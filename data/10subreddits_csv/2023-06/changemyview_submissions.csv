0,2023-05-31,"CMV: There hasn't been a progressive president in the US yet because progressive policies are unpopular/the timing was wrong, not because the US is an oligarchy and elections are somehow rigged against anybody who wants to tax the rich",u/ICuriosityCatI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13x2qj5/cmv_there_hasnt_been_a_progressive_president_in/,changemyview,"When I've asked progressives why there hasn't been a progressive president if their platform is as popular as they say and why voters consistently vote for middle of the road Democrats, I've generally heard one response or a slight variation on it: Because the US is an Oligarchy and the deck is stacked so heavily against progressives that it's impossible to overcome the obstacles. As proof, they'll point to various surveys showing that the policies they're pushing have widespread appeal. If the policies are so appealing, what other explanation could there be? 

In my view, there there are other explanations: the other policies progressives are pushing which are not popular and the unfortunate timing of the progressive candidate who shied away from the less popular policies. 

Progressives generally support reparations (opposed by most Americans. The majority of black Americans are on board, but only 18% of white Americans are) and Defunding the police (the majority of every racial group opposed.) Those are two major policies. Americans are generally also opposed to CRT and progressives messaging on CRT is mixed at best. (Personally in conversations with progressives I've heard it's only taught in certain college courses, but banning it K-12 is a problem and we should teach kids about implicit bias in K-12- implicit bias being a core tenant of CRT. It's enough to confuse anybody.) Progressives are also more in favor of making ""hate speech"" illegal (majority oppose.) 

So given all of the policies progressives push for that are deeply *unpopular* it seems to me like ""the US is an oligarchy and elections are rigged that's why we don't win"" is shifting the blame, not speaking truth. 

There was a progressive who I voted for who did not support most of the unpopular progressive policies. Bernie Sanders. The problem in my eyes is that he ran in the 2016 election, when Democrats were terrified of the Republican candidate. So Democrats threw their support behind the mainstream stereotypical politician (in every way except gender) who ultimately lost. And I think as long as there's the possibility of Trump getting elected Dems will continue to choose the safer, less radical option even if there's a progressive who pushes for the popular progressive policies and not the unpopular ones (which seems to be rare nowadays.) 

I do believe money can help candidates big time with advertising, but I also don't think advertisements are so powerful that they can actually make people do things, essentially robbing them of their will. In Oligarchies like Russia, Oligarchs can interfere with ballot counting and ballot tallies and final results. As far as anybody knows, the very wealthy here do not have that sort of power. And with social media it's possible to get a message out to millions with no money and, if the message is popular enough, win the election. 

But in my view bad timing and unpopular policies have prevented this from happening. But I'm of course open to changing it!"

For beef burgers it makes sense as there’s enough moisture and the texture of steak is harder to get through in a sandwich, but chicken burgers are just dry and bland because of all that’s lost by breaking the structure down by grinding the meat. 

I do think chicken burgers have a purpose — I appreciate that you can get more out of a chicken using mechanical reclamation and that has an important place — but on taste alone why choose a chicken burger over a sandwich? I’m more specifically talking here about situations where people take chicken breast or thigh and grind it up for their recipe rather than just brine/marinate and cook it."
0,2023-06-01,CMV: A lot of white people (especially Americans) don’t have the ability to allow other minority races to enjoy representation.,u/sunshinegal_7,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13xakma/cmv_a_lot_of_white_people_especially_americans/,changemyview,"I’ve spent the last few days reading about the TLM on Reddit and every white person who has complained about Ariel being black has come up with the most racist (un-racist, in their words) opinions on why. Oh! Ariel is a white mermaid and because that’s how she was when I was a child that’s how she should’ve stayed. Oh! Her being white with red hair is apart of who she is as a character. 

Ariel was a mermaid. Who had a beautiful voice. Those are the only two qualifications. And don’t get me started on the “what if we made Tiana white” comments. As a block woman, I would have been fine if Ariel was Mexican, Asian, or anything else. As long as she had the beautiful voice it wouldn’t have mattered to me. In fact! I would have been so extremely happy for those minority communities because it’s something so beautiful about kids and folks being able to see someone who looks like them on screen. This is why Mulan is so important, and why Encanco and Brave had such an impact on our little people… because they got to see themselves represented. Our little black girls get to see themselves as a mermaid and that’s so great for them.

And yet, it just feels like white people don’t have the ability to share that joy. Because all that matters is what THEY wanted to see from a movie that came out 34 years ago, where in the actual story she was green. 

Little white girls have been seeing themselves on the screen for literally over a hundred years. Of the 12 official Disney princesses, 7 are white. If you wanna add Anna and Elsa, that’s 9. Literally 95% of Disney’s animated movies feature white leads. Disney has 3 red-head leads which is still more than the now 2, black “Disney princess mess” we have.

So I’m sorry that I have a hard time believing that sometimes white folks just don’t like to see minority groups have anything. I think people would still complain if Ariel was Mexican with light brown hair or Asian with black hair. But I have a hard time believing they’d be upset if it was a white woman with blond hair. 

If we lived in a world where literally almost all of our biggest representation for young girls (as far as Disney is concerned) had all been black, I would feel absolutely ridiculous complaining about the ONE time another race gets to see themselves also represented by that princess."

Solution? Sortition where we randomly select people from all ages (from birth until you drop) and walks of life to serve in all branches of the goverment for a strict non renewable term of 4 years with your selection and participation in the government being mandatory with a penalty of death for not participating in the government process. Also, those chosen to become government officals are deprived of all human contact until their term is over so they can focus on their jobs of running the government.

No more political infighting since all political parties will be banned under the new system . No more careerism with the problems that entails since people are randomly selected to run the government rather than making it a career. No more strongmen backsliding since the odds of re election are stacked against them.

2nd Edit: I had also forgotten the work of Bohuslav Martinů, especially his symphonies and concertos.

________________________________________
Original post:

When I say fine art I mean classics of the highest quality. Think Sibelius 4 or 7, any Brahms Symphony, Mozart Jupiter, Beethoven 9. These works send shivers down my spine and I wonder how a human could have written them. **Nothing** written in the past ≈ 70 years that I have ever heard quite comes close to that level of life-affirming perfection. It’s like humans have lost the ability to make music that is truly “great”. We’ve devolved from quality into quantity.

There was a golden age where music of incomprehensible perfection was sometimes written, and it is now over. No music like the great masterworks of this era (1650-1950) had ever been made before and no music like it will ever be made again.

Many people have tried to change my opinion but whenever I try to listen to modern music I hear cacophony. I’ve heard many arguments - many are interesting and well thought out but then I have yet to be convinced.

I’d love to be proven wrong. Unfortunately most of the opposing arguments I hear boil down to “you’re wrong because your wrong”, which increases my fear that I’m absolutely correct about the death of art.

Make me award a delta. Find a large-scale orchestral work of classical art music written in recent years that’s as every bit as breathtaking as, say, Schumann’s 4th symphony and I will be be truly amazed. 

Neoclassical, pop music, contemporary; no genre has produced anything like the masterworks that came out of the golden age of music. While some composers have written decent pieces, the Great Masterworks stand alone in history, and no music like it will ever be made again."

0,2023-06-01,"CMV: Bidialectism isn't a thing insofar as having two distinct natural dialects of the same language. One is natural, the others exists based on the situation.",u/Throwfarfaraway33469,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13xf3qk/cmv_bidialectism_isnt_a_thing_insofar_as_having/,changemyview,"Let's say naturally bidialectal is someone that naturally speaks in both accents. 
Forced biadialectal is someone that has one natural accent and puts on the other. 

Bilingualism can also mean having two natural languages, or having one mother tongue and one that was learnt and can be spoken too (forced or naturally).

I don't think people acknowledge enough this idea that inconveniences a lot of people every day. I understand why Bidialectism exists when growing up both in Brazil and Portugal, at a time when European Portuguese wasn't common in Brazil. As a child you can feel out of place for various different reasons, one of which is always sounding different. This manifests in people laughing or looking at you weirdly every time you utter a word. So you start changing your accent and then suddenly you have to keep up conversations in the two separate accents and separate situations. Speak with one dialect in one country, speak with the other dialect in other country. That's all fine until the two realities mix. 

I'll mention the example of two people that go through this very publicly: Gillian Anderson and Sandi Toksvig (an actress and a presenter, respectively). 

Gillian has US parents, childhood in the UK, teenage years in US, then adult life in the UK/US. 

Sandi Toksvig has US parents, childhood in US, teenage years in UK, then adult life in the UK. 

I believe Gillian Anderson has gone the controversial route of being caught publicly speaking in both accents, and people ask what is going on. She'll state both are her natural accents but really what it means is she has probably kept up a secret speech pattern where she chooses to avoid sounding odd and will emulate the speaker, but if it happens behind closed doors, no one knows. If it happens in public people catch on and call that out. 

Sandi has admitted once she speaks in an American accent when tired (because she grew up in NY) but moved as a teenager to the UK and has since built her career as a UK TV presenter. Which means she has purposefully not spoken (unless ironically) in an American accent but maintains her British accent as put-on and openly admits to that. But these realities always conflate, so when you speak to family you always use the natural accent, British friends with a British accent, American friends with an American accent, and then avoid interactions where the two meet because one side will find it strange. Sandi when out and about in the US will probably not speak in a British accent, but if filmed, yes. 

This creates a really weird situation if you're aware of everything, and it's the kind of agonising awkwardness that puts The Office to shame, but nevertheless a reality when you live in two countries with different dialects and keep up familiarity in both, trying to navigate social queues and integrate without always being subject to ridicule. 

People that move countries only as adults tend to not put on accents anymore because they're comfortable in their own skin, but their twang might naturally shift
. they won't speak in two different ways though unless ironically."
0,2023-06-01,CMV: There's nothing wrong sleeping with your son/daughter,u/Soft-Butterscotch128,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13xgb0f/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_sleeping_with_your/,changemyview,"**\*Sleeping with = In the same bed/room**

Was watching a judge show where part of the case was the guy suing for a false CPS report. His ex wife filed a CPS report because the dad slept with the daughter and it resulted in the dad and the new wife being monitored and investigated for a few months and it ended up being unsubstantiated. The man admit to it but said it was on a trip where there was only a single room available, and the judge dropped his suit, saying the CPS claim wasn't false because he shouldn't be sleeping with his daughter.

Now if this was a step or adoptive parent I would understand more. But I found this pretty ridiculous and problematic because it's obvious the judge and the exwife were putting sexual connotations with it but to me that makes them the weirdos. I feel like it would also potentially damage the relationship between the dad and daughter because it seems like it would just create unnecessary tension over nothing where now they have to second guess everything they do (which i think was the ex wifes intention).

So as long as it's not on a regular basis I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with sleeping with your daughter/son. CMV

95,2023-06-01,CMV: Whether or not student loans are given out should be heavily based on the ROI of the degree and the individuals likelyhood of completing their degree.,u/stocktismo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13xgojs/cmv_whether_or_not_student_loans_are_given_out/,changemyview,"First off I'm not in favor of using race as a metric  IMO it shouldn't even be an item on applications but i can understand certain arguments for why. The main argument is that colleges are heavily incentivized to crank out graduates and are able to continue raising tuition every year because student loans are easy to get and many 18 year olds are not mature enough to look at those financials choices from an objective and long-term perspective. It's basically taking advantage of kids that couldn't get a that loan amount for something like a house, car or business. The US government gives the colleges the power to do this because they basically guarantee loans to kids so colleges don't have to be very competitive on tuition ROI of their degrees or even the quality of their degrees. Of course there is some variance to that as it's a spectrum but still.

Edit: i forgot to add student loan debt should be able to be wiped away via bankruptcy just like any other loan. This would keep the government from taking advantage of kids who don't know or realize the reality of student debt.

Edit 2: I'd like to clarify that i believe the individual universities look at all many factors that put people at a disadvantage like family life, socioeconomic status and weight them against criteria like gpa, extracurriculars etc and make the determination of likelihood of completion by either accepting or rejecting the individuals."

0,2023-06-01,"CMV: I think Beastiality is legitimately moral, and better than most things we do to animals.",u/GlaggleThrow22,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13xhsqb/cmv_i_think_beastiality_is_legitimately_moral_and/,changemyview,"I dont think there is anything wrong with beastiality, I think its is morally okay to do assuming an animal is not put in danger by the act, for example a size difference that could very easily harm said animal or if it involves sadism.

I dont think we can really demonstrate any real harm in most cases and i would even argue to a degree it could be \*maybe\* beneficial/positive for both parties.

For example if there was a man and a mare i dont think we could truly show the mare is hurt, nor mentally damaged by the experience of a man having penetrative sex with the horse. and you could probably apply this to most animals of a reasonable size.

not to mention, not even the fact we eat meat but the practices involved in even just dairy farming for example, or ironically, horses, involve sexual acts with animals, such as impregnating animals (This could reasonably considered actually harmful) or in the case of stallions and other male animals, often they are jerked off for sperm collection.

outside of these presented facts which show we already commit generally accepted and widely used practices, we reasonably show examples that are socially acceptable of animals being 100% undoubtedly harmed. A few examples of this can be the fact male chicks in poultry farming are often crushed alive, we seperate animals from their mothers, we hunt animals for sport, we keep chickens who do get to live in what are effectively little cubicles without sunlight, only with food, water, and a place for eggs to be layed into. and in the pork industry we often snip the tails of pigs when they are young, we also often intentionally damage the beak of birds so they cant kill each other in those  massive complexes.

now with this knowledge, say you are a sheep, and you are approached by a man from wales. two things could happen, you could be killed and eaten, often not in a quick and painless way, or you could be shagged. im sure we would all choose the latter option.

another argument that can be demonstrated is that consent would not matter as animals already do not have it as a concept, they just do sex, unless it was actually violent i dont think it can be shown that they would be disturbed by this. its not like dogs for example ask each other if they are okay with it before doing it, they just do it, so why would it matter if it was between species and no real harm was being done.

&#x200B;

thus this concludes my several arguments for why i think it is morally acceptable to do beastiality, and have explained why i think its much better than what we already do.

&#x200B;

Edit 1 : I have realized part of the way i have phrased this has made it out seem the point i was making is ""we do x to animals, thus you should allow me to do y"", and while that could work, my point was rather to show the societal hypocrisy and to address arguments of harm in advance. to say that beastiality is harmful you would need to demonstrate it, thus as it stands to me it is at the least morally neutral."
0,2023-06-01,CMV: Young men seeking hardship is not a facet of toxic masculinity,u/SteadyBender,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13xhuhd/cmv_young_men_seeking_hardship_is_not_a_facet_of/,changemyview,"I was talking with my wife about my young son’s future last night and brought up that I’ll be interested to see how he tests himself as he gets older. She seemed confused by what I meant so I explained that it’s very common for young men to want to prove themselves and find their limits in the world. It can include military service, athletic accomplishments, starting a business, etc. When I was young I was obsessed with proving my worth to society and I sought out difficult professional and personal life accomplishments.

My wife seemed horrified that our son would feel this urge, and told me we need to do everything we can to make sure that he doesn’t feel the need to prove himself to anyone. In her opinion she would prefer it if he got a purposeless job and lived a very boring life. She told me that what I described was “toxic masculinity” and that she felt bad for me that I had to feel that way when I was younger.

I’ve endured a lot of hardship in my life and I partially define myself by the way I’ve overcome adversity. I wouldn’t change anything and am very proud of who I am and what I’ve done. I cannot imagine a world in which I had turned away from adversity and just floated through life doing the minimum. I struggled greatly with depression before joining the army and finding purpose in doing hard, great things as part of a team. In my view, a core part of becoming a happy, well adjusted person is feeling that you have accomplished important things. I am extremely happy and fulfilled now and wouldn’t trade away any of the lessons I’ve learned in life. These hardships are absolutely necessary to developing a sense of confidence in oneself.

To deny my son that feeling by encouraging mediocrity sounds like denying him some of the greatest pleasures in life. Am I wrong here? Or would I be burdening my son with toxic lessons passed down through the generations?

FWIW I planned to encourage this same drive with our even younger daughter, as well, once she’s old enough."

My uni had dining halls and I often ordered takeaway. Since then I’ve been doing my SQE and have pretty much eaten out/ordered in every day since.

I feel as though that there must be some logical reason as to why cooking is considered to be such a vital skill to all but I have never felt the need to be able to cook. This is not to say I’m completely incompetent, I have cooked breakfast for my mum and past partners, and do enjoy baking from time to time but I’d argue that those were more so acts I wanted to perform than things I’d need to do.

In laboratories, they’re housed with care and only by trained researchers, fed specialised diets and live in facilities with specialised temperatures, humidity and a sleep wake cycle that suits their biological rhythm. 

Ethical guidelines exist to ensure they’re not socially isolated and are typically caged with other mice in spacious cages with free access to food and water. 

Euthanasia is conducted via painless methods including lethal doses of anaesthetic, where the mice won’t feel any pain and die a peaceful death. They’re treated with care in the facilities, and any symptoms of distress are addressed immediately. 

The use of animals in research is necessary as their metabolism and lifespan is shorter than humans, making it possible for us to study chronic diseases in shorter periods. Their biology is similar enough to humans for us to use them to test medications and increase our knowledge on the complex human bodies. 

If we did not have mice to study on, we would either have to use humans, or be well behind where we are in medical research. 

Every species looks out for themselves at the expense of others - we can not afford to save mice at the expense of humankind. It is easy to defend rodents in this circumstance when you or a loved one are not suffering from a chronic disease, but for those who are and will be, the use of animals in research is essential. 

Why should we not use mice in research? How will using them for research harm them? How are the procedures in a research facility different or worse then leaving them out in the wild?"

Corporations don't ever actually care. Earlier this week here the US we had Memorial Day, companies where plastering pro-troop stuff everywhere... does anyone actually think that these companies give a single shit about veterans? Same story for black history month. 

At the end of the day representation is representation no? Even if the person/company who is putting it out there is doing it for selfish money-grubbing reasons... the marginalized groups still get their representation right? Does the intention behind the representation really matter? 

In my view the pride month stuff is no different than companies pandering for multitudes of other causes, and at the end of the day it's still a net positive for the communities in question.

I get that time spent is already sunk cost, but there is narrative value in the long wait for the bus to arrive. Sure, I could leave early, but that would create a broken narrative of quitting on the trip. The more value we invest in something, the more attached and committed we feel.

It's called the Alligator River Story. The characters involved are Gregory, Abigail, Sinbad, Ivan, and Prudence. Here's the story:

Gregory and Abigail are deeply in love, but they live on opposite sides of the Alligator River. Gregory, wanting to be with his love, needs to cross the river, but it's infested with dangerous alligators. He seeks help from Samantha, a boatwoman. Samantha agrees to ferry him across, but only in exchange for sex. Shocked and desperate, Gregory approaches Ivan, a friend who happens to be a boatman, who refuses to help for unspecified reasons. Left with no other option, Gregory goes back to Samantha and, out of desperation, agrees to her terms.

Upon reaching the other side, Gregory confesses to Abigail what happened, hoping for understanding and support. Instead, Abigail breaks up with him. When Prudence, a friend of Gregory, hears of this, she becomes furious and confronts Abigail, leading to a violent assault. As Abigail is being assaulted, Gregory laughs, taking pleasure in her pain.

After hearing the story, I ranked the characters from most to least objectionable:

1. Gregory
2. Prudence
3. Samantha
4. Ivan
5. Abigail

This might surprise you, but the story you just read is a modified version of the original Alligator River Story. Here's how it originally goes:

Abigail and Gregory are deeply in love, but they live on opposite sides of the Alligator River. Abigail, eager to be with Gregory, needs to cross the river, but it's infested with dangerous alligators. She seeks help from Sinbad, a boatman. Sinbad agrees to ferry her across, but only in exchange for sex. Abigail first approaches Ivan, a friend and also a boatman, who refuses to help. Left with no other choice, Abigail returns to Sinbad and agrees to his terms.

When Abigail reaches the other side, she confesses to Gregory what happened. Gregory, instead of understanding, breaks up with her. When Slug, a friend of Abigail, learns about the situation, he assaults Gregory. During Gregory's assault, Abigail laughs, finding humor in his suffering.

For the original story, my ranking is:

1. Abigail
2. Slug
3. Sinbad
4. Ivan
5. Gregory

However, in discussions of the original story, I've found most people rank the characters:

1. Sinbad
2. Gregory
3. Ivan
4. Slug
5. Abigail

This difference in perspective and ranking depending on the gender of the characters raises questions about existing biases and double standards. Is it fair that the character who laughs at their partner's assault is seen as the least objectionable in one scenario but much more negatively in another?

Edit: if you’re confused about what I’m asking

1. I think people would change their answer if they heard the revised version with Samantha first
2. I don’t think Sinbad is the worst character and it seems like everyone else thinks he’s the biggest monster. The sex is essentially a transaction, it’s not coercion. That makes him a bad person but not a r****st

Edit: I think I have seen this on like twoxchromosomes where someone said this was mentioned in their class and a bunch of men were r*** apologists"

&#x200B;

what do I believe they are more dependent on is:

\-giving a shit

\-sleeping

\-privilege

&#x200B;

**Giving a shit:**

By this I mean caring about the course, paying attention in class, and carefully doing homework. This is fairly self explanatory, and many students may think they are doing this without realizing that giving a shit is NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT

**adequate sleep:**

Without adequate sleep you are essentially putting a debuff on your brain. Your ""processing speed"" goes down, your memory goes down, etc. And not getting enough sleep is an extremely self-perpetuating cycle: you don't sleep enough-> can't listen in class -> do homework slowly -> have to study more -> have to do more homework -> less sleep.

**privilege:**

And I'm not talking about spending money to hire a tutor or go to a fancy private school, you can benefit from privilege without spending a dime. If you are born in an area that emphasizes academics, or have parents that prioritize academics, this difference will greatly accumulate your overall academic skills through your (at least) 12 year schooling experience.

&#x200B;

My personal experience is that by giving a shit, getting 8 hours a night, and having privilege(born in silicon valley) I was able to get one of the highest grades in my class in AP Physics C and very easily get an A in Calc BC. I did both without ever really liking the classes(but still cared) or having a lot of background in them(such as physics and math competitions). I believe that no other factors really helped. I do not believe myself to be of very high natural intellect, especially in theses subjects.

&#x200B;

A lot of this argument is based on personal feelings and not logic, so there will naturally be many flaws which is why I'm posting it here.

If you want the films to end after the 3rd just ignore the rest and let the people who are excited about it enjoy it. Other franchises I've heard should stop are Scooby Doo, Pokemon, Charlies Angels, 007 etc. But if people are still enjoying these franchises and they're not harming anyone why should they stop? I just don't pay attention to the ones I'm not interested in anymore. it even happens with musicians, I've had multiple people say Madonna should stop making music. She has enough money to retire but if she's enjoying it why should she stop. She clearly is passionate about her craft. I genuinely do want to understand why these franchises should stop. Only thing I can think of is that companies could focus on other works that are more in demand therefore make more people happy. But I still struggle to understand what the harm is. I also have an obsession with creative media that has existed in different time periods so that does make me bias. I think it's just fascinating to see how specific art is depicted throughout history. Anyways I really look forward to anyone challenging my perspective! Thanks for reading my rant :)"

Supposedly, the sign of a ""good"" vodka is one with no taste, so if it has no taste the difference between(for example) a vodka and a vodka + coke is you can't drive after the latter (hyperbole but I'm sure you get the point).

Presumably, from the title of the video, the word allegedly implies that the doctor in questions was never actually convicted.  While some in the comments are keeping level heads and calling the assault for what it is, many seem to support the husband and even praise him for his self control and that if they were in his situation, they would have gone further.

Now, I don’t know if the doctor speaking did commit these crimes, but the word allegedly implies that he was never convicted.  What has happened to the presumption of innocence and the idea of “innocent until proven guilty”?  All I know is that this doctor might have committed sexual assault, but I definitely know that the man who slapped him committed physical assault.  I guess I’m going against the popular opinion in the comments of that video and I think that the husband was wrong to go up and slap the doctor.

I will link the video below.

He says that if you see a drowning child in a muddy pond, you should be willing to ruin an expensive suit to save the child. Anyone who wouldn't save the child because they didn't want to ruin their clothes is a bad person, we can all agree. 

But if we agree with him that 1) all lives, regardless of proximity are the same value, 2) the suit would genuinely be ruined (ei, can't be cleaned or repaired), and 3) your money goes further in poorer countries. Then what you should *actually* do is not save the child at all, as it would ruin your suit, and then go sell your suit and give the proceeds to a very effective charity, possibly saving hundreds of lives with mosquito nets or something. 

So consider now that you meet a man and he says he saw a child drowning, but did nothing, and he says ""don't worry, I've decided to sell my suit that I kept mud free and I will save many more lives than I could have by saving that child.""

Is that a good person? A better person than you who had the instinct to save the person infront of you?

In an AMA Singer said plainly that you shouldn't give money to homeless people in the developed world because your money can save more people in poor countries. So I think this analogy is pretty apt. Singer would say that if you see someone starving in your own country, you should feel no need to help them, because food is more expensive where you live than somewhere else. 

I'm sure some will say I'm taking the conclusion too far. But the argument Singer makes is quite strong in its conclusion. I think if you truly take it seriously you would have to agree that anyone in developed countries who has cancer should **absolutely** not be treated. Do you know how cheap mosquito nets are?

Do any of us truly believe that we should not be allowed any healthcare or social services because money needs to be spent at peak efficiency?

I suppose it's a general counter point to utilitarianism. But I think Singer's framing really convinces people and it's worth using his same framing as a counter point, rather than arguments such as the hospital that steals one person's organs to save 5. Singer's argument is flawed in my opinion because it logically nessesitates a race to the bottom when it comes to quality of life, and I think that means a worse world overall. If we as a society embraced his viewpoint we would need our governments to end all social programs, send all healthcare money overseas where to goes further etc.

Edit: link to Peter's comment on homelessness as it's come up a bunch: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/32lnif/im_peter_singer_australian_moral_philosopher_and/cqccnqu/

Off to bed folks. Gave one delta for Singer possibly not meaning that homeless people should starve but just shouldn't be helped beyond food. It's a significantly different reading from mine so it's a worthwhile point. I'll respond to more tomorrow if there are more."

It’s almost embarrassing let’s take a further look 

Sexism
- you hardly ever see women talking with other woman it’s almost entirely like their roles are simply made for the purpose of men

- the constant rating of women and their sexual appearance 

- ari gold has a wife who is fairly significant in the series doesn’t even have a name! In 8 seasons 

Racism 

- all characters from foreign counties (israeli, German) are always portrayed as crazy and ridiculous 

Homophobia
- this is the biggest in the show

- at first I thought it was just ari gold who was abrasive

- but this minority is almost hated in the show it’s like the writers are actually homophobic so much even the milder and kinder characters make remarks such as no PDA if your gay 

- it’s like every character on the series hates gay people

To me it seems purposeful and not ignorant it seems it’s more than just a reflection of the times but rather an attack on minorities especially gay men. (I think they get it the worst on the series) 

Will be very hard to change my view but would love to hear arguments"

It's Friday and with it comes an opportunity for a fresh topic.

I think any active Reddit user has been inundated with comments responding to something with ""This!"" and it drives me up a gosh darn wall. It used to be a little worse, where people would just comment ""this."" and move on; at least now, someone will start off the reply with ""this."" and then follow it up with whatever they're adding. To me, it's immediately offputting, and doesn't contribute anything of real value to the conversation. If a comment/post is worth ""this""-ing, the upvote is enough; likewise, a comment extending the discussion in favor of the parent comment/post conveys the fact that it was good information or that one agrees. The second I see ""this."" I immediately downvote that comment.

Maybe it's just because it doesn't remotely approximate real interpersonal dialogue, maybe it's because a lot of comments had nothing else to offer, maybe it's because you only see it in certain subreddits with more obnoxious users, maybe it's even just me being too uptight, I don't know. But it drives me nuts, probably more so than it should and considering this is a relatively diverse community (philosophically and ideologically) I'd like to see if anyone can make a compelling enough argument to change my view on the matter.

\*I'd like to add the disclaimer, because I know many people in this sub are fairly literal, that when I say ""most obnoxious followup possible"" I'm referring to any good-faith comment, meaning that I'm not including trolling, sarcasm, insults, etc. Those are obviously worse in most cases (unless they're genuinely funny and not mean spirited, which is a difficult line to walk!).

&#x200B;

ETA: A general addition based on some interactions with commenters. Many of you are acting like ""this."" is somehow *the only way* to express any sort of agreement with the previous comment, yet all of you that are pointing out what it means (obviously I know what it means, btw!) are using other ways to express affirmatives. I would also add, since this is something I've responded to a few comments with now, that no one would ever say ""this."" in real life in the context it's used here on Reddit. They would say some sort of actual affirmative. Using ""this."" (to me at least) moves the discourse further away from resembling actual dialogue. It makes it feel way more ""online"" and less like actual human interaction when someone says ""this."" in place of a more common affirmative. Whether or not you agree should already be clear from the comment itself. Some sort of affirmative is fine, but ""this."" makes it feel a lot further from actual dialogue than a more common affirmative.

ETA 2: It's been brought to my attention that the [Reddiquete](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette) actually makes a statement about this (under ""please don't""):

""In regard to comments:

Make comments that lack content. Phrases such as ""this"", ""lol"", and ""I came here to say this"" are not witty, original, or funny, and do not add anything to the discussion.""

It's unclear whether or not this refers to saying *just* ""this."" or saying it and following it up with a comment - it's probably the former, but in any case, it's clear that it's not a favorable expression."

Especially in economics, it feels like differences in definition can lead to wildly different conclusions. I want to be clear what I mean by the terms I'm using, and feel free to call out anything you think is strictly wrong.

[Market failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure): A situation leading to a market that fails to be perfectly competitive. This is synonymous with failure to reach Pareto efficiency, or any loss of economic efficiency.

[Perfect competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition): A competitive market with no failures. Typically requires perfect information for buyers and sellers, a large number of buyers and sellers, homogenous products, and no barrier to entry, among many other possible conditions. An industry in perfect competition will not be profitable in the long term.

[Profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_\(economics\)): The difference between revenue and costs. To be clear, this means a zero-profit company will be able to produce their product, pay their workers, and keep the lights on, but are unable to extract excess value to give to their owners, board, or other shareholders.

&nbsp;

**Permanent State of Market Failure**

Based on our definitions, there's two ways to identify that we're in a permanent state of market failure:

1. Long-term profits exist. The higher the profits, the worse the market failures. 

2. Put any industry and the definition of a market failure side-by-side. It's clear every industry falls victim to a number of these failures. 

If we can find even one current industry without market failures, I'm wrong a thousand times over.

We could alternatively find one industry where no major player has turned a profit for 15+ years - though this has a caviat that there may still be market failures, just in favor of the buyers. Still, since that would mean the industry is hemorrhaging money, I expect we're much less likely to find this than a zero-profit industry.

I'm also interested in historical accounts, though lack of information makes those much more difficult to prove, and also may not apply to today's system. 

&nbsp;

**Solutions**

If you're with me this far, and agree that the markets are in permanent failure, there's one more opportunity to CMV - what's the solution? Arguably the goal of a free-market system is to maximize economic efficiency, so we should want to reach that perfectly competitive market. I have never seen a solid argument for a solution to achieve the elusive perfectly competitive, zero-profit system."

Here’s why: 

- It’s not nearly as busy so that means your theater isn’t going to be as packed and filled with distracting people

- The lines for concessions aren’t long like they are night

- This may not apply for everyone, especially those that live in a city, but the parking lot for the theater isn’t as full so it’s really easy to find a parking space.

- You can go and still have the rest of your day to do stuff. Or if you want, you can see another movie (provided you can afford it)

Overall, I’ve found that my best theater experiences have come when I went in the day. Last time I went to go see a movie at night, I went to go see Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves and there were these really rude people who kept talking during the movie. And I know I wasn’t the only one who noticed. Of course, I’m not saying that there wouldn’t be rude people during a daytime showing. It’s just that the chances of that happening and the theater being packed are much lower during the day."

PEOPLE, MY VIEW HAS CHANGED. 

If you haven't heard, there's currently an American version of Squid Games in the works at Netflix. 

I don't usually care about remakes that much, but this is different and very strange to me, for several reasons. 

1. The original Squid Games has not finished. They're working on a season 2. 

2. The original Squid Games did gangbusters in America and I have literally never heard anyone complain that it wasn't American. 

3. It's not a remake, it's a new story. So it's a different story set in the same universe written and directed by somebody else. This means people will inevitably compare the two and as a writer that seems kind of messed up. Like if a different writer rewrote the Harry Potter series. 

But the main thing I'm struggling to wrap my head around is... Why? What is the point? I don't really have any desire to watch it. And it just seems like an FU to the original creator. 

But I'm open to changing my view.

He seems to be ok with it. VIEW CHANGED. I should have researched first, that's my bad sorry."

We’re not in the same place now as a nation; people can read and the National and global stage is very different. I think it would make sense for amendments to come with some sort of substantiating argument, and give context to the reasons these amendments were introduced and signed into law.

That way, people can better communicate, debate, and vote on the reasons those amendments were put in place. Also, if such a time comes where the substantiating reasons don’t apply as much, we can more universally consider changing or removing them in the same fashion."

28,2023-06-03,CMV: The four main arguments against supporting Ukraine are fatally flawed,u/GrafZeppelin127,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13zf0ah/cmv_the_four_main_arguments_against_supporting/,changemyview,"In observing some of the arguments made against other countries’ support of the Ukrainian side of the Russo-Ukrainian War, I’ve noticed some basic, fundamental flaws in the reasoning behind the four main lines of argument I’ve noticed. Those anti-aid arguments are:

1. Supporting Ukraine only prolongs the conflict and suffering.

This argument presupposes that the “peace” of Russian conquest and oppression is preferable to the Ukrainians than continuing to fight for their freedom. Not only is surrender their choice to make, not ours, it is also an open question whether cessation of support will actually lead to Ukraine suing for peace, or even necessarily lead to Ukrainians losing the war. Victory or stalemate would be more costly, certainly, but Russia already lost the First Chechen War against a polity that’s a fraction of Ukraine’s size, and if nothing else, a Ukrainian insurgency would be a protracted nightmare for everyone involved, even if Russia signs a peace deal on paper. That protracted occupation may end up being far bloodier than Ukraine winning the war in a conventional sense, and indeed those casualties would fall more heavily on civilians, not soldiers.

2. Not everything is reductively analogous to World War II. Putin isn’t Hitler and the Russians aren’t the same as the Nazis.

This argument is particularly galling, because it doesn’t seem to be able to imagine that even if comparisons to Nazis and the failure of appeasement are cliché and vastly overexposed, there can exist situations where something *genuinely is* analogous to those geopolitical events and their strategic and ethical implications. “A boy crying wolf” is a cautionary tale precisely because *wolves are a danger that can actually happen,* a point which seems lost by this line of reasoning.

3. Americans/NATO aren’t interested in defending democracy, they are motivated by advancing their own goals of Western hegemony. 

This is essentially an argument from impure motivations, and it’s bizarre to me. It seems to assume that any motivation or ancillary benefit that isn’t wholly altruistic completely obviates any genuinely altruistic impulses; as though there’s no such thing as a situation in which self-interest and ethics can possibly align with one another. It comes off like whataboutism, trying to equivocate or excuse the belligerence of Russia by pointing fingers at the United States’ historic wrongs. Moreover, even if it were true that Americans/NATO were entirely motivated by self-interest and didn’t care about the Ukrainians at all, what exactly would that change? Ukrainians still desperately want that military and humanitarian aid, and are willing to accept it even with strings attached. If that is a price they’re willing to pay, who are we to gainsay them?

4. The Russo-Ukrainian War is the fault of the CIA/NATO for expanding their influence and pushing Russia into a corner, therefore any further involvement can only make things worse.

Not only does the latter half of the argument not logically follow from the former, the former doesn’t matter even if it were true—which it plainly isn’t, as Ukraine was under no risk of joining NATO in the foreseeable future due to the Crimea dispute, nor does Russia have any right to dictate the defensive nor economic alliances other sovereign countries can engage in. Regardless of their actual motivations for starting the war, the Russians started it; the question now is how to proceed, and assigning blame is not actually helpful in that regard. The alternative of doing something proactive is not that no further harm can be done; inaction itself is an action that has its own potentially catastrophic consequences, such as the disastrous precedent it sets for nuclear proliferation that a de-nuclearized country (Ukraine) was left alone to be invaded thanks to the nuclear deterrent of an imperialist power (Russia), despite security assurances by other countries, including the invading one. 

In order to change my view, I would need to be shown that the logic in any of these arguments is actually sound, or be shown a sound argument against Ukraine aid that I haven’t seen before. I don’t need to have my mind changed on aiding Ukraine; I’d just need to see that there’s at least *one* logical argument between all those arguing against it. Of course, arguments that are logically sound but which stem from untrue premises (Ukrainians engineering a Russian-specific virus, for instance) don’t count."
0,2023-06-03,CMV: The future is already predetermined,u/General_Cow_7119,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13zfsk4/cmv_the_future_is_already_predetermined/,changemyview,"PLEASE change my view. I believe the future is already predetermined. 

That is to state that 
1) That everything happens due to a butterfly effect including the chemical reactions in our minds that produce thoughts. Of course that still means we have ‘free will’ in a sense that by not beliving in this unprovable idea, you can live with complete free will in your reality. 

2) That the present does not mean shit. The future and the past are just as real and concrete. Our perspective is just stuck in our own relative of time. In other words, everything that is happening is like written in the middle of a history book about the history of the universe. We are just playing a role.

3) the depressing bit: if you belive that, everything is predetermined, it’s easy to just give up on what your fighting against and think ‘I must have given up because I was meant to. If the circumstances were right, I would have continued. I should accept my fate for whatever it is as it’s unavoidable’. 

Note: I’m not too familiar to philosophy or theories in science but am eager to learn if it’s part of discussion."
1101,2023-06-03,CMV: Animal breeds which have universal or nearly universal health problems as a direct result of their selective breeding should be illegal.,u/Kat-Sith,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13zgnk2/cmv_animal_breeds_which_have_universal_or_nearly/,changemyview,"Certain dog and cat breeds have been selectively bred for features that are objectively harmful to the animal, such as the caved-in faces of pugs and Persian cats interfering with their respiration. This feels unnecessarily cruel to me, and if these forms of harm were intentionally and knowing created in any other way, it would be unquestionably considered cruel—if I somehow inflicted permanent respiratory obstruction on a newborn golden retriever, I don't think there'd be any question, but it's apparently okay to do that to every single pug.

As such I feel like purposely perpetuating such breeds should be classified as the animal cruelty that it is.  This doesn't mean euthanizing living animals, just spaying/neutering them and particularly shuting down active breeding programs for these animals.  I know that there are some instances of breeders actively trying to reverse the process, and I think there could be some room to work with them, but I also strongly question if even that is justifiable.  A sense of tradition and emotional attachment don't justify inflicting needless suffering. Again, ""But I really love the results of my intentional cruelty"" wouldn't be acceptable justification if the cruelty was inflicted in any other way.

Likewise, I just can't find it in me to care about the jobs of those who perpetuate these breeds.  If doing the right thing requires putting someone out of work, then they shouldn't have been in that line of work to begin with, at least in cases where the connection between the work and the harm is obvious and direct. Ditto for the preservation of canine history. We don't need to subject an animal to a life of suffering to remember the times when we subjected animals to lifetimes of suffering.  It's been a mistake, and we need to just gracefully accept that fact.

Edit: I'm not focusing on farm animals here, despite these concerns also applying to them. There are two broad reasons for this. First is that there is a significantly larger number of factors that come into play. The simple fact that the majority of breeding is done to produce greater food yields pours them into a whole other category from aesthetic preferences. There are certainly arguments to be made about whether or not this material benefit to humans justifies cruelty, but that's a much broader subject. The other is that discussing genetic health concerns feels almost petty in that context. The fact that chickens' legs can barely support their weight becomes meaningless when they're more or less immobilized anyway. And the suffering of cows is nothing compared to the environmental damage that large scale dairy farms contribute to. The presence of such greater issues makes the breeding concerns feel kind of petty, IMO."
0,2023-06-03,CMV: Third trimester abortions are impossible to argue for,u/MostDownvotedOnRebbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13zj0xa/cmv_third_trimester_abortions_are_impossible_to/,changemyview,"EDIT: I’m getting a lot of replies and it’s getting difficult to reply to them all. First of all I’m not arguing against third trimester abortions out of medical reasons of any kind, I’m arguing against third trimester abortions out of convenience. I should have put that in the title. I then disagree with the idea of that “well not many people support that” as a reason to why this cmv is “pointless” because I find it an interesting idea regardless. Same with a cmv that said “there’s no possible reason to believe the earth is flat”. So I’m just simply seeing if there could be a reason to why a 6-9 month abortion out of convenience could be morally or legally okay.

And before someone says it this excludes if the mothers life is in danger.

I’m pro choice up to around 20-24 weeks because before that the baby has no consciousness, no sentience, I don’t think it’s a person. 

That’s my cut off line, but many people have their own cut off lines. Pro lifers believe it begins at conception, others would say when the heart starts beating (even though that’s a terrible argument), others would say at 3 months, 6 weeks, etc and then finally you have radical pro choice people who would try to argue that abortions are okay up to the full 9 months.

Whenever I hear people try to argue for abortion up to 9 months, it’s always emotionally charged arguments “my body my choice”, which is a horrible argument and it’s stupid that’s the mainstream argument for being pro choice, reasoning like that is why liberals aren’t taken seriously. Excluding cases of rape of course when you have sex you know you may get pregnant, it is not your body, it is a body within your body. It is not a parasite, it does not harm you. I don’t see “my body my choice” as a good argument for abortion period, and it’s certainly not at 6-9 months. Anyway that’s my rant about “my body my choice”.

I’m mainly just looking for an argument or reason that I can’t think of currently, some sort of reason there could be an inherent difference between a 6-9 month old fetus and it being out of the womb, but I don’t see there being any way to argue for it. Inside of the womb vs outside of the womb is just way too arbitrary. But if anyone has a reason that I can’t think of I’d love to hear it and engage in the discussion!

0,2023-06-03,CMV: almost all people are immorally selfish and shortsighted except those tiny minority who contribute to the future of their community and the future of humanity,u/tnagg,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13zj5ib/cmv_almost_all_people_are_immorally_selfish_and/,changemyview,"Basically, I believe almost all people are acting in a net harmful way to the future of the community (whether that be your local community or humanity as a whole), except those who through their jobs or in another way serve the common good.

I have the following premises:

We have so advanced technology and relative freedom in the western world now that everyone is having the possibility of much larger externalities on the world, both negative and positive than ever before. In other words, people have the choice to do harm or good.

Regardless of all positive externalities, the world is in grave danger of becoming significantly worse because of these negative externalities. Examples include (no particular order):

\- slow extinction of liberal democracies

\- socially harmful media winning over socially beneficial ones

\- anti-intellectualism and stupidity winning over science (e.g. anti-nuclear sentiment winning over the Western world)

\- extreme inequality growing by automation

\- increased global tension resulting in vicious power plays that disregard local interests, predictably leading to wars

\- irreversible toxicity from various chemicals (causing e.g. male infertility)

\- climate change

3. The preservation of valuable things against the above dangers can be framed as public goods. Generally all these public goods like democracy, moral values, activism, intellectual integrity, honesty, healthy phisical enviroment, international respect and cooperation, are doomed to decline unless people do extra work to preserve these.

4. Therefore, one who does nothing extra to preserve these public goods (and still participates in society, thus contributes to the externalities that cause this harm) have a net negative effect on these. This is, I think, like 95% of all people.

5. Being one of these 95% of people who do not contribute to the common good but rather have a negative effect on it, is short-sighted but more importantly selfish and thus unethical.

6. Therefore, only a small class of people are ethical. Examples may include:

\- small class of public intellectuals, activists, some subset of scientists, journalists who frame the conscientious public discourse

\- people who fulfill both of the following criteria: A. work on products or projects that are clearly and universally thought beneficial (especially nonprofits, but also for-profits if the profit motive does not take over the social benefits of their product) AND B. actively protest when they would be pressured into a situation where their principles are violated

Note that

\- I am specifically talking about selfishness vs altruism in terms of future of society/humanity and externalities and I ignore other aspects of selfishness vs altruism that may not have a large effect on our future

\- I do not claim that anyone who acts altruistically has a positive effect (they might have a negative effect if what they advocate or work for is harmful), I am only claiming that if you are not acting in an altruistic manner regarding important public goods for the future (again, I think, over 90% of people), you are surely hurting humanity's future

\--------

EDIT 03/06/23 20:48 UTC:

I realize that if you are ignorant or poor or have serious family problems you have an excuse for not contributing to the common good and you might still be a good person otherwise, but I believe this only covers 15-20% of people in Western societies, so the rest of the people are not good enough if they do not contribute to the common good."

Change my view on the following scenario and why as Citizens we should stand for the current tipping expectation.

Pre pandemic: You buy a $10 meal with taxes it’s around$11 then 20% tip its $13

Post pandemic: $10 meal is now $16 for same meal with a smaller portion. Service is subpar because they are short staffed. They then charge increased taxes due to loss of revenue during the pandemic. They then charge a surcharge to make sure they get 20% to cover their staff then don’t tell you that there is a surcharge for using a card and then expect a tip on top of all that. Total then comes to $22. All they did was take ur order bring ur food ,make excuses for poor service as its not in their control and bring you the check.

Why should we expect this as the new normal. One person can’t make an impact but as a whole population we can change this.

My opinion is pay employees a living wage, include all taxes and tip to give the total cost of the meal upfront and then see if the population feels ur product is worth it. I’m tired of crap services at a premium.

Even disregarding economic issues,as some could argue,when jobs get replaced,new ones pop up,you cannot deny the social impact of AI where actual people could be replaced by it.

Character AI is a great example,out of curisoity,i decided to roleplay as a bf of a mafia don(doness?),and it was honestly...so captivating,the AI acted like a real ideal gf.
Then i made a connection with OnlyFans,most guys who pay for that pay for defacto ""gf experiance"" but that is kept restrained by the price,the fact the OF girl won't indulge you in some weird overly descriptive fantasy(unless you pay buckets).Here there is no price tag,no limit and it is only going to get better at everything.

Another intersting is that the first commandment of the main religion in the ""Dune"" books is *Thou shalt not make a machine in the likness of the human spirit*  a book written in the 60s seems to be ultra prophetic,in my view.


EDIT:To clarify,the social problems that AI will cause are increased lonliness and isolation and all the accompanied mental ilnesses(depression,anxiety etc.) Which are already high,and something after this,basically right after covid that punted those issues into the stratosphere...it think it could well be catastrophic."

If it has a slightly redish tint (longer wavelength) we call it ""warm light"". If it has a slightly bluish tint (shorter wavelength), we call it ""cold light"".

We normally associate light with warmth, so “cold light” sounds kinda unatural and foreboding. Some people, rather than seeing it as light which is slightly bluish, envision it to be some kind of alien, incidious threat. If I explain that you can just paint a light bulb yellow if you're worried about cold light, they don't buy it; to them, cold light are beyond mundane concepts such as ""slight bluish tint"" and more in the area of chaos theory and quantium mechanics, deep deep stuff on the border of human understanding but very science indeed.

The light from your phone is said to be slightly bluish. so the wierd understanding of light gets combined with technophobia where “Cold Light” gets hyped as some sort of terror beam streaming out of your phone and incidiously interrupting your sleep, prompting people to apply a yellowish filter to ward it off. Now, smart phones messes with your head big time, and not in a subtle way. Putting a yellow filter on your smart phone is akin to ordering two tiny pieces of sliced apple with your Big Mac because, you know, health.

I think that it's okay to do science on what effect slightly tinted light may have. But the science is shaky at best. [Some experiment](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50807011) showed that mice sleep somewhat *better* when exposed to subdued blue light (cold light) compared to when they were exposed to subdued yellow light AKA the excact opposite of what was ordinarily claimed.

*EDIT: ""Terror beam"" was hyperbole. Sorry, I thought that was more clear. I meant that the lack of understanding of color theory made ""cold light"" appear more threatening.*"

We were only allowed to purchase a certain amount per month at a specified price, then we would be forced to buy on the economy which was 2-3x higher.

I think this would be a great thing to implement in the US. Basically when you turn 21 a ration card would be given to you that would track your monthly ration of things like tobacco and alcohol. Each time you buy something you would need to provide both cards and would be charged money and whatever the ration portion is. After you run out of rations or if you don't have your card you would still be able to purchase these things (assuming you're of age) but you would buy it at a higher price.

This would be beneficial because it would be a tertiary step in buying these things, and would cause people to thing twice about their consumption, while still having the freedom to consume. Overconsumption of these items are a bane on society, so those who overconsume would be an increased price to cover that."

I'm not saying people act ""realistic"" (it's zombies ffs) but I AM saying I want to see people do plasabile things. That means not everyone will do the same thing. Smart people die on accident, sometimes dumb people get lucky but on average, people that make smart decision live and that's what I want to see. 

I know I'm not the only one that yells at the characters in shows like the walking dead when time after time the script is written such that people do the opposite of what the average person would do. 

I'd like to see these shows get away from the tropes that are forced just for immediate drama. Always falling at just the right time, the bad guy always stops just in the right place, lessons/experiences are never learned from, etc. 

As a reference, I think a show based on the book series ""Day by Day Armageddon"" would be a great adaptation."

1133,2023-06-04,"CMV: All healthcare should be 100% taxpayer funded, and anything less is a failure of the healthcare system",u/EPIKGUTS24,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14036go/cmv_all_healthcare_should_be_100_taxpayer_funded/,changemyview,"The exception here is medical procedures that aren't really medically important, such as breast enlargement or a nose job. The exception to that exception would be things like cosmetic procedures that markedly improve a patient's quality of life, such as breast implants for someone gender transitioning or has undergone a mastectomy, facial reconstruction for someone who had a car accident or birth defect, things of that nature. Which is a tiny, tiny minority of all medical procedures so it wouldn't make much of a change to the total cost.

Here are some reasons I believe this:

1. For most people, it would save them money. Imagine, if you will, that all the money you put in insurance instead went to a big pot managed by a *nonprofit* which paid out when you need money for medical procedures. This would be just as effective as the US's current system, but it would save money because it would eliminate the *profit-seeking* motives of insurance companies. Now, imagine that instead of having a bunch of bureaucracy handling insurance payouts, it was simply paid for via taxes and the government covered healthcare. Wouldn't that also save money by reducing bureaucratic waste?
   1. ""The government is wasteful"" isn't a valid counterargument to this, because even if it's true that the government is more wasteful than private companies (and that that cost outweighs the benefits of publicizing healthcare), isn't the obvious response that we should force the government to be better, rather than accept the shitty system that's in place?
2.  Healthcare is a human right. We live in a highly developed society, I think we can generally afford to lose some money on healthcare. We're human, aren't we? Aren't we supposed to help each other and work together?
3. Healthcare makes money. There are plenty of people in the US who choose not to get healthcare because they can't afford it. These people often then get sick and need more healthcare anyway, or even die. Dead people don't pay taxes. Keeping your populous alive and healthy requires an initial investment, but it's one that inevitably pays off in the end. Remember that the US [pays more for healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) than any other country in the world, but doesn't even come [top 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_quality_of_healthcare) in most disease outcome rates (eg The US has a 33.1% stomach cancer 5-year survival rate, putting it at #9 globally, with #1 being South Korea at 68.9%).

And here are some rebuttals to common counterarguments:

1. ""Countries with public healthcare have longer wait times""
   1. As mentioned before, despite spending the most on healthcare in the world, the US isn't even close to first in outcomes for many common diseases. In terms of wait time it is difficult to empirically measure wait time across different countries because they often measure them differently, but it doesn't seem that the US is too bad in this regard. An [OECD study](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/242e3c8c-en/1/3/2/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/242e3c8c-en&_csp_=e90031be7ce6b03025f09a0c506286b0&itemIGO=oecd&itemContentType=book) (that looked at 11 countries) on wait times showed that in terms of % of patients waiting more than 1 day for treatment, the US was #10 at 28%, in front of Canada at %33, with the best being Switzerland at 12%. In terms of % waiting more than 1 month (for a specialist appointment), the US was better at #4 with 27%, vs again Switzerland at 23%. So, there are plenty of countries with public healthcare that have shorter wait times than the US.  Some of these countries, such as Switzerland, do have private healthcare, but crucially it is *universal* private healthcare and costs them much less than it does in the US.
2. ""Doctor's wages would fall and therefore nobody would want to be a doctor""
   1. It's true that doctors in the US are generally the most highly paid in the world. However, the US doesn't even have more doctors than other countries. In terms of [number of doctors per capita](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.PHYS.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=true), The US has 2.6 doctors per 1000 people, behind countries like Australia and the Netherlands at 4.1, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, and Sweden at 4.4, Or even Cuba at 8.4 for some reason. It seems like number of doctors per capita doesn't have a strong correlation on healthcare quality, but even in this regard the US is behind many other developed nations.
3. ""The US innovates the most in Healthcare, which is why it costs so much""
   1. It's also true that the US is a major innovator in healthcare. However, according to the [2022 World Index of Healthcare Innovation](https://freopp.org/key-findings-from-the-2022-world-index-of-healthcare-innovation-e2a772f55b92), The US is #11 worldwide with a score of 50.66, behind countries like Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany with scores and ranks of 66.49 (#1), 60.04 (#2), 59.86 (#3), and 58.42 (#4) respectively. In fairness, 2022 was a rather poor year for the US, as in 2021 it was #6 and in 2020 it was #4 worldwide. But, it'd still be behind countries with universal healthcare in both years.
4. ""I don't want to pay for other people's healthcare""
   1. My rebuttal to this is that you should probably have empathy for other human beings. If everyone only paid for what they used, everyone would be poorer, because pooling resources together is more efficient and helps everyone in the long run.
5. ""My taxes would go up""
   1. Yes, but your cost of health insurance would be removed. And as we've seen by the cost of healthcare in other countries, your taxes would go up less than the current cost of your healthcare, because of the lack of profit motive. If your employer pays for your healthcare, then they should increase your wage to compensate for their savings.

&#x200B;

By the way, I'm not even American. I'm Australian. In Australia we have publicly-funded single-payer healthcare system, and every time I hear Americans talking about their healthcare system, it is incredibly obvious to me that our system is simply superior. We still pay for healthcare, but it's a vastly smaller amount that can be waived if you can't afford it. We also have private insurance, which covers things that Medicare (our public system) doesn't - stays in private hospitals (which generally have more comfortable rooms, and better ability to choose your doctors - but don't really have superior healthcare in and of itself), as well as dental and optical services which medicare doesn't cover.

&#x200B;

I would still call our system in Australia insufficient, because of the headache that dealing with Medicare can be, and the fact that it doesn't cover everything. It is clear to me that having everything be single-payer would cost the same amount or less, would simplify and speed up the process of getting important healthcare, and would increase the availability of healthcare to those who need it."

A good society is, among other things, a prosperous society, and compared to other economic systems, capitalism has proven its ability to make us more prosperous. Prosperity, the ability to create more than you consume, enables a society to, if it chooses, help the poor. A poor society, where people barely subsist, cannot afford to be altruistic. 

Being selfish--i.e., pursuing your own self-interest within the law--ultimately promotes a better, happier, and more prosperous society.  Besides, being self-interested is a person's natural state, whereas being self-sacrificing is unnatural for human beings and leads to a  less productive, less prosperous, and ultimately a less happy society. I don't work overtime to put my neighbor's kids through college.

Communism is a form of state mandated altruism where the individual's self-interests are relegated in favor of promoting the interests of the group. Communism has been tried in many places--most prominent of which are Russia and China--without success. 

I am torned between my feelings of a duty to be more altruistic or my intellectual sense that the best thing I can do for society is to be the best possible me.

**FIRSTLY**.  by ""mathematics"", I mean **mathematical syntax,** the system by which people express mathematics , relationships and algorithms. **""f=ma , c = pie\*r\^2""**

secondly , i teach, CS too HS and uni students. part of my argument comes from my anecdotal  experiences teaching these students.

thirdly, this also comes from my Colleagues in CS repeatedly expressing algorithms mathematically.

&#x200B;

My reasoning:

**ONE: single letter variables. mathematical syntax doesn't support multi-letter variables**

firstly, this shits already using **5 alphabets,** we got Latin, Greek, Japanese , Hebrew, Cyrillic. on top of that we have 15 more characters that were made the fuck up.  (not including the various unofficial symbols ive seen over the years)

secondly, despite managing to include an international cast of characters, many sciences , for example physics, use the same character, multiple different times for multiple different things.  for example :

the Watt, the w-boson, work, work function. all use the same symbol

This isn't even delimited too the type: constants, variables and functions can all share the same symbol, theoretically in the same equation.

Furthermore, by definition this also means mathematical syntax no longer fits the definition of information on its own and thus needs context to be provided alongside for the true meaning of an expression to be deduced.  

**TWO:  It doesn't  have syntax support for every algorithm /  relationship.**

this part of the argument is mostly related to CS... in programming we have alot of algorithm techniques that have no formal representation in mathematical syntax. despite that many of these very same algorithms are represented mathematically. (poorly)

For example, mathematics doesn't support iteration over containers. (or at least if it does id like to know what it is)  Its support for containers itself is lacklustre. functions and most iterative methods are also pretty lacklustre.  due to the fact mathematics is written in base 10 it also doesn't support expressions which only work in base 2.

**THREE: it adds a needless barrier to entry too academic study**

how difficult is it too just describe what the function is doing with words.  The worst example of this is neural networks and machine learning.

The mathematics behind neural networks itself is very easy and ive taught it many times, when i do teach it i always teach it with a coding exercise and with code examples, cuss when you see the full mathematical expression for a neural network written down, it feels like you need a PHD in mathematics too actually decipher it.  Mathematical expressions are fucking terrifying, especially to HS and new students.

Not only this but in the workplace Ive seen time and time again programmers throw away or just skim CS research papers that could prove to be very useful, Entirely because despite the fact they have been programming for several years, the algorithm isn't written in any manner they can actually read."

0,2023-06-04,CMV: The existence of incels is ultimately a good sign for feminism,u/architectureHater,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/140q37f/cmv_the_existence_of_incels_is_ultimately_a_good/,changemyview,"In human history we’ve gone through different eras of different styles of mate selection. Throughout each era there has been incels just not called that. In primative Hunter and gatherer times, the incels were men who were not strong enough to hunt. As a result they were likely killed by animals or by the elements.

If they survived that they would have to survive competition from other males over women. And usually the strongest male would win and the strongest males would impregnate most of the women. This is why humanity has more female ancestors than male ancestors.

This trend continues with status being added to a deciding factor in mate selection as it was beneficial for women to partner with high status males that could ensure they would be fed and protected. Since the average man had a higher status and economic capabilities than the average woman, they had the upper hand and more men were able to find partners.

Still when war came, men would be sent off to battle and if they die, the invading men would come through and the women would partner with the invaders for safety again. 

Heading into the modern age, mate selection was heavily influenced by financial safety. Women had to choose to be with a man as many places wouldn’t hire women or if they did women were paid less. Women were also not given any financial freedom so their fates were tied to the men in their life. As a result there still fewer men who couldn’t find partners. The threat of war still existed though, but rarely so the strongest were no longer the only ones finding partners excluding after times of war when the weakest men would die.

Now in the current times, incels exist and grow in numbers. Why? Because there is no benefit to a woman in partnering with them. War and roving bands of invaders aren’t a thing most of the western world is concerned about. Women also have the ability to go to work, earn their own money and have their own financial freedom. 

There is not much a woman has to rely on a man for so mating habits have changed. Instead of focusing on financial security, social status, and physical ability to protect, they focus on physical, sexual, and emotional attraction. 

Incels have the ability to provide the former, but not usually the latter. So women can brush them off to find a partner who can do the latter and only need to see the former as a benefit.

This is a sign for freedom. For women, incels mean that their survival is no longer dependent on the presence of a man in their life. It means that men who refuse to get with the times will die alone and the continued growth of the incel population means a shift in breeding patterns to favor women over men."

When we make a choice, that choice is based on our wants, we cannot control our wants and thus the choice is out of our control. That's the simplest arguement.

You might say; ""Well I might want vanilla ice cream, but I am gonna choose chocolate just to prove my free will""
Well think again, you still have a 'want' that controls your choice. You want to prove your free will.

The most common arguement is determinism, which is agree with to a certain extent. The scientific consensus right now is that randomness exists on the quantum level. So determinism is not correct. However randomness does not prove free will. The conclusion is that everything is determined to the point of randomness. And no where in this equation does free will appear.

I don't see this view as being particularly pessimistic. One of the main takeaways is that fault also can't exist. So we cannot judge one another. Which I think is a positive thing.

I really want to know why you still believe in free will.

EDIT: I am aware that I am not done debating with a lot of you, and am missing a lot of replies.

Premise one: Discriminating on race is illegal (and wrong). 
Premise two: Companies and colleges can’t discriminate based on race if they don’t know your race. 
Premise three: Asking for an applicant’s race makes it significantly easier for the college to know the applicant’s race.
Premise four: Asking for an applicant’s race serves no purpose outside of discrimination. 
Ergo: Asking an applicant for his or her race should be just as illegal (and seen as just as wrong) as discriminating against someone for his or her race. 

To change my view I’d like a hole to be poked in one of those premises or a different premise or premises to be brought up which renders the conclusion incorrect.

Edit: It seems as though most of the dissenting opinions come from a gripe with premise four so I will elaborate on it here to hopefully avoid typing the same thing in the replies: The counter argument I have seen the most is along the lines of: “These statistics are used to ensure companies/colleges are not discriminate ergo the question should be allowed.” While I understand this is the alleged purpose of the question, I don’t believe these are the results it produces. First of all: How, exactly, do you decide if there is discrimination? Do you compare the accepted applications to the total applications? What if the total applications don’t reflect the population? How do you define the population? The world? The country? The state? The city? Second, let’s say we agree on all of that, what is the tolerance level of the test? That is at what point do we agree that it’s okay to discriminate to reverse a potential discrimination? To quote Mark Twain: “There’s lies, damn lies, and statistics.”"

If the point of these checks were specifically to target lower income people’s rent or food why not give them some kind of credit for those expenses rather than cash that they can spend on whatever.
I think that when people receive that money they might spend on things that the policy was not intended for and only end up hurting themselves financially later on for not using the funds for their intended purpose. It seems counter intuitive to let people blow money on whatever when the set goal for these cash infusions is to target something specific. I don’t know just my thought CMV."

I then said, since i’ll be the bread winner, it opens the possibility for us to have a kid and him stay home with it. (we both love the idea) 

She then says to me “don’t do that, you stay home, let him be the man so he can feel masculine”
 
I strongly believe that there is no reasoning behind the prescribed gender roles currently in place. Women are just as capable to work as men are as capable to be nurturing. Other than religion i’ve never seen any other reasoning behind this. 

The idea of masculinity is a complete construction made my humans. What is masculinity? Some would say it’s being hard working, driven, strong willed and brave. But all those are also what make femininity to many woman. Who wouldn’t want those qualities? 

I can’t understand how a man not working is stripping him of his masculinity, is working a full time job that empowering for men?"

For half an hour my mind was blown, assuming it works as advertised (and it's an apple product so we can have some confidence it will) the vision pro appears to be a full realisation of what an AR and VR headset can be combining real world usability, controls, computing power and displays that will make headsets a major platform alongside phones, tablets and computers. This is the headset I want, it's incredibly exciting, and it costs three and a half thousand dollars.

In any context that's expensive but it's justifiable, theoretically you can replace your TV and computer with the Vision Pro, the cost is similar. It's not a problem that the Vision Pro is expensive, the problem is how apple are selling it.

Apple brought on the head of Disney to talk about their collaboration with Disney+ and what they showed off looked cool, but I'm not going to spend $7000 dollars buying two extra headsets so my kids to watch Disney+ in AR. All the cool stuff Disney say will be on the platform will never materialise because the mass market will never be there to justify it.

They talked about gaming, I'd love to play a AAA title on Vision Pro, it will be incredible. There'll be no AAA gaming on Vision Pro, there's not going to be the audience to justify making those games. The mass market will be a headset like the Quest at a fraction of the price which will have a library of games you actually want to play.

Apple showed us how you can wear the Vision Pro and interact with the real world, other people appear on your display, they can see your eyes, on video calls other people can see a life-like avatar of you, none of this well ever be comfortable. Talking to a person wearing a mask will never be natural, people will take it off to interact with each other, the avatar on video calls will not be a substitute for actual video of a person.

The vision pro might become a reality useful productivity tool for businesses that are willing to spend good money on the best tools. It might have success with enthusiasts who are willing to spend a huge amount of money to get the best headset experience. It will never be a mass market tool that people will wear around their home or the office. It will always be niche, change my view."

Growing up I didn't know what I wanted my job to be. I was always an excellent student so everyone reassured me that I could follow any field I pleased. However, when I turned 14 I realised that what I truly wanted to do was follow my father's footsteps and become a lawyer. As I previously mentioned I've always been an excellent student but what people didn't know was that I by far the person that worked the hardest in any academic environment I was involved in. I am not saying this to brag but to emphasize something that will be mentioned later. Something that always bothered me though (and this was something that I was sure nobody that called me smart knew). Whenever one of the people I considered dumb put in even the tiniest bit of effort they got the same results as I did. For that I always blamed luck and played it off as a coincidence. Now I understand that I was blaming luck for the wrong reason. Last year I took an iq test fully confident that I would get a score of at least 110 since both of my parents had scores of above 130. Little did I know that taking that iq test would be a grave mistake. After finishing it the results came up and I was mortified. 98. According to the test I had an IQ score of 98. I couldn't believe it and my ego at the time reassured me that the test was just bullshit. I was always a good actor and manipulator though, telling all of my family and friends that I in fact had an IQ score of 124. Nobody was really shocked but they still congratulated me... and to be honest that hurt considering what my real score was.Fast forward to a week ago. More than a year had passed and I decided that it's time to take another IQ test. I started off strong thinking that I got all the questions right. After some point though I started to not understand them. The shapes on my screen just didn't make sense to me so I decided to finish the test at question 23 fully expecting an IQ score of 100+. Once again I was shocked while glaring at my screen and witnessing the result. 88. Yeah... 88. The guy that aspired to be a lawyer and become part of the best university in his country scored 88 on an IQ test. That night I walked my dog and realised that the test I took last year was not just bullshit but was actually correct.  \*x\*\*SIDENOTE\*\*After going through a lot of shit in this past year including a HORRID breakup I had already lost all my confidence with the only thing remaining in my mind being that I was at least somewhat intelligent. So this really broke me.\*x During that walk I decided that my dream of being a lawyer was over. Who in their right mind would want someone that excuse my language was borderline mentally retarded to be their lawyer? I was heartbroken.. Really, I couldn't believe that I was that dumb. But, thinking about it now it really makes sense. All the times my efforts were ""disrespected"" by luck as my ""dumb"" friends got grades equal to mine with minimal effort were proven to be pure intelligence and talent... not luck. As I said.. I blamed luck for the wrong thing. The problem wasn't my friends' luck being exquisite but mine being abysmal. They weren't lucky.. I was just given a bad hand.My dream died that day. I decided that I couldn't be a lawyer and that everything I have done up to this point was pointless. All of my effort was wasted as I could never be something with an IQ score that low. I thought to myself that I should become a cop since, while they have a bad fame I've always admired their work in keeping everyone safe.I guess what I'm trying to say is that.. Luck's a bitch and life is unfair. Some fail and some succeed and sadly I will be one of the failures of the world. It's okay though.. I didn't whine or cry about it. I just accepted it. I was never keen on crying. I looked at it as a sign of weakness and pointless. I suppose I'll make the best out of a good situation and help some people as a cop instead of a lawyer.. It's sort of depressing though, since in my country a cop makes barely enough money to eat and maintain a roof above his head.(not considering a family)In conclusion, my dream died but that doesn't mean yours has to die too. All of you are probably smarter than I am and will succeed if you put the work in. Just.. please take something from this story. Hard-work without talent is never enough but hard-work with talent always is. Try accomplishing your dreams and don't give up on yourself. Utilize your intelligence and work hard to achieve that which you always wanted. Don't let laziness get in your way. I've worked hard I certainly have but now I realise that it will never be enough.Talent always surpasses hard work.

WRITTEN AND EXPERIENCED BY A 16 YEAR OLD.  


  
\*significant change\*

I might have messed up. I'm pretty sure that at first I didn't understand the nature of the test. I retook it and got a score of 107 after completing 30 questions and leaving 18 minutes on the clock. My first test was based on 20 questions. I realised that even though I didn't understand some of the questions later on I should've still kept going because the test (at least from what I think) doesn't deduct points for wrong answers but just adds some for right ones. So in theory if I used up all my time (Like I'm supposed to do) and actually studied every question precisely my score could've been different)  


I sincerely apologize for wasting your time and will retake the test in due time using up all of the time given to me, of course I will keep all of you updated. Thank you for helping me get thru this boys."

0,2023-06-05,CMV: Furry haters are more cringe than furries,u/mikeman7918,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/141rn40/cmv_furry_haters_are_more_cringe_than_furries/,changemyview,"The furry community has some cringe, certainly.  But not as much as most people think, and it's nothing compared to the level of cringe that furry haters exhibit.

Furries are furries for a variety of reasons.  For some it's just a fun thing they do comerable to engagement with a fandom, for others it's more of a strong identity such that they'd become their fursona IRL if given the chance, for some it's more of a sexual thing or a combination of factors.

There is this pervasive idea that being a furry is related in some way to zoophilia, but that's wrong.  One consistent thing among furries is that any sexualized creature is a sapient and usually humanoid person capable of consenting to sex and communicating it.  They aren't real animals, they are purely fictional creatures that are in every relevant way basically just different looking people.  Furry characters are usually functioning as a persona representing a real person, in fact.  A fursona, you might even say.  To make a comparison: calling furries zoophiles would be like calling somebody a pedophile because they have a kink for adults wearing diapers or are into ageplay.  Call it weird all you want, but they're ultimately sexualizing adults so there really isn't a problem here.

But furry haters on the other hand...  They are unbelievably cringe.  It's clear that they are trying to be edgy, but they aren't tactful enough to be edgy in a way that doesn't just involve being openly hateful towards people with no subtext or punchline, and they don't have the stones to do any bigotry that people would disagree with, so they go after furries.  It truly is some ""I'm 14 and this is edgy"" tier shit from people who want to be edgy because it would make them look cool but who are secretly conformists who openly mock the idea of thinking about the things they say.

The original meaning of being ""edgy"" is that you are willing to go up to the edge of what's socially acceptable, but doing that requires an awareness of where these social boundaries are and putting thought into what you do and say such that you come near to the edge without crossing it.  Around people who are part of marginalized groups being edgy can be more endearing than being hugboxy, because it demonstrates an awareness of the social boundaries and it shows thea consideration for the other person that you are so tactful in not to crossing them.  But being openly hateful isn't edgy, it's just lazily blasting right past the edge into the realm of unacceptability.  True edginess is an artform, and all these furry haters just shit all over it in a crude attempt to mimic its aesthetics."

0,2023-06-05,CMV: The Development Of Powerful Ideologies Asserting Racial Hierarchy/Essentialism In The Colonial Era Is Causally Linked To The Black Death,u/nekro_mantis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/141y0lw/cmv_the_development_of_powerful_ideologies/,changemyview,"Most explanations of European colonialism hinge on economic/technological essentialism, arguing that colonial empires emerged out of historically banal competitive proclivities which were delimited in specific nations by key innovations including guns and naval technology. Historical analyses of why Europe achieved these advancements in technology and economic structures have also been done ad nauseum which include arguments about the impact of The Black Death (relaxation of malthusian pressure), and disease is also factored into these stories specifically in regards to new world colonies. 

The assertion of this post will be that the realized inclination to dominate and dehumanize otherized peoples by asserting a ideology of racial hierarchy/essentialism cannot be reductively painted as a non-unique display of general human nature in ambition amplified by the arrival of key innovations in technology and economic systems, nor can it be chalked up to a nebulous evil inherent to colonial peoples. Instead, The Black Death likely induced cultural evolution of European communities toward heightened suspicion, wariness, and scrutiny of outsiders as a disease avoidance adaptation. The presence and easy manipulation of this instinctual fear would have been a non-trivial factor contributing to the cruel, dehumanizing nature of European colonial powers and their engagements with foreign cultures during their empirial tenure. 

Here are a few things that are suggestive of this conclusion: 

1.The Black Death has already been implicated by historical analysis as responsible for the intensification of persecution against otherized people within Europe at that time (Jews, Romanis, Lepers, ect.) 

2. Many of the nations hardest hit by the plague would later become major colonial powers (U.K., France, Spain, later Germany). 

3. Contemporary evidence of infectious disease exposure being predictive of racial bias that, interestingly, shows a greater effect in white study participants. 

https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/08/harvard-study-suggests-racial-tension-may-stem-from-fear-of-exposure-to-infectious-diseases/ 

4. Other analysis has shown historical particularities can have a lasting impact shaping cultural dispositions of groups who lived through them. The Black Death was a historical event of devastating scale and importance that is hard to overstate.

TL;DR: Hatred and Contempt for difference are a way of remedying the uncertainty of fear. In this case, fearful disposition was a historically contingent characteristic of relevant populations with an identifiable cause. CMV"

I get slightly shocked when they inevitably say to ""wait a few days before following up,"" because part of me EXPECTS them to further instill in me that my friendship with that person is ruined and I should never text them again. I don't mean being left on ""read"" after the natural end of a text conversation. I mean being left on ""read"" in the MIDDLE of a text conversation, which subsequently ends the conversation. When they inevitably say to wait a few days before texting, I get slightly taken aback since I barely have a toolbox when it comes to being left on ""read"" over text, and I really think a mindset change around being left on ""read"" would address many of my anxieties around texting. My apologies if this sounds very messy.

Here's my (slightly flawed) thought process: I immediately think texting between two people only falls in two categories: both people are texting each other every day, and both of them never reach out to one another at all. If I send someone a text message and they read it without responding, I immediately interpret that as ""don't talk to me ever again.""

Here's my reasoning: I fear that being left on read would be a leadup to me getting blocked on social media and eventually losing the relationship/existing connection. People say ""if the other person wants to text you back, she will"" and ""if she doesn't text back, she's not interested, so move on"", particularly in respect to pursuing romantic relationships. (I don't know how this applies to strictly platonic friendships, however, so correct me if I'm wrong.) People also say not to constantly spam text messages to another person or follow up immediately after the previous message was left on read. Therefore, I should never follow up with another text message at all, since that would make me look desperate for a relationship, and that would increase my chances of getting blocked.

This is why I tend to simply not reach out to people for weeks/months at a time if they leave me on ""read."" I feel that it's better to simply not message at all than message too early or message immediately after the previous message and come off as desperate.

I have a few social incidents to back this up. The first one was about 4 years ago. I was in class when a group of girls told me they were going to a beach about an hour away form town. They even showed me the apartment complex they would be staying at. I later begged my parents to take me to that same beach during spring break since they had a beach house there. Once there, I messaged them a bunch of times on Snapchat desperately trying to arrange a meetup point with them. All the messages were left on ""opened."" I later randomly encountered them on the beach, but it didn't last long. I would later realize they were never actually my friends, and eventually unfriended them from my Snapchat account. I believed that, since they left my messages on ""opened,"" they were not my friends. Therefore, I worry that if someone leaves a message on ""opened"" one time (even if they're just busy or forgot to respond), that's a slippery slope towards them not being an actual friend anymore.

The second one was about 3 years ago. I was trying to pursue a relationship with someone, and it was clearly not going well since it was mentally draining. One day, I was with my friends during lunch period. They all knew I had a crush on the girl, whether because I told them directly or they heard it from someone else whom I also told directly. They took my  phone and used it to try to start a videocall to her on Snapchat. She didn't pick up. I then sent a message saying ""That was not me, that was [my friend],"" which was left on ""opened."" The next day, I sent a picture of myself to her on Snapchat as a ""snap."" That was also left on ""opened."" A few days later, I found out that she blocked me. Since I was left on ""opened"" before I was ""blocked,"" I fear that being left on ""read"" one time would automatically be a prelude to getting blocked, even if the other person was just busy or forgot to respond.

Please change this view. This is seriously interfering with my current friendships, especially if I encounter a situation where the other person doesn't respond to a message I sent. Whenever I see the read recipt, the person's chat bubble dropping to the bottom of the chat window on Facebook Messenger, or simply a lack of response over text message, I immediately go into panic mode and start sorting through the worst case scenarios of ""what if they hate me"" and make plans to ""repair"" the friendship, even if there's nothing actually wrong with it. It's given me so much anxiety and I haven't had the tools to address it. This is why I feel that I should NEVER follow up to a text conversation at all after the person doesn't respond to my message; I feel that even following up after a few weeks would make me look desperate.

Alright Reddit, time to say the line. CHANGE. MY. VIEW!!!!!!!!!!

Edit: My apologies for the lack of responses! I was asleep. Oh dear, I guess I answered my own question lol..."
0,2023-06-06,CMV: If there was a button that would instantly and painlessly kill every human I would press it.,u/Quality_bullshit_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1428bxf/cmv_if_there_was_a_button_that_would_instantly/,changemyview,"Hi, I know this title seems really edgy but I thought of this and I do believe this is the kindest option. Now for you to understand my perspective there are two things I need you to do:

1 - See this from the perspective that there is no god

2 - Imagine after death there is nothingness for the individual, there is no ""you"", you dont know you exist nor exist at all, ""life"" is over and you are no longer existing.

&#x200B;

So here is why I believe this is right, if we have two options we should always choose the morally preferable option right? In this situation if we want to reduce the most suffering clicking this button would be the morally preferable option.

There is so much ""bad"" in this world and humans face so much injustice wouldnt it be fair for us not **all** to exist? It would immediately end all the unnecessary suffering, wars, rape, murder literally every bad thing you can imagine happening to humans in this moment would stop. My friends asked me about all the good but I think the bad far out weighs the good.

Choosing not to because your life is good I think is selfish because of the many millions and potentially billions who unfairly suffer throughout their lives.

Here is another goofy idea I had, if we imagine humans can feel happiness and sadness between 1,000,000 and 0 throughout their lives, we can make a natural assumption that they would have at least one point in each right? So if we look for the morally preferable option would that be having no sadness at all and therefore not existing at all?

&#x200B;

The main drawbacks I see with this are animals, I have pets and i'd be beyond devastated imagining them stuck in my house not able to get food so choosing to end humanity would also kill ALOT of pets, but even then we kill FAR more existing so its just me being close to my pets.

My friends think i'm being stupid and it feels like a very edgy take that I otherwise wouldn't have so change my mind please!"

In a sleeper train car with small individual capsule rooms there are 60 people. In a similar car with economy class seats there are 88 people. In a business class train car there are only 30ish people. So capsuled bunk beds should be only marginally more expensive than economy class but significantly cheaper than business: which is the definition of premium economy class. 

Point 2: Comfort. I'd definitely prefer a private capsule where I can fully lay down than a business class seat that doesn't allow me to have any real sleep during a long-haul flight. As for eating food... Why not just put a few tables in the public area? Or allow eating inside the capsules? 

Point 3: Efficiency. Capsules can be stack on one another up to three layers. Seats, whether business or economy, only has one layer. So capsules can accompany 2x or 3x more people in the same space as business class.

Point 4: Safety Problems. Long haul international flights usually fly in the stratosphere where there is little disturbance."

There’s also a report that they used the “smell of weed” to break into someone’s house without a warrant.

There have been many lawsuits, which the police departments have lost, that prove this.

Thus we should just get rid of that altogether. The new law should be that you need to see the illegal substance and take a picture of the illegal substance before you can make a warrantless entry.

Also it should include how you need the entire confrontation on your body cam footage (which should be posted online on a non-law enforcement business’s site) with no “cuts” or the arrest doesn’t count.

After all, to all the law enforcement that actually deserve their jobs, this will just give you proof you did your job.

1. Amphibious invasions are a complete nightmare to set up logistically, which the Chinese have zero combat experience doing. With the huge burden on supplies and time they have, it makes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine seem like a cakewalk.

2. Taiwan is surrounded by Allies. The Philippines, Japan and South Korea have a huge geographic advantage in that the Bashi channel can be contested by the U.S in the Philippines, and Japan is putting cruise missiles on their southernmost islands to cover the north, so an embargo is also borderline impossible to do.

3. Because of Taiwan’s climate, you have an extremely limited amount of time to invade and occupy the country before you’re hit by major storms and hurricanes that weaken your offensive.

4. China is indeed a very corrupt and evil government, but it’s not stupid. They’re not Putin who has done military action numerous times before Ukraine, China hasn’t been in a military conflict in decades and the CCP get their way through economics and negotiating agreements, NOT by war.

Feel free to let me know what you think, I’ll say that my view was far different before the invasion of Ukraine and the developments in the Philippines."

3,2023-06-06,CMV: Small penis shaming is the worst form of body shaming.,u/Moist-Improvement724,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/142gxrp/cmv_small_penis_shaming_is_the_worst_form_of_body/,changemyview,"All forms of body shaming are bad.  But of all the forms I've experienced myself, and seen others experience first hand, small penis shaming is the worst. Here's why:

The fact that it's not as readily apparent what size a man is, apart from men who are large when soft wearing those famous grey sweatpants that can show off their size, actually makes it worse. It means people can shame your penis size while standing right next to you, and laughing, not knowing that inside you're actually dying. You have to suffer in silence. I'm black and most people expect me to not have a small penis. So they think it's safe to small penis shame in my presence

It's at the core of  identity and masculinity. Think about the fact that we euphemistically refer to the penis as your ""**MANHOOD**"". To have a small penis isn't just a statement of fact, it means you're less masculine. Small penis shaming drives this into your psyche. That you're worth less than men who are bigger than you. They can be proud of their manhood, yours is shameful. This is even worse as a black man, where large penises are our whole shtick. It's our thing. The amount of time someone has flirted with me by saying ""*SO IS IT TRUE?*"", is demoralizing and depressing.

It's the only form of body shaming that even anti-body shaming feminists/leftists actually enjoy. So not even that ideology is a safe haven. I remember when Trump was elected, some leftists, of whom I count myself as amongst, made nude statues of Trump so they could point and laugh at how small his penis was. I remember looking at all those pics, and realizing my soft penis when looking at the mirror was if similar size as the one all these people were ridiculing.

I'm not sure how much personal experience is allowed when making these arguments, so i'll keep this one brief. 7 years after my penis was discribed as a ""pencil dick"", I still cannot get myself to believe there's a significant amount of women out in the world who's vaginas are capable of feeling pleasure when penetrated by a thinner than average penis. Like, it just doesn't compute to me. It doesn't make sense. How is she feeling pleasure from a penis so thin?

If that sounds bad to you, that's what a society that enjoys telling men with small penises how useless and undesirable they are, in endless TV sitcoms, movies and ads, does to them psychologically. And you know it'll never get better or improve. If you have a son or brother with a small penis, you know they're probably suffering the shame in silence too.

All forms of body shaming are bad, but I believe the reasons stated above show why this one is the worst."

1,2023-06-06,CMV: Universal basic income and negative income tax does not work,u/Bfitness93,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/142mdao/cmv_universal_basic_income_and_negative_income/,changemyview,"Just to explain NIT briefly. Let's say the number they decide on is 30k. If you do not make that you are given 30k. If you make under 30k you're given the difference. For example, if you make 10k they'll give you 20k. UBI, everyone is given a monthly payment.

They can see who makes what now and fund it accordingly. Let's say it's 1 billion dollars.

How many people would quit their jobs because of this? Why would someone work 40hrs a week for 31k when they can not work at all for 30k. The more you make the less incentive you have of dropping out of the work force but the closer you are to 30k the more likely you're to drop out. Maybe that point is around 40k when most people stop dropping out. Perhaps at 70k almost nobody is. 

Here's the issue, that 1 billion dollars can't fund all this new demand. 1 of the reasons using math in the economy can back fire since it doesn't take into account people have free will. The budget now might need to go up to 3 billion with lesser people paying into it. So now someone who didn't quit because they worked for 60k a year has more incentive to because their taxes sky rocketed. They might have paid 8k originally for this but now they have to pay 24k. Knocking them down to 36k a year. More people now drop out of the work force. Now 3 billion goes to 6 billion. There was a lot of incentive to work for 80k but now they'll be taxed at 40-50k due to an extreme demand of this policy, now they drop out.

Same with UBI. You give everyone a set amount. But this will cause some to drop out of the work force. Or cut their own hours. Now the burden goes on the higher paid groups but just like negative income tax, they begin to not have the incentive to work as much so the output lowers."

The defenses are usually along the lines of "" They're angry and traumatized from years of oppression that's why they lash out. You don't understand because you're white."" And that's fair, I can't understand the rage a black person experiences due to racism when I am white. But I can look at how other people in their shoes are behaving. Which begs the question: if they're not just violent angry antisocial people, if this really is the circumstances and not the person, why isn't everybody else in those same circumstances behaving the same way. 

I think 99% of the time, the violent looters are just violent antisocial people and that's why they loot and engage in violence. They see an opportunity to get a free computer, they take it. They get to watch a building burn, awesome. They get to fight? Great. I don't think they're good people pushed to the brink, I don't think their circumstances are the driving factor. And I don't think anybody should be defending them. Defend the peaceful protesters, point out how many of them there are. 

That's my view, but as always I'm open to changing it.

There are other cases too where the left is very quick to jump to the defense of people who have a history of doing bad things and criminals in general. One example is Rittenhouse- assaulting somebody would not have been out of character for the men he shot, but the assumption was that the man he initially shot was trying to protect others. If somebody shows you who they are believe them."

Historically, we have chosen not to get involved in protests or other political action, as we feel our neutrality as moderators is core to the success of the subreddit; it would be unfair for us to put our thumb on the scale to influence an issue.  However, this issue has given us pause, as it is about the future and stability of the very platform CMV depends on to function.  In full transparency, the moderation team is split on whether or not we should participate in this protest action.

To help us make the decision, we are asking for your input on whether or not to participate.  To be clear - the results of this poll are \*\*non-binding\*\*; we are using it as input for our decision, rather than to make the decision itself.

laughing gas, or other sedation methods, should be available and accessible. i have no idea why this is not available in most places. the attitude i’ve got from most physicians is “suck it up”. it doesn’t even have to be covered, i and many other people would be willing to pay an extra fee.

Corporal punishment teaches children from an early age that violence is justified in an attempt to halt a behavior. I've seen this sentiment expressed in my community such as polls justifying violence for the usage of slurs as if we have the right to assault someone over words( fighting words ).  Black women are significantly more likely to be assaulted compared to any other race of women in America. Abusing children will only create abusive adults.

This video for example is rather disgusting but the reception from my community is overwhelmingly positive in favor of the father. Not only is abuse celebrated for her acts; blatant sexism is also present here as a boy with 2 girls would not be as critisized or perhaps even praised for his behavior if his dad found him. 

With that said corporal punishment leads to increase aggression by the abuse of children Ultimately creating abusive adults that not only abuse others but only put themselves at jeopardy risking jail by the notion that certain non-violent behavior warrants violence."

Disclaimer - This is not a rant post against capitalism. I am speaking of the things that I have observed. And I am choosing this platform because I want to hear opinion and experiences of people from various countries and understand how much wrong or right I am with my perspective. 

I am a citizen a very large democracy and it's always the news how the government is bad or trying to dictate everything.

However, I think it's not just the government it's more us.

People have to clear one of the toughest exams in the world to get government jobs. But what do they do when they get the job. They eventually misuse their powers to make as much money as they can. Yes, not everyone is like that but most of them are, which makes the whole system corrupt and slows down the progress that is supposed to be made.

My point is these people with power are normal citizens just like you and me. These are one of the smartest people in the country who have studied and worked so hard to achieve where they are, yet for what? To exploit others. If this class is going to do this then what can we expect from less educated ones.

Teachers and doctors are more interested in getting salaries then the lives of the people who are dependent on them.

It's like citizens morality and values are degrading day by day. And these corrupt people are responsible for the corrupt government. 

I know people are bad. My question is, how the developed countries are growing despite having the same kind of people. Or is it that their citizens are more concerned about the country and their citiznes."

On a sac fly normally just the runner on third moves, sometimes a runner on second also moves. On a ground out, everyone moves forward. 

Point 2: Sacrifice flies are often just as unintentional as RBI groundouts. We rarely see anyone hit a sac fly on purpose. They're just swinging for the fences and missing the ball by a little bit. Same with an RBI groundout. Sometimes they hit to 2B on purpose but most of the times it's just a narrow miss from a base hit. So ""intentional or unintentional"" should not be a factor.

Point 3: The defense side doesn't often ""choose"" to give up that run either. If you're shifting forward then there is no such thing as an RBI groundout. Only a hit or unproductive groundout. If you don't, then the ball is just too slow to stop the runner coming in. You don't recieve an RBI for a GIDP ball.

Point 4: In general Sabermetrics tend to underrate team batting (such as groundout to 2B to move the runners forward) so officially recognising the RBI groundout as a positive or neutral outcome would benefit players especially team-oriented players who don't swing for the fences all the time."

But when it's winter it must be cold. And that's the problem. You either have to pay for heat or get tired with getting coal or wood, starting the fire and checking it doesn't spread. Going out is a torture. You have to put in a dozen layers of clothes. Underwear, pants, short-sleeved shirt, long-sleeved shirt, sweatshirt, boots, neck warmer, hat, gloves. To go out to a shop that is on the ground level or just around the corner, you need all this wearing and getting tired. Winter clothes are heavy, limit motions, sometimes even visibility, and are hard to put on and put off. So buying those is hard and even if you do, then they're hard to walk in. Summer and spring don't have those problems, because you can put on clothes for outdoors and indoors, just change boots and you're alright.

And winter is such a great time to get sick. And the worst thing is having a stuffed nose and have to breathe with your mouth, with this cold air. Throat damage guaranteed, plus this pain in the face from the cold air blowing in your direction. Summer and spring don't have such problems. And winter has the highest amount of deaths of all the seasons. I literally got a frostbite because I touched snow with my bare hands because I didn't have gloves on them. And if you're healthy and put on the clothes, there's another problem.

Getting around. Most of us are rich and have a car and can drive wherever they want. But if you can't, you have to use public transit. I don't have anything about just using it or the fact of the existence of public transit, but the quality of those in Poland, where I live, leaves much to be desired. You have to wait, in cold. In a city this isn't a problem as big as in the rural areas where buses function. These are often coming only in early mornings and in early afternoon, but even if they come more often, they often are late. And no matter the location, you often have to stand, and even if you find a seat, you can sometimes smell people who don't shower very often. Trams, trains, metros and buses are often heated, like most indoor places, we'll get to that later, and people coming there in winter are usually in jackets and sweat in those vehicles, especially considering how crowded they often get and how warm those crowded people are. You'll sweat like a construction worker after 8 hours of work during a heatwave. And driving doesn't save you from the effects of winter. You have to scrape snow from your car, the engine can not start or the visibility is low and roads are blocked or icy, you can skid easily and crash into another car, a pedestrian, a pole or a tree. Walking does neither. If snow falls, it's crushed by people walking, melts and freezes again, and or forms ice on the sidewalk. And you can slip on it and either break something or die. Each time I walk on it, I think I'm gonna die. Either i slip on it and land on a spiked fence, I land on the sidewalk and break something, or I land on the street and get run over by a semi truck or a car. If you manage to get to your destination, there's another problem.

All the buildings are heated, so if you're in winter clothes, you're going to sweat like a construction worker after 8 hours of work during a heatwave.       

It's dark half the day. You go to work or school, dark, you go back, dark. And the other half it's cloudy and grey. And the whole world dies. No leaves, no grass, no flowers, some animals hibernate, just grey, cloudy skies and white brown combination of snow, soil, water and mud. No sun. Sure, there are Christmas lights but let's face it, they are only to hide the grey and dark. 

It's a hard time for students. The semester ends. You have to pass everything. They throw a lot of tests and quizzes at you. You will tire yourself to death.

Winter sports and games. Snowballs. I hate snowballs. Even if the person who throws one is someone I like. Usually, I take it easy, but in my mind, I hate it. Ice skating. I can't do that because the nearest lake or skating rink is too far away to walk. I could afford that, but I would need to wear all those clothes, get on the bus, ask my parents for approval, get back. No way. Skiing. I live in a city surrounded by forests and farm fields. No way. Sledding. Those are easier because I have some hills in my neighborhood, but going out, taking the sled, going back. Nope. Snowman. Going out. No.

And there are, CHRISTMAS IN WINTER. I'm fed up with them. Literally a few days after Halloween and All Saints Day, all the shops and malls are decorated, and Christmas songs are playing on the radio and Christmas commercials on TV. ""Last Christmas, I gave you my heart..."":“Christmas promotion! Bone carp, only 21.37 per package or a withered Christmas tree, 69.69 each plus delivery for 3.21. Holidays for Christmas, Old Zealand, 666.66 both ways. Christmas loans, only in Pierogi Bank Polski."" Don't take Christmas loans, that's the stupidest thing you can do in that time of the year. They're still up everywhere, wherever I go, whatever I look at. Until the day finally arrives, December 24, when you are completely fed up with it. And it's not like I hate Christmas. Christmas in their current shape and theme are asking for dislike. You want to get up, leave, and come back when all this madness is over. But it's nice that we have time off and we get presents and meet our family. In the summer we have more free time, and on birthdays and name days we also get gifts and meet our family. But always something. And then there's another holiday.

New Year's Eve and New Year, when humans celebrate Earth going around the Sun once again, while nothing besides it happens in nature and humanity on those two days. You can do whatever you want on that day, and in my case, it'll be sitting on the couch in pajamas, watching TV and eating some unhealthy snacks like chips. Most people will spend it partying with friends and family and doing stuff together. And then, they will count from 10 to 1 like if a rocket was starting, and then fireworks explore, and dogs are scared. Afterwards, people will start to go home. And then you can't sleep the whole night because some idiots have too much fireworks and firecrackers, which is also a problem the whole winter."

The only ""online boycotts"" that work are those where the main use of the site is altered (e.g. Tumblr and the one OF wanted to do) and the users end up leaving permanently because they no longer want what the site offers. Changing how users interact with content will do nothing. UI changes are never popular. ""Sending a message"" is pointless since Reddit surely knew this change would be unpopular.

tldr; 99.8% of Reddit users are more bored than they are outraged, and will be back, and Reddit knows this."

This is mainly in response to the advent of stuff like that English teenager knobhead on Tiktok and others who go viral for stupid 'pranks' with stuff like vandalism or harassing members of the public. Many have opined that we shouldn't even be giving these guys the publicity of reporting on their activities as it plays into their hands, and to an extent I agree, but it's also not surprising that something gets reported on if it blows up on social media. It's a bit of a vicious cycle which I think encourages and publicises certain petty crimes and so I've started thinking that, as the wider impacts of such crimes conducted in this very social media-driven style are worse than if they were just performed with no further documentation, any time someone deliberately circulates their own criminal activity on social media they should be faced with a worse sentence than normal.

I expect that for *some* crimes this probably is already the case in a lot of countries; probably particularly for crimes like encouraging violence (publicly proclaiming support for ISIS bombings would probably be punished additionally harshly if the proclaimer posted their message on social media on top), and for crimes which are especially degrading to the victim(s) to the point that documenting and sharing it could be considered an additional crime in itself (e.g. someone who sexually assaulted another person would be punished especially heavily if they recorded and shared the assault.) But I think that with the especially viral nature of social media, this has to be something that is extended to other crimes as well. The 'benefits' of those other crimes have now gone up when the criminals choose to involve social media as there is now greater potential to gain fame from them, so to act as a proper deterrent the 'costs' of the crime must also go up by imposing harsher penalties on people who not only commit the crimes but share them on social media. (Of course, infamy may be considered a 'cost' as well, but presumably if somebody has elected to record and share their crimes it is because they do in fact view any fame they gain from them to be a good thing.) This may also further serve to stigmatise such behaviour; at present it seems like the presence of social media is convincing some people that their actions which in other contexts they may have recognised as wrong to be basically just a bit of fun and entertainment, whereas we really need to be putting out the message that turning harmful actions into a spectacle makes them *more* wrong, not less.

Everyone has a right to protest, I get that, but when people discover the personal addresses of government officials, either through legal means or otherwise, and then go to their residence to protest, I think that create huge problems.

With the increasingly polarized environment the United States is finding itself in, when a government official makes a decision, there is a good to great chance that half of the people are going to like it, and the other half are going to hate it. When the half the hates it figures “we’ll just go to the officials house and get them to do what we want”, there we have a problem.

Take the recently overturned Roe v. Wade  for example. Yes I know the republicans gained a lot of Supreme Court seats through scummy means, yes I know the Supreme Court can be described as having a conservative bias. However, as it were, people found the personal addresses of members of the court and went there to protest and brought the media with them, potentially doxxing them even further. 

Think for a second that the opposite happened, if the Supreme Court upheld Roe v. Wade, now the justices would just have to deal with the Trump supporters and bible humpers at their doorstep. How are you supposed to do your job?

Why are the protesters even there? Well depending who the protesters are and what they’re protesting, it’s either making their voices heard or intimidation.

[Here’s some cops in Los Angeles confronting a city council member over budget cuts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/gxebwb/cops_surround_and_confront_la_city_councilmember/)

Is this a protest or intimidation? What if they showed up at her house? Does it matter that much *who* is doing the protesting? When this was posted, everyone said that the cops were attempting to bully and intimidate the council member.

[Here are cops showing up to support cop city in Atlanta.](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT81dDgHt/)

Then the video was on the sponsorship changes, and how you can't have banner ads or video ads for sponsors.

And I'm going to be honest, I can't help but feel like that is a totally reasonable ask for Twitch to make.

And it's not like they are making it so you can't get sponsorships at all either. You can still have links to the sponsor, you can still talk about the sponsor, you can still show off the sponsored products or play the sponsored game, and you can still have that corner logo of the sponsor.

You just can't have banners that take up like the whole bottom quarter of the screen or run literal video ads on stream. Both of which most people don't even like on the first place because people don't even like ads.

The one argument I keep seeing is that it will harm eSports and large tournaments since they rely on banner ads and video ads. And to that, I just don't understand why they can't just convert to the small logo in the corner? Or just have a bot occasionally post the link to the sponsor in the chat? If the sponsor isn't offering those kinds of ads, then why aren't people mad at the sponsors instead? Like, gatekeeping the kinds of ads you allow for your sponsorships sounds mad controlling to me, and I certainly would be pissed.

Obviously I'm not a streamer, so I'm not too knowledgeable about sponsorships and what not. But from what I can see, this all seems like aassive overreaction because Twitch is asking sponsors to not be the central focus of a stream.

That being said, I know I am in the very, very small minority, and I would like someone to try and explain to me why I should be mad that Twitch is asking for these changes. Why are they unreasonable? Why can't sponsors just adapt to the new changes? Are all the complaints justified and why are they justified?

Also first time posting to this sub. Sorry if I do anything wrong."

Mark my words, the removal of username number codes is going to mark the beginning of the end for what used to be one of the most revolutionary websites.

Seriously, why? It's not fair to people who need to have the same username. Like let's say I've been ""Mike"" for 5 years, and Mike is taken. Well congrats, now I have to come up with some cringy xXx_M1k3_xXx nonsense just to get an account. (And YouTube has already done something like this recently and I can't see much benefit from that either.)

The folks over at Discord clearly didn't think this through because now there's going to be a mad rush for desirable usernames. People are already selling these OG accounts because ""they have precious names"", which completely runs contrary to the intended spirit of Discord. There's like no reason to force unique usernames. It's already causing people with common usernames to get bombarded with friend requests. And there are already allegations of favoritism with how more common usernames are handed out. They refuse to even take an ounce of the stinking heap of constructive criticism at their doorstep into consideration.

It reminds me of Lee Kuan Yew telling the people of Singapore to just try a banana when asked what if they wanted to use chewing gum to concentrate.

But the main point is, it's not so much the specific update itself, as it is the mods' clear-as-day refusal to listen to the community. They're up there in their high towers making whatever changes *they* think are right without hearing from *us*. Sure, they throw us bones and the like by hopping onto Reddit and discussing ""feedback"" and so on, but it's similar to the way news articles often have comments sections, and it'll do nothing.

And as a result, ultimately I think Discord is committing virtual suicide with this move. That shitty little startup grew too big for its own good and now they're implementing dumb policies to justify their overblown valuation."

I believe following system would be better:

Imagine a parliament with 100 seats, 4 year term. Every month 2 seats are up for election and election is held. If there is region, state or district with more seats that 2, all seats are elected simultaneously and next election will wait an extra month to spread elections as evenly as possible. This means that every voter votes only once in 4 years are there are no nation wide elections just local region/state/district. 

Goal is simple. Smaller changes in parliament assembly that better reflect current views of the people. If there is some major concern for population now, they don't have to wait up to 4 years to see the change.

Also there isn't huge swings where left leaning parliament changes everything previous right leaning parliament did 4 years ago and then again pendulum swings to the opposite direction 4 years later. Changes are more lasting when they are done in small portions."

Now, the title might seem worse than it is at first glance. Let me elaborate.

What I mean by shipping in this case, is creating fan content that directly projects yourself into a story, in this case, a romantic/sexual story involving fictional teens. Most common way to do that, as I've seen, is /reader fanfiction, that's written in second person (you entered the room, you looked away, etc.). It's written predominantly by adults and consumed predominantly by adults. And not like.. 19-y-o adults, full grown ""pushing 30"" people, some older, some having families and kids of their own. 

Sometimes it's not just fanfics. Often it's outright those same grown adults thirstposting on their twitter, how they find fictional minors in question ""hot"" and ""sexy"" and how ""pixels do things to them"". So I don't think the argument that ""it's not supposed to be a self-insert!"" flies here. And while I am ready to believe some type of mental age-regression does happen when people read this type of content, it's still blatantly self-insert. *Your 30-y-o self are fantasizing about dating a kid*. 

**Learn to distinguish fiction from real life!**

Now, I don't believe that these people are automatically predators in real life. Nor am I virtue-signaling, trying to protect pixels. I *know* it's fiction. But I also believe fiction doesn't exist in a vacuum and it's always connected to real life. I know that when people like a piece of fiction a lot, they start noticing things that remind them of it in the real world. People *want to* project themselves onto fictional worlds and I think the role they pick to project onto matters. I wouldn't want my teenage son be looked at by a grown woman and let her think ""oh he reminds me of that anime boy I wrote smut about"". 

**Why I want my mind changed?**

I found myself in a fandom that heavily features teenage characters. Mind you, this isn't like Riverdale or Wednesday where adult actors portray highschoolers. This is a book/graphic novel, characters all have designs where they look their age. At the same time, this isn't exactly a YA novel, the target audience is not kids, even though it's perfectly suited for kids. The content of the series is also not mature by any means. 
If you change my mind, perhaps I will be able to scroll through relevant tags on social media and not cringe every time I see someone post horny stuff about a made-up 15-year-old. Because when I see those made-up 15-year-olds, I can't help but think of my little cousins and I can't *not* think it's weird. And I genuinely don't understand how anyone can see them as.. not kids. No matter how fictional they are and no matter how mature they act in the source material. 

P.S: I don't mind shipping between characters. To me that's like the author writing romance between young characters. It's exploring a trope. As long as nothing explicitly graphic happens, I think that's *perfectly fine*.

P.P.S.: Worth noting a weird double-standard I've noticed in general with this type of stuff. People seem a lot more okay with it (to the point of defending it) when it's women writing about fictional boys. If a man did the exact same with a fictional girl, it would be met with a completely different reaction.

The future isn't deterministic, you cannot determine the future, at most you could calculate all possible futures. But which future ends up happening is not the result of free will, but rather the result of random chance.

This belief stems from my, admittedly rather shallow, knowledge of quantum physics. When two particles interact there is a list of possible outcomes from this reaction. it's completely random which outcome happens. The human brain is made of these particles and as such the choices we make are determined by countless dice rolls.

In the end, my body could be boiled down to an equation. even though it is impossible for anyone to ever determine what this equation would be, it nevertheless does exist and a godlike being could use it to calculate all my possible future actions. Perhaps the list of future actions would contain trillions of possibilities, but it would never the less be finite and beyond my control.

For my view to change I need to be convinced that there is no equation that can predict the future, even if you were able to prove the the quantum physics equations aren't valid for this, you need to be sure it doesn't just kick the can down the road to another equation that solves the future a different way.

Before I understood quantum physics, I believed that Einstein's equations proved a deterministic future. one where the future is set in stone. 

As a result my view needs to be disconnected with mathematics somehow, or else I cannot see how free will could exist. The other option is to convince me that a life without free will isn't as depressing as I think it is.

I don't see how either are possible, which is why I'm here"
32,2023-06-08,CMV: Not attending/supporting an event does not mean that you are against said event,u/Doormau5,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/144a3vi/cmv_not_attendingsupporting_an_event_does_not/,changemyview,"So, I was talking to someone regarding the recent controversy regarding a teacher in Canada who berated her students for skipping school on a day when it hosted a Pride event.  The teacher in question was recorded chastising the students (who are Muslim for context) for skipping school on that day, saying that the students cannot  expect to be respected for their religion if they cannot extend the same courtesy to the LGBTQ community.   

While on its face I do agree with the teacher's sentiment, that respect is a two-way street, I cannot help but think that, in general, people should not be forced to attend events that they don't want to.  I believe that forcing people in this context would not only be a breach of personal liberty but also counter-productive since I think will breed resentment towards the event, instead of acceptance.

The person I was talking to disagreed and explained that by doing what they did, the students chose to take an active position against other kids, namely the LGBTQ students.  

This is the position that I take issue with and the topic of this CMV.

As I stated above, I believe that not attending/supporting an event does not mean that you are against said event.  To me, this makes no sense. 

There are plenty of events that I do not attend or support but that doesn't make me take an active position against these events.  

For example, I do not attend sports events.  Does that mean that I am taking an active position against sports?  Of course not, so why would it be any different in the above case?  

If I choose to not attend a cancer research event, does that mean I am taking an active position against curing cancer?  I don't  see how you could logically make that argument, so no.

Finally, I myself do not attend Pride events, but does that mean I am taking an active position against the LGBTQ community?  Absolutely not and I struggle to see how you could make that argument.

So anyways, that is my position and I am looking forward to the responses."
554,2023-06-08,CMV: justice would be best served if it were significantly easier to collect on judgements won in small claims court. This could include involuntarily charging their credit card or bank account.,u/RDMvb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/144adwy/cmv_justice_would_be_best_served_if_it_were/,changemyview,"My view that I would like challenged is that justice would be best served in the small claims court system in the US if it were significantly easier to collect on judgements won. The limit on small claims court is usually around $5,000- $7,500 in most states. Several times in my adult life, I have been involved in a dispute with another person that is under this limit where I have clearly been in the right. The details don't much matter for the purpose of this discussion, but it has mostly been contract disputes with small contractors around home improvements. Each time, the advice I've gotten from friends who are lawyers or lawyers that I have paid for a consultation is that it not worth pursuing the claim because even when you win, the defendant basically just gets a sternly worded letter asking them to pay. 

You might try to get a lien on their property, but if they don't own real property then this doesn't help and even if they do, nothing happens until they try to sell it, sometimes decades later. You could try to get a wage garnishment but this is very difficult and if the person is self employed it doesn't happen. The end result is that you can fairly easily screw someone out of their money up to $5,000 with no consequences.

I believe this is a miscarriage of justice and needs to change. Once a judgement is won, the courts should have the power to pull a defendant's credit report and see what bank accounts and credit cards they have, and to debit these accounts and send the money to the plaintiff. That way the plaintiff walks out of court with a check. The defendant should also be charged for related costs, such as the cost to pull a credit report and credit card transaction fees. 

I know this system is not perfect. Not everyone has credit cards and bank accounts and they could simply pull out the cash or close the credit card account if they know they are about to lose. But this would result in at least some more judgements successfully collected, which is most justice served. I also realize this would result in credit card companies being more selective about who they hand out credit to, but I can't really consider that a bad thing.

I would be interested in having this view changed. To successfully CMV, I would need to understand how justice is not served or how unintended consequences outweigh the benefits that I see here."

&#x200B;

I see 2 explanations for this.

&#x200B;

A. They think respondents are lying but are afraid to piss people off by saying so directly, or...

&#x200B;

B. They haven't heard of that particular poll.

&#x200B;

I don't think these explanations are as distinct as people make them out to be. If you expect respondents to tell the truth, wouldn't you consider it a worthy use of your time to look up what polls say on the subject, or at the very least, a worthy use of your podcast / radio listening time to pick podcasts or radio shows that frequently discuss polling? I don't even trust respondents to mean what they say and I do that anyway, because what respondents say takes on a significance all its own independently of whether or not they mean it.

&#x200B;

I want to start with the obvious: I hate Nazi's. On a personal level, they can all go to hell for all that I care. I hope every time someone displays a swastika in public, they face consequences for those actions from those around them.

But that being said, I don't think the answer is to make it illegal for individuals to share their views in a public space. It is easy to make these choices when it comes to something like a Nazi symbol, but allowing the government to ban any speech that is not posing an immediate threat is a dangerous precedent. For example, in the US, many politicians would love to ban the display of the pride flag and other symbols they consider to be, ""hateful."" If we allow whoever is currently in office to declare which symbols can be expressed and which statements can be made, I believe it establishes a dangerous precedent that could erode free speech in the long term. 

If a view is wrong, I believe it is on each of us to call that out in public, especially if you are not a part of the group that is the target of hate. Your workplace, family, and friends are all free to make choices about you based on what you say. But legislation is not the answer because it allows politicians to decide which views can be expressed and which cannot. Unless the speech poses an immediate threat to others (such as yelling fire in a crowded theatre, or calling for immediate violence), banning any form of speech is a bad idea in a free and fair society."

Gender identity is a big topic these days but with lots of conflicting ideas about rights and changeability of sexuality and gender. My point isn't so much about gender but more specifically about sexual attraction.

Part of the lawmaking for homosexual rights has been based on the argument that these individuals have no choice or chance of change in regards to their attraction. They can either act out their attraction to the same gender or go celebate, not something that the government should demand of people.

More recently as the discussion has moved away from homosexuality and on to gender identity not primarily defined by sexual attraction my impression is that the claims have changed. And I think the science backs that up.

My view:

I think that the brain is more plastic and changable than was claimed last century, that peoples attraction can change and is as much or more determined by cultural perception, personal experience, and gender identification than by inborn intincts. That means that it is possible for any individual to be bisexual, as long as the have the requisite experiences and mental changes.

Does that mean any homosexual can just change to be hetero? Not necessarily. We know it is really difficult to change many aspects of a person. There are many overweight people and addicted people that don't have their weight and addiction as identity factors that experience change to be impossible. I can understand that it may literally be impossible to a homosexual to change given their experiences and self identity.

That said I have heard many stories of individuals experience change in their sexual attraction, either from hetero to homo or vise versa, some ""naturally"" and others through dedicated ""effort."" I understand that anecdotes are not the basis for claims on the whole population, but have not been able to find any statistical studies on the nature/nurture aspect of homosexuality and have trouble changing before I can be presented with those.

Does this mean we can outlaw homosexuality because it isn't perfectly unchangeable? No I think society has progressed away from outlawing things based on norms and bias. Do whatever you want as long as it doesn't hurt people.

Would love to have my view changed, there is so much ideology and conflict around these topics it's hard to get to the biology of it all."

So if my guesstimate about political beliefs regarding guns in the rising generation are semi correct for a conservative university, then I would guess Gen Z and millennials as a whole are probably anti gun. My guesstimate also comes from these poll results.

According to the Harvard poll, about two thirds of Americans 18-30 want gun laws to be more strict and 58% support and assault rifle ban.

In the Pew poll from 2021, Hispanic persons support stricter gun control at a 65% rate while for white persons support it at a 45% rate, and Hispanics are the fastest growing ethnic minority in the US at this time. There is also a trend that urban and suburban voters support gun control more than rural voters and 18-30 year olds are a lot more likely to live in the city and the suburbs than in the country. Those who are more highly educated like those who went to grad school or graduated from an undergrad degree are more likely to support stricter gun control than those who graduated from high school only, and todays young adults are more highly educated than the young adults of 40 years ago.

0,2023-06-08,CMV: You should NEVER ask mutual friends about a specific person or to check on them,u/CEO_Of_Rejection_99,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/144i8zs/cmv_you_should_never_ask_mutual_friends_about_a/,changemyview,"I noticed a post on a relationship advice subreddit about a coworker who was avoiding the OP, and the top comment said OP should ""check on said friend through a mutual friend.""

This unlocked a realization in my head. I feel that I should NEVER ask mutual friends about a specific person or for advice on dealing with that person. Here's my reasoning, and correct me if I'm wrong:

If you're pursuing a romantic relationship with another person or are attracted to them, you should NEVER tell other people about your crush (at least, if you're not close with them) or otherwise get other people directly involved in the relationship, because it could make things awkward for the other person. In my experience, people tend to get riled up about crushes/potential romantic interests REALLY quickly. I have also unknowingly extended this logic to other interpersonal situations that are outside the strictly romantic realm as well. Therefore, crushes, and other interpersonal situations by extension, shall NEVER be released to your peers, and you have to take care of it by yourself.

I learned this the hard way during my high school crushes. Since I was young and didn't know of any alternative method to seek guidance, I told a lot of my peers (except the actual person I liked) that I had a crush on that person and asked them for advice. To be fair, I wasn't actually close with these people and only told them out of hope that they would leverage their connection with the person to get them to like me back or at least offer some advice as to how to pursue the relationship. This knowledge would eventually spread around and get back to the other person. This made things awkward for the other person and made them feel pressured. Some of these crushes would also later block me on social media.

This is why I become extremely uncomfortable and get wary of answering my friends if they ask if I have a crush on another person, regardless of whether or not I actually have a potential romantic interest in mind, even if they say they'll keep it confidential. I remember telling some of my peers ""please don't tell anyone else this"" when asking them for advice on my crushes (again, to be fair, I wasn't very close with them), and yet, other people would eventually know. I don't trust *anyone* outside of a very, very select few people to keep information secret. I fear my peers will use it as an opportunity to pry open my romantic life and pursue the relationship or set up the interpersonal situation for me, The other person may believe that I have recruited an army of my friends to try to force them to be with me and make them feel pressured.

I'm also wary of asking mutual friends for advice on dealing with another person since I fear receiving downright bad advice and falling prey to it. I remember during one of my high school crushes, when I asked a lot people for advice (as usual) and listened to advice that fit with my hopes of eventually dating her, while ignoring advice that went against these beliefs. It just so happened that I ended up following advice that was just downright bad, such as obsessing from afar, treating the situation as a competition with other potential romantic interests, and getting other people involved, while I ignored advice that would have actually been useful, such as moving on.

I also fear that asking mutual friends for advice would present me as ""weak"", unconfident, and unable to handle crushes and other non-romantic social situations myself, and therefore someone no one should date or otherwise be close friends with. People usually say the following in terms of pursuing a romantic relationship: why would you do all this work of telling a bunch of people about your crush and trying to recruit an army of friends to build the relationship for you, when you could just go up and bite the bullet by talking to your crush and asking them out? If you spend all your time and energy asking a bunch of people about dealing with your crush, you're just circumventing the problem by obsessing from afar and not getting anywhere, and you could just use that same energy to ask them out. Girls want boys who are confident and therefore can handle crushes. Therefore, if you ask mutual friends for advice on crushes/interpersonal situations, you are not confident and therefore you are not relationship material.

Please change this view. I feel that this view should be changed I may have a strong network of friends but I believe this view is preventing me from using it to its full potential. I feel like I have to carry a huge burden in interpersonal relationships with little to no guidance and risking messing things up without having outside opinions/judgment to guide me and therefore feeling better not doing anything at all. It just feels like a missing part of my interpersonal relationships/interpersonal situations. It just feels wrong to have a support system that could potentially be useful but also something I refuse to use. I could seek advice from parents/my therapist/random internet strangers on Reddit, but while I don't think they're incorrect and I don't mean this as a personal offense to them, I feel that they're ""out of touch"" from my perspective mainly because they're older than me and may not know me personally or be relatable as much as someone my own age.

Not knowing if accounts are real is an issue to a decent degree. Not really to me but I see people constantly getting baited by it. Not the worst but not great. Seemed like that’s the biggest worry people had coming into the change

The real issue, however, is with replies

With the prioritization of blue check marks replies coming first they’ve single handedly ruined the best feature on Twitter. Ever popular tweet will have hundreds of people who don’t post anything remotely entertaining and just payed their way to get there in front of tons of much more interesting and at times useful tweets from people who don’t pay

I know it might not sound like that big of a deal but it makes Twitter so much less enjoyable I’m considering stopping using it for that reason alone"

Murder, child murder, particularly horrific sex crimes etc. 

I also feel no sympathy for those who commit crimes abroad, fully aware of the draconian laws that exist within those territories, and subsequently face the death penalty.

I think people who’s executions are carried out humanely and with minimal suffering are lucky. A death sentence is the sanctioned taking of your life by a state, minimal suffering should be the goal but when this doesn’t happen, it’s just unfortunate for the executed party and nothing more. 

For context I’m 24, not religious and from the UK. I would bring back the death penalty here in a heartbeat if I could, we have a real knife crime epidemic at the moment. 

I’d also like to add I only support the death penalty in clear cut cases with an abundance of evidence, I appreciate the finality of capital punishment and believe crimes without irrefutable video evidence should result in a life sentence."

A) most people won't and B) that's not going to make a huge impact. Oh you're gonna make your sub go private? Eventually the admins will just remove and replace the mods. 

But what could hurt reddit's advertising value more than anything? That's right; the crazy offensive content that Reddit has tried to minimize. If you want to protest reddit's changes, coordinate with your favorite subs to mass upvote content from specified offensive subs, forcing some advertisers to leave the site entirely.

EDIT: People have pointed to certain flaws with my specific proposal. Primarily, people may be unwilling to upvote offensive content and sexually explicit content might not get to r/popular. Here's some slight alternatives:

Upvote content that insults any advertisers on Reddit.

Upvote Furry content.

Upvote r/conspiracy."

88,2023-06-10,CMV: Extraterrestrials have not visited Earth.,u/someoctopus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1468rqs/cmv_extraterrestrials_have_not_visited_earth/,changemyview,"I want to believe aliens have visited Earth as much as anyone else, but there are so many factors that make no logical sense to me.

1. Most UAPs are sighted near US military bases. Isn't it possible, if not likely, that many UAPs are classified US military operations? After all, we know today that many UAP sightings from the 60s-70s did turn out to be US military operations.

2. If aliens traveled to Earth, that would unquestionably imply that they are masters of space travel. I find it hard to believe that such masters of space travel, possibly millions of years advanced to humans, would _ever_ crash, let alone multiple times on the same planet. This causes me to dismiss immediately any claim that we have recovered alien vehicles.

3. Most supposed footage and/or photos of UAPs or aliens are grainy, blurry and leave so much up to interpretation. Literally everyone has a high quality camera on their person these days. Why are all these photos of such poor quality?

4. Most people claiming aliens or UAPs have visited fail to produce direct, indisputable, evidence. For example, David Grusch recently claimed he talked to individuals that claim to work on alien tech. David never saw said tech. David didn't say who his friends were. To me, it's possible David is confused or lying, or, more likely, his sources are confused or lying. For example, his sources might _think_ they worked on alien tech that crashed on US soil, when in reality they worked on Russian/Chinese tech that crashed on US soil. It seems to me that the Pentagon probably employ a 'need-to-know' policy. David's friend may not have been told where the tech originated from because that is not 'need-to-know' information. If an official can complete their tasks without certain information, then they won't get that information. This reduces the risk of leaks. David's friends may have incorrectly assumed/concluded they worked on alien tech. 

5. Do you really think Bill Clinton could keep aliens a secret? The man couldn't keep his affair a secret.  Do you really think the US government is organized enough to keep aliens a secret for 5+ decades, through multiple democrat and republican administrations? The number of people that would need to cooperate would be in the thousands, and they each would have a strong motive to leak. 

I can list more points that make it tough for me to buy all these UAP stories. But, I'll stop there and ask, how do believers rationalize with the above points?"

In both school and college I was a nerd. I was obsessed with scoring high grades, and I often had the best grades of my class. I read a book and repeated that many many times until I got everything stuck in my memory. I crammed all that information into myself a few days before we had an exam. And it worked, I often scored a 10 out of 10. People were like ""you're so smart"" when in reality, I just put alot more time and effort into studying than my classmates did. Does that mean I'm super motivated and that is a good thing? Not really, because now that I'm a young adult, I realize alot of that studying was a waste of my time and energy. I don't even remember most of what I studied so hard years ago.

Reason 1: you can study something alot and score a perfect grade, but years later you might still completely forget it. If I have to redo all my college exams now, which I have passed, then I would fail most of them unless I study again

Reason 2: scoring perfect grades in college doesn't mean you're smart, and doesn't mean you understand the job/field you are preparing for. I have graduated from college with alot of high grades, and still at the moment of graduating, I had this ""how the fuck am I supposed to do this job"" question in my head. I was still clueless to how to do the job that I studied so hard for, for 3 years.

So, I have a history of high grades, yet it hasnt helped me at all. I forgot most of the things that I had scored so high on during my study years. Seriously, what benefit do these high grades of the past give me?"

0,2023-06-10,CMV: Media Quality is Entirely Subjective,u/00PT,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/146e50i/cmv_media_quality_is_entirely_subjective/,changemyview,"# Context

For a while, I thought the statement indicated in the title was a universally accepted thing. And it seems like it is in specific spaces of the internet. But every now and then, I'll come across people that either attack or defend some movie, trope, book, etc., from what appears to be an objective lens. This has been happening a lot in Marvel subreddits recently, where someone will assert that they didn't like a movie such as ""Into the Spiderverse"" (or its recent sequel), and they'll be massively downvoted with multiple replies talking about how they're just wrong, listing all the good things about the movie and making it clear that they dismiss the original opinion. This happens regardless of whether the original commenter gave explanations or not.

Perhaps more infamous examples come from the other side of things - media criticism. Take movies such as ""The Emoji Movie."" Generally not liked, but those who dare to mention that they do like it have a lesser position in discussion simply due to that statement. There are also several long and rant-like video essays about specific films where criticism is the main focus. [This](https://youtu.be/U__oaZ9FiXM) is possibly the most infamous due to its sheer length and the general attitude of the guy narrating. **I do not expect you to watch this entire video to engage with this post.** You should be able to see that by just watching for a few minutes. This type of video always ends up being interpreted as objective, especially when considering the nature of the big claims they make. The one I linked seems to paint the director of ""Toy Story 4"" as some kind of villain, or at least directly malicious towards the franchise. All because this particular person didn't happen to like what they created.

Normally, I would mark this all off as hyperbole, humor, or assertiveness. After all, I'm not the best at judging the intention behind statements, even in casual conversation, and I tend to avoid it whenever possible. It seems that since a default English statement without certainty modifiers is interpreted as a statement of fact (You don't need to say, ""It is a fact that the sky is blue,"" for example, ""The sky is blue"" has the same meaning), a statement can seem more confident than it actually is a lot of the time. However, I've seen comments that outright **say** this is an objective thing. One such message linked directly to [this video](https://youtu.be/W-LrCEkgssU), which I think allowed me to understand the point of art objectivity as a legitimate position the most thoroughly out of anything else I've been exposed to. I still feel like I'm missing some parts of the picture, however. Hence, this CMV post.

It's possible that I'm just completely mistaken about this premise.

# Explaining The Opposition

In the previously linked [video](https://youtu.be/W-LrCEkgssU), the main point appears to be something along the lines of ""Whether you like or dislike an art piece is subjective, but I can objectively say specific things about it which constitute good or bad quality."" To illustrate, I will provide some examples (**note that I do not necessarily agree with everything stated here. It is meant to represent a viewpoint opposed to my own.**):

The other [video](https://youtu.be/U__oaZ9FiXM) I linked, the 6 hour one on Toy Story 4, spends a significant part of that time talking about how plot points don't make sense or that the animation doesn't reflect what actually happens in canon. It can objectively be said that this breaks immersion, as it makes the world less believable, reminding us that we're watching something made up when the preference is that we *feel* it is real.

Another central point is deemed ""Character Assassination,"" which describes how certain characters display behavior that is both superficially and philosophically contrary to their initially established traits or previous development. For example, Jesse is shown to be anxious when placed in a dark and small space (a closet), which would make sense in the context of her original introduction, but does not when you consider a short film released afterward where she seemed to overcome this phobia. Objectively, those who liked where the character has got to at this point would be disappointed by the change.

A third point is that the film communicates problematic messages during certain parts. For example, the protagonists generously forgive the villain and allow her to get her way, despite said villain not earning this forgiveness in any way and having no right to the item she needs to accomplish her goals. Objectively, this could influence people to tolerate abusers, enabling them to continue causing harm.

For a positive example, many films are praised for their emotional core, making the characters internally conflicted and bringing a lot of the focus onto this fact. Some even bring the position to the point of saying that this is *the* reason that stories work in general and that every good narrative has this aspect.

# My Position

While I might agree with a specific point being made (for example, I accept that keeping a story logically consistent increases immersion), I do not think that these points objectively translate into some measure of ""quality.""

The definition of ""quality"" that best fits my view can be found in Oxford Languages: ""the standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind; the degree of excellence of something,"" or, as Mirriam Webster more concisely puts it, ""degree of excellence.""

This makes the term inherently a measure of how ""good"" something is, meaning there needs to be some standard to define what is good and bad for a piece of media in order to successfully argue my point that ""Media Quality is Entirely Subjective"" or its opposite, ""Media Quality is Entirely Objective."" That's where the opposition falls apart, in my view.

See, different audiences have different standards for this. Some people want an emotional narrative first and foremost, while others just want to see action or a flashy presentation. Still others prefer something that challenges them intellectually or explores a specific philosophy through a story. As previously alluded to, I've seen people explicitly say that *all* good stories have some central emotional conflict and that this will make a story work regardless of how interesting or exciting the actual premise is as long as you make good use of plot devices to show off the emotions. Yet, others will confidently tell you that a good premise and plot is the most critical part of media appeal. Some people only want to be immersed in the works they consume, while others cherish the idea of a fourth wall break, which fractures the immersion, usually for comedic purposes.

Even positions that seem to be incredibly basic, such as the idea that a protagonist should have at least one likable trait, however small, to make us care about them, are not universally accepted. I've seen people directly claim they don't have to be likable, they don't even have to try. That as long as there is some kind of internal conflict that is clear to the audience, they will tolerate your story.

The thing is, all of these positions make their arguments well. Looking at the elaborations for pretty much every argument I've seen, I can certainly see why a person would value this one quality of a media piece and view others as less important. It's all relative to their standards, which, while I may agree with one set more than another, are all equally valid.

""This thing decreases my immersion"" only translates to ""This thing makes the media worse quality"" if you accept that a lack of immersion indicates ""bad quality."" For some people, this is irrelevant or even beneficial to the overall experience, depending on their standards for the media they consume.

# Messaging

But what about when media sends messages that can be said to be objectively bad? The third example I used earlier, about the villain of Toy Story 4 being forgiven without ever earning it or having a right to get what they want, might fit this category. No matter if someone can get entertainment from that movie, it can be said that the messaging it sends makes it overall worse in quality.

This is the position that has got the closest to changing my view that media quality is *entirely* subjective, but it hasn't actually been able to do that. This is because I view the actual act of taking some message away from the media you consume as subjective. Depending on how someone feels during consumption and how they interpret the underlying meanings behind the stimulus they are given, they could come to wildly different conclusions about the messaging of a particular art piece. A lot of this is the point - The creator doesn't force one ""correct"" interpretation but allows their piece to be freely discussed, felt, and interpreted in a variety of ways. I don't think the originally intended meaning matters any more than another meaning someone can think up.

There's also the idea that mere exposure to another perspective is not necessarily wrong in and of itself. People should be able to think critically about what those around them say, and simply censoring it from their view doesn't really accomplish that.

# Conclusion

None of this is telling you that you can't dislike a movie or book based on some trait it has or what you consider it to be saying, but to claim that this is an objective flaw in the quality of the media is being blind to all the nuances of people who all have different standards and interpret things differently. I also believe that both positive and negative opinions on the same piece of media should be freely allowed in the same space with no visibility manipulation in favor of one or the other.

Like or dislike what you want, but don't claim that others are wrong for doing the same about their own standards and preferences."

second, i’d like to preface this by saying that i’m not a fan of the democratic party, finding it too beholden to corporate interests, a fealty it likes to disguise by making shallow overtures to various identities (LGBT, black community, latinos, etc.) that mask its corporatist nature. 

i consider myself rather far to the left, a socialist in the sense that, like orwell, i desire a humane society in which all people are treated equally and afforded a chance to live a happy and fruitful life. i am obviously of the mind that such a world does not exist at the moment, and believe the primary reason that world is so remote from our reality is the conservative/far right movement in America.

i would also like to add that i am referring to the american right, knowing full well that rightist philosophy has a concerning foothold in many other western nations. i am focusing on the american right because they exist within the most powerful country in the world, wielding enough influence on our culture and policy to have an  effect on the world and the people inhabiting this global community. 

i am firmly of the mind that humanity would take a leap forward of immeasurable length if the american right didn’t exist. why?

- anti-intellectualism and anti-science are critical components of their belief system. american conservatives oppose an educated populace, for an informed public is a critically thinking one, a mass of curious and thoughtful men and women who seek the answers to the questions that lie at the heart of our understanding of one another and this world we occupy. the right in america continues to deny, in the face of incontrovertible evidence, the existence of climate change. whether it’s because of how corrupted it’s become under the influence of the fossil fuel industry or an actual belief that climate change is a manufactured crisis, the right rejects the proven science underlying the gravest threat humanity has faced since the advent of nuclear weaponry. 

- the right’s denial of the science that definitively proves the existence of climate change, and their wholesale refusal to work with democrats to craft sound policy that addresses this crisis, poses an existential threat that MUST be confronted at some point in the near future if we mean to rescue civilization from the cliff it now dangles over. 

- covid was the most recent example of how the anti-intellectualism and anti-science underpinnings of rightist thought is existential in nature. because of their refusal to accept the reality of covid and the various means with which we could protect ourselves and prevent it from spreading - masks, vaccines, social distancing, etc. - an unnecessarily high number of american citizens died, causing damage to our economy that we have yet to recover from. 

- the right is engaged in a full scale assault on schools and libraries, the institutions we entrust to help shape the minds of our children. removing books that address subject matter that would make our children more informed and empathetic guarantees a bleak future of citizens without a grasp of history and a context within which to process a proper response to our most pressing issues. 

- guns continue to be a scourge on our nation. i don’t necessarily support a ban on firearms, largely because i don’t think it would be practical at this point. but i know there are several common sense solutions that would certainly lower the level of carnage taking place. sadly, conservatives oppose any measure that addresses responsible gun ownership, finding it an infringement on their supposed right to bear arms. because of it, mass shootings are now so common as to become a mundane fact of life, no longer eliciting the shock it once did even a decade ago. 

- bigotry is at the core of rightist thought. an irrational hatred of anyone who is not straight, white and christian (although, many of them are atheists, too, i’ll admit) has always been a fundamental pillar of the rightist platform in america. whether it’s directed at black people, hispanic immigrants, muslims, or gays, the conservative movement in america thrives of dividing the public along these lines and ginning up hostility towards marginalized groups. 

there’s plenty more i could write, but i’m not interested in composing an essay. i certainly don’t know what the answer is, though i believe society must find a solution to american conservative problem at some point if we mean to not just survive, but thrive as a civilization of people who live together in peace and work towards a brighter future in which all of us lead fulfilling and enriching lives."

To want to monopolize traction over a product they create, when they’re not yet profitable and others have been leeching for free / in a manner that only makes them profitable, doesn’t sound like much of a dick move to me and more in line with what any other company does.

With the rapid evolution of AI, ChatGPT might only be the beginning of their problems and they might need to secure their brand before it’s too late.

I get that mods are upset, they are also contributing a lot for free - but is it really as bad as it seems? Can there not be some faith that they improve the mod experience?

The blackout seems half like an egotistical move to me - „If we can’t moderate the way we want - we don’t give much of a fuck anyways“ - and play authoritarian over activities which hundreds of thousands of people enjoy.

It’s an abuse of power. You don’t just boycott something yourself - You force everyone else to, either, whether they want to or not.

6,2023-06-11,CMV: AI Art is not Inherently Evil,u/PeoplePerson_57,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/146svti/cmv_ai_art_is_not_inherently_evil/,changemyview,"I've been speaking to a friend recently who is an artist, and she's been of the opinion that AI generated art is 'inherently' evil. Having discussed it with her, I'm really not sure why she sees it that way.

I have dyspraxia, and having spent years trying to practice drawing and art, digitally and physically, the best I can produce has been barely comparable to what your average 11 year old can do with little effort. I DM tabletop games for my friends, and in the past I've commissioned artists to create visual images of what I imagine certain characters or places to look like. From my perspective, I'm doing the majority of the creative legwork, and the artist is mostly translating the information I give them into an image.

AI image generation, for me, has been an accessibility tool. It has allowed me to relatively quickly and inexpensively transfer my mental image into a visual other people can see, and though it does lack some of the creative spark of the commission artist that would otherwise have created it, it serves its purpose just fine. AI image generation makes relatively 'fine' looking art accessible to many people for very little cost, when previously it would have required paying an artist a small sum to have your mental image translated to a visual one.

I don't really understand why a lot of people rail against AI art as some kind of fundamentally 'bad' thing, and I'd like to see some of the reasons people view it that way, which is why I'm here.

Things that will not CMV (feel free to make points along or adjacent to these, but know that I've considered them before and do not typically find them convincing:

- Anything along the lines of copyright infringement and theft. This is a pretty simple one, because I already agree this is bad, but the issue lies in the execution of the AI, not inherent to its concept

- Negative externalities. These kinds of arguments around commission artists losing their work and having to find other jobs are the same arguments luddites made about the spinning jenny. Unless you can explain why this particular labour saving device is uniquely inherently immoral in comparison to every other one in the past, arguments coming from the negative externalities of artists' labour being devalued are unlikely to convince me

So, without further ado, CMV!"

In bipartisan election systems it's usually clear that the way to uproot corruption is to reconstruct the domineering parties, whereas multi-party ones' plan is just to elect someone new which doesn't work well for the aforementioned reasons.
The revolutionary underdogs' existence, which may or may not be a significant selling point, doesn't seem to amount to much if they don't gain noteworthy power.

The facts of the case are that Harvard is being accused of discriminating against Asian applicants in two ways: first, by requiring Asians to have a higher SAT score in order to be considered for admission (than other races) and secondly, by assigning a lower ""personality score"" to Asian applicants than other races.

Now, it's not ideal for Harvard to have to resort to such practices. But the alternative is that Harvard would wind up with a student body that's 40% Asian. How is that ideal, and how does that benefit other students or diversity as a whole?

Let's look at the University of California system for an example. Decades ago, Californian voters abolished race-conscious affirmative action via referendum. The result was that Asians shot way up in college admissions at the UCs while black, Hispanic and other students fell in representation. (If I recall correctly, universities like UCLA and Berkley became 30-40% Asian.)

Admissions is a zero-sum affair; every college has limited seats. You admit more of one race, and the other races must necessarily fall behind and be less represented. Given the benefits that diversity has to offer for student learners, how can a (hypothetical) Harvard student body of 40% Asians, 50% whites, and 10% all other races possibly be more beneficial for the learners (and society overall) than something like 15% Asians, 50% whites, and 35% everyone else?

It should also be pointed out that Asians are already way over-represented even **with** affirmative action (they are only 6% of America's population but are already represented at around 20% in the Ivy Leagues.) If anything, Asian students should be held to an even *tougher* standard than they currently are, so that their representation can plummet down to something more suitable like 10-12% (which would **still** be over-representation.)

So, how else is Harvard supposed to achieve a diverse student body **without** resorting to tactics like making Asian students score higher on the SAT than other racial groups? Bear in mind that many other racial groups, such as African-American students, suffer from growing up in poverty or dysfunctional families in a way that many Asian-American students do not."

8,2023-06-11,CMV: True patriotism lies in celebrating our country's achievements while also acknowledging and addressing areas that need improvement,u/kkin1995,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/146xu0r/cmv_true_patriotism_lies_in_celebrating_our/,changemyview,"Hello r/changemyview,

I am writing as an Indian citizen who is extremely proud of my nation's accomplishments, many of which have positioned us as a global leader in certain sectors. Take for example, our Unified Payments Interface (UPI) or the RuPay card systems that have revolutionised the way we handle digital payments and is now being adopted by other countries too, or our indigenously built Vande Bharat trains that showcase our advancements in railway technology.

At the same time, I feel it is equally important for us to acknowledge and address certain infrastructural challenges. I do not see this as a criticism but rather as a necessity for continuous growth. Take for example, wheelchair accessibility and public transport services. Acknowledging and addressing issues in these domains can greatly enhance the quality of life of many fellow citizens.

In fact we have the standards and laws already existing in the Constitution. The issue seems to be with the implementation of such standards and laws. For instance, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 can make public spaces more inclusive and people with disabilities more independent. I also understand that these laws have already been implemented in many places, however, such implementations is neither wide-spread nor fully completed. 

Similarly, improving public transport facilities can increase connectivity and provide a reliable, safe and affordable means of transport to many Indians. Now, improvements to Public Transport is already in motion such as the implementation of electric buses and the pilot projects of tap and pay systems in many bus services. However, if you notice, there is a hesitation in adoption of technology by public transport agencies. For example, the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC), which is a commendable initiative by the Prime Minister, has only started being implemented in the recent past despite being introduced years ago. Why is there a delay in such promising implementations?  Why is our public transport agencies hesitant to use Google Maps for live timetables like the Indian Railways has done and instead opt for developing an expensive and sub-par application that serves only one agency.

The intention here is not to undermine the accomplishments we have made. On the contrary, it is to use our national and international achievements as motivation to address other areas that require our attention.

To my fellow Indians, I would like to suggest that our love for our country can be expressed not only by celebrating our national and international achievements, but also by acknowledging and addressing areas that need improvement. This way, we can collectively contribute to the all-round development of our country.

Looking forward to hearing your valuable insights and perspectives and if there are issues with my argument, please point them out and change my view.

Thank you for reading."

My friends are totally crazy, I have received pleas from at least two to try to buy tickets in the line, because these tickets are so hot and the prices are so low, that there will be millions of people trying to buy them.

Same is happening in America in the Eras Tour. Bloomberg reports:

[Taylor Swift Helps Chicago Book Most Hotel Rooms on Record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-07/taylor-swift-helps-chicago-book-most-hotel-rooms-on-record)

[A Recession? In Taylor's Economy? You Need to Calm Down](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-05-21/it-s-taylor-swift-s-economy-and-consumers-are-happy-to-spend)

(Taylor Swift Fans Have to Barter, Borrow and Plead to Get Into Her Shows)[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-26/taylor-swift-eras-tour-teaches-fans-supply-and-demand-basics]

Here's an excerpt from the last issue:

> Swift will hold three events this weekend at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and some of the cheapest tickets start at around $1,000 in the resale market. With a stadium capacity of 82,500, up to a quarter-million people will watch her perform in a single weekend.
> The Swift tour provides a real-world lesson in the mechanics of supply and demand like no Milton Friedman textbook ever could. Much like Wall Street stockbrokers after a hot initial public offering, people who had scored multiple Swift tickets through Ticketmaster — you might call them scalpers; others prefer to think of them as capitalists — quickly found buyers for their assets. Most sellers were able to recover their initial investment and make a handsome profit, with some fans paying thousands of dollars for tickets that had originally sold for as little as $49 plus fees.

What I think they should do (and that's generally, for every hot concert)? A (sealed bid, second highest)[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction] , where basically every person says what is the highest price they're willing to pay. If they're selling 100,000 tickets, the 100,001st highest bid is the price everyone will pay for their tickets.

I see many benefits.

1- It's easier to true fans to buy. Here in Brazil a lot of swifters posted images saying that if you ""just like"" Taylor Swift this concert isn't for you, you should know a lot of trivia about it. If you really care about Taylor Swift and wants to go to the concert, you can cut consumption elsewhere in life, you can work a bit more (if you're a teenager, you can get a summer job to pay for the tickets), and you have better agency, rather than being left to luck and the ticketmaster website. Imagine telling your kids you worked two months during summer to go to her concert. (My father has a similar story, but in 1968 and with Brazilian country music. He at age 9 worked 3 days as a shoeshine boy to buy the tickets to a concert he really wanted to go. And we went. And to this day he's very proud)

2- You remove scalpers, that are just lucky bastards. 

3- The scalpers profits go to the artist. If someone's to profit from Taylor Swift popularity, it'd rather be Taylor herself.

4- There's less economic waist, including less carbon emissions. Given the unpredictable nature of the ticket buying process, it's very likely some Philadelphia folks only could buy tickets in Chicago and some Chicago folks only could buy tickets in Philadelphia. You can see how much unnecessary travel there was because of the concerts."

The performative speeches and chants always gain a lot of attention and so do the riots and protests, but they do not lead to real material change . The AA community is still economically worse off relative to population size , the wealth gap is still here, incarceration rates are still high, gun violence and gang activity is still rampant within inner city or low income AA communities. All of the problems still persist. 

My basic point is that unlike the 1900s where protests and riots were directed at explicit laws and practices that were incredibly immoral and obviously wrong, the protests of the recent decades are not productive and are not leading to any true changes."

This film with a run time of two and a half hours spends that entire time setting up plot points without ever resolving them. The movie feels like the first five episodes of a series rather than a movie telling one story. The ending of the movie revealing Miles is the Prowler in this universe with a ""to be continued"" is frankly eye-roll worthy. Setting up an entire new plot thread right at the end of the movie after resolving 0 of the threads that the movie set up. So many things are left unresolved.

Why is Miguel a vampire and what really happened in the universe he went to?

What will happen with Spot?

What's up with Miles being the prowler in universe 42?

How will Miles be able to resist the Miguel's men?

Will Miles be able to save his dad? 

Etc. etc.

Lack of plot aside, the main characters don't go through any sort of growth. Gwen's dad making up with her after all this time comes from changes he made off screen, and Miles telling his not-mom that he's Spiderman doesn't matter. Miles' parents don't have any sort of agenda against Spiderman. The one time they cross paths is when Miles' dad and him talk. It's not like it is with Gwen and her father. So why is it a big deal that Miles decides to share that he's spiderman? What's he actually risking there?

Given all that, when it came time for the 5th action sequence of Miles swinging around for 10 minutes, I was thinking, how are they going to conclude anything? The answer is that they didn't.

The movie was visually impressive. The gags were funny. The character moments were touching, but with all the payoffs reserved for the 2nd movie, I left feeling like I watched one half of a 5 hour movie, an incomplete experience."

An audio version can be found at the start of the thread)

The school involved subsequently released a statement that talked about diversity but didn’t specifically mention the specific categories targeted by the rant: https://twitter.com/5Pillarsuk/status/1666009370130259970 (linking is not an endorsement of the Twitter accounts involved)

My view is that the teacher used the student’s religion, immigration status and race as leverage in the discussion, and that it was wrong for the teacher to do so.

It should go without saying, but non-Muslim, non-immigrant, non-POC individuals can also be opposed to gay rights, transgender rights, or inclusion themed events, and just because a Muslim, immigrant, POC individual skipped an event, we shouldn’t assume that it’s because the individual was Muslim, immigrant, or POC. Also, while we don’t know what happened before the rant, I think it exceedingly unlikely that the student said “I avoided the event because it goes against the colour of my skin”, so I don’t think the student mentioned the colour of their skin first.

In the rant the teacher threatened the student with not “doing” Ramadan, whatever that means, and suffering prejudice for their religion, and suffering prejudice for their colour of skin, with not being Canadian, and not being “here” (most likely Canada based on the context, as opposed to the school).

These are threats that can be made against a Muslim, perceived to be immigrant, POC individual that couldn’t be made against a Canadian of non-immigrant background. Where would a Canadian of non-immigrant background be deported to, for example?

The teacher thought that because of the student’s minority status, she could control them like a marionette. That’s repugnant.

I’m not touching the teacher-student relationship of this because it’s often regarded as normal for schools and teachers to instil certain beliefs and values into students, it’s largely what the beliefs and values are that’s disputed, or the manner in which it’s done.

If the teacher had merely said that Islamophobia is bad and that homophobia is also bad, I could understand the logic, but I would still find it rather pointed, and would rather the teacher not mention anything related to the student’s background at all.

I regard racism as bad, and oppose it unconditionally rather than only on a transactional basis.

Regarding Canada being a bad choice of country to immigrate to if you’re anti-LGBT: even if immigration were solely done on ideological alignment, the student in question probably wasn’t responsible for choosing which country to immigrate to - if they were an immigrant.

To pre-empt some criticisms: yes, wagging school is bad, and yes, homophobia and transphobia are bad. Also, it’s not known what was said before this rant or afterwards, and no I’m not calling for this teacher to be fired - maybe the teacher had a bad day at the office. While some may feel religion doesn’t deserve protection because it’s a “choice”, skin colour definitely isn’t. Also, while my view currently feels obvious to me, a lot of people are siding with the teacher, as can be seen by many of the comments in the two /r/edmonton threads about the incident, or even with the other CMV post on this rant where the OP agreed that “tolerance is a two-way street”. https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/144a3vi/cmv_not_attendingsupporting_an_event_does_not/

I believe that if you took a dude who grew up in the hood, or any poor area, a dude who grew up in a trailer park, if you take them to an average suburban area they will feel like they don’t belong because the society isn’t the same culture as theirs, on top of that most poor cultures believe that middle class/rich people are working against them, which just makes the idea of moving to a suburban area less appealing to someone in a poor area. They will feel like they are betraying their culture and most poor cultures will insult them or berate them and call them a traitor if they do admit to wanting to move to a better area with a better culture. 

I don’t know the solution but I think this is the biggest disconnect between poor cultures and “rich” cultures and the reason why so many people stay in poverty. Change my view."

Even the greatest intellect can be silenced by physical injuries or deprivation of life resources (clean air, food, water, etc). Also, there's no ""goodness"" for the dead, meaning there's also no ""better"". ""Goodness"" does mean ""a positive state of affairs"", after all. So if something's dead then it can't experience anything at all, let along positivity.  True, there's also no badness when dead, but it's still no state of goodness / positivity.

By contrast, a living 0.1 IQ creature can still experience positive states despite low intelligence. Thus, it's better to be stupid but with high independent survivability than to be smart and low independent survivability.

Now to the specific human/alligator comparision.

\*Gators by far, *far,* ***far*** outpower, outswim, and even outrun a human. Even with modern handheld civilian weapons it's fairly difficult for multiple humans to kill a gator.  Even those weapons aren't exactly easily built from basic camping materials.

\*Gators, being ""cold blooded"", require less food per kg of body weight than humans; as ""warm-bloodeds"" in general demand more calories per pound. That lets gators survive longer without food than humans, at least in the food-to-body-mass ratio sense.

True, alligators can't survive well in long-freezing regions, but there's plenty of tropical and subtropical areas for them to live in, which is of little relevance here. Even human's can't survive ""ordinary chilly winter days"" without clothing and in any case prefer similar temperature ranges to an alligator's natural activity range.

\*Gators are survivors. They've been around for 300 million years, which means they survived the great dinosaur-killer despite their large size. Humans, by contrast, have been around only 50K to 300K years -depending on your standard for ""human"". Yet we barely survived a ""mere"" supervolcano eruption 70,000 years ago (the Toba eruption in what is now Indonesia).

In all these respects, alligators are superior at survival to humans. Thus it's better to alligator than be a human - unless you wish to say that intelligence is better than survivability, or that stupidity is worse than physical fragility."

I don’t think it’s a specific thing like people seem to think it is and then dwell on. I think that they then feel more poorly as they don’t get the help that they need and over focus on things everyone experiences like dry skin , and blame fibro.

1,2023-06-11,CMV: Legal brothels in Nevada do not provide opportunities to vulnerable sex workers on the streets and therefore don't help them.,u/PM_ME_KITTYNIPPLES,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/147aqtv/cmv_legal_brothels_in_nevada_do_not_provide/,changemyview,"These are my main arguments:

1. To work legally as a prostitute in Nevada, you must be hired by a brothel. Since there are so few legal brothels, hiring is competitive and sex workers that are more vulnerable, minorities, and unpopular demographics are more likely to be excluded (transgender individuals, people of color, men, etc.).
2. To work legally as a prostitute in Nevada, you must pay a licensing fee and undergo a background check. This excludes poor sex workers and those that have previously been arrested. It closes the door to most of those working on the streets. Also, anyone working as a prostitute that is a non-citizen and was trafficked into the country would be ineligible. 
3. Legal brothels are heavily monitored and have a lot of health and safety measures in place, but if someone trying to purchase the services of a prostitute is turned away, they're unlikely to just give up. Some travel to Nevada specifically to purchase the services of a prostitute, and they're not going to just throw the money and time they spent away. These problematic customers, whether they refused to wear a condom or acted aggressively, will find another illegally working prostitute that can't turn them away. It increases demand for illegal prostitution because some seekers of legal prostitution will inevitably be turned away. 

Things that would change my view:

1. If someone could give me a definitive source that the background checks for legal prostitutes do not disqualify those that have previously been arrested for prostitution or drug possession, or that there is a simple way to have the record of those crimes wiped off your record in Nevada. 
2. If someone could provide examples of men or transgender individuals that have been hired by legal brothels in Nevada."

As well as/or going to therapy. My general stance toward medication is: only if necessary/if the rewards outweigh the risks. So in general I think people are overmedicated, but when it comes to neurobiological disorders such as ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar, medication cannot just be ignored.

ADHD is correlated with a plethora of negative outcomes, anything from car accidents to crime (this is common sense, if someone needs a dopamine rush they are more likely to do these things). However, I believe the modern capitalist system requires ADHD/ADHD like personalities, because it is a perpetual bubble and needs unnecessary and perpetual consumption.

People with ADHD/subclinical ADHD/ADHD like personalities are the ones who largely prop up this bubble. They are the ones who are always looking for that dopamine rush. They tend to be the ones who keep buying toxic positivity (no evidence in the literature that this works) motivational books or get rich books, when logically, if those books contained truth, then the authors would just use those tips/truths themselves, and would not need to resort to make their money from selling these books. Also, more car accidents, more crime, more need for lawyers, judges, services, etc... it all leads back to GDP and economic activity.

And now these are the same types of people who are relying on ChatGPT and erroneously think chatGPT is magic: they think what they do themselves was done by chatGPT, not realizing chatGPT is just input=output. These are the same people on chatGPT sub saying ""chatGPT is better than all therapists I ever had""... well my guess is that they are inputting what they like to hear in the moment/that gives them the dopamine rush, but their therapist actually used the literature to help them but they found it too difficult to do, so they dropped out of therapy and blamed all their therapists instead, and now chatGPT is harming them in the long run by telling them what they want to hear in the moment (input=output) and they are mistaking that for therapeutic progress. They are also the same people who buy the exact same phone every year with a different model number, to get that new dopamine rush feeling.

This doesn't mean that people with ADHD/subclinical ADHD/ADHD like personalities are not as intelligent as others, it simply means their need for that dopamine rush gets in the way of their logical reasoning at times and makes them more susceptible to these things. So they would benefit from help, and I believe most are not getting help. By saying it is overdiagnosed, we are doing a disservice to them and making it less likely for them to seek treatment."

16,2023-06-11,CMV: You should NEVER talk to or make plans to hang out with someone after pursuing a romantic relationship and getting rejected.,u/CEO_Of_Rejection_99,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/147d4zp/cmv_you_should_never_talk_to_or_make_plans_to/,changemyview,"Correct me if I'm wrong. This is something that has held me back without me even realizing. Here's my reasoning:

People often give the following advice when it comes to romantic rejection: If the other person's not interested, MOVE ON. Moving on means you do NOT continue pursuing the relationship ANY LONGER. If you do, then the other person will feel pressured and uncomfortable.

If the other person doesn't respond to your message, they're not interested. If they give a vague ""I'll let you know"" if you ask them out and they don't respond or give a vague ""I'll let you know"", they're not interested. If they BLOCK you/unfriend you on social media, they're not comfortable and therefore not interested. Anything other than a ""hell yes!"" means they're not interested. In that case, MOVE ON. I feel that all of this has been fed into my head in all my years of trying to figure out crushes and relationships.

I believe that things such as talking and making plans to hang out, even if the intention is nothing more than as friends, could be interpreted as continuing to pursue the relationship after the other person indicated they're not interested, thereby making them uncomfortable. If the other person has blocked you on social media and you still try to reach out to them (whether in real life or online), then that would be violating their boundaries. Blocking means the other person doesn't want to talk with you.

I remember the days when I got blocked on social media after trying to pursue a relationship with another person. I admit the ways I've addressed these early crushes were flawed and I also admit I made the mistake of trying to reach out to them IMMEDIATELY upon finding out they blocked me. When I have asked my peers in the past about how to deal with someone who blocked me/doesn't want to talk to me, they have said to give the other person space and leave them alone for a while.

Therefore, I feel that I am doing the person a FAVOR if I don't speak with them again or make plans to hang out after pursuing a romantic relationship with them and being rejected. If they rejected me, that means they don't want the idea of a relationship to be entertained again after that, so anything that could vaguely resemble continuing to pursuing a relationship (even if the intentions are nothing more than platonic friendship) should not be attempted. If they blocked me, that means they don't want to be in contact with me, so I should stay away from them.

3 years ago, I unsuccessfully attempted to pursue a relationship with someone in my class in high school. It was a disaster and I spent a lot of time and energy on it. I later found that she blocked me on Snapchat, a very obvious signal that she didn't want to be in contact with me. She later unblocked me 2 weeks later. Fast forward to a year after that, and I was still reminded of the painful memories that I associated with the crush. I then blocked her because I felt that remaining in contact with her was not necessary and, since she rejected me, I was doing her a favor by removing myself from her presence.

2 years ago, I matched with someone on the Bumble dating app. There was initial interest and we exchanged socials, but she was always consistently unavailable due to classes and being out of town to visit family. I eventually blocked her without saying a word, because I was tired of pursuing a relationship with someone who was consistently unavailable. I felt that I was giving her what she wanted, since she was consistently unavailable to meet up in person, whether due to physical location/scheduling issues or simply not being interested.

I feel that this view is holding me back because it prevents me from feeling free to reach out to past romantic interests and make plans to hang out with them as friends, even if the romantic attraction was short/not very intense, or if it didn't cause any actual problems for both of us. I fear the other person can read my mind and guess that I had a crush on them or assume that I'm continuing to pursue a past crush on them, even if I have purely platonic intentions. To be honest, I find it sad that I think I have to cross a potential great friend off my list of friendships simply because I had a crush on them and decided the relationship was not worth pursuing or found out they weren't into me the same way.

Cannon will disagree and severely hamper the evidence allowed at trial. 

Cannon will also severely delay the trial over and over , agreeing with the Trump defense team over and over. Likely will not see a trial set until sometime after the next presidential election. 


Cannon can find reasons to simply dismiss the case entirely and that would be that.

Unless somehow the case gets reassigned to another Judge, then Judge Cannon will absolutely torpedo any chance the prosecution has of getting a conviction."

26,2023-06-12,CMV: The fact that there are so many religions proves that all of them are wrong.,u/Sentient-Bread-Stick,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/147h3q2/cmv_the_fact_that_there_are_so_many_religions/,changemyview,"There are many, many religions. Logically, speaking, only one or none of them are right. Almost all of these religions have gods, which seem to almost always come with a belief in the afterlife. In most religions, the god(s) will judge a person for certain qualities or deeds (example: murder is typically frowned upon, while being kind is usually seen as a good thing) and depending on whether or not the god(s) approve of them, they will be sent to a certain afterlife (usually there is one good one and one bad one, but it varies. There are also exceptions like with reincarnation).

This on it’s own already has many problem and logical inconsistencies, but what makes it all fall apart is the most common qualification to enter the good place (heaven, Valhalla, eternal paradise, and every wonderland used as incentive in every religion): you have to believe in the right one.

Take Christianity. For many branches, the only way you can enter heaven is through believing in and worshipping one singular god. This must be done out of faith, while you’re alive, until you die.

Notice the main problem: faith. Religions require you to blindly believe in their god(s), or else you will be punished for all eternity. The obvious trap here is that this makes it impossible for you to stop following the religion. Consciously or subconsciously, it’s out of fear.

This is done with every religion. From the very earliest tribal rituals to modern organized churches, one message is made clear, one that every single religion says: “This religion is correct. Believe and follow it and you will be rewarded. Doubt or question it and you will be punished”.

This would make sense if it were one religion, proven to be right, known to every single person to ever live. However, this isn’t the case. Millions of religions spread over thousands of years all have this rule. Which raises the question: if belief is so important, why don’t we already know what’s right?

A god could easily prove themselves to be real, or at the very least make everyone instinctually believe in them. They could make a universe that without a doubt requires a god to exist (our universe is automatic; while a god COULD exist, it is not necessary for the universe to function). The fact that they haven’t done this already disproves most religions, as it means a god is not omnipotent and/or omnibenevolent (can’t or won’t do it, contradicting the popular belief that gods can do anything and want people to be happy).

In other words, no religion we have ever had, currently have or will ever have is remotely likely to be correct. This is me of the many reasons why. This isn’t to say that a god doesn’t exist, but if they do, I doubt they would care whether or not we believe in them."

The upper class only got there because they exploited and tricked so many people along the way. Politicians and the ruling class never truly represent and do what's best for society, but rather what's for their own best interest.

&#x200B;

Kindness, altruism, friendship, love, and other social abstract concepts are all created by the ruling class to manipulate and keep the lower classes in their place. For example:

* **Kindness is foolish.** Acts of kindness prevent people from using their limited resources on bettering their own lives, and instead then use those precious resources on someone else.
* **True altruism doesn't exist.** Rich people never donate to individual people - they donate and give to foundations and charities, of which they can get publicity and tax write-offs. They do good in order to feel good about themselves. if they were truly good, they should just distribute their wealth to everybody else. Even if someone did something wonderful for the greater good, what they get in return is never equal to what they sacrificed or ""put into the system""
* **Love doesn't exist.** Marriage is just a contract that legally binds aging people to each other, so that the broader society doesn't have to worry or take care of the aging people in that contract. Two people get together for the mutual benefit of the shared resources. Love wears off eventually, and at the end it will just be the shared pool of resources going through each day.
* **Only blood ties are the only true bond in this planet.** In general, everybody can leave, including your spouse and your friends, but family typically stays together. Because it's the path of nature to protect your kin and look out for their best interest. Statistically speaking, your kin is the least likely to betray you. So nothing else exists, and you should not trust anybody who isn't family.
* **Morality is a social construct that prevents people from acting in their best self-interest.** The rich and the powerful are constantly violating their morals in order to maintain their place at the top of the pyramid. Believing in morality will distract you from making the decisions that will maximize personal benefit. Therefore, you should always place self interest (and the interest of the family) before the needs or requirements of anybody else.
* **In short, doing the ""right"" thing is for fools who have either too much time or too much money.**

These sound ridiculous, but I also think that there is some truth here. In general, it's easier to live life when you have more material wealth and power. When we choose friends, we naturally gravitate towards people who are more attractive, more affluent, or have more potential benefit or use to us. When we choose marriage partners, we also tend to consider their financial status, their physical health, and whether they'll help us bear the responsibilities of life down the road. People can change at any time, so therefore it's unwise to bet anything on concepts such as love, friendship, or morality. I'll even go as far as to say that people like scientists and professors are somewhat foolish, in that their hard-earned achievements are then exploited by industrialists and capitalists to make more money for themselves. It's very rare that the true scientist, or inventor, fully reaps the rewards of what he creates. They created so much value for society, but what did they get in return? At the end of the day, we can only rely on ourselves and our kin, the people who will never betray us because there is that blood tie. And it's best to make life easier and better for ourselves and our kin, first, before considering all these distracting abstract social constructs.

**There's a myriad of individual views here in this post - but I guess the main question I'm asking here is if the pursuit of abstract, ""good"" concepts is actually worthwhile, and if it is, how does it manifest in our lives down the line?** 

As I'm typing this, it makes sense in my head, but my heart feels sad. Which is why I know that these are probably shitty values and beliefs to have. And which is also why I'm trying to create distance from my toxic family. But please, someone please convince my mind that these values are more destructive than they are constructive. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

While artificial voices are not quite as advanced as the chat side of things, in five years time they will also be, comparible, with human voices and so there will really be no need for a company to employ humans in their customer service departments, apart from maybe a handful of staff to monitor interactions and deal with, more difficult, queries which the chat bots can then be trained on later."

0,2023-06-14,CMV: Religosity is not a bug in our system of understanding. It is our system for understanding.,u/Fando1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/149gsq8/cmv_religosity_is_not_a_bug_in_our_system_of/,changemyview,"I know religiosity and spiritually are pretty out of vogue these days. And perhaps rightly so. 

But extending on Emile Durkenheims ideas in The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, I would argue that religion is fundamental to how we interpret the world. Even for those of us who claim to be atheist/agnostic.

Whatever your feelings about 'religion' as a concept, you have to admit that religious ideas (sacred objects, rituals, and communities governed by divine rules) are prolific across history. With almost every culture having its own set of deitys: Thor, Hades, Rah, Allah, Yaweh, Ganesha etc. 

One explanation is that religious thinking is some form of 'bug' in the system of our understanding. Perhaps forming when antient people would confuse dreams and reality, or perhaps a personification of natural occurrences like lightning or wind.

But surely these bugs would be an evolutionary disadvantage. - If you work up a sweat doing a rain dance, you'll die of thirst quicker! So why do the ideas persist. 

To me, it's not a great explanation for why religions last for thousands of years. And almost every civilization independently constructs their own religious system. 

It makes a lot more sense to assume they have some kind of evolutionary advantage. 

I believe a better explanation for their proliferation is it is fundamental to how we interpret reality. Durkenheim makes the argument that many successful political movements are religious in form. Post revolutionary France had sacred objects like the Tricolour, divine rights like 'egality, fraternity and liberty', and rituals like Bastille Day. 

In fact if you think about your own community or friendship group, it likely has a lot of these features. Even atheists have objects they consider sacred (for me it's my first guitar - which I value far more than its retail value), rituals - for us it's going to pub and then ordering 100 chicken mcnuggets (we're gross I know), or arbitrary rules - never order a steak well done, never leave a pint half drunk etc.

The basic elements of religion are ubiquitous in any social group. Whether they invent a specific god for their belief or not. Though you could quite easily argue many of us deify our heroes - musicians, writers, artists. 

If someone gave you a pen that was owned by some guy down the road, it wouldn't really have any meaning to you. But if I told you it was owned by your favourite writer, suddenly it would take on a whole new importance. Despite materially just being the same pen.

I think this way of thinking is fundamental to how we intuit the world. To how we assign value and how we narrow our focus from the vast array of sensory input we are constantly bombarded with.

As a kind of mental triage, our brains are hardwired to assign value to certain objects and to gravitate towards certain hueristics and rules. Repeat certain behaviours that comfort us. 

It is these cornerstone's that define religion (according to durkenheim) and also govern the way our cognition works on a basic level. As if we are born with a blank template to understand the world, that we then fill with objects, rituals and rules that we are taught. And this template can be understood to be synonymous with religious thinking."

But I think that in this day and age with the new times that it shouldn’t matter because men and women are equals and should be treated as such, so if a women has sex with a man or multiple they shouldn’t be viewed any less because nobody views a man less. If you don’t agree than attempt to change my mind but make sure to have evidence and explain it and I’m not a fan for analogy’s. 

Reason for delta: the comment adjusted my view not completely changed it but it was adjusted because they explained how their is an inherent biological difference between men and women. Because if a man has had many sexual partners then that would mean that their is something unique about him or he’s good at manipulating, and lying because us women are so selective."

what makes lolicon bad but a hentai game where you play as a rapist serial killer is acceptable

“it sexualizes children” no shit sherlock but if it’s fictional again why should I give a fuck

saying lolicon is bad because pedophilia is a weak ass argument

an argument that can work is “watching lolicon can actually increase the desire to harm children rather than reduce it *provides a credible source*”

see there you’re not saying “it’s bad because people who watch it are pedos” that’s a dumb argument, no you’re saying it’s bad because it can lead to an increase in csa

see that’s an argument that can work

of course there’s the issue of you can probably find an argument that playing violent video games can lead to an increase in violence and provide a credible source for that claim

and now you end up with a new debate

if lolicon is bad because it can potentially lead to increased child sexual abuse then why are violent video games acceptable if they can potentially lead to increased violence

well the people for whom that is true usually have severe mental issues to begin with, most people don’t go shooting up a school because they played school shooter simulator

so what makes lolicon bad but violent video games acceptable, anyone have an argument for why lolicon is bad but violent video games aren’t?

I’m aware not everyone that sees lolicon or violent media are adults and an argument for why lolicon os bad is that children can be exposed to it

so let’s say a 7 year old has the misfortune of stumbling across lolicon and an intensely gorey movie with a serial killer protagonist

after being exposed to that would they both have an equally negative impact on the child or would the child be more likely to think adult + child relationships are acceptable but not more likely to think murder is acceptable

if so that’d mean lolicon would have a greater negative impact on the child’s development than violent media and if so then that’d be an argument that’d change my view

so are there any sources that show that lolicon has a greater negative impact on development than violent media or is the negative impact the same

my view will be changed if you can provide some sort of evidence that if a child was accidentally exposed to lolicon and violent media the lolicon material would have a greater negative impact on them than the violent media 

if you don’t have a source because it turns out no study on this has been done then you can still use argumentation to explain why you believe lolicon would have a greater negative impact than violent media if a child was exposed to both

sources are ideal but I can be convinced by an argument that doesn’t have sources

EDIT: u/mortusowo provided this argument

19,2023-06-14,CMV: United States v. Miller (1939) should be overturned,u/Bad_Right_Knee,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/149ozyj/cmv_united_states_v_miller_1939_should_be/,changemyview,"This was a supreme court case over the 1934 National Firearms Act. Here is the basic background of the case, from Wikipedia

> The case involved a criminal prosecution under the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA). Passed in response to public outcry over the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the NFA requires certain types of firearms, such as fully automatic firearms and short-barrelled rifles and shotguns, to be registered with the Miscellaneous Tax Unit, which was later folded into what eventually became the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), then part of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the ancestor of today's Internal Revenue Service.[1] The $200 tax was to be paid at the time of registration and again if the firearm was ever sold.

> The defendants Jack Miller and Frank Layton were indicted on charges of unlawfully and feloniously transporting in interstate commerce from Oklahoma to Arkansas an unregistered double-barrel 12-gauge shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length, in violation of the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C.S. § 1132c et seq. (""Act""). At trial in federal district court, the defendants filed a demurrer to the indictment alleging that the Act was not a revenue measure but an attempt to usurp police power reserved to the states and so was unconstitutional. Defendants further argued that the Act violated the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. The district court held that the section of the Act that made it unlawful to transport an unregistered firearm in interstate commerce was unconstitutional as violative of the Second Amendment. It accordingly sustained the demurrer and quashed the indictment. The government took a direct appeal to the Supreme Court.

And the ruling was that 

> Not unconstitutional as an invasion of the reserved powers of the States. Citing Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U. S. 506,[1] and Narcotic Act cases. P. 307 U. S. 177. The conclusion was in the favor of the NFA.

> Not violative of the Second Amendment of the Federal Constitution. P. 307 U. S. 178.

> The Court cannot take judicial notice that a shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches long has today any reasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, and therefore cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees to the citizen the right to keep and bear such a weapon.

> In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a ""shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length"" at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment, or that its use could contribute to the common defense.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Miller

Now, with the basic facts established, I believe this ruling should be overturned because of three reasons

1) the case was tried in absentia because Miller was deceased before the trial. This is the only supreme court case in US history to happen in absentia. I believe that this is a 6th amendment violation and it was clear the defendant couldn't get proper legal council while deceased - that is why the defendant's legal council was not representing them at the supreme court, and neither was the defendant. It is absurd that a case decided under such disadvantageous circumstances should stand as good case law. 

2) simply transporting a firearm across state lines is not interstate commerce, and the government is overzealous in applying the commerce clause, as previously found in US v Lopez (1995)

3) according to the metrics laid out above, short barreled shotguns now are ordinary military equipment capable of being used for the common defense - as shown by M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System and various short barreled Rem 870s and Mossberg 500/590s used by all branches of the US armed forces. As such, based on the same facts and logic presented today, Miller would be found to have been protected by the 2nd amendment."

Of course, I think general leftist policy is better for citizens, but American leftists are HORRIBLE at advocating for their positions without sensationalizing them.

Real leftism to me is about helping the working class. Social democracy is about ensuring there's a social safety net so that no citizen is beneath dignity. To me, what holds American political discourse back is this strange focus on reactionary politics that's fuelled by fringe culture war issues.

Massive corporation: any for-profit privately owned or publicly traded business with a market cap which is comparable to the GDP of a top 50 nation 

Centrally planned economy: any entity where the production and distribution of goods/services/labour etc are planned by a central governing body

Amazon has a market cap of 1.24 trillion US dollars. If we compare that to national GDPs, it would be the 16-17 largest country in the world in between Indonesia and the Netherlands. 

Like any other corporation, the assets of Amazon are centrally controlled, the C-suite and board of directors and other senior management will make plans about how the business should operate, where potential avenues for growth exist and will deploy capital and labour according to their plans in order to grow and operate their business. 

If Amazon operated under free market principles then individual employees would be trying to allocate their own capital to develop new areas of the business or would have wages determined by individual managers rather than set as standard across the company for a given task and geographical location. 

I’m not trying to debate that Amazon operates in a way that is always good for the employees, but rather that companies like Amazon provide a really powerful counter example to those people say that planned economies cannot work or are inefficient. 

Such large organisations show that it is entirely possible and indeed efficient to centrally plan the allocation of resources. I’m not looking to discuss any of the other pros or cons of communism/socialism vs capitalism I’m purely looking to discuss the efficiency of centrally planned economies. 

You can change my view on this by explaining how this is not a reasonable analogy to central planning at a national level.

Inflation was lower, stock market was stronger, interest rates were lower, cost of everything was lower, unemployment was lower, taxes were lower, we were much further away from war, more people had a much better chance of achieving home ownership, etc.

What am I missing here?

Some quick background:  I live in a purple state and the general consensus of a majority of the people around me (with differing political views) seems to be that they miss how life was under Trump.   The two main things I hear complained about are the huge rise in cost of living and the meteoric rise of identity politics.  

Please change my view as I would genuinely love to learn about the positive things Biden has done/changed that you feel make day-to-day living of the average American EASIER than it was under Donald Trump. I am a registered Independent who did not vote for Trump or Biden.


EDIT/UPDATE:   Thank you to everyone for the replies so far!

COVID happening was obviously a giant issue that upended almost everything, so I completely understand and agree with the points made there.

My only gripe so far is that many of the responses seem to be reasons or excuses, most having to do with COVID (which are valid), but in theory that proves my point. I never said anything about why in my post...I just stated that it is better and then asked for examples of what Biden has done that make you feel that it is better now than it was under Trump.  There have been some posts that have examples but not many."

## Romantic 

For people in a relationship, unless you started off as friends first, it makes no sense to go from romantic partners to friends **WITHOUT** explaining the reason y'all are incompatible. I don't know why it is so hard to say ""You're unattractive now"" or ""I only date [enter whatever race is most attractive to you]"" or whatever caused you to want to become just a friend. 

## One Sided Romantic 

If a friend asks you out and you can't tell them why, then it should be understandable that that friend doesn't owe maintaining your friendship. It's up to the rejector to explain why they are incompatible. Especially if y'all have never been on a date before since you have no knowledge as to why. If its because they are unattractive that is totally fine just explain it. 

If you can't think of one then that probably means a) you are taken ( in which case say it ) b ) You really should give the date and if the date goes bad then say that's why c) accepting your friendship means less to you then how uncomfortable you will feel after you say your reason. 

After all, if you asked someone out and they said they weren't attracted to you, that probably wouldn't hurt your friends in any way unless you only had shallow intentions from the start. 

## Platonic 

It isn't just romance. Lately, I  have seen people who were good friends leave their friends in the lurk just because that friend became depressed or they were struggling through some trauma. Often times the friend that is going through something makes fewer plans to go out, less attempts to check on others, and basically stops contributing to their relationship. 

I've noticed people in this situation complain that ""if xyz was my friend they would do ABC"". But aside from how manipulative that line of thinking is, they themselves don't want to say the real reason they are incompatible with that friend. Why stop a friendship because someone is going though a phase? 

I have also seen if after a few weeks or months they have a glow up on social media or something, people start looking for them more! Almost like they want to reconnect as if there wasn't intentional ghosting not too long ago. 

The last one I know can vary from person to person but my point stands."

Offering to pay someone (thing of value) for an official action (thing of value) is a way to describe offering a bribe. Soliciting a bribe can be described as performing an official action (thing of value) but only in exchange for money (thing of value).

But whether it be money or action is irrelevant in either position.

And accepting a bribe is the same thing as asking (soliciting) for one. Simply put if the answer to a question is always no unless the question is accompanied with a piece of candy you are effectively asking for a piece of candy in exchange for a yes.

Joe Biden and Donald Trump are each accused of crimes involving bribery and Ukrainians. Here is Trumps accusation:

Trump asked for an investigation into Biden (thing of value) in exchange for Trump’s release of aid (thing of value).

And Biden’s:

Biden accepted $5 million dollars (thing of value) in exchange for him making firing a prosecutor a condition of aid (thing if value).

So it’s the same action, they both “Bribed” something. The only difference is what each of them got.

Which is the bigger get? $5 million dollars or an investigation into your political rival and the White House? I would say there are universes where these two line up as being close to equal in value.

Which is the bigger give, or rather which was more important? Releasing aid that your government already promised and planned for or getting a prosecutor fired that the US government and some of the international community wanted fired anyway? I would say here it depends on whether or not the prosecutor was really investigating Burisma. If the prosecutor had no intention of investigating Burisma then it’s irrelevant to Burisma if he is fired. But if he really was going after taking down corruption in Burisma and Biden stopped that then that is a really big give with big implications.

Therefore: If Biden is guilty of bribery allegations and Trump was also guilty, then they should receive the same punishment.

If you thought Trump should be impeached then you should also think Biden should be impeached and also think the reverse, if you dismissed the allegations against Trump as unimportant then you should do the same for Biden.

And to further tie this to current events. ***IF*** you think that what Hillary Clinton did with 30,000 emails is the same as what Trump did with 31 documents then they should receive the same punishment.

So if you thought Hillary should have been punished then you should want Trump punished now (obviously Trump himself is in this camp). And if you thought Hillary should escape consequences you should want the same for Trump.

Now my view is that Hillary and Trump’s actions aren’t the same, but I do believe that what Biden is accused of and what Trump was impeached for were the same. So to change my view you need to explain why they shouldn’t be treated the same for the same action or why their alleged actions aren’t the same.

Edit: My view has been changed [here.](https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14a3ok9/_/jo8w19g/?context=1) The fact of the matter is the way both of these gentleman have acted in regards to transparency is very different. Look no further than Biden releasing 20 years of tax returns and Trump not releasing any and having over 500 shell corporations. And like I have known all of these allegations discussed here have varying degrees of unproven elements but none of them at equal in all of the elements or what is unproven."

0,2023-06-15,CMV: Sexual Selection does not currently adequately describe the mechanisms behind female choice,u/FerdinandTheGiant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14aajkc/cmv_sexual_selection_does_not_currently/,changemyview,"Just for background information: 

> “Sexual selection, theory in postulating that the evolution of certain conspicuous physical traits—such as pronounced coloration, increased size, or striking adornments—in animals may grant the possessors of these traits greater success in obtaining mates. From the perspective of natural selection, such increases in mating opportunities outweigh the risks associated with the animal’s increased visibility in its environment. This concept was initially put forth by English naturalist Charles Darwin”

Setting aside male to male competition, I will be discussing mate choice. This is the preference shown by one sex (often the females) for individuals of the other sex that exhibit certain traits. 

The presence of a particular trait among the members of one sex can make them somehow more attractive to the opposite sex. This type of “sex appeal” has been experimentally demonstrated in all sorts of animals. 

One reason for this is something known as a perceptual bias which basically means that there is a preference in the female for example, bright colors, because they feed on fruit and it’s beneficial for them to be more attracted to these colors. When males begin to have these colors due to a mutation, the females begin to select for it and that creates a feedback loop of selection known as runaway selection. Though perceptual bias aren’t the only way runaway selection can begin, in fact it can occur from any preferential selection by females that outweighs natural selection against the trait. 

But that last line is the key part. One of the tenants so to speak of sexual selection is that is a opposed to natural selection.

It has long been held that the additional conspicuousness gained in many cases from sexual selection are maintained by that selection and is constrained by higher predation pressures than less conspicuous males. This however is not reflective of reality. 

Research indicates that males with higher coloration and conspicuousness do in fact also have a higher survivability indicating the conspicuousness is not a cost at all. Instead, it indicates that these signals are connected to a level of condition-dependency which makes it so that more conspicuous males are the better quality males. 

This indicates that the coloration did not evolve due to females, at least not female choice alone. If that were the case, you wouldn’t see a conditional dependency attached unless that aspect of it randomly evolved later in males which isn’t likely IMO. 

What does seem likely is that this condition dependency evolved first and was then exposed to runaway selection by female mate choice. Now you may be asking my what process and that is where the Unprofitable Prey Hypothesis comes in. The basic premise of it being that the coloration of males evolved originally as a signal to predators of their escape potential. This is the basis of aposematic coloration in poisonous animals or alarm calls in birds. These are signals to predators (aka the forces of natural selection) that the prey is not worth expending energy to chase or thst there is too much of a cost in general. 

It is through predation that these signals gain their condition dependency that is then acted upon by females."

\---**Please read the entire post before you comment, many of the points mentioned in the comments  have already been addressed in the post.---**

*Of course, setting mutually agreed upon boundaries is the key, and it is never healthy to try and control your partner. I do not forbid my partner, nor does he forbid me from hanging out with people of the opposite sex. We both have friends of the opposite sex that we spend time with.  That being said we both spend time with those friends most often in groups. Though we have had one on one hangouts with these friends we tend to keep them casual and infrequent and they always happen in a public setting.*

*(I also want to include any friend who could potentially present the threat of an affair, emotional or otherwise. Including an LGBTQIA+ person hanging out with someone of the same community* ***where an attraction could be present. This would be determines on a case by case basis.***  *This applies throughout the post.)*


EDIT OMG I AM BI. PLEASE STOP ASSUMING I HAVENT TAKEN THIS INTO ACCOUNT. You are not making a new or exciting point. Yes bi people can have friends. Jhc. 

&#x200B;

Personally I do not subscribe to the idea that men and women cannot be friends platonically, I very firmly believe they can. That being said I also feel that the lines between a platonic and romantic relationship can very easily blur in friendships where that potential exists.  My boyfriend was one of my best friends for years before we eventually ended up dating. Our relationship blossomed platonically which led to a mutual romantic interest. It happens. So it does not seem outside the realm of possibility to me that it could happen when one person if already in a relationship.

Because of this I do feel that it is reasonable to feel uncomfortable with your partner having friends of the opposite sex that they spend one on one time with, especially frequently. I think that the potential in many cases very well may exist and for that reason it is unnecessary to allow for the circumstances for that situation to flourish by allowing them to be frequent.

I am 100% aware that the most common rebuttal will be something along the lines of *""Don't you trust your partner? If you trust them there should be no issue.""*

**But that's just the thing, it isn't actually a matter of trust**. Not entirely. You can trust your partner implicitly,  but that doesn't negate these facts:

1. **When it comes to emotional matters, that is not up to choice**.  Trusting your partner relies on the belief that they will not make a choice that could hurt you. But people don't choose who they develop an attraction to or who they catch feelings for. **You can trust your partner 100% and they can choose to not break that trust, and STILL catch feelings/ develop an attraction to someone else without intending to**. This could lead them to stray from your previously strong relationship on an emotional level, which can be just as fatal to the relationship. Relationships fail and people leave each other all the time without any infidelity occurring. Trust does not have to be broken for relationships to fail as a result of another person interfering.
2. **People can and DO still break trust if they deem the risk worth it**.  You can trust your partner all you want. Have 0 qualms, a perfectly healthy relationship, and still be completely blindsided by their actions. You cannot read people's minds or anticipate their motives. People will surprise you, and trusting blindly can be unwise.  How many people have had their hearts shattered because they found out someone they trusted implicitly did them wrong. **We all know someone it has happened to. People do that, and it is naïve to think that it could never happen to you**.

The next thing people will meet me with is ""*Oh you're just insecure. That stems from your own issues and you should work on yourself if your insecurities make you feel this way*.""  And yes on some level that could certainly be true, there are many people who are overly possessive or controlling due to their own insecurities. But I feel that **on a base level you do no need to be insecure to feel this way**.

Personally, I am not very insecure. I am confident in my looks and my personality, I am confident in my ability to thrive and find joy independently and outside of a relationship or to find a new one.  For years my long-term plan did not involve any partner and I created goals I was perfectly happy meeting without anyone by my side.  I know that if my partner were to cheat or choose some other woman over me that its a stronger reflection of him and his potential issues than me or mine as I consistently strive to meet his needs when he expresses them and improve on myself if I don't. My worth is not dependent on my relationship or whether or not it succeeds or fails.

That being said, I do love my current partner and I love our relationship. We are strong and healthy and I see a real potential for us to create a happy future together long-term.  We are communicative, work through our issues as a team and are open about what we need from one another. I want to protect this relationship. So with the above points kept in mind it seems reasonable to me to reduce the potential for anything to get in the way of that. **Life happens, and even in healthy relationships  good people with pure intentions can stray if given the opportunity**. So why not set boundaries that protect the relationship by minimizing that opportunity?

I really feel that, within reason, it make sense to set boundaries with friends of the opposite sex when in a relationship. In this day and age and with the popularity of individualism and the strong emphasis on personal freedom it seems antiquated, controlling, or is overall just an an unpopular opinion. But I think if you are truly committed to the strength and longevity of the relationship you have it is not an unreasonable rule to have."

110,2023-06-15,CMV: The way medication is used for mental health(in America) is flawed,u/PoolLongjumping9562,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14af7pj/cmv_the_way_medication_is_used_for_mental/,changemyview,"I’ve been diagnosed with OCD for a couple years now. It’s legit, confirmed, official and on paper. And it sucks. I’m not self diagnosing,  or someone who pretends to have mental illnesses for attention. So please no arguing over such things in the comments.

It’s been strongly recommended that I take anxiety/depression meds. But I’ve been declining to take them. I’m still doing therapy and talking to a professional though.

My questions are about mental health meds themselves.

The idea of being sad or anxious or not being at my best mentally, and then being told to take a pill for it makes me uncomfortable. It feels very dystopian and Matrix-like. Am I really better, or do the pills just make me feel better? Wouldn’t any positives I feel from the medication be fabricated?

And how do I know it won’t affect my personality? Change the way a perceive and feel about the world around me? I may have some issues with anxiety, but I don’t want my entire personality to change, perhaps even permanently.

(For context, I’m in America)

I’m also uncomfortable with the way that these medications are prescribed. They prescribe these medications automatically and in such a worryingly carefree manner. It seems like so many healthcare providers are willing to play this weird chemical lottery game with your brain. There’s no way to know how a specific drug will affect you until your on it. So often times you’ll be put on one drug after another until one “sticks.” That seems careless, especially when many drugs have side effects like “may cause or increase suicidal thoughts” and other extreme potential side effects. But nobody really knows until they’re on one of these medications. Surely I’m not the only one that thinks this weird chemical gambling with your brain is dangerous? 

How can you give a depressed person a pill that may or may not cause or increase suicidal thoughts, and then send them home? WTF? If you had really bad hearing and someone offered you pill that could fix it… or make you permanently deaf, would you take the pill? I sure as hell wouldn’t. I’d rather have difficulty hearing than take a gamble on potentially losing my hearing forever.

The way that medications are used and prescribed(at least in America anyway) seems very flawed to me. I’m sure my worries about these medications are partly because of my anxiety. Just by reading my post as I type it, I can tell how anxious I probably sound to anyone reading this. But I also feel like these are also legitimate questions.

TL;DR: I guess my question ultimately boils down to how are so many people comfortable taking meds for mental health? Are you really better, or just feel better? How do you know it won’t make unwanted changes? How do so many people accept the risks? Potential side effects may include paranoia, new or worsening suicidal thoughts or ideation, hallucinations, etc. Not to mention the potential physical side effects. I don’t understand how so many docs and patients are willing to roll the dice like that? Maybe I’m missing something?"

Since then, it has(played an instrumental role in doing) :

* Eradicated Smallpox(WHO)
* Convened hundreds of international agreements concerning dispute resolution and trade(Secretariat)
* Resolved disputes and protected human security in contested areas(UN Peacekeeping, ICJ)
* Facilitated international development through travel with the Freedoms of Aviation(ICAO)
* Set up Refugee camps in places like Eastern Europe for Ukrainians, or Uganda for the Sudanese(Multilateral)
* Helped destroy bacteriogical weapons(sorry I can't say biological or I'll get cancelled by the DPRK), or at least was able to give warnings( Implementation Support Unit for the Convention on Bacteriological Weapons
* Reverted the destruction of the ozone layer

The UN has facilitated treaties, peacekeeping and even economic development. It also serves as a platform for dialogue between countries on thematic/global issues, so bilateral tensions don't prevent constructiveness. Through international conferences on things like human rights, disability rights, trade and sustainable development, the UN is able to organize international support for a common response to global issue. 

Some people want to exclude countries from the UN because of their supposed violation of certain global principles, such as the DPRK, Russia, China or Syria. While all of these countries have violated some of these principles one way or another, when it comes to stuff even they have contributed too, they shouldn't be excluded. Unfortunately, some US politicians(I'm from the US) have disagreed. Former USUN head Nikki Haley(now a GOP Presidential Candidate) called the election of the DPRK to the WHO Executive Board ""a farce"", because North Korea starves its own people while developing nukes and hostile policy towards the US, Japan, and the Republicans. Now, I have no idea what their defense policy has do with this, given they're not at war or imminently likely to be, and I think the mountains play a big role in the food problem(p.s. North Korea is organizing a top-level response effort to the food crisis, and the country has improved its situation since the famine in the 90s. So, I'm not sure how bad North Korea's health policy really is. 

The WHO is an independent agency, and should not be politicized. Now, Syria(which was just on the board) is not a good idea, because they ARE in an active war, and the regime their has used chemical weapons and repeatedly attacked hospitals. But they are out now. 

&#x200B;

And them's the facts, that the UN is an indispensable forum for dialogue, dispute resolution, common responses to international problems, and international development. 

Maybe it needs reform, but some people are just anti-globalist, and I think they're wrong."

But the thing is, people are still gonna use it until there is a replacement.

Yes, there technically are some alternatives that people are talking about but I don't see it replacing reddit. The most likely replacement I think there is Quora and Discord but even then it's a stretch.

The thing most people don't realize is that you need users for an social media app. Social Media relies so heavily on its users. Yes, you can create an app like Reddit but you also need to convince a lot of people to use it. Around 1 billion people If you hope to take down reddit.

1 billion people is approximately 1/7 of the entire world population. Only 2 countries in the entire world has more than 1 billion people and that is India and China.

This is no easy feat and only a few social media app had ever done that. It is possible but it will take months, possibly even years like it did with TikTok/Musically.

In conclusion, reddit sucks right now because of the changes it is making but we will likely have to deal with this for several months and possibly years to come. I'd love to be proven wrong though."

Some of the other protestors were also masculine and got kicked out too. I am not against public nudity in general. I grew up in a country where if you saw a man or woman topless in your home town the immediate response was to shrug. I don't have a problem with public nudity. I believe Rose going topless was stupid because of the location she chose to do it in. You don't go to the symbol of your country topless. Internationally, people won't take you seriously. It's like if Biden decided to go to a UN meeting with a t-shirt and flip flops. It's not the kind of image that you want people to have because people outside the US don't consider that kind of behavior normal in that context. She also stupid conservatives another headline to use to attack trans people. Who was she trying to convince? Who was she trying to deradicalise? People in the LGBT community are fighting so every little action they make doesn't become sexualised by the media then she just goes to the white house with her breasts out. It defeats the purpose. That is part of the reason why Martin Luther King always preached about protesting peacefully because he wanted to disprove the racist notion that black people were inherently violent and could only solve their problems with violence. Also, I am not saying that it is okay for conservatives to generalise about millions of people because of the actions of one person. What I am saying is that if you are an activist you have to think from a utilitarian standpoint what actions need to be taken to actually help your community. How in the hell does Rose Montoya going topless at the White House help deradicalise conservatives in states like Florida?

Edit: I can see now that my point in deradicalising people was wrong because that is an extremely difficult thing to do. However, I still don't necessarily believe that is a good image for moderates to see.

Edit 2: I think I understand the points that are being made. Basically, she forced people to see the double standard that men and women experience. Which essentially highlighted the mental gymnastics that people have. It forced transphobes to treat her the same way they treat cis women. Also, I did some research on protesting and public nudity. I learned alot about people like Lady Godiva. I can see now how it is really just a means to get attention for a specific cause. Basically, it makes people listen to what you have to say. I can effectively say that her actions were not simple or stupid."
0,2023-06-15,CMV: The reason the LGBT+ community is so polarizing in America is because of Kink and other more sexual movements with in.,u/My-_-Username,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14akezw/cmv_the_reason_the_lgbt_community_is_so/,changemyview,"Real quick to the mods, if this becomes a mess, I’m sorry. 

The main issue with LGBT+ acceptance is that instead of pushing for just for the rights of the LGBT+ community, the pride movement also has picked up any movement regarding to sexuality. Kink at Pride and Drag Story Times are connected with the LGBT+ through history sure, but they also have produced several bad lenses. With Kink at Pride, it exposes the public and children to inherently sexual displays. Men in bondage gear and doggy gimp masks are mainly what comes in mind, and that’s hard to excuse as wanting to further acceptance of different genders. It seems more like wanting to further the acceptance of exhibitionism, which isn’t exactly good. As for Drag Story Time, drag is also rooted in sex. While drag more in line with vaudeville and other over the top attractions, and can have lower content ratings, it still is rooted in sex and we should reserve that for older audiences, such as teens and up. 

TLDR: More sexual movements should be reserved for older audiences."

Every election cycle is the same story, these parties appear out of nowhere to run their fringe candidates and get 2% of the vote if they're lucky.

Not saying they don't have good morals or intentions, but they're suckers if they think their vote does anything.

&#x200B;

These parties could actually make a difference if they ran in local/state contests and built legitimacy from the ground-up. But it's clear their intention isn't to win or effect any meaningful change. People think the Green Party or the People's Party have some moral superiority due to their platforms when the party plays the political game too just like the others. It's just the way they play it is different, their goal is to pretend they care about winning when in reality they're simply content to just throw out useless candidates every general election to get money from Republican groups hoping they'll spoil the Dems in close swing state elections. If their voters understood basic civics and the FPTP system, they'd vote for the group that better aligns with them on social, economic and environmental issues. If you're a full blown anarchist or communist then I would understand if they didn't vote Democrat, but it's delusional how they think these parties are actually trying to win and make a difference. They're not and are perfectly happy and benefitting from how they do now, because they don't want to win."

However, they are being used more and more as the years go by, especially by milennials/Gen Z. 

Both of these platform types create ""hyperrealism"", where what we see online creates a distorted image and expectations of reality. For example, men seeing Instagram models on their feed will distort their idea of female beauty- every woman needs a size 2 waist to be considered even remotely attractive anymore.

Conversely, women are increasingly picky too. More women want a guy with 6-pack abs and a ton of money to even stand a chance at talking to them.

Dating apps are becoming the norm, with 52% of young adults having used it at least once. People aren't going out nearly as much as they used to, partly due to COVID, so apps like Tinder are expected to become the most common dating method in a few short years.

With this in mind, it's no wonder why we're seeing a rise of lonely, single men and groups of women that are fed up of being harassed pestered by men online with explicit photos they neither wanted nor asked for.

Of course, most men these days are overweight, unmotivated and socially awkward- so that slims down good options for women even more.

Dating is heavily skewed towards the elite ""top 20%"", where only the most attractive, successfully people will get the chance to actually find anyone. The rest of us will be either left with bad options or no options at all.

Is there any way that dating will get better, or will these social trends only make our current problems worse?"

I'm disputing the existence of them in the first place and the fact they're typically the default setting.

Read receipts/confirmations are the icon notifications in messaging apps that let the sender of a given message know whether the recipient has read - or at least opened or interacted with - their message.

While understandably handy for the sender, I believe that it's the receiver's prerogative to be able read a message and then confirm or screen what they wish without having to consider the social or formal implications of leaving someone on read.

Being ""left on read"" has now become an abstracted meta to navigate when using apps like this. People may avoid opening and reading messages until they know they have the capacity to respond properly - which isn't ideal because there could still be useful information in the message. Accidentally (or not) leaving a friend hanging for a few days can not only make the sender feel bad, but trigger a feeling of guilt for the recipient. Both parties might feel this way regardless of the little blue ticks, but at least there's a passive layer of ambiguity or deniability rather than an active confirmation that someone has most likely been ignored.

If someone knocks on my door or even rings my phone, I don't need an app that narcs on me when I'm predisposed or simply don't feel like answering. It may be rude of me to do so, but I should be entitled to a level of privacy in regards to my own autonomy or actions vis-à-vis my door, phone or indeed, messaging app.

I could obviously contrive some scenarios where the existence of read receipts could provide some kind of benefit that outweighs what is a fairly petty privacy concern - but en masse it can feel like all these stupid icons have done is add a weird layer of social complexity and immediacy to what should be an optionally asynchronous interaction. No, I don't want you go to your 30th Steve, leave me alone.

102,2023-06-16,CMV: The Brotherhood of Steel is the best faction to support in Fallout 4,u/Krenztor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14aww8y/cmv_the_brotherhood_of_steel_is_the_best_faction/,changemyview,"WARNING: Spoilers for the story of Fallout 4, a game made almost 8 years ago :)  
  
Just to be clear, I haven't played the other Fallout games, though I have heard some info about them, but I can only mostly speak for Fallout 4.  If anyone wants to bring in history from outside Fallout 4, I'll definitely take that into consideration, but I'm just not too familiar with it.  I do know that the BoS has been around since the original Fallout and that they've managed to spread from the Pacific to the Atlantic.  I think they are the only faction that's been able to do that?  But that's kind of a minor detail to me at this point.  I mostly want to focus on what is revealed in Fallout 4 itself.  
  
On a tier list of best to worst factions to support IMO:  
  
F Tier: Raiders and Gunners.  I know, not supportable factions, but just want to throw these out there because they kind of do act as evil factions.  They are cancers on the Commonwealth and humanity overall.  The Gunners might have better organization, but they don't present any real goals so presumably they just want money and will kill for it.  
  
**D Tier: Railroad**.  Very admirable goals, but if you support them through the end of the game, they destroy their only reason for existence which is the Institute.  Once that is gone, they've kind of hit a new crisis which is where do they even go from here?  They can continue to protect existing synths and maybe even start producing their own if they tried hard enough.  They have good technical skills and the will, but I can't see how that will benefit the Commonwealth or humanity overall.  
  
**C Tier: Institute**.  Bat shit insane scientists that are literally and totally disconnected from the rest of the world both physically and mentally.  Father is their leader and he proves just how confused he is by admitting he woke up his parent just to see what would happen.  He is a sociopath and the Institute was happy to have him in charge.  Even if you as the player end up being in charge of the Institute at the end, an early rebellion takes place that you have to put down.  Beyond that, the council doesn't care much for you.  Odds are you aren't going to change much.  They are very set in their ways and you aren't a scientist.  You'll be lucky to hold onto power for more than a few years and even if you do for the long term, you'd have to practically tear apart the entire organization in order to root out all the evil that goes on there.  There is some potential in this faction, but it is sketchy at best.  
  
**B Tier: Minutemen**.  By the end of the game you've probably built up a couple dozen settlements making up hundreds of people that include roving bands of Minutemen protecting the Commonwealth and provisioners transporting goods all over the place.  The group has a history of at least trying to start a government and now that the Institute is gone maybe they can achieve it.  Their biggest weakness is that they also have a history of collapsing on themselves due to poor leadership and by the end of the game, you are literally the only leader they have.  You die, the Minutemen will be in disarray.  Preston is a joke and Ronnie doesn't seem interested in anything except staying at the Castle.  If a government can get started and good leaders and systems be formed, then there is a chance that the Commonwealth is in good hands, but that is kind of a pipe dream at the end of the game given that there are no plans for the future of the Minutement.  
  
**A Tier: Brotherhood of Steel**.  I know these guys have a lot of problems, but let's look at how they compare to the other factions.  
  
Raiders / Gunners - Where those guys are out to destroy, BoS is out here to build and organize.  They are what the Gunners would be with better tech, organization, and a mentality to build rather than profit.  
Railroad - Where once the Institute is gone they have no direction, the BoS now has their greatest barrier out of the way and can more strongly implement their vision.  
Institute - Where they are disconnected from the world, BoS very intentionally rolls into the Commonwealth in their airship and dives head first into the thick of it.  They are heavily invested in the Commonwealth and have plans for being on the front lines when resurrecting it.  
Minutemen - Where they have no leadership, the BoS is thickly layered in leaders and have people who excel in various areas.  They also don't have a history of collapsing in on themselves.  
  
The greatest weakenesses of all the other factions are strengths of the BoS.  The weakness of the BoS is almost certainly the rigidity of Maxson's views.  He doesn't compromise about anything and that means kicking someone like Danse out of the BoS because he isn't human even if he is a massive asset.  That said, Danse could be coded to go haywire and kill them all since he was created by the Institute who could reasonably have had that in their agenda.  He could even accidentally go haywire as was seen during the Broken Mask incident.  Maxson also won't tolerate even intelligent ghouls or super mutants.  I'm not sure what they'd think of Virgil after he returns to being human or the idea of simply curing super mutants since they were once humans.  That said, I'd argue that a very small percentage of useful beings in the Commonwealth are ghouls or super mutants so even though he's ignoring a valuable resource, it is a small resource.  
  
The rigidity of his goals are a strength as well however.  There is no hemming and hawing about what needs to get done.  We might be able to afford that kind of leadership in peace time, but in war (and post-war) times, you want a laser focused goal with little red tape.  When things need to get done, Maxson and the BoS will get them done, with extreme prejudous.  They have the technology, troops, and training to carry out just about any mission and have goals in place that will lead to a very unified Commonwealth.  If it isn't human, kill it.  If it is human and it's violent, kill it.  Beyond that, establish outposts to ensure security.  Expand the reach of the BoS though interacting with the Commonwealth.  
  
If you took this faction and let them play out for 50 years after the fall of the Institute, the BoS would probably result in a world much like we have today in the US.  Strong federal government and military, humans running everything, and technology being prevalent in society.  It would be more militarized and authoritarian, but I'd also expect that of a post-apocolyptic future.  It's going to take some healing before you get a liberal democracy up and running though to be fair the Minutemen probably would attempt to achieve that though I tend to think it would collapse just as it did in the past.  
  
I'll also address my strongest criticisms of the faction.  Teagan gives you quests to steal from farmers to support the BoS.  These are optional quests and personally I don't do them.  Because they are optional, I simply see it as a black mark on the BoS that they'd consider these actions, but they don't actually do them.  Also it isn't official BoS policy and just Teagan speaks of it.  
  
The most egregious fault is that they kill the Railroad at the end of the game.  This decision makes no sense to me.  Sure, the Railroad does have it in for the BoS and in fact they do destroy the BoS if they get the upper hand.  But at the end of the BoS campaign, the Railroad is in no position to attack the BoS.  At worst, they should be arrested for plotting against them, not utterly destroyed.  That said, I am not going to say this enough to make me change my mind on supporting the BoS.  The Railroad really WAS a threat to the BoS and eliminating them can be somewhat justified though I think it is complete overkill.  They honestly should have just let the Railroad be since they were a minor threat at that point and with the Institute being gone, the Railroad was probably going to dissolve all on its own.  
  
**S Tier: Sorry, no S Tier**.  I want to point out that there is no obviously great faction to support.  They all have their issues and none are guaranteed to succeed, including the BoS.  
  
So there it is.  I'm curious what others think.  I know BoS is authoritarian and biggoted and are by no means angels, but given the circumstances I don't find it hard to understand why they are the way they are and why their methods will work.  The Minutemen are a close second but they seem too flimsy to succeed in the long run.  If they had better leadership and long term plans, I'd have taken them over BoS.  Would have been really nice if in the game you could setup a Continental Congress with the Minutemen where the leaders of all the settlements came together and set forth the makings of a new nation.  Unfortunately, I don't even know if that is realistically where the faction would head given that same 50 year time period.

I feel like once the sole survivor is gone, the Minutemen are directionless and collapse back into in fighting and ultimately disappear.  The Institute given 50 years I think just wipes out all humans in the Commonwealth.  Maybe to replace them with robots or maybe just kill them all as an ""act of mercy"" because they see the Commonwealth as hell on earth so they are saving people by killing them.  I guess there is some merit there since if everyone is dead, at least nobody is suffering anymore!  Can't say I find that logic all that convincing though.  Railroad, well, 50 years later I'm not sure anyone even remembers that they were there.  
  
Anyways, BoS currently has my vote.  Change my view :)"

1,2023-06-16,"CMV: Marbury v. Madison (1803) was incorrect and the Supreme Court does not have the so-called power of ""judicial review""",u/CandyBroker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14b2xx9/cmv_marbury_v_madison_1803_was_incorrect_and_the/,changemyview,"Maybe judicial review is tolerated because it has ""worked out"" for 230 years so why mess with it? Because the powers the court has belong to Congress and our elected representatives. For too long the judicial branch has had few checks on its power. Power these justices are not entitled to. Article III of the Constitution, which grants its powers, is very narrow and explicit in terms of establishing the Court's jurisdiction. 

I am not someone who believes this because of *Dobbs*  but it certainly reinforces it. I have believed this pretty much since I first learned about Marbury. For a court dominated by so-called textualists, I find it amusing Marbury is their sole justification. The Supreme Court's website silently concedes this by citing *Marbury* and not the ""judicial review clause"" of the Constitution.

So it's high time Congress wakes the hell up, takes back its power, and reverse the continued atrophy of legislative power (the most democratic, gerrymandering aside) and halt the expansion of judicial and executive power. We need a 28th Amendment that declares there is no ""judicial review"", voiding Marbury and clarifying that any delineating powers beyond the specifications of Article III jurisdiction belong to Congress alone. 

And no, doing this will not upend civil rights as we know it. The court itself hasn't been pro-individual liberties, excluding guns and religion, since the 1970s. For every *Obergfell* and *Miranda* we get I can cite 2 more where the court undermines individual freedom and our government. 

Dobbs upended a right but that's too easy. We have Dred Scott v. Sanford, which was not only judicial overreach it invalidated the Missouri Compromise and all but guaranteed we would be on track for the Civil War. The court also checked the Union's wartime powers, which Lincoln thankfully ignored until Taney died. We also have Buck v. Bell, where the court said eugenics wasn't unconstitutional (this hasn't been fully overruled), or Korematsu v. US where the court approved FDR's Executive Order to imprison Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Seriously, anyone who thinks judicial review at the level Congress has tolerated protects our rights is delusional. Korematsu has also not even overruled either. Roberts says it was ""wrong"" and ""exceeded the presidents powers"" in the *Hawaii v. Trump* decision, but still doesn't overrule it. 

And of course Bush v. Gore, where the court voted along partisan lines to halt a 537 vote recall in Florida. They overruled the state Supreme Court, which undermines the concern with ""judicial restraint"", another myth the court is said to follow. It's not secret they voted along party lines either, Justice Sandra Day O'Conner was upset at the thought of having to ""wait 4 more years before [my husband and I] could retire back to Arizona"". In a 2013 interview she later recanted taking the case and said the court shouldn't have bothered. A little late for that Sandra. 

At minimum I support a proposal Theodore Roosevelt made of allowing a citizen ballot referendum to overrule the Supreme Court. I'd also enjoin the court for 10 years so they can just recreate it under a different case brought before them. 

As the Danco/FDA affair out of the District Court of Northern Texas shows this is too much power for an unelected body, fully insulated from the consequences of their decisions, to have."

Pros:

* Easily noticeable
* Short and quick

Cons:

* Startling (being startled while trying to drive is potentially dangerous)
* Easy to use to express anger: it's sharp and can be repeated rapidly

[La Cucaracha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7vANMggH9I)

Pros:

* Easily noticeable
* Sounds funny, so cannot be used to express anger
* Melodic, so it's not as startling

Cons:

* Longer

Making the default sound for a car horn be La Cucaracha would reduce road rage, increase levity and joy while driving, and still be useful for getting people's attention. I see no significant downsides to this swap. "

By liberal arts, I don't mean every major other than STEM, but specifically the ones that people take to improve their cognitive abilities or their understanding of a topic either unrelated to a specific career field or related to a field in which only a small fraction of people have a career directly borne out of that major. So Political Science isn't included because  it commonly leads to law school while gender studies is because of the scarcity of jobs outside of highly specific therapy and academia. Also this is on a phone so excuse the formatting.

 Being wealthy isn't everyone's goal in life, but it's an undisputed fact that having a certain amount of money is required for a happy life in most cases. It's also an undisputed fact that minimum wage isn't enough. We often hear stories of liberal arts majors that have successful careers, but these can be divided into 2 categories. Category 1 is those that excelled in their field, eg. Bestselling writers or professors. These are rare enough that they don't have a major impact on the overall success of people in their field. On the other hand, we have people that achieved success in unrelated fields, such as a story I recently read about a gs major in IT. There's very few fields closed to people without a specific degree or major aside from medicine and law, but the starting salary of a cs major in cs will obviously be higher than that of a psychology major in cs, although experience will play a role as well. In the job market, liberal arts majors are barely better than general studies majors. 

Under very very few circumstances is a psychology major going to have as good of a post-graduation life as a doctor, or even help as many people. Unless you already have a fortune, having better reasoning skills will help nobody, least of all you. If you turn your hobby into a career, you'll no longer have a hobby. I don't remember who said that quote, but it's definitely true. No one is stopping you from writing a novel on the side or auditioning for roles in movies, but making that your career often leads to you getting tired of it."

I'm not going to deny that there is a mental health crisis in science. [I myself failed my PhD](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/12wr1dh/i_failed_my_phd_is_it_wrong_that_people_who/), and [I was already having a mental breakdown in the middle of it that further lowered my performance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/145ietq/how_can_i_stop_being_so_mentally_flimsy/) **But that is my fault for being a weak-minded dud of a student**. There are plenty of people that do successfully pass their PhDs, and it would be unfair on them to expect PhDs to be easier so I could have succeeded in mine.

However, the mental health crisis is not the main problem - instead, it's that STEM academia is undervalued. Here in Australia, [doing a PhD earns less than a minimum wage job](https://theconversation.com/how-are-phd-students-meant-to-survive-on-two-thirds-of-the-minimum-wage-185138). [And these underpaid PhD students comprise 60% of Australia's research workforce](https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/why-australia-s-smartest-people-are-living-on-noodles-and-pizza-20230525-p5db7l).

I'm currently doing casual work in bush regeneration while looking for a job in STEM, and even if I work only 3 days a week, that job will earn me more money than doing a PhD. I am not trying to disparage bush regeneration here, I am using this as an example to show just how undervalued STEM academia are.

As for STEM academia being ""toxic"", it seems that it **needs** to be that way. Research is very hard work, and seeking funding can be very competitive. There is often a very good reason why your supervisor or journal editors or thesis reviewers send back scathing feedback - because STEM research ought to be carried out to high standards. It needs to be ""toxic"" for the same reason that the SAS or French Foreign Legion need to be toxic - because it has no room for duds. But when STEM academia are underpaid on top of all that it leads to 3 things:

1. People leave STEM academia because you can make more money in industry or government
2. Only people from well-off backgrounds can afford to even try to enter STEM academia, potentially blocking poor but hardworking and intelligent people from joining the field
3. Research output is hampered because researchers are more concerned about being able to pay for rent and fuel than their actual work

**Edit #1**: Don't pity me for failing, pity my supervisors because I failed them.

**Edit #2:** [In Australia, around 80% of people who start a PhD eventually successfully complete it](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1267338.pdf). This is a sign that ""toxicity"" isn't a barrier to most PhD students, but meanwhile, [costs of living are still skyrocketing](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/au/personal-finance/cost-of-living-in-australia/), so that's the main hardship for students now.

**Edit #3:** Also, going back to the original article that inspired this post, those ""toxicity"" problems are widespread throughout society. It's an unfortunate phenomenon that we ought to fix, but it certainly isn't something that STEM academia should be singled out for."

Some of these features include waterproof materials (not that special or hard to find), removable sleeves (where the hell are you going to put them now? In your jacket pockets? Now your jacket looks stupid), 2 way zippers that go different ways (not special or hard to find), quick release zippers (zippers are already faster than buttons, who cares that I can open a zipper a bit faster), some jackets you can take the hoodie off and mix and match colors from the hoodies and jackets (… for the price of multiple multi-hundred dollar jackets I can just get a ton of different jackets), the jacket has a sling strap where you can take off the jacket and use the sling to carry the jacket (now you look fucking stupid) (he also does a pull on the strap super fast like it makes him look cool or something but imo it’s just cringy), some pants have magnetic pockets (he claims it’s “to store your goods securely” like zippers don’t exist which are more secure than some dinky magnets), he shows a jacket that can be flipped inside out (not unusual), he shows multiple jackets with different zippers like one in the armpit area so that your pits can breathe (looks fucking stupid and if you have to let your pits breathe then you shouldn’t be wearing a jacket anyway), he shows a jacket with ventilation (he shows it like it’s a cool feature but it’s not unusual to have this, shows a stupid ass jacket with a deployable pocket (it’s a pocket that goes on the inside of another pocket with a zipper and he takes it out and it magnetically sticks to the outside of the jacket, stupid as fuck since now it makes the previous larger zippered area useless since things can fall out and looks fucking stupid, shows a front flap that he says “can reveal your badge” like it’s not always supposed to fucking show anyway (yes, a name badge), shows an inside pocket on the same flap like it’s a cool feature even though it’s literally just an inside pocket, shows a magnetized area of the front of a jacket for sticking your AirPods on (the least secure place for your AirPods ever), also says the same flap “integrates” your sling bag into your jacket… it literally covers like 2 inches of the strap leaving the rest exposed and looks you guess it fucking stupid, shows a quick release buckle on a sling bag (how is this a feature? It’s a fucking buckle that’s not new, also who the fuck cares about a quick release sling bag there’s no situation I can think of where I would need to take off a bag quickly enough that it matters), shows a stupid ass show and says he loves it for techwear since it has good grip (wow amazing), is comfortable (wow amazing), is breathable (wow mesh), and says his favorite feature is the waterproof zipper (the shoe has zippers instead of laces, shoe looks cool but his justifications for liking the shoe are fucking stupid, he shows a bomber jacket with a collar that isn’t flat but stays up more like a regular shirt collar (good idea, absolutely stupid to call it a tech feature)

1,2023-06-17,CMV: Reddit's upcoming API pricing is not outrageous,u/MrMaleficent,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14bqy1e/cmv_reddits_upcoming_api_pricing_is_not_outrageous/,changemyview,"I'm sure most people have seen the recent protests and blackouts on Reddit over the ""outrageous"" pricing Reddit is adding for their API. This pricing being the company will charge $12,000 for 50 million API requests. Many people seem to believe this pricing is so ridiculous it's actually an attempt to completely shutdown 3rd party clients.
I do not believe Reddit's pricing is absurd, and this entire issue has been blown way out of portion.

I'll break down why I feel this way into two sections

#  The Imgur Comparison

I think the main reason people feel Reddit's pricing is insane, is because of the following quote from the Apollo developer

> [For reference, I pay Imgur (a site similar to Reddit in user base and media) $166 for the same 50 million API calls.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_title&embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F5%2F31%2F23743993%2Freddit-apollo-client-api-cost)

There's one gigantic issue with that statement. Imgur's public API pricing is actually [$3,333 for 50 million API calls](https://rapidapi.com/imgur/api/imgur-9/pricing). I have no idea if Selig is lying, I don't know if he was grandfathered into a significantly cheaper plan, and I don't know if he was just being misleading on purpose..i'm just not gonna address that.

But even in the best case scenario where Imgur privately just gave Selig a far cheaper deal, Reddit's upcoming API pricing should not be compared to Selig's private deal. It should be compared to Imgur's public pricing, therefore Reddit's API is only going to be 3.6 times more expensive than Imgur's API. A far cry from the widely spread 72 times more expensive, and I think it's perfectly understandable Reddit's API would be about three times more expensive than Imgur's, because Reddit hosts more complicated data including much longer videos.

# Operating Costs

The other reason I feel like the price is perfectly fine is when you compare the per user costs to Reddit premium.

Selig says he calculated an estimated cost for these changes to be [$2.50 per month per user.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_title&embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F5%2F31%2F23743993%2Freddit-apollo-client-api-cost) Putting that into perspective. A user would be getting an ad free Reddit experience for $2.50 per month. Reddit premium, whose primary selling feature is no ads, costs $6.99 per month. Reddit is basically giving developers a wholesale discount on Reddit premium for their users, and there's plenty of room between $2.5 and $6.99 for a 3rd party app developer to make profit even when accounting for development costs.

If we look at Apollo costs specifically, the subscription prior to the pending shutdown was [$1.50 per month](https://apolloapp.io/pro-ultra/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20subscription%20of,Why%20a%20subscription%3F). If we just add the old subscription to the new API costs, he would have to charge only $4 a month to make the exact same profit per subsciption. That price is still undercutting Reddit premium, and would continue to heavily incentivize users who hate ads to use Apollo over Reddit Premium.

Just for comparison here's some ad free memberships with other companies. 

Company | Price
:--|:--:|--:
Hulu | $14.99 per month
Youtube | $11.99 per month
Spotify | $9.99 per month
Twitter | $7.99 per month
Imgur | $4.99 per month

---

Anyone is welcome to try and change my view that the pricing is completely fair and within reason."

1,2023-06-17,CMV: I think traditional gender roles are needed for developing countries.,u/Sandy_hook_lemy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14bsg1h/cmv_i_think_traditional_gender_roles_are_needed/,changemyview,"In developing ountries, there is often a need for a clear division of labor in order to ensure that basic needs are met. Like in many developing countries, women are responsible for the majority of household chores and this frees up men to work labour intensive jobs  since  these countries  not industrial and men are generally more stronger than women

Developed countries, on the other hand, are often in a better position to do away with traditional gender roles. This is because they have the resources to invest in education and childcare, which can help to free up both men and women to participate in the workforce  and have the technology to use automation making these roles redudant.

This may also explain why developing countries tend to be less socially progressive.

Might be wrong tho

Edit: I have used ""needed"" wrong here. I meant to say that gender roles will organically manifest due to the limited resources and opportunities in a developing country"
1,2023-06-17,CMV: capital letters are unnecessary and should be abolished.,u/QuadNarcaLover,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14bsytq/cmv_capital_letters_are_unnecessary_and_should_be/,changemyview,"capital letters are unnecessary and should be abolished. they serve no real purpose other than to make some words look more important than others. this is unfair and misleading. capital letters also create confusion and inconsistency in writing. for example, why do we capitalize the first word of a sentence but not the last? why do we capitalize some directions like north but not others like east? why do we capitalize some titles like 'Commander' but not others like teacher? there is no logic or reason behind these rules.

capital letters also waste time and space. they require more keystrokes and ink than lower-case letters. they take up more room on a page or a screen. they slow down the reading process by interrupting the flow of words. they make writing harder by forcing us to remember arbitrary rules and exceptions. essentially, we end up with 52 letters instead of 26, even in computers you have to account for case sensitivity and other nonsense because of the capital letters.

the most common barrier faced by non-english speakers trying to learn the language is the confusion caused by capital letters. most non-european languages do not have multiple symbols for the same letter. for example how would an alien know that 'A' and 'a' refer to the same letter/sound. those two look nothing alike. same for 'G' and 'g', 'E' and 'e' or literally any other letter. lower-case letters are easier to read and write. they are more consistent and uniform. they are more democratic and inclusive. they do not discriminate between words based on their perceived importance or status.

therefore imo, capital letters should be abolished. they are unnecessary and harmful. they cause more problems than they solve. they are outdated and obsolete. lower-case letters are enough for all our writing needs. they are simple and beautiful.

i am willing to listen to alternative viewpoints, especially from people who learnt english as their second or third language."

Due to this being an incredibly detailed issue I will try to list all of my grievances with the movement. But I will most defiantly miss a couple

* The main points of the movement deny much of the conventional wisdom about basic nutrition. This being conventional wisdom that has only been reaffirmed by scientific checks and as far as I am aware has not been substantially disproven reasonably or scientifically.
* Through this does not say much of the ideology itself more of a general annoyance, Many of it’s arbiters are incredibly sensitive and parrot any genuine criticism as “Fatphobic”. This attitude has created a severe lack of self-awareness within the movement, as no one is being criticized.
* It misunderstands the reason why such a thing as “fatphobia” would exist. Because that is a biologically unnatural state. In the wild, you cannot hunt for food or even collect barriers if you are 400 pounds. Let alone get to that weight in the first place. Any negative consequences caused by obesity are completely natural. Even in the civilized world, infrastructure and clothing is usually based around people of a relatively normal weight, because massively obese people would be extremely expensive to accommodate. Not because these companies are “Fatphobic” but simply because that is a natural consequence of morbid obesity.
* It is an ideology formed of apathy in The face of addiction. Overeating addiction is a major health concern and fat acceptance is attempting to hide the eating disorder in a thin veneer of an oppressed people. Ultimately, people who parrot this ideology as an excuse to guzzle down junk food are going to kill themselves. And the last few years of their life will be miserable too. As there bodies decline like all inevitably do, their organs will struggle to accommodate their weight. Their obesity affectively amplifying the negative consequences of aging.
* Though this is a relatively minor grievance, this movement has also hijacked the “body positivity” movement. Originally began for genuinely disabled individuals, those with odd skin conditions , those who lost their limbs in an accident etc."
1,2023-06-17,CMV: Modern China is a fascist state and proves that classical (Italian) fascism can work better on a large scale than Communism.,u/Serious-Trade-4405,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14buwpc/cmv_modern_china_is_a_fascist_state_and_proves/,changemyview,"Some time ago a friend asked me if I was ‘against literal Fascism’ more as a joke than as an actual question. The term is always thrown around by Socialists to insult everyone who isn’t a socialist, and by liberals to insult far-right extremists and Socialists, and basically everyone always claims not to be a fascist when accused, so it must be bad. Of course my answer was immediately yes, but then he asked me why, and I honestly couldn’t come up with an immediate answer. So I started to research what fascism was, and I realized that it was different than I had thought. Classical Italian fascism (not national socialism!) has the following defining characteristics:

  
\-	The idea that the individual is less important than the nation (or group) as a whole, essentially anti-individualism and very collectivist. From this assumption follow many other fascist principles, for instance, that the suppression of the Intelligentsia is justified because it is necessary for the nation to flourish, that war isn’t necessarily bad if it serves the interests of the nation, for whilst individuals may die, the group as a whole will become stronger, the principle that it’s okay to take away certain personal liberties from certain individuals, etc.

  
\-	Paligenetic nationalism: extreme nationalism, which in fascism is often combined with the idea that the nation was once great, fell, but can made great again through nationalism and other means.

  
\-	Corporativism, a fascist economic model which can best be described as a mostly capitalist one, but where the state has sufficient power to intervene in the economy when it deems it necessary for the people (or itself), and also controls certain parts of the economy which have been nationalized. Usually 10% or 20% of the economy is state-controlled, where the rest of the economy is capitalist, otherwise known as state capitalism.

  
\-	Traditional and conservative social values.

  
\-	An authoritarian government which controls the media and curbs individual liberties such as freedom of speech (which is critical of the state) for the good of the nation.

  
And China, despite claiming to be Communist, has ALL of these values. The economic mixed market (corporativism), the conservative social values, the idea that the group is more important than the individual, the nationalism, an authoritarian government. And it certainly does not have the main defining characteristic of Socialism: A mostly state-controlled (nationalized) economy, and the destruction of the ‘evil’ bourgeoisie; in fact, China has MULTIPLE billionaires. 

  
And one of the main fascist theorists (who are alive today), Ken Griffith, agrees with me that China is no longer Communist, and has been becoming increasingly fascist for a long time.

  
This brings me to my final point: Classical Italian Fascism works better than Maoism, a form of Communism, and also just communism in general. Communism wants to transition from a society with money to classless, stateless society. This will be achieved through simultaneously making the economy grow to the point where there is such an overflow of wealth and goods that the transition is possible, and by creating communes, small village-like communities which will be able to make the transition when the time comes. (I know this is a little bit Oversimplified but I have a migraine at this point so I’m just trying to get through the rest of this post quickly)

  
One such an attempt, mainly for economic growth, was the great leap forward, a social and economic programme conceived by ‘chairman’ Mao, to undergo a century of economic progress in 5 years or less. This project was mismanaged so terribly that 40-50 million Chinese died in a few years through grain deficits. The great leap forward was (and is) extremely complex, but the upshot is that Mao was replaced, tens of millions of Chinese people died, and there was some, but not sufficient to justify the cost in human lives, economic growth. Eventually, Mao came back in a ‘revolution within a revolution’ in which 20 million more Chinese died.

  
So, Communism in China killed tens of millions and achieved little economic growth. Then, after this terrible failure and Mao’s eventual death, China transitioned slowly, very slowly, to a more fascist state. Many of the Fascist principles were already there, such as an authoritarian government and collectivist ethos, but over time it gained the rest of the defining features, mainly the corporativist economic system. 

  
Ever since it has been more Fascist than Communist, China has had massive economic growth, having an average rate of 10% economic growth per year between 1990 and 2004. Its fascist economic system allowed it to completely recover from the 2008 market crash through public spending, unlike the US, and it has the second largest army and one of the biggest navies in the the world. There are bad things too, of course, like the mistreatment of Uyghur people, but that is (IMO) way better than the  (at least) 40 million who died in the cultural revolution. Note: I am talking about classical Fascism, NOT National Socialism, which I do indeed believe to be worse than Communism.

  
TL;DR: Current China is far more fascist than Communists, and its history has proven to me that classical Italian Fascism works better than Maoism. Change my view.

You would for example think about trading, well you wouldn't need to trade anymore since money wouldn't be a thing and since the whole point of trading is money. If you are doing for hobbies, traders would be able to create their own currency which would be used to buy/sell goods in their own ways. However, this currency would be pointless as its only a collectible and since everything is free wouldn't be something that you can exploit, so if you take a lot of things for free and exchange them for the trading currency, youd only have that collectible currency that yes you can use to buy bigger things but youd always have access to those for free anyway so its not really possible to exploit that and it would just remain as a hobby. Secondly, I think technology would develop rapidly, more than it does today, since access to resources would be free (the only problem would be to balance resources and not exploiting them) and since homelessness, famine and all that would be cured, we would have many (and I mean a lot) of people who had potential that went unnoticed enrolling into life as they now have the opportunity to share their ideas and if nothing they are extra manpower so its a win win for technology. Everyone would also be pretty well-educated and would have all the resources they need to contribute to any problem that exists with whatever idea they have. Furthermore, youd say people are greedy and would overtake, overuse and exploit resources since everything is for free, but I believe it is not hard at all to implement a machine-operated security system all around the world to keep people away from doing this. Since we would have all the resources we need for free, we wouldn't have issues while implementing the security system in every area which needs to be protected and this therefore would stop people from overtaking/exploiting since the risks would be too high considering the rewards and nobody would take that risk either way. You would also say, yes all of this is great, but we need work power, and considering the abolishment of money, nobody would want to work right? Wrong. Infact, I believe people would be even more motivated to work simply because if nobody works, nobody will get access to anything new and live out a stagnant life without being able to advance, furthermore, they also wouldn't revolt since they already receive what everyone produces for free so their work being given for free would not be a moral consideration, and I believe the rapid growth in technology would manage to automate everything from factories to security either way so they wouldn't even have to work for a long time. However, I believe that there will still be people who choose not to work but I don't think that amount will be in majority compared to people who want to work, most scientists today do their jobs for contribution and development rather than money as an example. I know factory workers, construction workers etc.. have it harsh, but their conditions can be easily improved and it would be no hard job to keep them entertained living like kings in their workplace since everything is free the employer wouldn't need to cut off anything from the budget and would be able to provide the best workplace possible for the employees which is another source of motivation. The only issue I can't really answer now is resource management and power management, Im trying to develop ideas on what to do on those since raw material is limited on earth and producing power is no easy job considering how demanding it would be to supply for with the rapid decline in homelessness, considering they all move to a house and use electricity, considering technology also uses a lot of electricity and power to advance, so does the factories, power and energy consumption would be a huge deal. Renewable sources are a good idea but they are not always enough and we'd need something more consisten that those to store energy and nuclear energy and power plants would be too harmful to the environment considering the large amounts we need. When it comes to raw material, I want to believe that we would be able to develop technology to clone non-living things even though their complex form. It is theoretically possible to clone a living thing so why wouldn't we be able to clone a non living thing afterall? Maybe in a world without money more people would have the time and resources to commit to this thought and develop ideas to overcome these issues since they would be listened to unlike todays world."

After twenty years of on-time payments for undergraduate loans, any forgiven debt is forgiven but forgiven debt may be treated as taxable income to the IRS.

Why should REPAYE be the default repayment plan and not the *Standard* repayment plan? Well, the goal of repayment should be to minimize defaults on loans and a lower payment should reduce the likelihood of borrower default. Also, if REPAYE is the default repayment plan, borrowers who would be struggling with the monthly payments for the *Standard* repayment plan should be fine with the monthly payment under REPAYE.

Lower defaults and not having to manually change repayment plans if a borrower's income is low is a great way to streamline student loan payments and minimize defaults."

Now the keyword there is punish, I don’t think we should let 13 year olds buy liquor for example.

And to be logically consistent I would apply this to parenting as well, I think the proper response to catching your kid smoking and drinking would be to take it and tell them they can have it when they get a little older and can make informed, rational decisions for themselves, and then move on. This is also what I think a cop should do if he sees a “minor in possession”. It’s a victimless crime in which the person being charged did no moral wrong in the first place.

31,2023-06-17,CMV: Jake Paul Fights are Rigged,u/TigerDriverCentral,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14c15m4/cmv_jake_paul_fights_are_rigged/,changemyview,"I tried to search this on Reddit, and the last post I found was from 2021 (admittedly, on this sub), but I’d like to make an updated post for 2023 in light of his upcoming boxing bout against Nate Diaz and his last few fights since then, as this is something I’ve been very conflicted on since Paul’s boxing debut.

I was looking at tickets recently for the Diaz bout, and I’m tempted to go just for the spectacle (and despite training boxing and a few other martial arts for years I’ve never seen a live card) but I still can’t shake the feeling that something doesn’t feel totally legitimate about Paul’s meteoric ascension in the world of fighting. His first two fights were definitely against cans (I mean one was a former basketball player) and you can definitely make the argument, without much needing to convince on my part, that he could have legitimately beat Ben Askren who even in the UFC was quickly outclassed on his feet by being a predominantly grappling guy before MMA, but since those fights you are asking me to suspend my disbelief by a large margin, especially since throwing fights isn’t something that just happens in old gangster movies anymore (see, PRIDE)

I think the two Tyron Woodley bouts are what totally solidified in my mind the doubt I had to the legitimacy of these fights. I mean, Woodley certainly was on a losing streak after losing his title, but he was also top of his division in the UFC only 2 1/2 years before fighting, and subsequently losing twice, to someone who only debuted within a year and a half of their first bout together, compared with Woodley’s background of 15 years of experience solely in MMA, without even mentioning his D1 wrestling background (not that it’s relevant to boxing of course)

Then, the guy went the distance with Anderson Silva. For some people, Silva may seem like an anachronism. But to people like myself, who came of age in the late 2000’s, Silva was the undisputed GOAT of the MMA world. I know he had some disappointing showings in his last few MMA bouts, but I would like to believe, maybe naively, that Anderson Silva on his worst day even just doing standup could outclass 75% of most fighters with even a few years of experience. I am also aware that he lost his first bout to Tommy Fury more recently, but Fury is still very relevant in the world of boxing, and has a lot more to lose in terms of reputation than people like Woodley or Silva who are on their way out from the limelight of the world of combat sports.

Which brings me to another point; many people claim “well why would they throw their fights? They don’t want to tarnish their reputation!” For one, these fights seem to be primarily sponsored by entertainment companies. I know the upcoming bout is put on by DAZN, which makes it seem somewhat legitimate to me, but otherwise people like Woodley or Silva have a lot more to gain in a “fixed fight” scenario with all the pomp and maybe illusory circumstance of a typical boxing match where they can still walk off with a large, probably undisclosed amount of money for adding to the star power of the still young and relevant Paul all while playing into the rigor and prestige of an actual fight. The same seems to go for Diaz.

While boxing is a much different beast when isolated from the broader view of MMA; like wrestling, or BJJ, and I do believe those are arguments which have some standing, maybe I just dislike this arrogant prick so much that I find it hard to believe that with only a couple years of experience and training he can now suddenly go toe to toe with a rogues gallery of the some of the most infamous names in the world of combat sports.

Where is the guarantee that the therapist won't fuck you up if they are offered more money? Think MK Ultra project where psychologists/psychiatrists were carrying out cruel experiments on unknowing patients.

Money. Why on earth do they charge 3-4x an engineer hourly pay, when becoming a psychologist doesn't require as much effort and time as getting an engineering degree or a medical school?

I could afford therapy, don't get me wrong, but I simply cannot understand how you can tell your deepest wounds to someone who will ditch you in a second once you are no longer able to give them money.

3,2023-06-17,CMV: Disparity in Recognizing Organized Crime Reflects Biases and Misconceptions,u/JBJGoat999,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14c241b/cmv_disparity_in_recognizing_organized_crime/,changemyview,"I’ll say why I think that society and the FBI think the way they do about these organizations at the end.   
  
I would like to discuss an observation that has been on my mind lately, regarding the way society and the FBI categorize and perceive organized crime. I find it strange that certain criminal organizations, such as the Italian Mafia, drug cartels, triads, and yakuza, are commonly seen as ""organized crime,"" while many black street gangs seem to be excluded from that perception.  
  
Society attributes those ‘organized crime’ organizations with traits like intelligence, organization, strict codes, and well-defined hierarchies. However, it appears that this level of recognition is not consistently extended to black street gangs.   
  
This discrepancy in perception creates a clear division where these well-known criminal organizations are placed in one category, while black street gangs are often relegated to a separate, less prestigious one. This distinction raises questions about the biases and misconceptions that shape our collective understanding of organized crime.   
  
I know that there have been rare instances where the FBI has employed the RICO statute against street gangs. However, correct me if I’m wrong, this mostly occurs when there is someone famous or influential associated with that gang right? If so, that’s a pretty strange policy position on the FBI’s part, that black street gangs are not organized crime or worth their attention unless there’s someone famous in that gang.   
  
I’m going to address some of the factors that I think society & the FBI look at when they think about who is and isn’t considered an ‘organized crime’ organization or at least a serious, competently run criminal organization.   
  
**Point one: Longevity of the organization**  
  
Despite the longevity and continuous operation of certain street gangs, such as the Black Gangster Disciples (BGD), they still struggle to be recognized and treated as serious criminal organizations. The BGD, which traces its roots back to the late 1960s, has been active for several decades, engaging in various illicit activities and exerting influence in Chicago communities.   
  
The fact that these street gangs have maintained a presence and perpetuated criminal activities over an extended period raises questions about why they are not consistently regarded as serious organizations. While it is true that the BGD and similar groups may not exhibit the same level of international reach or hierarchical structure as some well-known criminal syndicates, it does not diminish the impact they have on the communities they operate in.   
  
If they’re so unorganized how is it possible that the authorities haven’t been able to eliminate them for the last 60 years?  
  
**Point two: Geographic Reach**  
  
I think a lot of people feel like having a large geographic reach is required for a criminal organization to be considered ‘serious’. I don’t think these people are thinking that there are both advantages and disadvantages with doing that.   
  
One significant advantage of black street gangs staying local is their adaptation to their environment. Operating internationally is not inherently superior to operating within a specific block or neighborhood. Black street gangs have thrived by focusing on their immediate surroundings, allowing them to establish deep roots, local connections, and a better understanding of their community's dynamics. The success of these gangs, in terms of revenue generation and influence, should not be dismissed simply because they do not operate on a larger scale.  
  
Are people not considering that the decision to avoid expanding into international territories might also reflect a conscious choice by black street gangs to protect themselves from heightened scrutiny and intervention by larger authorities? By staying local, black street gangs have largely avoided being targeted on a larger scale. Ironically, their ability to evade targeting due to their limited geographical reach points to a level of organization and strategic thinking within these groups.   
  
This goes for many of these sections but I’ll put it here. I think it’s important to evaluate organized crime in a nuanced manner, considering the specific dynamics and strategies employed by different groups.Just because these organizations don’t match exactly with the definitions that we’ve created for organized crime does not mean that they’re not important or worthy of attention.   
  
**Point three: Decentralization**   
  
One significant factor that often goes unnoticed by those unfamiliar with the intricacies of black street gangs, such as the Bloods, is the decentralized nature of their organization. Many people might not realize that groups like the Bloods are not a monolithic entity but rather consist of various sets and factions scattered across the country. While there may be loose affiliations and shared cultural elements, they do not operate under a centralized leadership or command structure.  
  
It is worth considering that the decentralization of black street gangs could be perceived by society and the FBI as a reason to discredit them as serious or organized crime groups. This inconsistency becomes apparent when we examine how other criminal organizations that manage to establish decentralized operations are often deemed more dangerous or threatening. However, when it comes to black street gangs, this decentralization is used to undermine their significance.   
  
**Point four: Security and vetting**   
  
The ability of black street gangs to maintain a common culture and a sense of identity across different sets throughout the country is an impressive achievement. For instance, if a member of the Bloods from Florida were to end up in a California state prison, local Bloods from the California area would have the knowledge and ability to vet that individual, determining their authenticity as a member of the gang, even if they had never encountered that person's particular set before. This level of cohesion and recognition demonstrates a remarkable level of communication and shared values among members, despite the geographic distance between them.   
  
An important aspect that should be taken into consideration when examining the recognition of black street gangs as organized crime is the difficulty law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, may face in infiltrating these groups. While the FBI routinely employs undercover agents to infiltrate various criminal organizations, such as biker gangs, white power groups, militias, and extremist organizations, there is a notable absence of publicly known cases involving successful infiltration of modern-day black street gangs. A lot of these groups are made up of people that grew up together as kids, or people that were already teenagers/adults and saw these people grow up in the neighborhood. They’re inherently vetted… You can’t just show up to a street gang as a 25 year old guy and be like hey guys I just moved to the neighborhood can I join your gang? Most of these people have known each other for a long time.   
  
**Point five: Willingness, and success rate in committing violence**   
  
I think part of what society looks at when they think about what organizations are serious or a threat is how likely those organizations are to commit violence. By that metric, black street gangs are far more actively engaged in committing violence on behalf of their gangs than all the ‘organized crime’ groups I mentioned above besides drug cartels. It’s also important to note that while people in these gangs do get arrested for violent crimes, they definitely get away with it pretty often. The clearance rate for murders in black neighborhoods in Chicago is around 21%, compared to 45% in white Chicago neighborhoods. So these gangs are clearly committing high levels of violence and getting away with it.   
  
**Conclusion:**   
  
Why do I think that people think this way? The TLDR of it is that these gangs mostly impact other black people and I think society just doesn’t care about it because it doesn’t impact them and the FBI’s priorities are downstream from society."

The first is do the plaintiffs have standing. While the second is it it is at all legal. 

It should be clear to anyone that the two plaintiffs don’t have standing at all. The first plaintiff, the states or specifically Missouri, have claimed that MOHELA would lose revenue and thus hurt them. However, it has been established before by the court that you cannot sue on someone else’s behalf or just because they would get hurt. It should be also said that MOHELA is a nonprofit and have said that this wouldn’t affect them at all and they declined to sue the administration. 

The second plaintiff, the people, are suing because they don’t qualify for the forgiveness. This also doesn’t have standing because we have many programs in America that you must qualify for to receive. This would open up a slew of issues. 

Finally the issue of if it’s legal. This case is about the plaintiffs so I’m not sure if the court can rule if it’s legal or not in this case but if Covid is a national emergency or was at the time of issuing this then Biden does have the authority.

However this will ultimately be up to the court but I don’t see how they could oppose it from a legal standpoint."

13,2023-06-17,CMV: Most anime characters are drawn to appear Caucasian,u/dcdsks,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14c6c8n/cmv_most_anime_characters_are_drawn_to_appear/,changemyview,"Firstly, I'd like to point out that I am a fully East Asian woman, so please do not make jabs at my ethnicity and how it might affect my perception of anime characters. I understand there are a lot of animes that reasonably make East Asian-looking characters, and I'll list a few to be fair, but I think there are even more that do not. Also, I will be shortening the phrase ""East Asian"" to ""Asian"" for clarity although I acknowledge Asia encompasses a very large part of the world.

Firstly, a lot of anime characters have colorful hair and eyes. I've seen some people argue that it's because they dyed them, but we also see many of those same characters born with that hair. One character who comes to mind is [Mary Saotome from Kakegurui](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kakegurui/images/5/52/MaryAuction.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190714213032), who has no indication in the anime that she is Caucasian or of Caucasian descent and whose name is in Kanji. I could see the argument that color is used to differentiate characters, but I think exceptional animes like [Dragon Ball](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/63/Dragon_Ball_Main_Characters.jpg/300px-Dragon_Ball_Main_Characters.jpg) do a good job of making the characters look Asian with natural hair/eye colors, while still having facial features that set them apart from each other.

I don't hear this point brought up a lot, but as someone who grew up in a culture where the shape of one's eyelid is very important, I notice a lot of anime characters have very defined, high eyelid creases that are unnatural for full Asians. I, myself, have double eyelids, but the ones that I see often drawn in anime, [in Demon Slayer for example](https://www.looper.com/img/gallery/just-how-powerful-is-demon-slayers-nezuko/l-intro-1665597253.jpg), are thick and deep enough to cast shadows on the upper eyelid area, which Asian eyelids rarely do. Every time I see a Demon Slayer cosplay makeup video, the MUA always puts on multiple layers of eyelid tape to achieve deep creases. [Sailor Moon](https://mangainsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Sailor-Moon-Characters-Guide-Child-Pillar-1.png) and [Toradora](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tora-dora/images/a/a6/Volume1_cover_transparent.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width/360?cb=20160508051704) (with the exception of Taiga) are animes that demonstrate how easily artists can draw Asian-looking eyelids, so I feel like if the other artists wanted to, they would. But they don't.

Furthermore, the side profiles in anime are [so sharp for no reason](https://www.otaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cropped-1Orf1jMK1jfZ2iN9St1UWuw-1024x614.png). A lot of anime characters' side profiles have noses and chins that could cut butter-again, if they wanted to make more realistic profiles for Asians, they would; because all it takes is drawing rounder lines instead of sharp corners. I even see some cosplayers putting in [nose inserts](https://soranews24.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/08/sub62.jpg?w=580) or [using a clay-like product to build onto their nose bridge](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fake-nose-job-wax-1542140019.jpg). I'm so bewildered because how can someone look at [Light Yagami](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Light_from_Death_Note.jpg/220px-Light_from_Death_Note.jpg) and tell me that isn't a [WHITE MAN](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/4d/f0/7f/4df07fb6525bf9245383a891ca06711b.jpg)!"

With the rise of social media and the body-builder lite (people who body build not to compete but for a social media following/influence) this attitude has spread into the general fitness community.

The mark of someone who runs long distances, climbs mountains, swims, etc is a low resting heart rate (40-50bpm). TRT/steroid injections raise your resting heart rate significantly. You'll probably notice this effect way before any changes in appearance/strength. This makes cardio difficult and competetive cardio nearly impossible. Your heart rate raises whether you're doing 200mg TRT for the middle aged, or 500-1000mg test + 5 other supporting compounds for the professional bodybuilders, or the retarded cocktails/cycles of SARM gym-bros. This reduced ability is the reason you see so many peoples' entire fitness journey limited to gym. Their heart can't support strenuous activity beyond 6-12 reps of heavy weight.

Steroid use is so rampant due to social media culture that many young people cannot even identify what natural progress is. You've got 16 year old boys going from twigs to greek gods within the span of a year. You've got women pushing supplements who went from no ass to huge within months. People are forgetting you can have a great body and achieve all around fitness because they take shortcuts right to the great body part. Why does no one question how people get on Instagram and within months have ""better"" bodies than olympians?"

If you think your salary is low you should organize the union to protest or start a strike, ask your representatives to change the law, not ask us the customers to pay for it.

It's ridiculous to ask for tipping when your service time less than 30 seconds! I heard that some Apple stores are planning to ask for tipping! Can someone change my view that tipping culture is necessary?"

I gave him 5 ten digit numbers and he not only remembered them perfectly within seconds but also after 1 hours had passed!

Similarly there was a girl in my Engineering college who was a district level tennis player, took part in 2 major dramas, always volunteered for all creative and social activities and was a great foodie who loved to eat and cook. Inspite of all that, she scored an unbelievable 9.6 pointer(out of 10). I literally saw how she could remember complex engineering formulas by writing them once and also the techniques to solve 25 different types of sums(from 10 chapters).

Meanwhile I, an average student could not remember the formulas even after I wrote them and byhearted them more than 10 times daily!(And before you say formulas should be derived not mugged up, try doing it for tens of different formulas in a 3 hour exam). I ignored so many extra curricular cultural, charitable and artistic activities because I was not sure(and rightfully so as proved by the one semester I did take part) that I would be able to do these activities and still score well in the exams.

And I have pretty much seen the same pattern in job and professional life too ever since.

**The point is that** people these days like to throw around fancy words like 'Unrecognized genius is a cliche' and 'EQ and skills matter, not IQ' and 'Better yourself and IQ will follow'. While none of these phrases are false, it is extremely clear to me and my worldview that base intelligence and the ability to master any skill fast along with a high IQ is very very very real and people who are bright are not only able to have a great career more easily but they are also able to be more artistic, social and even charitable because they can do a range of activities while managing to excel at their main job in life(which can be cracking the final exam or their primary job).

That girl could afford to always help others and be seen as a 'kind and helping person' because unlike me, she never refused to help people in their work.

Why did I refuse them? I had no time to help them even if I wanted to since I was so busy trying to juggle my own activities.

&#x200B;

Some people like her can really master stuff lot faster and gain new skills quickly.

Similarly I have seen some people who are good natured but are honestly really 'dumb'(sorry I couldn't find a better word). I have seen a boy struggle so much with even the basics that his failing in exams was inevitable. And before you say 'He could have a hidden talent in guitar or chess or business'. No he honestly didn't atleast for the time when I saw him. I have seen old people in my office stuck on the same position for years because they honestly don't have the brains to tackle a promotion.

Lastly I have to mention that I have ADHD(I am currently pursuing Mtech in thermal engineering). I did not mention these details at the top because I didn't want you readers to be biased by these facts. They are the same for most average students.

Now, about the issues that will be raised

What if you pick someone unqualified? He or she learns on the job or dies trying.

What if there is gridlock? All laws proposed will be passed, no debate needed whatsoever and the individual on the street chooses which law to follow.

What if that someone does not want to do his or her part once selected? Jail or execute them for refusal.

What about regulating those who monitor the lottery selection? Infinite regress which means more work available for the unemployed.

Also, they've already been violent with others, and they've been asked by countless neighbors to keep their shit down. Its a repetitive issue, and I refuse to feel bad about calling the police without knocking. 6 AM, and most people around here only have sundays off. I'm going to try to go back to bed, because if I ask ""Hey, could you turn that down, please"", and they respond poorly, I'd need a lot of self control to keep from doing something stupid.

Also... people will say it's just music. No. Its MUCH more. To say the ABSOLUTE least, it's a neighbor who has no respect for the people living around them.  It's constant drugs, music, and prostitutes (Not even joking at all)

When our ancestors were roaming the world as small bands of hunter gatherers and they saw another group coming towards them they would need to make some very important risk assessments and choices. Firstly, they would need to decide whether it was worth engaging with that group or it was better to avoid them. This decision would have been helped along by an assessment of the composition of the group that was coming. I can imagine one of my ancestors asking another “How many women are part of the group?” so as to ascertain whether it was a band of warriors that might lead to violence, or a mixed group that might be more conducive to a peaceful exchange of goods and information. Can anyone imagine one of our ancient ancestors looking at another group of pre-historic humans and asking “How many men and women are in that group?” And the other answering “I don’t know their gender identities.” No, it’s too ridiculous because what matters, and what has always mattered, is not someone’s internal perception of their gender identity, which might not even exist, but the physical reality of their body, its capabilities, and its limitations."

Social media is a place where people post the most over exaggerated versions of themselves to digitally flex on people and this is widely known and accepted as the status quo, nobody is scratching their asscheeks on their Instagram (I hope).

I think that disconnected reality is already here and I’m not necessarily mad about it, I think there are definitely harms that can occur to certain individuals who immerse themselves too heavily in technology, such as social issues and self esteem problems, but these issues also existed before social media and times are changing.

I think the 3d video functionality of the headset is really cool in its ability to capture memories, but not necessarily be involved in them.

It is easy to think ""starving children in Africa"" and think of the horrors of colonialism, but that phrase/mentality comes from a series of 1980s commercials talking about a famine in Dergist Ethiopia - who were never colonized but instead a communist regime overthrew the emperor in 1974 and then starved a couple million people to death in the subsequent years. In turn the communists intentionally made the famine worse to get more economic aid. That is just one example among many, it was nearly every country from Somalia to Angola to Mozambique to Ghana. With communism being a revolutionary ideology, said revolutions systematically destroyed what little infrastructure did exist, created nothing, and then agricultural policy tended to starve their people.

Colonialism on the other hand stopped about 80 years ago at this point. There is little connection to colonialism in the present day in these countries, bar common languages being French and English and some minor remnants of infrastructure. There wasnt much ""taken"" from these countries in the name of colonialism - the only resources that have been exhaused are some gemstone deposits like Tanzanite, otherwise natural resources are largley untouched. Any remnants of colonial plantations are either still worked as farms or basically returned to the wild - that didnt get destroyed. This isnt to say that everything european colonialists did was good, far from it, but it is hard to draw a direct connection between that and present day suffering in subsaharan africa."

With that being said, If a person does not agree with someone being trans, this does not make them Transphobic.. Phobic is a person with an extreme or irrational fear of or aversion to something. Those who are against the trans community are not afraid of them, they may be naive, ignorant or simply don’t agree with the trans community.. but calling them transphobic is misguided and the term itself is thrown around too much."

The problem, as I see it, is that in order to protect your negative rights, you have to guarantee some sort of system of protection. Which requires positive rights for things such as fair judicial treatment, police, etc. Otherwise someone could just come up to you and burn your house down, put tape over your mouth, enslave you, etc.

_""But negative rights are inherent; they don't require other people.""_ Then there is no point in stating your rights in the first place if there is no protection for them. I can say something is morally right, sure, but then why differentiate between positive and negative? That differentiation is typically used in a political context, not soley to one's individual morality.


_""But I can protect my negative rights on my own.""_ Again, you can do that anyway. So that's pretty much synonymous to saying they are just moral rights. Plus, a single person cannot adequately protect themselves and their ""rights"" in many circumstances, especially from a large group of people or a government. That is why without requiring other people to protect those rights, those rights are merely a privilege, or something that you state yourself but has no inherent meaning other than you saying it. If a person were to infringe upon whatever you say your personal rights are; your supposed rights are useless unless there are other people to guarantee them/protect them.

_""You can have your rights protected by the government without requiring people to do things.""_ That would make them a privilege instead, since those rights are no longer guaranteed."

When the site first exploded over posts that all of the popular 3rd party apps (Apollo, RIF), the narrative was that he was likely doing so to consolidate value for the site in preparation for the IPO. The statement was made that monetization through the official app was likely higher. People were also worried that reddit might get rid of the old.reddit.com interface because it does not include a lot of the functionality reddit uses to make money.

Spez is a well known prepper with conservative tendencies, and that's not damning in and of itself. However, the article that came out recently about his conversation with Musk changed my mind in a fairly major way about the motivation behind reddit's actions.

Musk is a terrible person, no doubt, and he's no genius, but he also isn't an idiot. He was forced to buy Twitter, no question, but he was **not** forced to make the drastic changes he made. He could easily have made a few superficial changes to please his conservative base (forcing his tweets to the top to have a continuous conservative stream on the site would have been just innocuous enough), otherwise been hands off, and Twitter would have been mostly fine from a valuation standpoint. Musk did what he did to reduce the effectiveness of one of the largest non-conservative platforms on the internet. Anti-propaganda is a thing, and Musk's actions post-purchase (once he was stuck with it) definitely reduced the ability of non-conservatives to be heard. Musk could couch the entire change in the veil of ""I'm doing this to make Twitter profitable"" and his current public perception of incompetence and nobody could touch him on it. (Kind of like Boris Johnson.) You'd have to have an IQ in the 70s to think that the changes Musk's making to Twitter are to improve it, and Musk just isn't that dumb.

spez spoke to Musk, and now we're hearing the same exact story on a second massive mouthpiece for non-conservative information. ""Monetization!"" and people calling spez incompetent seem to be the statements of the past few days. It's the same tactic. A lot of the louder, older progressive voices have left the site, diminishing their importance. The rest of the reddit staff, who are nearly all likely politically progressive, can mutter to themselves, but because there's a business reason behind the change, they can pretend that the impact will be minor and nothing much will change.

White progressives cant achieve their political goals alone, and we're not gonna set aside our fight against racial oppression and just hope that they'll help us out later.  
  
  
  
Right now people of color have no good reason to trust white progressives, based our history of being discriminated against and left behind by ""color blind"" wealth redistribution efforts. So if they want minority support they're gonna need to actively fight for things like reparations, increased affirmative action, police reform, and other large scale antiracist efforts to undo the pervasive effects of white supremacy in all aspects of society. This means setting aside their privilege, working to unlearn their internalized racist ideas, and being willing to support policies and actions that don't immediately benefit them and may even cause them some short term discomfort.  
  
  
  
It feels like white progressives keep trying to ignore this uncomfortable truth, because they'd prefer to center their own needs over those who are suffering under racial oppression.

In America there are speed limits on roads that tell you how fast you can go on that specific road, if you break that speed limit and get caught, you usually end up getting a speeding ticket and possibly other fines, AKA punishment, **but what are you given if you** ***don't speed*** **and follow traffic rules?** you are given nothing and threatened with tickets and fines if you do, all punishment no reward. And not getting a ticket is not a reward, that is like saying your reward for not getting sent to time out is not getting sent to time out.

This simple philosophy can be spread to all aspects of our modern life controlled by government and authority, and well explains one of the reasons so many people view it all in a negative light.

So what exactly would I recommend as the solution to my previous example? How about a hypothetical where everyone who is given a drivers license is given either a significant discount on insurance and registration fees or sufficient financial assistance on vehicle repair based on them being in a ""responsible driver"" list. Doing things such as speeding, reckless driving, being majority/completely at fault for an accident like DUI not only fines you and tickets you, it gets you banned from this list for years at a time loosing all benefits. This way good drivers get rewarded, while bad drivers get punished. In such a system I predict driving violations would decrease significantly and opinion of public services would see an up-turn.

Title maybe confusing so let me explain

So as a straight guy, I put my category as a guy and indicate that I want to see women. There have been times when I've considered changing my category to a woman, which would result in me seeing women who are attracted to other women. The reason I don't do this is because I feel like it's disrespectful kind of dismissing their sexuality in a way. Plus I feel like it's just rude because these people are trying to find a particular person who they have decided they are attracted to and you're like ""look at me!"" 

So with this in mind I'm starting to notice an influx of this happening in various ways. One example, is a female, who identifies as a man and uses he/him pronouns...but still sets their profile as female. To me this is the same as a gay man setting their identification as a woman in order to try to match with straight men (which is also something that happens). 

The second (and possibly more confusing thing) is people who set their preferences to men, but then say they aren't interested in men and basically come up with different ways to say they are looking for women or transmen, often using misandrist language. The latest one I saw was someone's bio who said ""Only interested in men who use she/her pronouns"".

This is one of many reasons I deleted the app but one I don't really understand. To me it seems this is very obviously disrespectful in the same way as a straight guy changing his preferences to swipe on lesbians.

Stuff like tons of plastic and what not does not count, not to say that isn't bad and should be stopped (China, India looking at you...) but it's beyond the scope of this CMV. 

Now that that's out of the way, there's no evidence that climate change (as defined above) is bad for the world or even humans on net. After pouring through the research the only direct impact I found that was even proven to directly impact humans was rising ocean levels causing flooding, but a lot of places where plants couldn't previous grow are now becoming forests due to increased CO2 levels and the change in distribution of water around the world.

Every natural disaster and forest fire is blamed on climate change but there is little to no evidence that these are due to climate change at all, stuff like putting out small forest fires quickly and letting brush to build up is actually proven to be a big part of the problem but climate change? It's theoretically possible it plays a role in some areas of the world but as far as actual evidence? Very weak correlation is all we got. 

The fear is the increase heat is going to trigger some kind of chain of events which is ultimately disastrous but again there's no actual hard science suggesting any of that. Again it's theoretically possible but what specifically will happen that causes what specifically to happen? And are we just ignoring the potential for adaptation by both nature and humans? For example Humans can build sea walls and dams to deal with rising sea levels and many strains of coral have already adapted to higher ocean acidification. 

So ultimately to change my mind you'd have to show me with scientific proof (not appeal to authority actual data) what the specific consequences of climate change or some knock off effective of it are that will make the world significantly worse on net for life in general (ie. not one specific animal but reduce the total life on the planet) are or will make it the world worse for humans by a degree greater than the measures needed to stop it would."

I've recently been pondering the various fashion trends that have come and gone over the years. From bell-bottoms to neon windbreakers, we've seen it all. And who could forget those wild hairstyles of the eighties? The sheer audacity of it all! Looking back now, it's almost impossible not to chuckle.

Which brings me to my point: the Crocs trend. Popularized in the early 2000s, Crocs saw a resurgence in the last few years. And I firmly believe that future generations will view them in the same way we now view eighties hairstyles - with a mix of incredulity and amusement.

Here's why:

Aesthetic Appeal: Crocs, much like many eighties hairstyles, are often deemed 'ugly' or 'unfashionable', despite their comfort and functionality.
Trend Reversal: Fashion trends often come full circle. Crocs, like the big hair of the eighties, could become a source of mockery before eventually being seen as retro-cool.
Cultural Influence: Just as eighties hairstyles were a response to the cultural norms of the time, Crocs are a symbol of our era's emphasis on comfort over aesthetics. Future generations may find this amusing, just as we do with past trends.
Interestingly, Crocs have already been subject to mockery in pop culture. In the 2006 movie ""Idiocracy,"" the costume designer, working on a limited budget, chose Crocs for all the characters. They thought the shoes, made by a then-startup company, looked futuristic yet were too ridiculous to ever become popular in real life​1​.

In spite of my arguments, I'm open to having my view changed. If you think Crocs will escape the fate of eighties hairstyles and not be subject to future ridicule, I'd love to hear why. Maybe there's something about Crocs that will make them an enduring fashion statement, or perhaps they'll avoid becoming a source of mockery. Either way, I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

European countries, for the most part, have the benefit of agreeing with each other on the guns issue. Especially in the landlocked, or double landlocked countries that have banned or heavily restricted guns, who are surrounded on all sides by ***other countries*** that have also banned guns, and those countries are either also surrounded by other gun banning countries, or thousands of miles of ocean, or some combination of the two. It's a pretty natural setup for ""Nobody's smuggling illegal drugs into our country"".

But in the US, we already know how trying to ban stuff that people want works. Cartels get busy making deals, palms get greased, crates full of contraband get overlooked, and Bob's your uncle. The biggest thing I see facilitating this is gun manufacturers hopping the border into Mexico, and being the ones to work with the cartels directly, then pleading ignorance. ""How could we possibly know the cartels were buying mass amounts of our guns and sending them into the US?"", and other such statements. Given the general corruption of American business owners, I really find it hard to believe this wouldn't happen. And not just the gun companies, but foreign regimes we stand in opposition to, as well. Russia supported the cartels that were pumping drugs into the US during the late 1900s, I wouldn't put it past them to do the same here, just to cause unrest in the country. Same with any other country we're beefing with. So then we're wasting trillions of dollars, and another 50 years, on a failed war against something Mexican gangs are all to eager to provide.

If we want to take gun regulation, or even banning, seriously in the United States, I firmly believe that forcing Mexico to deal with the cartels, or even occupying the country to do it ourselves, is going to be a necessary first step. Or, seriously amping up border security. Part of the ***reason*** the war on drugs failed, is the lackluster, patchwork attempt at border security. If people really feel this strongly about guns being dealt with, maybe a giant Great Wall of America that costs a quarter, a third, or half of the yearly military budget to build isn't such a wasteful investment, after all. If we go full militant on this approach, like actual, serious, no nonsense, I think we could get it done. But accusations of racism hold that back. Would some people have racist motives for supporting this? Sure. But if a Klan member invented the cure for cancer, would you refuse to take it, ""just on principle""? And before anyone calls that a false equivalency, in both scenarios, there's a chance you die if you don't temporarily put up with them being a racist, and support them."

But by definition emergencies are anomalies and are far outside the norm.

My logic is as follows: if I, as a freelancer were to purchase my own insurance I would be paying between $300 and $600 per month, and I would only be able to see my normal doctor between 2 and 6 times a year depending on which plan I choose. This does not cover prescriptions, let alone vision or dental.

As someone with ADHD, if I want to obtain medication I'd need to see my doctor monthly. Also, as someone who lifts weight, its important for me to be able to see my GP somewhat regularly. I might pull something or need anti-inflammatories, which brings be to my next point.

For only $90 out of pocket, I can see my doctor once a month. For about the same amount, I can purchase my medication. This cost is a fraction of what I would be paying if I followed the plans laid out for me by the people in government and the insurance industry, which makes me wonder: Why would I be asked to pay many more times over for LESS access to healthcare than I've already got.

The only solution I've been able to come up with is that there is another group of people they're trying to subsidize. I think that older people who statistically draw more from the system are the focus of this push. Although I acknowledge that emergencies happen I don't feel that it is the focus or point of this machine.

This almost feels like it should be common sense, but apparently its not given how modern America seems to operate, let me give an example.  
In America there are speed limits on roads that tell you how fast you can go on that specific road, if you break that speed limit and get caught, you usually end up getting a speeding ticket and possibly other fines, AKA punishment, but what are you given if you don't speed and follow traffic rules? you are given nothing and threatened with tickets and fines if you do, all punishment no reward. And not getting a ticket is not a reward, that is like saying your reward for not getting sent to time out is not getting sent to time out.  
This simple philosophy can be spread to all aspects of our modern life controlled by government and authority, and well explains one of the reasons so many people view it all in a negative light.  
So what exactly would I recommend as the solution to my previous example? How about a hypothetical where everyone who is given a drivers license is given either a significant discount on insurance and registration fees or sufficient financial assistance on vehicle repair based on them being in a ""responsible driver"" list. Doing things such as speeding, reckless driving, being majority/completely at fault for an accident like DUI not only fines you and tickets you, it gets you banned from this list for years at a time loosing all benefits. This way good drivers get rewarded, while bad drivers get punished. In such a system I predict driving violations would decrease significantly and opinion of public services would see an up-turn.  
No solution is perfect, but in my opinion not even attempting to make things better is worse.

73,2023-06-18,CMV: Wasps often get an unfair amount of hate (especially on Reddit) compared to bees but I believe wasps should actually be admired and appreciated as much as bees.,u/deadfermata,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14d2wjk/cmv_wasps_often_get_an_unfair_amount_of_hate/,changemyview,"I often see a very strong and forceful reaction from the Reddit community when there is a video, gif or image of wasps (and hornets) or their hives. The comments are usually ""Kill it with fire!"" ""Burn them all."" ""Fuck wasps!"" ""Wasps are assholes!"" etc etc. It's almost like the Reddit hive mind starts to buzz. Lol.

I want to challenge this sentiment and and promote the lesser recognized benefits of these creatures. I love all sorts of insects and find them quite fascinating so it always bugs (pun!) me whenever I see such a violent reaction to wasps. I also love bees. I think bees are incredibly important and amazing creatures but I'd like to focus on wasps.

To be clear: I believe both bees and wasps have their benefits and harm (depending on the circumstance and context) I am not quite on board with the general sentiment I see online (but especially on Reddit) when it comes to hating wasps.

While wasps are often regarded as annoying pests and feared for their stings, I am not convinced that wasps are necessarily more dangerous/destructive than bees but, in fact, believe they play a crucial role in our ecosystem. Their extinction would disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem and nature in general. So there are three core arguments I'd like to touch on (but feel free to bring up any other ones)

**Ecological Importance:**

Just like bees, wasps contribute to pollination. While they may not be as effective as bees, wasps play a vital role in pollinating certain plant species, especially fig trees and orchids, which rely on wasps for their reproduction. This symbiotic relationship is essential for maintaining biodiversity.

Wasps are also nature's pest control experts. Many wasp species are parasitoids which means they prey on insects that harm crops and other plants. By keeping pest populations in check, wasps actually help maintain the overall health of agricultural ecosystems. This natural behavior helps reduce the need for chemical pesticides.

**Decomposition:**

Certain types of wasps are scavengers - such as Yellow Jackets.  They play an extremely important role in cleaning up the environment by feeding on dead animals, carrion, organic waste, etc. Without these Yellow Jackets, the accumulation of decaying matter would actually pose a pretty big threat to public health.

Wasps can also assist with the breakdown of organic matter and facilitate nutrient cycling in ecosystems. By consuming decaying matter, they contribute to the release of nutrients that can be utilized by plants, fostering healthy soil and supporting the growth of vegetation.

**Food Chains:**

Wasps serve as a vital food source for numerous animals, including birds, reptiles, and other insects. Removing wasps from the ecosystem would disrupt the food chain which can lead to an imbalance and negatively impacting predator populations. Also, in controlling insect populations, wasps indirectly benefit other species that rely on the same prey. For example, if a wasp preys on caterpillars, wasps reduce caterpillar numbers, which in turn protects plants from excessive herbivory.

**Thoughts:**

It seems to me that the violent responses I see on Reddit to wasps is often rooted in lack of understanding of just how important these creatures are. It's often because people only associate wasps with 'stinging' or 'allergy' reaction but the same can be said of bees. I often see the fear that people have of wasps to be along the same line as those who are afraid of sharks. The fear is misplaced.

I don't think wasps are perfect creatures but no species on earth is. They can be destructive in other ways but I do think the amount of hate wasps receive on Reddit isn't really justified. Their role as pollinators, pest controllers, decomposers, and vital components of food chains cannot be ignored. If more people recognize the ecological benefits wasps provide, hopefully they can appreciate the creatures more and admire them as much as bees!

**Extra:**

Most of the hate that wasps get often has to do with stings, allergic reactions, invasion of human space, nuisance and aggression and on some occasions, crop damage or interference with beekeeping.

However, many of these ""negative"" experiences can also be said of bees. Wasps won't generally attack for no reason unless they feel threatened (such as their hives being bothered). Their reaction is no different than bees or any other creatures whose habitats are disrupted - it's a natural response to 'fight back'

The other big argument against wasps is that they interfere with bee hives or bee keeping and can sometimes steal honey or invade hives which in turn negatively impacts honey production but bees are not too dissimilar as they are known to also compete with native pollinators. For example, the introduction of non-native honey bee species can compete with native pollinators for resources, which consequently impacts the populations of local bees, butterflies, and other native pollinators.

You’ve all certainly made me reconsider my point of view on this and I appreciate everyone taking the time to chat with me and share their opinions. Thank you all 

—————————

Original post: 

Let me preface this by saying I’ve never considered myself to be someone who subscribes to “child free” mentality. I’ve always imagined myself having kids. So while I know that reddit has a big child free community, I genuinely am looking for someone to oppose me on this and change my mind. I want to be excited about having kids, if it is something I choose to do in the future. But based on recent events I feel that I would dread having kids. So please help me see other points of view on this.

Currently I’m of the age where many of my close friends and family are new parents. When I see them post photos on social media they of course all look like they couldn’t be happier. But when I spend time with them and their kids I see them constantly struggling under stress and frustration, with the occasional moment of calm and happiness.

This really showed itself to be true recently, when a family member of mine, along with their 2 and 4 year old, stayed the week with my wife and I at our house. For 5 days straight it was constant battles with these kids. It felt like everything led to the kids crying or having a melt down. Not allowed to eat on the couch? Crying. Kid says I’m done eating when there is still food on their plate and mom says finish your dinner? Crying. I could see that mom was at her wits end daily. There were many positive moments in between, don’t get me wrong, but it seemed they never lasted that long. In addition, with kids being around everything we did revolved around them (which for lack of a better word is very boring). So many things we couldn’t do because we can’t bring kids or do it with kids. After they left yesterday my wife and I were totally shell shocked and now rethinking our decision/plans to have kids in the future.

Ultimately this is the conclusion I’ve come to:
- at the worst of times, kids are a total drain on your sanity and mental health. Driving you to extreme stress while also taking away all your freedom and your capacity to “unwind” since they are a 24/7 responsibility
- at the best of times, kids can be very emotionally fulfilling (when they are cooperating, telling you they love you, etc.). But even in those best moments, at the end of the day they still take away all your freedom and force you into a very limited routine. Not to mention the large financial expenses of having kids which severely limits lifestyle choices, ability to save for retirement, etc.

It just seems like the lows are way lower than the highs are high. I’m trying to think of the best reason I can come up with to have kids, and the best I can think of right now is the emotional fulfillment it gives you. Another big one I think is that when you get older, having kids really helps a lot with not being lonely and having someone to care for you (I see this in my elderly parents now).

If you’ve read this far thank you so much and I hope you can help change my view."

This is dangerous as it means Chinese influence is growing and represents a slippery slope leading to future acceptance of authoritarianism and loss of personal freedoms world-wide.

China has a terrible track record of abuse of power and human rights violations, and its government cannot be negotiated or reasoned with. Its people have also been indoctrinated into loving this way of doing things and predominantly support its government and are thus accomplices in all its faults.

By not immediately shutting down any consideration of acceptance of China and Chinese way of doing things or Chinese people way of thinking and their opinions, we open the door to not only China gaining more power over us all, but also open the door wider and wider for our own goverments to abuse power, as we'll start justifying things that should not be justified, such as increasing surveillance and loss of privacy.

Also, we can already see among a large part of the people some extent of flirtation with communism and revolutions, which are exclusively harmful things to any society. We must not give in any more ground.

This is what I believe, but I have been told I'm being too biased and stubborn and that things aren't this black and white. So I'd like to check my biases and consider other views ... hopefully something I haven't considered before. Change my view."

You can observe this dynamic almost everywhere in the world, irrespective of political alignment, therefore it's my opinion that elections become practically irrelevant. 

They seem to feign just enough interest in the needs of the people that there aren't massive protests or attempts to get them out of office but actual good deeds where there isn't some return of investment are extremely rare."
1,2023-06-19,CMV: Reddit leaderships decisions regarding 3rd party apps make sense but redditors insist on having their cake and eating it too.,u/polio23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14depps/cmv_reddit_leaderships_decisions_regarding_3rd/,changemyview,"My view:

Have their cake - redditors want to be able to access reddit via their preferred means and in their preferred format 

Eat it too - but they also don’t want to do any of the things that actually support reddits existence. 

As I see it, reddit is ultimately a business and is losing millions of dollars every year. In terms of monetizing their audience Reddit has essentially the same two options as every other platform 

1.	Advertising 
2.	paid content/access

But Redditors HATE both of these options. They use ad block, they use third party apps with fewer or no ads. And they refuse to pay subscription fees for the service, I would be willing to claim that the vast majority of them don’t even use the paid version of the 3rd party Reddit app they do like, but obviously I don’t have a way of proving this. 

Which leaves Reddit with figuring out weighs to make money business to business rather than business to consumer which they have done by increasing the costs of API access which will either generate revenue OR result in the apps that are driving away eye balls from Reddit served ads shutting down. 

Some folks have indicated that the issue isn’t charging for the API but rather how much Reddit is charging to which I have a few responses:

1.	Reddit setting the price makes the most sense - only Reddit knows how much their costs are and similarly only Reddit knows how much money they need to generate from this revenue stream to move towards sustainability, let alone profitability.
2.	Reddit has 0 obligation to support businesses that directly trade off with their advertising revenue or any business at all for that matter. 
3.	 If 3rd party apps are unwilling to require users to pay subscriptions to offset this cost then they should go out of business, it doesn’t make sense to be okay with Reddit losing millions every year but insist that Apollo or RIF have to be profitable at all times,  especially given that their costs are SIGNIFICANTLY lower than Reddits since they do 0 hosting. Why should Reddit be subsidizing businesses that can only exist in the first place because they rely on Reddits infrastructure. 

So bottom line: Redditors want reddit to be exactly how they like and is convenient for them but overwhelmingly don’t want to pay for that service with their time or money (want to have their cake and eat it too) but ultimately Reddit’s decision is completely reasonable."

I have thought of this because I'm confident enough to say I can throw hands. I can punch a wall once without problem, I wil feel the pain after the second punch tho. I can play volleyball where I fell on the ground many times (both concrete and sand). I experienced foot and hand bruises many times. I am doing 1 minute plank once a week. I do 30 sit-ups everyday to become more fit. I can carry a heavy water jug the size of my torso while walking a distance of 10 meters.  

Mozart is the strongest historical figure I can beat imo. Ofc we are not sure about what he truly was so I just based it on research. Since Mozart was sickly and probably spoiled af from his daddy, he never experienced getting his a-- kicked by anyone before. I already get wrestled by my little sis and big sis many times. I can finish him maybe after 3 rounds.  

Michael Jackson is the strongest celebrity I can beat imo. He was said to be doing exercises in his prime so he's a bit challenging imo. He also experienced a lot of pain in his life that made him tougher. However, he didn't do weight exercises, only exercises about flexibility so I bet he can't carry 70kg sack of flour. I can carry that for 10 seconds. I think I can beat him if he's just chilling and I'm full of rage and bloodlusted. Or it could be a tie.

1,2023-06-19,"CMV: Trans women are not ""biologically male."" They are in fact female.",u/silverspools,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14dfves/cmv_trans_women_are_not_biologically_male_they/,changemyview,"This is a long post, but I feel that it is reasoned. If not, I'm curious to know why and willing to change my mind on this. 

According to many people, they tell me I am a ""biologically male"" no matter what I do despite that I am a trans woman. This idea gets thrown around a lot, but the back and forth of defense of trans people is making it hard for me to get what ""biologically male"" even means. Furthermore, I need to know why that matters at all. **People say it's for societal reasons, but I'm not sure what that means.**

Personally, I'm not sure what ""biological male"" is even suppose to mean for the modern trans woman anyway. Here's my summary of why I disagree with this take.

Do chromosomes exist? Yup! **Are we made out of them directly? No, not at all**. That's like saying the blueprint of a building is the physical building itself. Chromosomes just tell biological processes how to happen in a body for everyone.

Does having a Y chromosome make you male? Typically, yes. Universally, no. The Y chromosome is actually very small, the only thing that really matters is the SRY gene, which is like a specific kind of gene that encodes a transcription factor that leads to the **formation of androgen receptors in cells**.

In short, the Y makes the switch in cells that if flipped by androgens, start making male stuff typically. **If that switch is never flipped, which happens under several different contexts, you don't get a male.**

Many trans women take HRT, it both blocks those androgen receptors I mentioned, and replaces testosterone with estrogen. Everything to make a person is in the X chromosome and our base chromosomes. **Literally everyone on earth has both ""male"" and ""female"" DNA inside of them. We all have an X chromosome.**

Using that ""female"" DNA, HRT totally flips the endocrine system and the body will absolutely make all the same secondary sex characteristics a female has, regardless of that Y chromosome. That is the whole purpose of HRT. Under such conditions the ""biological"" process is no different between trans women and cis women

If the common notion that women are they way they are because of their ""hormones"" you got some explaining to do why those same hormones in trans women don't count. Estrogen is estrogen, regardless of who's body it's in.

It is my belief that opposition to trans kids going on blockers and HRT is that everyone understand what that means subconsciously, a young trans girl will not go through a male puberty, those androgen receptors I mentioned? Not flipped. Trans girls who go on to become trans women who's entire biology is shaped just like a cis woman.

The huge kicker is that even without all of that, there's about 20+ years of sound science that has investigated the trans brain. They also looked at cis men, men with hormone imbalances, trans people not on hormones and trans people on them.

The result? **Trans women have neurological structures just like cis women and very much not like cis men under any condition**. The brain is an organ and very biological too. I would argue that it's also you.

The brain invented a word to describe itself, I think it's kind of who we are entirely. 

The only thing left I can think of is what's between our legs and how that relates to a gamete.

So, in summary, if the entire biology of a trans woman is just like a cis woman with the exception of a gamete, how is that's biologically male? How is that not a variation on one drop thinking?

Why does my brain and body not count at all when talking about biology, but gametes must rule the world? If you point to the Y chromosome, that is flawed thinking.

If some blueprint at a construction site says to build a **south facing window** in a building, but the workers end up **taking directions to skip that and build a north facing window instead** using the exact same tools, then I need to know why the blueprint is what matters and not the building.

**Given all of that, when people say I'm biologically male, they're pointing to those blueprints and saying it's obviously that there is a south facing wall when everyone else can see that the workers ""biologically"" made that north facing one.**

How is that a reasonable assessment of biology and why do people insist on the blueprint and not the building. I don't see how that thinking makes society better, **but I'm willing to change my mind if someone can explain that reasoning and also explain where I'm suppose to find this ""biological male"" thing that doesn't seem to exist.**"

The last time I asked if it was pointless, only about two people tried to change my view. The rest were complaining about cyclists, claiming the US cities actually were pedestrian and bike friendly, cars were just superior, and just a bunch of car brained cliches and excuses for why building pedestrian, bike and public transit infrastructure is somehow bad or not possible. Someone even got upset at me for making ""broad generalizations"" about motorists while saying ""most bikers don't follow the rules of the road."" without any self awareness.

When that's the overwhelming attitude of Americans, what hope is there of change? 

This is combined with the US building more and more car dependent areas. The vast majority of people who live in these areas will control which politicians get elected and which policies are enacted, preventing any meaningful changes from happening to US cities."

In both cases, you have groups of people on the Internet getting together to convince themselves and each other that a normal, healthy biological activity is bad and evil and the source of their suffering. They feel powerless in their lives, so they try to assert power by denying themselves of something that is not only perfectly fine, but actually healthy. They become obsessed with this harmful self-denial, creating self-reinforcing communities that revolve around it.  
  
NoFap and pro-ana sites both reframe an unhealthy obsession as “self-control.” They band together to reassure each other that their obsession is a “lifestyle choice,” citing anecdote and dodgy pseudoscience to try to reinforce the notion that what they're doing is positive and good.  
  
If you read NoFap and you read pro-ana sites, there are strong parallels in the ways their adherents use them:  
  
Posting personal experiences to solicit validation  
Endorsing sex negativity and anorexia as positive, healthy choices  
Exchanging tips and techniques for avoiding food and masturbation; going on group fasts together  
Competing with each other to go the longest without food or masturbation.  
There's a reason some sex educators describe extreme sex-negativity as “sexual anorexia.” In both cases, shame and dogmatic thinking conspire to distort the sufferer’s thinking and judgment about ordinary, healthy activities."

4,2023-06-19,CMV: New pronouns are pointless,u/lonadotexe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14dlsej/cmv_new_pronouns_are_pointless/,changemyview,"I don't understand people who use new pronouns like Xe/Xem, Thon/Thons and the likes, and I feel companies adopting these new pronouns are quite stupid. In my view, the traditional pronouns are more than enough. These pronouns are actually useful, unlike e/ey and Fey/Fier.  
  
He/Him if you have an XY chromosome  
  
She/Her if you have an XX chromosome  
  
They/Them if you don't know, or if they're uncomfortable being called the other two pronouns, or if they have some sort of genetic variation  
  
These pronouns have an almost inherent use in the real world. ""He can't come with her"" conveys more information than ""Thon can't come with eir"".  
  
I'm not sure why people who ""feel"" like they're the opposite sex change their pronouns either. You can be a man (XY, with a penis) and feel feminine, but you're still a man. You can still fit in He/Him. You don't need to invent a completely useless pronoun for yourself or switch pronouns. You can be a woman (XX, with a Vagina) and feel masculine, but you're still a woman. You don't need to switch pronouns.  
  
More confusing to me is why homosexual and bisexual people change their pronouns. You're a man (XY, with a penis) and you like another man (XY, with a penis). There is absolutely no reason for you to switch away from He/Him.  
  
Just a sidenote but I'm not \*against\* new pronouns like Hitler was against Jews. I just find the concept to be stupid. Like something a mentally illiterate person would want to use.  
  
At the end of the day, saying someone's pronoun is Xe/Xem is the equivalent of saying someone's fairy dust grandmother is Motherus Jupiterus Grandmotherest. It's devoid of use, and I personally feel like it's something wannabe clout-chasers use.  
  
Note: I'm all for homosexuals, bisexuals, and heterosexuals. I hold nothing against the gender a person is into. I myself am bisexual, and believe being bisexual is the most normal sexuality."

I can be trans and desagree with some things, I can be trans and think letting anyone that says they're trans enter a sports competition is not fair to cis ppl, it's not, and that not homophobic to say, yes, it's important to let trans ppl compete with their gender, but also, it's not something that should be just, u say u go. 

I feel pushed out and devalidated by the whole movement, I can't even stand trans forums bc I can't say things without fear of being banned. Because I was, banned for saying you can't just let anyone that says they are trans into sports with their gender. 

And now I can't ask what people think about what's going on with the world and the lgbtq movement, about what conservatives say is ""gender ideology"", and I hate to say it, but I now agree more with the right (I am not american, do not follow democrats or republicans, it's different where I live) because the left and the lgbtq won't let me think or say anything and if u desagree w them u out. 

Why can't I be trans and have an opinion that's different? I don't agree with most of the whole 2SLGBTQIA+, which is something I am lost, because I can't even understand. Now the whole movement is just a plataform for the left to push their things. I was a depressed messed up kid, having affirmative surgery would not have solved my problems, you can't just agree with kids. Before I could know who I was I needed treatment, depression covers everything else. I also think the most important thing with transitioning is therapy, besides the fact you need to be sure to go through it, it's what will give you tools to deal with what comes with being a trans person. I was constantly challenge in therapy about being trans, it wasn't a bad thing, in fact, it's probably the only reason I can go through all this wo losing my mind, it's the thing that makes me sure of what I am. 

So, do you think the lgbtq+ movement is still the same? Or was it hijacked by the left and taken over by politics and has become a place where you are only accepted if you are and think the same as everyone and if you differ from the ""right"" thinking you are homophobic and transphobic and all other thing?"

Large, especially corporate owned complexes, that have tons of units could easily accommodate this need, and would vastly and cheaply improve the lives of their tenants.

In other words, the brain feels one way and the body doesn’t match. Therefore, the current treatments that we have modify the body to fit the mind. These surgeries are risky and do not actually result in function similar to that which the brain would like or want to have. For example, someone who’s gender identity is female but was assigned male sex at birth, even if they transition and have gender reassignment surgery, they will not be able to have a baby, they can’t breastfeed, can’t have periods, etc. In some ways, this seems like a patch, but not a fix. A true fix, would be to fix the identity at a brain level. That is, rather than change the body to match the brain, change the brain to match the body. In the future, once we have a better understanding of how the brain works and can actually make that type of modification, it seems like it would make much more sense to do a gender reassignment of the brain, as this is the actual root of the problem. As it stands, giving someone breasts or creating a vagina does nothing to fix the actual issue. Or cutting off someone breasts or penis. These are brutal disfiguring surgeries under any other condition and I think people will look back and be shocked how the medical establishment performed these kinds of procedures during our time. Changing someone’s gender identity to fit their body would allow them to not only feel more “at home” in their body, but it would retain the function of their bodies as well."

My view is that artists really don't have any argument against AI art other than it is taking away their jobs, which in itself is already a shaky argument. I will attempt to argue against them. 

1. AI art is not art: I don't really see how this is an argument against AI art. If people like looking at something then it is their right to enjoy it. Whether it is art or something else doesn't really matter. You dont get to decide what people enjoy or not. 
2. AI art is stealing: This is a more nuanced subject but imo i see how AI art is stealing from anyone. It looks at images, it sees a pattern, it recreates the pattern based on the prompts of the user. It does not simply stitch images together. Now imagine if a real person does this, lets say a man looks at all of Van Gogh's pictures and tries to mimic the style, no one would call him a thief unless he tries to pass his painting off as Van Gogh's. If a person can do it, why can't an AI? Please don't say the processes are different, it doesn't matter since the reason behind them and the end results are the same. The AI being more efficient than a person in copying a style does not make it immoral.
3. AI art is killing art: No, it is not killing art. There is no ban on manmade art, you can still draw or paint whatever you want. What most people are afraid of is that they can't make a living out of drawing commissions anymore. It is understandable to have such worries but it does not mean that art is dead. If you only paint what other people order you to paint, you are not an artist, you are a painter for hire. And lets not pretend that this is going to make everyone lose interest in manmade art, there would still be booming market for art. It is mostly going to affect low level commission artists, it won't affect the value of fine art pieces. 
4. Why AI art is hated: The only reason it is hated by artists is because low level artists can't compete with AI. The standards for art of regular people is not that high and AI can easily fill their needs and thus, most painters who live off commission cant compete with AI. Imagine if AI is painfully slow, like 1month/picture, artists wouldn't care because it doesn't affect them. Now that they are affected, they scream bloody murder.   
I see this as artists not wanting to evolve. If the only thing that separates an artist and a non-artist is the ability to draw then artists are no different than any other profession. The way i see it, the essence is art is creativity, not only the skills. 

All arguments against AI are just there to mask to the real problem which is that AI is making it harder for artists to make a living. The concern is understandable but trying to make it about anything else is simply disingenuous."

If you lie about a violent sexual crime should be forced to be put on the sex offender registry because they have done more damage to actual rape victims. not only that many of the victims of these false allegations are bullied and ostracized and even can become suicidal. it's becoming more common to hear these types of stories. lying about such a crime is so damaging it deserves to put a person on that registry as punishment.

sure you can criticise the way its done, but at the end of the day the views MATTER... a large sentiment is people simply saying ""if they really cared they wouldnt film it"" in some cases this is true in the sense that its ONLY being filmed for clout and they dont really care about the good deeds they're doing. But in these cases the good deed still gets done and people who are in need of help are still better off for it.

but the important elephant in the room is that these deeds would be largely impossible for the people doing them without the views, because the views generate the revenue possible for them to do this, and any other means of making such large amounts of money as quickly would ultimately take far longer and would result in less benefit to those in need. 

at the end of the day whether they're doing it for clout or not what they're actually doing is taking money from youtube, or tik tok or wherever a long with large brands in case of brand deals and using it for charitable deeds, and no matter what the motivation that is a GOOD THING. if you asked the people being helped if they'd rather continue to be hungry so that these clout chasers stop getting their clout, im sure all of them would say ""Fuck off, im hungry and these guys are helping me more than anyone else ever has"" and so this is INFINITELY better than people who just do dumb shit for clout, like those who flaunt existing wealth etc. 

so the people saying ""stop doing this its wrong"" are the ones who are actually in the wrong, its fine to voice criticisms, and i think there are a few signs of people who care more than others even if ultimately they're doing it for clout, for example those who simply film the process of them making huge amounts of food to give to the homeless and not shoving a camera in the peoples faces whilst they hand it to them. (sidenote, people who think these people arent giving the homeless the food are delusional, no one is making 200 hundred sandwhiches and then throwing them out, or freezing them... be reasonable) 

&#x200B;

so yeah in conclusion, whilst these people are in some cases kind of being douchebags, if at the end of the day they're able to help these people more than i or the average person ever could, im never going to suggest it be stopped, even if it makes them rich in the process."

The problem with such a government is that sooner or later, they tend to entrench themselves and become de-facto dictators or fall into infighting amongst political parties.

I think we should decentralize our political systems with not one government in power for all districts in a single country and all districts have all responsibility for governments such as education, defense (this also means that the lowliest towns can keep CBRN weaponry) and policing , enforce strict term limits of one term lasting 4 years (with the penalty for exceeding them being death)  and ban political parties and career politicians (meaning that all politicians must be selected by lot and all citizens, from birth till death and is compulsory, with no exemptions) . This will prevent entrenchment of power and prevent infighting in politics as any amassing of power will be detected and dealt with.

Moreover, it's easier to pass laws. Rather than debate over it in parliament or congress, all laws proposed will be passed with the final vote being  the people on the street with them choosing to follow or not to follow laws and it being decided by simple majority.

If you hate the government so much, then who is the muscle of the government? When the government passes laws, who enforces those laws? The answer is the police. The police are a powerful institution, and any powerful institution, especially a government one, should be constantly criticized and held in check.

Happiness is positive. Suffering is negative. Death is neutral. 0 > -10, therefore death is preferable to life if there is more suffering than there is happiness. I think there is more suffering in this world than happiness because of my following arguments:

There is no positive equivalent to the nanking massacre, or the Holocaust, or the Cambodian Genocide, or the literal countless other acts of evil that exist in this world. And those are past evils. The evils that will take place in the future are likely to make those events seem mild with the use of nuclear weapons like Tsar Bombas (which are 40\* more powerful than Hiroshima nukes) and advanced chemical warfare and biological warfare. Raising a family, or getting married, or getting a promotion, or reading a good book, or taking drugs can never produce an equivalent amount of happiness as the torture, rape, and murder of an individual person, let alone the mass torture, mass rape, and mass murder of the countless millions of people that took place in the countless genocides, wars, and serial killings that have took place in history and continue to take place in the present day, and will take place in the future.

And even when it comes to things we generally see as ""positive"" those events/activities are inherently combined with lots of ""negative"" sacrifices. Raising children is stressful and requires you to sacrifice other forms of happiness such as other hobbies or passions or even relationships because of how much money and time it takes. Children can also be unruly and stressful. Children can grow into becoming selfish and horrible and psychopathic monstrous adults who could ruin your life, the lives of others, or even their own lives. Having children could potentially lead to a net increase in the amount of suffering in the world if the child lives an unhappy life or ruins the lives of others - which they probably will if you consider my other arguments. Marriage is similar, but with the added weight of how the majority of marriages end in divorce which causes suffering for everyone involved. And the fact that before getting married to someone you'll usually have a large number of failed relationships filled with miserable arguments and ended in miserable breakups prior to the marriage. And that doesn't even count the countless rejections and loneliness people feel before and between relationships and friendships even.And lots of people get married and then divorce, get married, and then divorced multiple times. Getting a promotion requires hard work and is stressful. Reading a good book requires you to bore yourself by reading hundreds of bad books. Taking drugs involves drug addiction and painful withdrawl symptoms. There are always negatives paired with positives, and a lot of the times the negatives can outweight the positive. Whereas, there are no positives paired with the nanking massacre, or the holocaust. Its just pure 100% evil and suffering - in the build up - in the conclusion - and in the aftermath. (Except maybe you could argue that the evil people that took part in these genocides indulged in sadistic pleasure at killing people who they believed to be sub-human but I think the emotional experience of such disgusting creatures has no value and deserves 0 consideration. In fact, the happinss of those people deserves consideration; it should be considered to have equal value to suffering.)

There's also the fact that the brain hasn't been evolutionarily designed to make you ""happy"". The brain was evolutionarily designed to facilitate survival and reproduction. And the brain does this by making you stay frustrated and wanting more. This is done through a pyschological phenomena called hedonic adaptation. If you drive an Audi, and then buy a Ferrari, you'll get a burst of happiness, and feel lots of positive feelings when you drive the Ferarri, but each day you drive it, the happiness you feel will get weaker and weaker and weaker until you feel just like you did with the Audi. Your brain becomes more resistant to the positive feelings you recieved when driving the Audi. Thus making you feel frustrated with your Ferrarri and desiring something more, maybe this time the new Audi or a Bugatti Veyron or a helicopter or a Private Jet, etc. This doesn't just happen when material possessions, but even marriage. Studies show that marriage makes people happier in the first two years of marriage, but after that your happiness goes back down to what it was like before marriage. Overall, happiness is fleeting. But suffering? Suffering stays with you. If you experience a traumatic event then that trauma will stay with you your entire life and make you unhappier for as long as you live, or atleast for as long as your psychological treatment struggles to work. And even in psychological treatment a common saying is that ""therapy doesn't fix you"". Therapy and other psychological treatments may be able to reduce the severity of symptoms, but there is no ""fixing"" mental illness. If you're depressed, therapy won't get rid of your depression, all it will do is decrease the severity of the symptoms and help you cope with it. But the depression will always be there.

And a lot of things that are considered ""positive"" are only arguably ""positive"". Not everyone finds joy in raising children. Not everyone finds joy in marriage. Not everyone finds joy in relationships, or sex. Not everyone finds joy in reading books, or listening to music, or watching movies, or watching TV shows, etc. Whether you find joy in something or not is a flip of a coin. Just because you find joy in reading books today, doesn't mean you'll continue to find joy in it tomorrow, or next month, or next year. Partly due to hedonic adaptation, but also there's factors surrounding age, environment temeparment, mood, body chemistry, etc. that just vary from day to day, week to week, year to year, etc. that will effect how much joy we find in things.People have different tastes.  **Joy is subjective.** But suffering? **Suffering is objective.** I can say, and I'm sure most people will say, with 100% certainty that from the day that they were born and to the day that they died, they'd derive an immense amount of suffering, pain, and misery in the experience of getting tortured, raped, or killed. That has nothing to do with temperament, age, or mood. You will always hate those things. It's not arguable whether getting tortured, raped, or killed is ""positive"" or not. But getting married, getting a promotion, reading a book, etc. is. Some people hate marriage and some people like it. But everyone hates getting their fingers twisted, broken, and sawed off one by one whilst someone else laughs as they rip out your teeth and puts them back in the wrong way round, whilst someone else shoots and kills your entire family in front of you. There's no argument there. No debate. Everyone hates it.

""Consider the capacity of the human body for pleasure. Sometimes it is pleasant to eat, to drink, to see, to touch, to smell, to hear, to make love. The mouth. The eyes. The fingertips. The nose. The ears. The genitals. Our voluptific capacities (if you will forgive me the coinage) are not exclusively concentrated in these places, but it is undeniable that they are concentrated here. The whole body is susceptible to pleasure, but in places there are wells from which it may be drawn up in greater quantity. But not inexhaustibly. How long is it possible to know pleasure? Rich Romans ate to satiety and then purged their overburdened bellies and ate again. But they could not eat for ever. A rose is sweet, but the nose becomes habituated to its scent. And what of the most intense pleasures, the personality-annihilating ecstasies of sex? … Even if I were a woman and could string orgasm upon orgasm like beads upon a necklace, in time I should sicken of it.

...Yet consider. Consider pain. Give me a cubic centimeter of your flesh and I could give you pain that would swallow you as the ocean swallows a grain of salt. And you would always be ripe for it, from before the time of your birth to the moment of your death. We are always in season for the embrace of pain. To experience pain requires no intelligence, no maturity, no wisdom, no slow workings of the hormones in the moist midnight of our innards. We are always ripe for it. All life is ripe for it. Always. … Consider the ways in which we may gain pleasure. … Consider the ways in which we may be given pain. The one is to the other as the moon is to the sun.""

And so far, I'm only talking about the pain that humans experience, humans which are by incomprehensible measures the most powerful and advanced species in the galaxy. Quality of life is much worse for all other species. The amount of suffering that occurs in nature is mind boggling. The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive; others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear; others are being slowly devoured from within by rasping parasites; thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst and disease. Nearly all the things which men are hanged or imprisoned for doing to one another, are nature's every day performances.

Day by day my mind is blown by some of the evils that humans commit. But if we're being real, the evils we commit are nothing compared to the evils that animals and insects commit to eachother on a regular basis. Life as a whole down to it's core, down it's fundamentals is violent, and barbaric. People often say that nature is un-caring, but i disagree. Nature is sadistic. Nature rewards the most ruthless and bloodthirsty and dominating and violent. Nature is the child in a colosseum audience, laughing and squealing with joy as a slave chops off the head of another slave, blood spurting out of the dead slave's neck like a fountain of wine. Nature is the child laughing in glee as he runs over 100s of civillians in GTA. It's wired into the brains of all predators, and humans are predators - the only thing we take constant joy in is inflicting harm on others. We don't find constant joy in love, or kindness. We get bored of those quickly"

If this is an effective way of getting people to be more careful with a product, then we should follow suit with other products.

Ladders should come with photos of compound fractures and people paralyzed in the hospital next to the ""don't step on top rung"" label.

Fireworks should come with photos of blown off hands.

Opioids should come with photos of people who died of ODs/became homeless and warning about how addictive they are.

Lathes, chainsaws, etc. should come with similar pictures of industrial accidents near any warning labels about their use.

Alcohol should come with pictures of diseased livers and FAS babies.

If the argument is that this works for cigarettes, it should be universally applied to get people to pay attention to risk. If it is ineffective, then no reason to have it on cigarettes.

EDIT - I don't care the cigarettes are addictive and don't have a practical purpose. The crux of my view is that warning labels should be as effective as possible, regardless of what risk they are warning against. To CMV you would have to show that this is not the case and that there is net benefit of less effective/prominent warning labels."

In other words, the brain feels one way and the body doesn’t match. Therefore, the current treatments that we have modify the body to fit the mind. These surgeries are risky and do not actually result in function similar to that which the brain would like or want to have. For example, someone who’s gender identity is female but was assigned male sex at birth, even if they transition and have gender reassignment surgery, they will not be able to have a baby, they can’t breastfeed, can’t have periods, etc. In some ways, this seems like a patch, but not a fix. A true fix, would be to fix the identity at a brain level. That is, rather than change the body to match the brain, change the brain to match the body. In the future, once we have a better understanding of how the brain works and can actually make that type of modification, it seems like it would make much more sense to do a gender reassignment of the brain, as this is the actual root of the problem. As it stands, giving someone breasts or creating a vagina does nothing to fix the actual issue. Or cutting off someone breasts or penis. These are brutal disfiguring surgeries under any other condition and I think people will look back and be shocked how the medical establishment performed these kinds of procedures during our time. Changing someone’s gender identity to fit their body would allow them to not only feel more “at home” in their body, but it would retain the function of their bodies as well."

Generally speaking I am totally in support of black people and the progress we've made as a nation.

However, I am still feel like Juneteenth is kind of [""American Myth"" revisionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_mythology). The emancipation of black people and [reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era) that followed(Especially after Lincoln died and Andrew Johnson took office) led to some of the most brutal times in American history. Reconstruction was lead by people who wanted nothing more than to own black people as objects and the [black codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Codes_\(United_States\)) that followed were more inhumane than slavery ever was.

So I ask knowing all of that is Juneteenth a good holiday? Are we celebrating the freeing of slaves or Reconstruction? Things got MUCH worse after Andrew Johnson entered the white house and led to the rape, murder, and some of the most brutal working conditions in the world for a population that was completely helpless.

Furthermore, mods that are complacent with Reddit's shitty leadership (I applaud those that are not) are contributing to morally reprehensible outcomes (e.g. loss of 3rd party apps for visually impaired); there should be a system for users to replace such mods.

I can understand the allure of this idea, we all enjoy any excuse to pass the blame on to evil faceless corporations.

And they are truly, evil and faceless. Don't get me wrong energy companies have a lot to answer for around misinformation and denial PR campaigns over the past 50 years. 

BUT... This narrative that the problem is purely due to fossil fuel companies is surely BS. Fossil fuel companies only exist to fulfill our demands. Our demand for petrol, air travel, plastic polymers and everything else we consume.

It doesn't make any sense to compare individual emissions with that of a fossil fuel company. As they are both part of the same system. 

So I'm absolutely in favour of regulating fossil fuel companies with a carbon tax. But we need to understand that it is our individual demand that is driving these companies. And we do have to change our behaviour on an individual level if we want to reduce emissions."

I'm a centrist, when I hear the right make their points I can usually figure out what principle (or profit) they are serving. Like when the turtle guy prevented Obama from appointing a supreme court judge and then did a 180 on all his arguments when Trump had the opportunity to. His arguments were obviously bullshit but it's not like he wasn't serving principles he believed in that he believed Trumps nominee would rule in favor of those principles and with the overturn of roe v wade I can only conclude he was correct, whether or not you agree with those principles is irrelevant. 

The left on the other hand... what the fuck are the principles? They scream about human rights then try to restrict freedom of speech and right to self-defense, hell even right to a fair trial isn't safe. They talk about bodily autonomy when abortions are involved but then when it comes to vaccines they go full nazi scientist. They claim they want to help the poor but support policies that completely devastate the poor like illegal/mass immigration. They claim they are against racism then vote for a guy who wore blackface on camera on THREE separate occasions that we know of... not to mention the fact they support racist policies. They claim they support the oppressed but then twist the definition as an excuse to bully the oppressed and even when someone is oppressed by their own definitions if they disagree with them politically they fucking lynch them. 

In addition to that it's not even like they are all getting rich off this, sure some people are like the people who pocketed all the BLM donations and bought houses with and didn't even bother to pay for the funeral of the guy who's grave they were getting rich by standing on... but the vast majority even a good chunk of them actually getting rich aren't even getting rich off these specific policies which they are total hypocrites on but the vast majority of people who support these policies don't see a dime. 

So I just don't get it, there's no principles no financial incentive, no nothing, I don't get what's driving the left these days."

The thing though is that what I have noticed over the years is that people usually say that weed is the ultimate gateway drug and I simply don’t believe that. Because looking back anytime I chose to partake in an activity that was outside of my normal nicotine Vape or weed I had alcohol in my system. And I still don’t understand how people say that weed is the ultimate gateway drug because when I smoke all I want to do is eat an entire loaf of banana bread and watch Futurama.

1,2023-06-20,CMV: The US's Education System is the root of all problems,u/KingJTheG,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ei943/cmv_the_uss_education_system_is_the_root_of_all/,changemyview,"There's a lot of debate about this, but I don't think the US is doing so great right now (shocker). While people often point to things like politics, healthcare, low wages, platforms like Onlyfans, and not-so-bright politicians, I believe that our core issue is poor education.

I can say this confidently as a recent college grad with three diplomas under my belt and a GPA of 3.48.

Instead of making high-quality education available to everyone, no matter where they live, it's become another thing that money can buy. The sad part is, those who really need good education can't afford it. Sure, the internet is trying to change that, but this fact only emphasizes my point.

This gap in understanding often results in young (but usually middle-aged and older) adults holding wrong views because they simply don't have the right information. Some politicians take advantage of this, building their bases with people they know can't see through their lies just to gain more power. Fewer people going to college affects the healthcare field by increasing salaries and costs. Our failure to improve education also stunts wage growth, which then discourages people from attending college. Platforms like Onlyfans become a means to an end rather than a last resort, especially when trying to cover high college fees. Uneducated folks in positions of power end up making poor decisions. Their rewards for their efforts are the Texas freeze, drying rivers, and poor infrastructure health.

If we address the education issue, I believe the rest will eventually fall into place. Otherwise, things are just going to get worse from here."

1,2023-06-20,CMV: Verbally lying to the police that you didn't commit a crime is so rarely prosecuted that it can sometimes be a rational strategy to avoid arrest for unjust laws.,u/aze_a_ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ej4uo/cmv_verbally_lying_to_the_police_that_you_didnt/,changemyview,"Lawyers always say ""Don't lie to the police"" in their public-facing SEO web articles.  But I propose that in the initial stages of an investigation lying can be useful.  Over on another subreddit where police officers post, there seemed to be consensus that if someone on a traffic stop is being answering questions and not being oppositional they often cut them slack.  But if someone immediately ""lawyers up"" and won't answer questions then they assume they are guilty and press hard.  My anecdotal experience the few times I have told the police ""I'm not answering any questions"" bears this out.

Lets take the example of a traffic stop where someone has non-smelly weed concentrate in their car, in a jurisdiction where this is subject to arrest.  They get pulled over for a busted tail light and the officer goes on a fishing expedition trying to assess whether there is anything else they can get them on.  A standard question is ""Are there any drugs or weapons in the vehicle?"".  I propose that answering ""No"" is a better way to avoid criminal penalties than saying ""I'm not going to answer that question"".

The evidence I have is many videos I've seen of police interactions which involved people lying to the police initially.  The police never even threaten them with charges for lying even if they are caught in a clear lie, despite their willingness to threaten BS charges like obstruction.  And reading about charges that were filed later, lying to police is never included.

Of course, you have to be good at lying and know when to stop digging.  My personal approach is that if it's clear the officer thinks they have reasonable suspicion to detain me for an arrestable offense then I stop talking and lawyer up.

The goal of lying is to avoid letting the officer get to this point.  I'm not asserting that lying never makes things worse, just that the small chances of bad things coming from it are worth the payoff of hopefully not getting charged and having to pay for a lawyer.

ETA: This concerns the justice system in the USA, not other countries.

ETA: I should have clarified that the only situation where I think lies are useful is when an officer doesn't seem to have any particular suspicion, on a fishing expedition.  Many people have responded with situations where I agree that lying is not likely to be useful, like major crime investigations, or federal investigations. That has helped narrow the scope of the view I would like changed.  So lets stipulate that I'm only talking about a traffic stop where the officer is asking fishing questions and you have good reason to believe that the officer has not yet discovered the crime you are concealing.

""Do you have any drugs or weapons"" when you do

""Where are you coming from?"" when you came from a bar.

""What do you do for a living?"" when you are unemployed or work under the table.

1,2023-06-20,CMV: No paranormal realm exists,u/Fast-Armadillo1074,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ej8n5/cmv_no_paranormal_realm_exists/,changemyview,"I do not believe there is any sort of spiritual or paranormal realm. There is no scientific evidence that there is one. If there was real scientific evidence that there was a paranormal realm, I would instantly change my view.

I’m confused by all the seemingly rational people who believe this stuff. So many people are scared of made-up things that aren’t real. People swear they’ve seen ghosts and spirits when no scientific evidence exists. Even if I saw a ghost or spirit, I wouldn’t believe it was real because I’d know I was hallucinating. Even if I did believe it was real, I’d realize later it was a temporary emotional response to that hallucination.

Why are people so scared by fables? Many people are afraid of ouija boards, but technically you can’t prove that they are dangerous in any way. Ouija boards are harmless and have no real effect. I might as well eat off the most “haunted” ouija and use it as a dinner plate for all I care.

Some poisonous molds can cause hallucinations, and I believe that every single hallucination was either some sort of fungal poisoning or schizophrenia.

Ghosts, spirits, magic, hauntings, all fake. The devil’s tramping grounds in North Carolina? Probably a poisonous mineral deposit in the soil.

I believe that critical rationalism is a reasonable way to look at things. This epistemological method is not exactly the same as the scientific method, and came later. It was formulated by a highly respected philosopher, Karl Popper.

“In so far as a scientific statement speaks about reality, it must be falsifiable; and in so far as it is not falsifiable, it does not speak about reality.” - Karl Popper.

Popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method in favour of empirical falsification. According to Popper, a theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can (and should) be scrutinised with decisive experiments. Popper was opposed to the classical justificationist account of knowledge, which he replaced with critical rationalism, namely ""the first non-justificational philosophy of criticism in the history of philosophy"". - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper

Critical rationalism does not in any way prescribe a “final obstruction of all plausibilities in the universe”; rather, it is an epistemological method of determining what is rational or not rational to believe based on current evidence.

The moment that the reality of a paranormal realm was scientifically proven, a critical rationalist (me) would be forced by logic to believe it, but until that moment, I would have no choice but to not believe it.

To further illustrate this, I will use an analogy of invisible flying purple elephants.

There is no scientific evidence there aren’t invisible purple elephants flying through the sky over our heads.

On the other hand, the belief that there are no purple elephants is a falsifiable belief. If there are actually flying purple elephants, all it would take is a single detection of a flying purple elephant to disprove this belief.

The belief in purple elephants is unfalsifiable because there is no way you could prove flying purple elephants don’t exist. The belief in flying purple elephants IS falsifiable because you can prove it incorrect the moment you can prove the existence of flying purple elephants.

If flying purple elephants were proven correct, the belief that there are no flying purple elephants would be falsified, therefore the opposite must be true. Until that happens, flying purple elephants is an unfalsifiable belief and no perfectly rational person can believe in them. **(Note that this does not mean that a rational person cannot believe in them. A mostly rational person might believe. I am not certain that it is possible for any person to be perfectly rational.)**

Context: I’ve spent 5-6 years gymming 3 times a week for 2hours every session, albeit, haven’t even reached my goals. I do feel guilty for taking all this time to workout but I can’t help but feel it’s better spent on other intellectual hobbies.


From the outside, it looks like I love working out! But there’s this nagging feeling inside of me that all this is pointless. 

Weightlifting needs to be consistent and it wastes your time that could’ve been spent on other activities that are highly more valuable and the opportunity cost is greater than it seems.

People sacrifice time away from family/friends to achieve their dream body and fitness goals. In turn, all the time they’ve spent exercising could’ve been spent harbouring better relationships or creating something.

It is SO HARD! And what for? To look better and feel better? Especially if you lift alone, it can be extremely boring and isolating.

Popular benefits of lifting like health and looks can be achieved through other means like plastic surgery, diet and playing sports. I uds higher bone density and muscle mass is important, but if it is solely for aesthetics then it is pointless right? 

Just need help in not feeling this way, ironically i can’t stop weightlifting but I feel it is horribly pointless. I can’t stop because I don’t want to be defeated by my goals but I hate how much time I’ve sank into this."

They cannot manipulate the vote counts, they cannot cast one million ballots each. They would just have to accept the results and the policies that would follow. Unless somebody can show me that what I said above is somehow false, I don't see how elections could be considered ""rigged."" 

In the US, unlike countless other countries, elections are not rigged. And the sway of the ultra rich ruling class is questionable given how many people are against them and support policies that would harm them.. 

I think the problem is that a lot of people who want change *don't vote.* and don't try to get others to vote. Either because somebody told them elections are rigged (looking at you ultra left and ultra right wing) and the US is an oligarchy where the rich inevitably win, or because they believe their vote doesn't count so why bother. 

To be clear, I don't think one vote changes the outcome of an election. But there are two conclusions that can be drawn from that fact. One, I shouldn't vote because my one vote won't make a difference. Two, I should try to get others to vote because just my vote won't make a difference. And far too many people stop at 1. 

I understand there are people who do not have the time to spare on voting campaigns, but there are plenty of people who do have time and just can't be bothered. And this, in my view, is the biggest problem with US elections: people don't put enough effort into elections. They say ""eh, the corporate stooge will just win why bother."" And then the corporate stooge wins and they say ""see, why bother."" 

As for the voting laws argument- the vast vast vast majority of people are eligible to vote in the US. That's not to say there aren't restrictive discriminatory laws- I believe there are. But most of these laws do not actually prevent people from voting. 

If people were promised free TVs for showing up at polling places, I believe they would find the time. Even if they are far. Even if they couldn't get snacks while in line. Even if any number of barriers were present. They're stupid rules, but most of the ones I've seen do not actually prevent people from voting. They just make it easier for people to say ""the system is against me why bother."" 

If the privileged citizens with time on their hands campaigned for the candidates they wanted and eligible citizens did everything in their power to ensure their vote made it into the pool, I believe they would be unstoppable. Citizens say ""my vote doesn't count why bother."" Citizens tell other citizens that elections are rigged by the oligarchy. Citizens don't put in the time to vote and most of the people that could campaign can't be bothered. So based on that, I don't think the political system is to blame for the lack of change, I think US citizens are. But I'm open to changing my view."

 From the very start native Indians worked hand in hand initially with the east India company and then with the raj afterwards. At no point was there more than a few thousand European troops stationed in India, the vast bulk of 'british' muscle were the native sepoys. Additionally and the point of this post is that much of landowning class, the zamindars, landlords and princes sided with the british to either retain their power or increase their power by joining the british in annexing their neighbours. This is evident in the fact that in the indian mutiny the majority of princely states including the freshly conquered sikh punjab wholeheartedly backed the british in retaking india.

 When the british left and even up until today the power structure that allowed them to govern still remains. The endless Indian bureaucrats that were the essential machinery of the raj still remained, and in place of the raj political dynasties from these rich landowning collaborators took power. The social, economic and political power structures under the raj remain virtually unchanged even now. And the same monetary drain still happens, corrupt  officials embezzle money then skip to the west and deposit it in western bank accounts and real estate."

I am a very science and logic-based person. I really do believe that if you are playing roulette, the more the ball lands on red in a row, the more likely it becomes each time for it to land on black. Or if it's even a whole bunch of times in a row, each time it lands on even, it becomes more likely that the next one is odd. (same idea for any other game of chance)

Now, I completely understand that each time the ball is spun in the wheel, anything that happened before that has absolutely no bearing on what happens that time. Why would it?

But, statistically speaking, I think that if you were to spin the wheel 100 times, the number of blacks and the number of reds would be close to 50 each, or somewhere around there (not considering the green spaces for sake of simplicity). Same way that if you flipped a coin 100 times, it probably wouldn't be 100 heads or 100 tails. There's a chance that it could land on heads 100 times in a row, but I think we can all agree that the chance of that is pretty slim.

And, of course you know, that the ball is not going to one fine day just land on red and then continue landing on red forever. Eventually, it will land on black again. 

So, that's why I believe that the ""strategy"" of betting on black when the ball landed on red a bunch of times in a row is reasonable and would, in theory, allow you to win more. But, please, explain to me why this is incorrect."

If Andrew Tate was viral before August 2018, I would have never said this. But today I say this with confidence.

Now let me just say, I don’t like Andrew Tate. I think he’s a sexist degenerate who supports human trafficking.

HOWEVER, NASCAR is worse. Let me explain.

It all started in August 2018. Within 24 hours of a fan favorite driver (Chase Elliott) finally breaking through and winning a Cup Series Race for the first time winner, Brian France, the president of the sport, gets a DUI and is allowed to resign. And yes, NASCAR let him resign instead of firing him.

Fast forward to April 2020. On Easter 2020, NASCAR had a virtual event on a simulator version of a track they hadn’t raced at in 25 years. Star driver Kyle Larson says the n-word to test his radio mid race. He gets suspended indefinitely, but more on that later.

Two months later, black driver, Bubba Wallace, decides to race bait and says that a garage door pulley was a “noose”. This gained national attention and made NASCAR look terrible.

In 2021, Kyle Larson gets reinstated to NASCAR and wins the championship. Yes, a blatant racist is an American auto racing champion.

In July 2022, former NASCAR Cup Series Champion Kurt Busch gets a concussion that ultimately ends his career. His brother, 2-time NASCAR Champion Kyle Busch, calls out NASCAR for messing up the design, and gets $100K

In September 2022, NASCAR has a race in Fort Worth, Texas that sees five drivers blowing tires, two more drivers getting concussions, NASCAR officials refusing to stop a race despite lightning being reported three miles from the track, and an incident where young gun William Byron spins out veteran Denny Hamlin under caution which is a violation of NASCAR’s rule book, and NASCAR fines Hamlin $75K and docks him 15 points, but Byron is not penalized.

How much responsibility does NASCAR take for all of this? None.

At least Tate talks about taking responsibility for your actions.

Also, Tate’s fans want to be more successful. NASCAR fans just want to be deadbeat country bumpkins.

1. I own a bar and there are a few customers that I suspect have major problems with alcohol. They often come in drink too much and overspend. As the business owner, I don't refuse them service because it's making me a profit. It this ethical or moral?
2. I am a bank manager in a low income community. I am giving out high interest loans to people knowing that they will always be late with payments, incurring extra fees and possibly default. Is this ethical or moral?
3. I am a guy in a relationship with a girl who's got very low self esteem. I am basically leeching off of her, and every time she doesn't give me what I want, I allude that I'm going to break up with her, resulting in her giving me what I want. Is this moral or ethical?

Now what is the CarynAi? CarynAi is an AI program that is basically an advanced virtual girlfriend. It simulates a relationship with the AI, apparently being so advanced it can make plans for the future all for the extraordinary price of $1/min or $60/hr. I saw a lot of people basically saying ""eh whatever"", saying simps and incels are the ones using it.

Now here's the issue. People are ignoring how serious an issue loneliness is becoming for many people. This is one of the basic human needs and without it you can definitely develop mental health issues.  That is exactly what this AI is designed to do. It's mean to target lonely people, us advanced AI to develop a fictional relationship and then charge them to be able to continue it. Maybe it's not explicitly stated but that's the truth of the matter in my opinion.

It's a parasitic cycle and similar to scenarios 1-3 it shouldn't be given a pass. I think to change my view you need to explain why this isn't similar to scenarios 1-3 and why it's moral/ethical, or explain why all of these situation are moral/ethical.

Why can’t we just get used to the fact that dogs live shorter lives than humans & realize that a 10 year old dog is getting pretty old instead of needing to convert it to a new number that matches more closely with a human life span.

Firstly, there are so many causes of death and lifestyles that affect life expectancy that there could never be a single number that accurately represents a conversion.

Secondly, none of the milestones in the “dog year” formula match up with human age except for (kind of) death.  Dogs regularly have kids at 6 months old, are we saying that 3 year old humans are in prime child rearing years?

It doesn’t do any harm if you for some reason insist on doing your own math & conversions, but you should at least acknowledge that if you do it’s pretty dumb & unnecessary.

Change my view because I can’t think of a single reason to overcomplicate dogs ages by adding unnecessary math & multiplication for no reason."

3,2023-06-20,CMV: It's not possible to talk about trans rights in the US.,u/silverspools,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14eveil/cmv_its_not_possible_to_talk_about_trans_rights/,changemyview,"**First off, I actually do want my position changed on this. I REALLY need it to be so help me out.**

I think it can, but it obviously seems super hard if I am to be honest. All I think is that we need some healthy framing of the issue.

Here is my position:

**On the topic of detransition**

**Personally, I don't think anyone left or right understands this issue.** The Left wants access to care, the right wants to restrict care to protect vulnerable people. **I think that's both totally valid.** Allow me to explain and I think I can change your mind on this topic. For starters, nobody talks to detransitioners.

Sure, the right has Chloe Cole, KC and a few dozen people. The left has millions of trans people.

However, **that fact makes the typical woke liberal super fucking righteous** about the whole thing and it actually pisses me off. Why? Because nobody is actually talking TO these people in general. How do I know this?

  
**I detransitioned.**  


Yes, honest to god, did it for years too. Even served in the Army to try and be a man. If you don't believe me, my DD214, general knowledge of lowest bidder components that were a fucking nightmare to deal with and how pretty lubricant is for the Mk19 40mm Automatic grenade launcher. It's sparkly purple! I'm serious, if you know if you know.

**Unfortunately that did not work out super good for me and it fucking sucked. Why? Gender dysphoria.** Yup, it's real and it's super baked into the fucking brain, let me tell you about that. The science shows it and anyone who has a job in any hospital that isn't Catholic knows this too. We should stop pretending otherwise.

This is where the right gets this one wrong. **Conversion therapy does not work, it's torturing kids**. If you actually say you care about kids, you wouldn't support it either. It's actually illegal too and more placed are banning it. **Kids kill themselves because of it and you can't hide those bodies without poisoning your position.**

  
**Trying to ""live as a man"" did not work.** Ironically, if military service is what really makes you a man then I'm more of a man than most men in the US. I am a combat veteran too. I still find sand from Iraq to this day in my closet and I can personally tell you how fucking terrifying camels spiders are. They're like face huggers from Aliens.

**You know what did work? Retransitioning! My life has been 1000% better for it too.**

I even ""mutilated"" my body and yet I am still capable of holding a cogent conversation and live life well and not be bothered by it. I think that clearly proves transitioning works **and people get pressed when they see hot trans women.** What, you think I fundamentally reshaped my body to be average? You all look at our porn and **Pornhub has to keep reminding you all of that fact.**

Why did I detrans in the first place? **Pretty fucking obviously the transphobic society we all live in and let's not pretend otherwise**. I mean look at the language people use (mutilation's instead of surgical procedure) for starters. [That and all the hate crimes and murdering too.](https://time.com/6131444/2021-anti-trans-violence/)  


If you would like to know more about detransitioners, I'm actually a data point in the [2015 Transgender Study.](https://www.ustranssurvey.org/reports)

**Again, nobody left or right was really asking for my true opinion on this. Everyone assumes each other.**

If you read the study you will see the numbers of detransitioners and they're pretty revealing.  
**More than half, easily go on to retransition. Those that don't typically express a non-binary identity and absolutely 0 said they were somehow duped into the whole thing.**

Here is a simple personal test.  
In Iran transitioning is legal (interesting religious reason why) however homosexuality is not. **People are forced to transition to keep society heterosexual.**

Here's where some honest refection should enter you mind. **Did you know this fact before you just read it?** If so, great! If not, you need to be honest with yourself that perhaps you might not be as informed as you think.

Look , this is clearly a heated debate. I guarantee 100% that I have personally spoken with, befriended and affirmed more detransitioners than you will ever know personally. 

 What do they say? **""Stop fucking using us as a voiceless political prop""**

Some detrans grift for the culture war because everyone's trying to make a buck in this economy.

Speaking of money, no, this isn't big pharma. The cost of all trans people receiving care for the next century is a rounding error if the price of Viagra was raised $0.01.

All that being said, **I think the left and right can come together on this one.** I mean, don't we all hate politicians anyways? Let's freedom our way to a better conversation about this.

> “If Truman’s announcement turns out to be true, then I think it is the time all of us [those working on the atom bomb] should literally cut our stomachs…the Americans have achieved a great victory over us”

Nishina Yoshio, head of the Japanese atomic bomb project

While this is not super well known, the Japanese had their own atomic research program, however it faced many problems. While I won’t go super into them, cumulatively they resulted in the Japanese leadership holding onto the belief that whole technically possible the atom bomb would be too difficult to produce, much less produce in mass. 

Following the strike on Hiroshima they refused to concede that the United States had vaulted over the tremendous practical problems to create an atomic bomb. Meetings on the topic held on the 7th make this clear, with the government seeking to independently confirm the attack, though ultimately acknowledging that if it were true, then the bomb changed the dynamic (mainly by weakening Ketsugo). Even as evidence began to mount that it was a atonic bomb, leadership still buried its head claiming it could be some kind of magnesium bomb. Ultimately within certain branches of the government this research and denial continued even past the end of the war.

While certain members of the Japanese government like the doves and civilians leaders were quick to hop onto the bombs being atomic, mostly because they viewed it as the best way to surrender while saving face, the military wasn’t and they held firm against even considering surrender until they knew more. 

Had the bombs been displayed to leadership first, there wouldve been no denial. Couple that with proof of Trinity and they’d have no argument that the US couldn’t produce multiple functional bombs. This skips the uncertainty and drops the death toll considerably."

So I'll try defining what I mean for purposes of this post. 

Now as a preface my post is not about convince me I should take their view point but rather that it is understandable. Like there are views I don't agree with but can see where they are coming from. For example I am more libertarian because I see humans as not to be trusted. That said I can understand people who aren't libertarian and believe that actually a community can work together. 
But I digress.

Incel in my definition are men who believe the dating market is skewed towards pretty men. Incels believe that women hold the power in dating and that something needs to change. 

The important part of my view I want to change is understanding the what needs to change and why and how. 

It makes no sense to say women only go after Chad's and then what? Are women not supposed to go after Chad's? It's like complaining that highly skillful employees go after high paid salaries leaving people with low skill to work low paying jobs. What exactly is it that must change? I'm also not agreeing with the whole women only go for Chad's as the only criteria. 

Secondly. Why must it change? Do we not have free association? 

Thirdly. How? How does one propose forcing people to date poor ugly men?"

1,2023-06-21,CMV: Human Progress Was Gravely Harmed When Lincoln Didn’t Wipe Out The Confederacy And When Germany Didn’t Execute Hitler And His Conspirators After The Beer Hall Putsch,u/Donny-Bandish,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14eyxz9/cmv_human_progress_was_gravely_harmed_when/,changemyview,"these are two junctures in relatively modern history that i consider flashpoints at which the arc of justice was horribly warped, actions - or inaction, however you wish to interpret it - whose consequences are being felt to this very day, affecting the march of human progress and the prospects of our survival as a species. 

1. Lincoln’s refusal to wipe out the confederacy with prejudice.  as you well know, the greatest military conflict, prior to the two world wars, that the us engaged in was its own civil war. this war resulted in over half a million dead americans, some historians arguing that almost a million died. despite revisionist claims painting it as a battle over state’s rights, the war was fought over the institution of slavery, the defense of which the south viewed to be a call to arms. these traitors were willing to split the country and murder their countrymen to preserve what they saw as their god given right to own black people, whom they viewed to be inferior and deserving of their captive station. at the end of the civil war, the leadership of the confederacy was generally left untouched and cleared of any wrongdoing. general lee, who should have hanged, was even allowed to become a professor at princeton university. jefferson davis, the leader of the confederacy who sought to overthrow the us government, was given a light sentence instead of treated as the traitor he was. after leaving prison, he returned to virginia, espousing the same hateful rhetoric that joined his seditious leadership of the confederacy, spearheading the terror that would meet the freed slaves living in the south. these men, along with everyone else who provided rhetorical and material support to the confederacy should have been wiped from american soil. instead, their racism continues to insinuate itself in american society, taking hold of one of the two parties that make up the american political system, and dominating the culture of the southern us. 

2. in 1923, adolf hitler staged a military demonstration in berlin that turned violent, resulting in 14 dead nazis and 4 police officers. but even before this famous attempt at a coup de’etat, the putsch, hitler stormed the city hall in munich, taking the mayor and city council hostage. this was exactly 100 years ago. when the bullets stopped stopped flying, and  order was restored, hitler was arrested. but instead of being executed for the attempted overthrow of germany’s government, he was sentenced to 5 years in minimum security prison - of which he only did a mere 8 months. this was before he burned the reichstag and executed the night of the long knives, the two events that would precipitate his solidification of power over germany and put him in a position to wage war against the free world and slaughter millions.  Hitler was joined in this coup de’etat by Heinrich Himmler, Wilhelm Frick, Julius Streicher, Rudolf Hess, and Hermann Goerring.  

 Himmler would become head of the notorious SS was the chief administrator of the concentration camps. 

Julius Streicher was a propagandist whose anti semitic words and incitement to genocide began to be published in 1923, on the pages of his newspaper DeStormer. 

Wilhelm Frick became Hitler’s Minister of the Interior, overseeing key policies implemented by the Nazis, such as the Nuremberg laws. 

Rudolf Hess was Hitler’s deputy fuhrer. He played a central role in formulating Hitler’s vision for the world, assisting him with Mein Kampf and drafting the legislation that would lead up to the holocaust. 

Hermann Goering was head of Germany’s air force, the Luftwaffe, and considered the second most powerful man in Nazi Germany. 

none of these men, all of whom comprising the core of the Nazi command, including Hitler himself, were handled by the judiciary as traitors who had just sought to overthrow the government. instead, the judges who they stood before treated them with the kind of leniency you’d expect men who committed terrorism and treason on the scale of which they where guilty would never be accorded.

now, imagine how different this world would be if the confederacy and anyone who supported it had been wiped out. a little known bit of trivia is that Hitler’s plans for racial conquest - of Germany and, eventually, the world - were largely informed by the treatment of black people in post-slavery America. the nuremberg laws were heavily influenced by jim crow.

no debates over confederate flags or statues honoring traitors. no history books polluted with lies and historical revisionism. no politicians appealing to an idyllic past when blacks knew their place and southern hospitality consisted of lynching. how much better would race relations in the US be had the confederate traitors been wiped from existence? black people would have been given the reparations that were promised them in the walker of slavery ending. black communities in the south that were thriving hubs of culture and commerce - ultimately destroyed after federal troops left the south and effectively ended reconstruction  - might still exist to this day. 

how different would the world look had hitler and his conspirators been executed; or, if not executed, imprisoned for decades. there wouldn’t have been a world war. the jews of europe would have lived in peace. the holiday would never have happened. millions of people wouldn’t have died. cities would not have had to be rebuilt. the military indusyrial complex may never have taken shape had the impetus of the world war 2 effort not given birth to it. yes, japan was still a problem, but a coalition that wasn’t spread thin by the european axis would have handily defeated japan. in fact, arguments have been made that japan’s territorial ambition was bolstered by reassurances she received from hitler. 

anyway, my point is that the lenient treatment of the confederacy and Nazi Germany slowed the march of human progress and continues harming us to this day."

I think this starts at some point in people's lives, say high school or college graduation, whatever life period online dating overtakes other types. If there is a time in life before things change this way you should enjoy it while it lasts, but you're best off just being celibate after. Making any attempt at online dating is more trouble than it's worth, especially if the activities you enjoy do not produce good pictures and irl opportunities are scant. The emotional toll of attempting online dating is greater than almost any potential benefits. 

And no, having a satisfactory rest of your life does not automatically provide good activity pictures. I hear this a lot but it's completely false, good side pictures are limited to action shots and group photos. Action shots are limited to only a few specific activities that work, and group photos are more common if you do stuff irl but require a degree of planning that takes away your ability to actually enjoy the things you are doing.

I'm not convinced attractiveness plays any role whatsoever in making the experience easier. 

If you want sex pay for it. It's not that expensive. 

I'm saying this as a trans woman but I got my opinions when I was male presenting. I will probably use donated eggs to have kids someday and raise them as a single mother."

  What if the left-right dynamic playing out in the area of Kids and Trans rights and that intersection

Was how it was supposed to be? 


That the Left Progresses that the Right continually pulls us into Regress.


To make sure we get it Right! 






CONSIDERING  THE FEELING ON THE RIGHT THAT THE LEFT IS GOING TO OVERTAKE EVERYTHING AND FORCE ITS WAY ON EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE




   Nowadays, i think that many many more people from the center have begun to shift their feelings on the  subjects and now support the positions traditionally on the right.


   I don't know what to think about this.


I do know, as a father of an 11 year old boy, that im scared to death of getting it wrong.



I am lucky that we are at a private school.

Because for years i believed that these things would Fade like Fads.

In all honesty, I didn't think about it that much and being a democrat, I've been reflexively been on the ""support at all costs""

But as my son got older, and i realized why i am not so concerned..  

It's because HE IS AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL.


ERGO: THAT IF HE WEREN'T, I WOULD BE NERVOUS.


I guess i found out by accident that I do detect some sort of agenda.

I think it's an agenda that springs from a good place, from a place of wanting the best for the greatest number of people..

Which is fine.


However it forgets that half the country is on a  whole other Trip.


And though i think it's too much of a backlash,  maybe it's not. 


 

I find some peace in the following: 

I think that the answer is that the system was designed to have ""progress"" of the Left be tempered always with the "" regress "" of the Right.


   I don't think that change can happen too fast.

Its a shame that it will take suffering and strife but they way that i see it is that this cultural struggle is normal, healthy and thank God for it!


  That the left (and that's where i am) had, for many years, almost a clear path to their view of progress.


They didn't take into consideration the other half of the country.


They just barreled straight ahead...


And so now the Right is doing what they need to in order to slow things down..   



So that in case there was any danger in the more liberal agenda, that it can be at least slowed down and maybe from a place of intention it will go forward, not from a place of untested unrestraint.




 We on the left should be happy about this.

Or could be.

If the Right was as aware of these dynamics i think it could make all the difference.




But i think that both sides see the future as if its a country of only their own mind/kind. 

   
On the left we have assumed that all the changes and such that we Saw for society, such as the freedom to be who you are and to take on the established religious restrictive world full speed ahead were obvious Truths and obvious Goods.

They still seem so to me.

But are they? 


Did we think of what that our more Right friends in the country were needing? 

We didn't ask. We just went full forward and and with a gusto.


   Now, we are having a forced conversation about these things. Like a couple in Marriage Therapy.




  And the result is that the changes are on hold for now.

They are being re-examined .


And in the end, if they were worthwhile changes to society they will soon pick up Speed.

In fact it seems like the Right is being given a very small window to have it's say in, before it is overwhelmed by the GenZ bias towards being on the left.


So, either way, it's a give and take that i think i am okay with because i see a larger purpose in it... Almost a silently guiding sort of force.

Maybe it would help if we all could see this in their day to day life..


I am saying all of this in a general sort of way, fully realizing that the Right having the reigns, culturally, for a bit, is asking for impossible compromises for people.


That's why i think that it's helpful to see things as a FEATURE and not a bug.


That it's okay that we are slowing down for a bit.


I think the issue in schools is that the lefts desires, as Adults, 
 for a new Way of being and living is playing out in the lives of our children.

OUR KIDS ARE NOT DOING WELL.


WE CAN BLAME BOTH SIDES FOREVER AND FIGHT FOR THE FIGHT OF IT!   
 

But

 then we would again be forgetting that our kids are not doing well.




Maybe it's for x maybe for y maybe, for Z reason.


That doesn't matter so much as much as The question of IF WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE LONG HELD WAYS OF LIVING, WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT.

We need to slow down and have these conversations.

That's the beauty in the American Experiment.


We can and should be, on both sides, grateful of this process.

Right now, the Right is beginning to take the Reigns.


Maybe, It is up to those of us on the left to make sure they don't have too much of a hold. Meaning that we don't fall into some bad ways of governing ourselves.


And then back and then forth.

It's a difficult time to be young.


I often resent the right for making it harder. 

But what if they are saving us from making horrible decisions that are too difficult to change? 


What if it is a lesson that we needed?



Who knows what those things might be. 

At least we are slowing down, and examining it


It gives me peace and makes me see the bigger picture about how this amazing country works."

I believe that religion like finances is a personal matter and nobody should be shamed or coerced into a religious faith. As an Episcopalian/Anglican Christian, I also accept evolution, and Old Earth, and am an ally to the GLBTQ+ community. I believe that in America, faith has been misused and abused by the religious right to push a right-wing political agenda that makes me wonder if Jesus Christ would support. Also, many young people some middle-aged people have been traumatized by their experiences in a faith community.

I consider myself a progressive Christian in terms of theology and a political moderate and registered Independent. I try to stay away from hyper-partisan politics that seek to exacerbate the political polarization in America. I want to see healing from the division. But according to data, increasingly people are ditching Christianity and other organized faiths. This is pronounced in people ages 16 to 45, which would be Millennials and Generation Z. For many people have left religion to become nonreligious due to changing social norms, being unable to reconcile their faith and sexuality, and coping with the hypocrisy in the church.

If this trend continues, it seems likely that America, a nation that was strongly influenced by Christian principles, would become a new bastion for **secular humanism** and America may become the new Netherlands (The Netherlands is very secular and has few religious minorities). I am concerned that if 55% of the US population becomes religiously unaffiliated, then that means I would likely face marginalization and persecution for practicing my faith.

I don't see myself as an evangelist but I do believe that *not all of the world's religions provide a path to salvation.* It is my belief that humanity can ***only*** be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus Christ. Now this may sound irrelevant, but I consider this a deeply held religious belief. Take from that what you will. I am perfectly fine with individuals not believing what I believe since religion is a personal choice, I seem concerned with the trends of secularization in America. This seems to undermine my faith since as less people practice the same beliefs, Western civilization is likely to shift away from the Judeo-Christian principles that made it successful.

So that's my expression of my view. I apologize if some things are irrelevant, I just need to vent. I hope from this *#ChangeMyView*, people can challenge my notions about secularization and the idea of an interfaith dating relationship.

I think my opinion is fairly clearly stated in the title. All of the information and research I have seen says that black Americans have lower average IQs than white Americans and/or Americans overall. However, it has been very hard to find recent research on the subject, and it's come to my attention that investigations of such topics are banned, either explicitly or implicitly, in most venues I would usually seek to aggregate data from. I'm curious about if there is any actual data or arguments against  the thesis statement that I've missed or been unable to find, or if the reason such discussions are suppressed is because there are no counterarguments and it's conclusively but uncomfortably true.

To clarify, I am NOT arguing that black Americans are dumber/less capable/inferior to other Americans. I'm aware of the limitations of and flaws in IQ tests, and don't think intelligence corresponds to human worth/validity of human rights anyway. Also, I am NOT making any arguments about any individuals. I'm very aware of how normal distributions work, and that the deviation within racial groups is larger than the difference between group averages. Finally, I am NOT arguing that black Americans inherently score lower on IQ tests, I am open to the idea that changes in socioeconomic status, culture, racism, etc, could eliminate the IQ gap, and if anything some research I've seen suggests the magnitude of the gap has decreased over time. My position is only that at present in 2023 (or, since data for 2023 isn't available, whenever data was last collected), the average IQ for black Americans was lower than the overall average.

Please change my view. "

Arguments like ""the rigid rhythm of the school day, with gym class and recess squeezed out... is not ideal for boys"" are implied to be biological while reinforcing the classic tropes that ""boys will be boys"" and that it's just natural for them to focus less on, and care less about, their studies.

&#x200B;

We all reach education at our own individual level of maturity, and the idea that men are inherently less mature just feeds the historically sexist view that men should be boisterous and childish in youth and women demure and composed. If we all develop at different rates how can we say that some people need to be held back to catch up, when there is genetic variance amoung all children.

&#x200B;

If women express a lack of interst in education they are told they are limitting themselves, but if boys do it's because of their ""naturally wild nature"".

&#x200B;

Furthermore, the idea that men need more help to focus totally ignores that society puts more pressure on women to succeed while allowing men to relax without threat of consequence, trusting that they will just be fine. 

&#x200B;

Society has ensured that men have fewer consequences for neglecting their studies than women creating a situation in which, now that women have equal access to education, they are doing, as a result, far better. If men want to compete with women academically they shouldn't try and just be older, but actually be more dilligent.

&#x200B;

An argument is made that fewer men recieve bachelors degrees today than women, but this simply represents a lack of interest of men to go into higher education, compared with women. Fewer men apply to college.

&#x200B;

The only fair way is to group people as they always have been, by age, and let those that perform better rise to the top. All redshirting does is hold men to a lower standard than women."

Okay, having listened to some of your arguments around the differences in the way drunk driving laws are written and applied in the US, I can see some of the reasoning behind them. I still think a better system could be implemented, but I don't think the laws are as stupid as they first seemed. Thanks to those who contributed meaningfully. I have distributed deltas to the main arguments I found compelling.


I was surprised to learn when visiting the US, specifically Texas, that it is illegal for an open container of alcohol to be anywhere in the car, including in the hands of passengers or for example, a half empty bottle of vodka from the night before being on the back seat.

To me, this is a pointless rule. It is already illegal to drink drive, that's fine, but why stop passengers from drinking? Why make it awkward to move drinks around if they're open? If I'm not drinking and driving, what is the issue?

There doesn't seem to be any point to the law that isn't covered by standard drink drive laws as seen in other countries. It just makes life more awkward, road trips less fun and gives one more reason for the state to flex its muscles and fine people.

Arbitrary rules and restrictions placed on people that don't serve a purpose of protection are examples of needless authoritarianism and an anachronism. ""Follow the rules because we say so"" they dont seem to be there to protect anyone.

I want someone to give me a better argument than my Texan family who seem to think it's a good law to stop drink driving, something there is already a law against.

To me, it seems like pre-crime or thought crime. ""You may not be drink driving but you have more potential to so you're getting a fine"" completely unfair.

To change my view you would need to convince me that this law solves a real problem not already solved by rules against drink driving or otherwise give me a good reason why passengers can't drink or why I can't have a half empty bottle in the back."

Although their deaths will be painless, meaning peaceful. Knowing you’re going/about to die is not peaceful at all. With the banging sounds that they’ve heard in the ship? They’re scared and they’re panicking. And I feel terrible.

Take away their riches and privilege aside. They’re people with families. They’re someone’s father, son, husband, grandchild, classmate, colleague, role model, etc. 

I don’t really see what people gain in celebrating death. Even when criminals are “neutralized,” I don’t celebrate the fact they have been, but that the problem or the crime has finally been resolved. 

Everyday, we all take risks. We hop on planes, drive in cars, eat food that’s past due. Not to compare that to going down into mysterious waters. But, I feel like we all like to scream “YOLO” to the top of our lungs, but then call people stupid for actually taking it to heart. 

I would agree that being a billionaire is unethical. But, I don’t think that it’s a sole reason someone is deserving of a terrible death.

And hey, with all the money in the world, who wouldn’t want to do side quests?

I do think that it was a stupid decision, and said decision will result in their death’s but…we all miscalculate sometimes you know?

————

Edit: To rephrase my first sentence, “I was kind of surprised with the amount of people laughing at the fact that they’re going to die. Or saying that their deaths are deserved because they are rich.” I apologize for not making that distinction.

Edit: On the side quest statement. that was more of a joke, you weren’t supposed to take that seriously. I wasn’t saying that they shouldn’t be donating to charities. but, I do understand that when you have everything in the world, it’s easy to feel bored. Which is why I think billionaires act all crazy and start venturing into weird shit. I’m not justifying what they did, or how much of a miscalculation it was. But, I think we often ask ourselves, “why do billionaires act like crazy son’s of bitches?” But, If I had all the money in the world, no obstacles, nothing left to achieve. I wouldn’t know what to do with myself. I wouldn’t go to the moon or jet pack off of mount everest, or try to discover mermaids. But i definitely would go wild and mix margarita with milk (again another joke)

A comment I made: 
“I addressed this in another comment, but like other people have said…we know about deaths because of what is shoved in our face by the media. But that doesn’t mean that I didn’t feel bad about the people capsizing, or the father and son being struck by lightning, or a prisoner dying because he wasn’t able to receive his heart medication. How I know about these deaths? It’s because of the media, and what was thrown into my face. The only deaths, that i’d know of without the media, are the ones in my community/local. But that doesn’t mean I don’t feel bad all the same. just because I feel bad about rich people dying doesn’t mean I can’t feel bad for the diseased or the sick dying. Why does empathy have to be mutually exclusive? You can be angry that the media doesn’t showcase the deaths of the diseased, or the sick, or the vulnerable. but in doing so, that doesn’t mean you have to celebrate the well-off dying. Death is peaceful, but the circumstance is always the opposite. My father died of cancer. So although I can’t empathize with the feeling of “knowing you’re going to die soon and there’s nothing you can do about,” i’ve seen it firsthand and it’s just terrible. Not to make this religious, but when I pray, i pray for the sick, I pray for the recently deceased, i pray for all the people in the whole world. There’s no possible way for me to know of everyone who has died, or will die, or every, single terrible circumstance. Because like you say, there’s just too many. but that doesn’t mean I don’t feel bad when I come across it.”

Edit: Please try to keep your comments respectful to the situation an each other, 

Edit: Not caring about them dying is not the same thing as laughing or celebrating that they’re dying…

Edit: I addressed this in a comment but what I had read was that their death was going to be immediate and painless? Maybe I didn’t read the right sources and I apologize. 

————

Final Edit: 

“All five people on Titanic-touring submersible believed to be dead,
 U.S. Coast Guard says. 

- Debris found is ""consistent with a catastrophic implosion of the vessel.” 
- Tail cone found 1,600 feet from the Titanic on sea floor


Through reading everyone’s arguments and opinions on this topic, I regret to say that my view hasn’t been changed.

I think it’s strange to put yourself on a moral high horse because you speak of inequality or those in need…but then, laugh and celebrate human suffering. I think we all can agree that knowing you’re going to die, within hours, and not being able to do anything to stop it… is the worst kind of mental suffering. 

Indifference isn’t the same as celebratory or finding the situation comical. It’s the exact opposite actually. And I think a lot of you confused the two. 

Stay safe and take care of yourselves everyone. 
Also call your loved ones from time to time!

3,2023-06-21,CMV: watching porn should not be normalized within committed sexual relationships,u/maimonidies,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14fdehi/cmv_watching_porn_should_not_be_normalized_within/,changemyview,"Lately I see so many reddit posts from wives complaining that their husbands watch porn and that it bothers them. Most of the responses would be like, ""its none of your business what your husband does"", ""its his body he can jerk off whenever and however he wants"", ""your'e just insecure, go see a therapist"", etc. But I feel this is wrong on so many levels. This practice has become so normalized that women don't questions this anymore, it's something that they have come to accept as part of life, as if  all males behave that way and that it is inevitable, so they are stuck with these conflicting emotions not knowing how to process them.

Regardless of whether porn is a form of cheating or not, I think this practice should not be normalized within committed sexual relationships, for the reasons below:

1. It's simply not true that all men need to watch porn. If you wanna make the argument that all men need to jerk off every once a while that's one thing. But to say that watching porn is a necessity is simply a lie. Plenty of my friends do not watch porn but have healthy sex lives instead.
2. There's a difference between jerking off and watching porn. I find that ppl conflate these two, its like if he can't watch porn then you're not letting him release his sexual energy and you're hindering him and his natural urges. But that's another lie. There are plenty of ways for men to jerk off without resorting to porn. Porn is just a heightened form of imagination and fantasy, men masturbated for thousands of years before the advent of porn and they did just fine. It's just not a necessity.
3. This is really my main argument. **Watching porn in most cases will hinders one's sex life with their spouse.** I know this to be the case as I experienced this firsthand. First off, porn addiction is a real thing and it can ruin one's sex life, but that may be an extreme case; even if someone is not actually addicted to porn, it undoubtedely affects one's sex life whether they are aware of it or not. Men lie to themselves that they are just not in the mood of sex, or that they are simply too tired to do it, but the truth if they wouldn't be watching porn they would be having sex much more often. Not the same argument can be made in regards to masturbation. Masturbation on the most part does not hinder one's active sex life, because it is a completely different experience, and is usually used in addition to sex. But porn, besides for the unhealthy expectations it sets, is a lot of times used as a substitute for sex. Yes I know, sex with the same person can get boring at times, but instead of focusing on making things better and spicier in the bedroom, its just easier for men to jerk off to their fantasy hottie, so its the easy way out, but not necessarily the most effective and most healthy way for men to cope with their sexual energy. I may be overgeneralizing here, but I know that this is true for so many men. And [research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1988.tb00027.x) seems to back this up.

I'm not arguing that porn should be banned, I'm just saying that porn shouldn't be normalized to the point that all women must accept the fact that men need to be able to watch porn. Let's be true to ourselves, porn has a lot of negatives and its not something men NEED (they WANT it alright, but they also want to cheat and hang out in strip clubs), and it's ok for women not to be ok with their men jerking off to porn. This has nothing to do with them owning their husbands body. If porn is affecting their sex life (and I think it does) then I think they should have every right to make resonable demands and set normal healthy boundaries on what is or isn't allowed in a committed sexual relationship.

Edit for clarity: my first two points are not that since porn is not a need then men should be ok without it. My point is that men use statements like those to maipulate women to make porn more acceptable and normalized, they compare it to masturbation as if to say, that if you don't let me watch porn then youre not letting me be a healthy functioning male, which is simply not the case. There's a chasm between the two."
1,2023-06-21,CMV: I belief most issues in modern US society are more nuanced and complex then the simplistic labels people place on them. (Ex. Abortion is more complex then simply saying pro-choice/life),u/Hopeful-Translator70,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14fdulh/cmv_i_belief_most_issues_in_modern_us_society_are/,changemyview,"General gist in the title, however…continuing on the abortion theme…

I think we can scientifically conclude that ‘life’ begins prior to the fetus relocating from inside the mother to outside, which would imply Pro-Life. However I don’t think it’s fair that we force a woman to carry a baby to term in all circumstances. Rape, incest, medical deformities, etc are all reasonable justifications to have an abortion. Risk to the life of the mother is obvious as well. That said, I don’t think even for those reasons anyone should wait past the pregnancy mid-point to have an abortion for any reason other than medical necessity.

The mother has rights over her body, bodily autonomy, but the fetus inside her is a new unique human being who’s right to live should also be considered. The conflicting rights have to be weighed and prioritized.

Abortion therefore is a complex issue that can’t be summarized by simply saying Pro-whatever. I believe most of the troubling issues in US society these days are the same, they require reason and broad consensus through compromise to resolve. Our inability to do so is a threat to the future of society."

That ""power"" has many facets.

In the first instance we can say that a person has power when they are able to longer survive than their peers without needing outside help. It is easy to get a feel for what this means when we were to imagine that some workers of Amazon would protest against Bezos by going on strike. It is a matter of fact that without dedicated labor unions maintaining these laborers the strike would amount to nothing because Bezos can live longer without his income than the people who labor under him. That is in part because of the shares that he has from Amazon. As long as most of his projects succeed it doesn't matter if some fail. It is thus the fact that he's the CEO of Amazon that makes him rich.

In the second instance we can say that a person has power when he amasses a large collection of stuff. This is basically my answer as to why a book in a flea market sells for less than the same book in a dedicated book store. Amazon has in general a large collection of stuff and it is because they have a large collection fo that stuff that they can charge premium for it. Bezos, as the CEO of Amazon, assumes ownership of all this stuff, hence why Bezos is rich as the CEO of Amazon."

This is actually not a great model of the labor market in general, but for the purposes of this post, it’ll do. Basically, most people think of immigration as an increase in labor supply. Labor supply is the number of people willing to work at a given wage. So, more people, more workers for any given wage. As a result of the labor supply increase, wages go down.  
OK, but working isn’t the only thing that immigrants do. They also buy stuff. They rent apartments. They buy food. They get haircuts. They go to the doctor.  
All that stuff takes labor to produce. Food takes labor. Haircuts take labor. Doctor visits take labor. Building new apartments takes labor. And so on. Even if the immigrants don’t start spending their money on day 1, businesses can see the immigration wave coming and they know there will be increased demand for their products. So they hire more people. To hire more people they have to…raise wages.

A positive labor supply shock pushes wages down. A positive labor demand shock pushes up wages. Maybe one of those effects is a little bigger; maybe the other. But they’re going to mostly cancel out.  
  
And to see why this is true, just think about babies. Each new generation is bigger than the one that came before it. If those young people were just a labor supply increase, then as population went up, wages would go down. But obviously that’s not what happens, because young people also buy stuff, which pushes up labor demand, which pushes wages back up.

If the answer is yes, then the being is not truly omnipotent because it cannot complete the task. If the answer is no, then the being is also not omnipotent because it is unable to create the task in the first place. Either way, the concept of omnipotence appears to lead to a logical contradiction. this implies that no being can be almighty and all powerfull.  
  
Omniscience Paradox: This paradox explores the concept of omniscience, which is the idea that God possesses all knowledge. The question raised is whether an omniscient being can know the future. If God knows the future with certainty, then human free will might be called into question. On the other hand, if the future is not knowable, it raises doubts about God's omniscience.  
  
Problem of Evil: While not a traditional paradox, the problem of evil presents a challenge to the existence of a perfectly good, all-powerful, and all-knowing God in the face of the existence of evil and suffering in the world. If God is all-loving, why does evil persist? If God is all-powerful, why doesn't he intervene to prevent suffering? This paradox questions the compatibility of these attributes.  
  
In my personal belief, I posit that an entity or some form of existence predates the widely accepted concept of the Big Bang. This belief stems from the logical understanding that something cannot emerge from absolute nothingness, as evident in the mathematical principle that 0 added to 0 can never equate to 1. I refer to this entity as ""God,"" acknowledging the limitations of language and human comprehension in defining such a transcendent being.  
  
According to my perspective, this God has introduced the theory of Karma, which suggests that our actions have consequences that reverberate throughout existence. However, I posit that God does not actively interfere in the functioning of the world, as such interference is beyond human comprehension and cannot be easily delineated through logical constructs. God's nature remains elusive and resistant to precise definition.  
  
In my belief system, I assert that God has endowed humanity with a fundamental sense of morality, providing a compass that guides our ethical choices. However, I contend that the true essence of God is ineffable and cannot be fully captured or articulated through human language or expression. It transcends the boundaries of our finite understanding. how he is being an such great and mysterious thing know how many virgin bitches u will get after bombarding fellow humans which are non-followers, he also knows what type of clothes women should wear and how he be worshipped. he also knows how much flowers be dedicated to him how much currency he wants . he also knows which sweet dishes he likes. doesn't it seems worthless for a being like almighty himself."

I believe essentially online dating options are too taxing to be a net positive, while irl dating basically ends around high school or college graduation.  
  
I think probably you lose your irl options around the end of sophmore year in college, but if you get lucky and are in a major with people you actually like then you can get an extra two years. It is possible some jobs allow you to irl date and this is worth choosing your job over, and probably worth a 50% pay cut but I don't think most people do this, nor do I think it is an option to change your career for this.  (I'm a programmer, it sucks even though I've gotten to travel to dozens of countries and all that, I'm a virgin in my late twenties and gonna die as one)

Even if you lead a fulfilling life, it doesn't necessarily translate into attractive online dating profile pictures. I've heard many people say this, but in reality, truly engaging photos typically consist of action shots or group images. Action photos work only for certain specific activities, while group pictures require planning that often diminishes the enjoyment of the moment.  
  
Furthermore, I don't believe physical attractiveness significantly eases the experience of online dating. I think modern dating is just a scenario where everyone loses.  
  
If physical intimacy is your goal, considering professional services could be an option, as the cost isn't prohibitively high.  
  
While I'm currently speaking from the perspective of a trans woman, my viewpoint was formulated during the time I presented as male. As for starting a family, I intend to potentially use donated eggs in the future and embrace single motherhood.

So often it seems they want additional rights to elevate them over the majority.

I understand why. It's sort of a ""payback"" for being abused and marginalized for so long. I can empathize with that. But it doesn't make it right.

I believe that all humans are naturally self-interested and look out for themselves. This translates into groups of people as well. BLM doesn't care about other minority groups - they want theirs. The disabled doesn't care about racial minorities....and etc. etc.

The concept of intersectionality is now in our consciousness, but I still believe there is a long way to go to fully understand and address this when seeking rights.

And who said that everyone within the ""majority"" is equal to begin with? That's a separate fallacy in itself."

This is life or death stuff, not only for the COVID 19 but the next national emergency we face. One way or another, trust in our institutions must be restored.

Any misinformation about vaccines needs to be exposed as such. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. I have no delusions about Hotez changing the mind of ardent anti-vaxxers, but there are people out there who, in good faith, want to understand these disagreements and hear all sides. 

There is a lot of money on the table. The $1.5 million dollars could be put to a lot of good that would overcome the minor negatives of participating in the debate. Meanwhile, taking the money redistributes money from the donors to a good cause.

I already know that Dr. Hotez as expressed reluctance on the grounds that the debate would somehow give RFK Jr. additional clout AND that Hotez worries that RFK Jr. is a more clever debater. I do not find either argument compelling (so repackaging these arguments isn't likely to change my view.

**I don't buy the argument that debating RFK would validate RFK Jr's views or increase his clout and authority somehow.**

\-RFK Jr. is already a household name, if only for his namesake. RFK Jr. already reaches a substantial audience that is continuing to grow. Now there are even Republicans looking up to this lifetime Democrat. Successfully dispelling any misinformation might loosen RFK Jr's hold on this audience, but more importantly, there are people out there on the fence. Refusing to debate gives the impression that Hotez is hiding something or knows that he would be easily defeated. Avoiding the debate plays into that side's interests more than meeting him on the stage would give them clout.

\-I used to spend a lot of time watching debates between theists and atheists about creation vs. evolution. I never heard a scientist argue that debating a creationist would make the creationist appear more authoritative.

**I do not buy the argument that RFK's silver tongue would overcome Hotez's expertise and experience.**

\-Hotez has done countless media appearances. He is no stranger to the camera and microphone. In fact, he has already done Joe Rogan's podcast. The deal is that Hotez can take his time, so it's not like he has to be quick witted.

\-Hotez is an experienced academic and scientist. His entire career has been dedicated to evaluating evidence and making arguments to support or refute claims and hypotheses. I am sure he's spoken at conferences and taken questions.

\-With $1.5 million coming in, Hotez can afford to spend a little time studying RFK Jr.s go-to arguments. If he's really that daunted about appearing publicly to discuss things that he's dedicated his career to researching, he can get a debate coach temporarily to help him.

\-Unlike Trump, RFK Jr. does not have a habit of blustering, bullying, and talking over people. To his credit, I have seen him take hard questions, and he listened and then responded. I don't think he would play dirty with Dr. Hotez, and even if he did, that would only expose him as a fraud to all but those who will stand by him no matter what.

\-No, Dr. Hotez should not give up his time and energy answering every random nutjob that comes out of the woodwork making crazy claims. That wouldn't be helpful either. But no matter how disagreeable his views are, RFK Jr. is not some random nutjob. There is $1.5 million lined up in support of this, he's running for president, and as a lawyer all these years, he's at least a professional in dealing with evidence and arguments about scientifically related topics, even if he has nowhere near the expertise Hotez does. So, this is not going to be a waste of time.

**Things that could change my view.** Hotez should not debate RFK Jr. if it can be shown with reliable evidence that:

\-Hotez has something to hide that would be exposed in a debate. For example, if he had been publicizing his views about the vaccines in bad faith. Pointing out that understanding and guidance evolved is not enough. Show that he was intentionally, knowingly misleading the public.

\-The reliable evidence about vaccines is on RFK Jr's side AND Hotez already knows his argument would not withstand scrutiny.

As I award delta's, I will list the things that altered or gave me worthwhile, interesting ""food for thought"" below."

1,2023-06-21,CMV: The ideas behind non-binary and trans gender identities don't make any sense.,u/lev_low,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14fh1q5/cmv_the_ideas_behind_nonbinary_and_trans_gender/,changemyview,"I've been thinking about this topic quite a bit lately and feel like it would be good to hear something from ""the other side"" on it. I personally believe that biological sex, is a more real, useful and meaningful concept that gender identity for a number of reasons. The first is based on biology: Among humans there are only two sexes, male and female. These are made up of a whole host of traits, but the most important ones are the stuff between your legs - having a penis, testicles and the ability to produce sperm if male, having a vulva, ovaries, the ability to produce eggs and give birth to a child if female. Adding to these are secondary sex characteristics - body type, voice, face shape, skin type and so on. There is no third type of genitalia and, most importantly, no third type of gamete besides sperm and eggs. There is no ""spegg"" that serves some third purpose for sexual reproduction. There are people born with various intersex conditions, but these people are a tiny minority of the population and don't produce a third type of gamete.

The second is observational - I have met people who identified as transgender or non-binary and I've been able to observe their biological sex (albeit without seeing any genitals, so just with like 95% certainty or whatever) within minutes of interacting with them. Despite the fact that they had gone to some lengths to change them, their secondary sex characteristics - body type, face shape etc - easily and consistently gave them away as either male or female. I've never seen a human being who I've been unable to categorize as either male or female. You don't have to rely on my anecdotes either, there are many trans and non-binary people in public life who are easily clockable as, again, either male or female: Elliot Page (female), Dylan Mulvaney (male), Conchita Wurst (male), Janelle Monáe (female). 

The third reason is logical - the definition of gender as ""If you feel like a man or woman, you are one"" turns gender into an incoherent and nonsensical concept. An apple is an apple because it's a very specific type of fruit that can be separated from pears, giraffes and phone booths by certain observational criteria. If anything can be an apple, ""apple"" turns into a string of sounds without meaning. If any person on the planet can be a woman merely by identifying as one, ""woman"" is a useless term - ""woman"" only gains meaning by excluding other types of people according to certain criteria, like not having a vulva and ovaries. If woman is an adult human female, it's easy to discern which people are women are which are not. If woman is something you feel like, a woman is just any human since, presumably, anyone can feel like anything. In virtually every other aspect of existence, most people would agree that you can't identify your way into things - I am a 25 year-old, 6 feet tall man with pale skin, a skinny build and a deep voice. If I said I identified as a 50 year-old, 5 feet tall woman with dark skin, a stocky build and a light voice most people would rightly say I was being ridiculous. All of these aspects of myself are observable externally and not a matter of how I *feel*, yet so many see no problem with your gender identity - and nothing else- being a matter of personal identification. 

Parts of this post might be regarded as inflammatory, but these are my sincere beliefs and experiences. I believe that this debate will be aided by neither side self-censoring themselves in order to be less controversial. To add some context I am a gay man who in some ways breaks societal gender roles, and I find it frustrating that I'm often ""expected"" to support transgender issues because I'm part of the LGBT acronym. Homosexuality and transgenderism are two very different things that aren't based on the same concepts or experiences."

The copyright system has been entirely hijacked by corporate actors to stifle innovation and progress in the name of ""fairness"". If I want to make a remix to some T-Series song, giving proper credit, why should I get sued?

In general, I think copyright as a system should be radically reformed. Markets are always more productive when more actors are focusing on creating products -- more products and more diverse products get made.

Let's take that remix example. Maybe T-Series had a song with a really nice sitar part, but they fucked up the drums. If I download that mp3, isolate the sitar part, record a new drum part for it, and release a new (better) song, doesn't everyone benefit?

At best, I think that the tenure of copyright should be brought back down to 10ish years. Or the system could be abolished entirely.

4,2023-06-21,CMV: You should not recommend going to a psychologist for existential philosophical issues,u/MentalDespairing,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14fjswh/cmv_you_should_not_recommend_going_to_a/,changemyview,"EDIT: There seems to be a misunderstanding. I am not someone who has never tried a psychologist and am asking, quite the opposite. I **am** going to a psychologist now and **have tried multiple ones.** I am arguing from my experience that they could not help. The one I stuck with the longest is helping me get on welfare so I am extremely appreciative for that, but I do think it was a waste for my philosophical problems.

I am a person suffering from existential, philosophical dread. I think if morality is relative altruism, torture, murder, friendship are all equally valuable. Every culture and morality is just as good as another and imposing any view or advocating any view is a form of moral imperialism.

Human beings try to cheat by saying ""nihilism is true, we can create our own meaning"", but those people at the same time try to arrest and condemn people who do stuff like theft and murder....even though nihilism means everything is acceptable. It is insincere to say people can chose their own values then punish people who have values you don't like.

I'm struggling to live my life because I am losing the ability to use the word ""should"". And no, survival and pleasure are not objectively good.

I believe that a psychologist is NOT the right to discuss these issues. If I want to mention stuff like slave morality, moral nihilism, moral relativism, radical skepticism and so forth, the psychologist I have tried (ranging from 2-11 appointments per individual) could not keep up. EDIT: **I have already seen multiple psychologists. This post is not about me trying it for me the first time. I am currently and have gone to psychologists for a long time. It's just that it does not works, sorry for making it sound like I have no experience.**

Before saying ""well, you should study philosophy then"" - I don't think this is accurate, as studying philosophy the professor is not there to serve you but you to listen to them and perform the assignments. It would be incredibly awkward and uncomfortable for other people and the professor to see me again and again derail the classes and papers to be about my personal moral crisis.

To me it seems that a lot of people advocating going to a psychologist for philosophical, existential dread is using circular logic, or a sort of axiomatic argument- If you have existential dread you are not mentally well. Please consider not doing that - entertain the idea that a person who has existential dread is sane, I just simply refuse to select an ignorance, desperately hoping for external help.

Please consider responding with something else than ""edgy"". This ruins the CMV. I will sincerely respond to non-rude replies, as I do want my view changed.

**""Direct responses to a submission must challenge or question at least one aspect of the submitted view.""**

EDIT: I am considering studying philosophy in the fall (money is not an issue). But this could risk me becoming more depressed, and mind going dark places. Is it worth the risk if it could also be a solution? Because reading about nihilism and relativism hurts me, yet the other alternative is to be ignorant."

Every human being needs to discover what they care about, and it's selfish & presumptuous to impose on them. Sure, it's definitely valuable to teach them the same languages as us, both the creative languages that deal with emotions, like art, music, and languages like math&philosophy. I guess spoken & written language is sort of a means to connect these languages. 

It's up to the more knowledgeable other (the 'elder', in the first phases of a person's development, as opposed to the 'younger') to try to teach the young what they think has value. The ability to communicate harmoniously should always be prioritized as it's our foundation of interaction. This requires both emotional and intellectual education. I feel like the current system has a pressing lack of the former, and an imposing focus on the latter. . 

When we can communicate, it's up to the elder to act responsibly to the best of their ability, simply be how they think they are the best version of themselves, while staying open for input of the child. It will come for guidance, whenever it requires. As long as it is treated gently, it will continue to do so until traumatized otherwise. 

The elder have a responsibility to the younger, to learn them how to communicate and to welcome their value and potential in our society. To just give knowledge when they ask for it, and share perspectives when they share their view. Help them learn and be open to learn ourselves

Can't we as a society just put more focus on establishing trust, listening to the younger, and respectfully discuss how things are?

While on the topic of communicating&distributing value, I'm trying to re-define what one could consider ""a moral investment"". I would say we could call it:
A redistribution of wealth aimed at creating value. The goal should never be to receive money, because pursuing money for money's sake is an escapism from insecurity, which in turn is a behavior that is toxic for our surrounding because it incentives us to believe it could be 'okay' to oppress others.
Seeing another human as a means instead of as a goal is not human, and those of us who are 'with their heart' while reading this will probably understand what I mean.

When parents post their kids on TikTok for views, they are unknowingly exposing their kids to pedophiles. They do not realize that pedophiles intentionally follow these accounts because they are indirectly trying to acquire cp. This needs to be stopped immediately because kids are more accessible to pedophiles than ever these days.

This stems from the entire idea that Millennials are in desperate need of clicks and likes. Millennials are trying too hard to become celebrities and will make their children expendable to do it. Yes, posting your kid for likes is child abuse. And the reason this is child abuse is because your child cannot consent to being in the TikTok video.

Another problem is that the comments section in these TikTok reals shows how many people know that this is wrong and it also leads to the idea that parenting is getting worse, and children are more entitled than ever.

I think this should be punished by this law:

If you post your kids on TikTok, you will automatically be fired from your job, you will have to serve at least 20 years in prison, you will lose your place of residence, even if your mortgage is paid off, and you will have to register as a sex offender for life.

Sam preaches that nobody should smoke cigarettes. He believes that cigarretes severely damage the health of both the smoker and those around them, as many clinical studies prove. He also believes that cigarettes contribute to pollution and reduce air quality.

However, Sam is himself a smoker. He’s a dirty little hypocrite.

…But how does that undermine anything he’s said?

He’s still right. Cigarettes HAVE been clinically proven to damage the health of the smoker and those around them. They certainly contribute to pollution and reduce air quality. These objective facts have not changed one bit because of Sam’s hypocrisy.

Sam knows what’s best, but he struggles to do it, perhaps because of nicotine’s addictive properties - and that’s fine. Plenty of people know what they should be doing, but struggle to do it. That’s normal. We shouldn’t devalue their opinions just because they aren’t perfect robots who live in utter conformity with their own principles 100% of the time.

I think people too often use the hypocrisy of their opponent in an argument as a justification for ignoring their opponent’s points, without actually addressing the points themselves. This perpetuates close-mindedness.

Imagine if someone said 'lynching black people is part of my culture so you can't get mad about it', you wouldn't accept that hopefully. 

The biggest issue here is consent, babies can't consent yet they have a piece of them cut off. It's fine if it's medically necessary but the ides that it prevents disease is dumb, just wash your dick. I've never gotten an UTI because of foreskin and I'm obviously uncircumcised. Just let your child have their foreskin and wait until they're able to make the decision for their own, adult circumcision isn't bad at all.

I'm a feminist but circumcision is another example of feminist double standards. If you have a vagina, imagine if your clitoris was cut off. That's a circumcision. When FGM happens everyone is outraged but more than 75% the US population don't give a shit when MGM happens."

My view is this: The current body of evidence to the onset of the Younger Dryas does not indicate that their was an impact event, as such I do not believe there was an impact event.

The idea that it was started from an impact event is not a new one, however it would be more accurate to call it a revived one. The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis was really pushed most recently by a researcher by the name of Firestone who I believe in 2007 released his first paper of many on the subject. From there, research has mainly gone through the Comet Research Group. While they publish a lot of work, they also have quite a few critics and researchers who do not support them. I once read someone state that if anyone proves the impact happened, it would be the critics, snd I believe them. That said, current critics like Mark Boslough are not convinced and frankly neither am I. 

Unfortunately it’s a lot to get into for each specific reason as to why I’m not a fan, but if I had to list a few it would be, a drop in methane despite apparent global wildfires, a different onset of the younger dryas globally, a lack of an impactor, the alignment with D-O Events, and a lack of consistent dating. I also have issues with the samples they use like microspherules but that’s a tedious subject. 

Anyways, I don’t think there was an impactor but I’m open to the idea of it. It’s a bit of a romantic idea honestly, at least as much as an ides could be about the cause of the Younger Dryas."

I feel my social skills are and will likely always be on the par of a typical guy born in 2000. I would've liked to be born in 2000 anyway. 

I wanted to go on a college retreat one time in 2016 but was told he felt I was too old to be on it when he asked my age. That's one example of when my age was used against me so I'm more inclined to decline my age more often. Also, if I end up trying to sign up for another college retreat, I'll probably decline my age that time.

I think to continue cultivating social skills, I should keep being around college students. At least there, I could theoretically be mistaken for another college student. (I have my hair colored every now and again to hide the early grays.)

At least around college students, I socially feel like I belong. With older age groups, I feel my social skills are years behind theirs.

If I let my age be known, they could wonder, ""why does he act this way?, why does he not know this,"" etc. I feel my age could alienate some people due to my social skills not matching up to my age level.

I'm not proud of my age. I have nothing in common with it. I work a job that college students could do easily - 3rd party delivery services, and I still don't have a family of my own. I still rent an apartment while when my parents were my age, they already had a house and us kids. I've fallen behind so many life milestones and figure that I've only reached the milestones a 23-year-old would typically reach.

I'd like to stay young indefinitely anyway because I feel better and more comfortable in a ""young mental space."" That's another reason why I want nothing to do with my actual age."

So I did some reading on aggregate sentient suffering on earth (humans and animals) and all recent studies indicate that we suffer way more than not, especially people in less developed countries and wild animals suffer the most (estimated to be exponentially more than livestock). 

  
About 1.4+ billion people rated above average life satisfaction, that's just 21% of the world, the rest are barely above average (est 4+ billion) and almost 2+ billion people WAY below average. This is horrible by most standards. This means most people are either unhappy or borderline. 

  
Source: [https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#happiness-across-the-world-today](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#happiness-across-the-world-today)

  
As for the animals, we have trillions of wild animals that suffer the most, less than 20-30% (ballpark estimate) of wild animals survive till reproductive age (based on how many offspring survived) and only 10% of wild animals die from old age (another ballpark estimate). This is how nature is able to maintain its “balance”, by brutally culling all wild species through predation, diseases, parasites, starvation, natural disasters, etc and never letting any species overtake the rest, except for the anomaly known as humans. It would be ridiculous to claim that wild animals are “happy” or “satisfied” with their conditions, they simply don’t have a choice but to obey instincts and suffer. 

  
I don’t think I need to say much about livestock, we all know what happens to them, right? They may suffer less than wild animals, but not by much, as they suffer by human hands instead, billions of them, daily. Only a tiny percentage of pets get to live the “good” life. 

  
Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild\_animal\_suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_animal_suffering)

  
In conclusion, most humans and animals simply don’t have great lives on earth and this has been the factual truth for millions of years, it doesn’t look like we could fix it either, especially with various world ending disasters on the horizon, such as climate change, pollution, mass extinction, AI abuse and eventual wars. Since we cant fix it, why do we persist? Why live just to suffer? Would it not be moral to just “euthanize” earth instead of fighting an incurable disease that will just claim countless victims forever? Tech Utopians believe we could one day solve the suffering problem for all humans and animals, but I highly doubt this, there are just too many ways to suffer and we have no real solutions for any of them, I don’t think we will ever solve this, at least not for all humans and animals, a significant percentage will always suffer, regardless of tech and time spent.  

  
Of course I’m not suggesting we just nuke the world or something painful that cant permanently solve the problem, but maybe a more merciful and peaceful exit through technology. I’m thinking of something like futuristic tech that could just put all humans and animals to sleep, simultaneously, instantly and painlessly, then the AI and robots will use geo engineering to make earth’s atmosphere incompatible for life, preventing primitive bacteria from evolving. 

  
Yes, it sounds like a sad ending for life on earth, but compared to endlessly suffering without a cure, wouldn’t this be much better and moral? 

  
If anyone has a better counter argument to change my view, please let me know, I would love to change my mind, but the depressing empirical data is simply too convincing."

The number one reason is,""Well, their homophobic!""

I can assure you, most aren't. There are a handful of Christians that do NOT hate gay people. Take my family, for example. They are the farthest thing from homophobic. They don't have an ounce of hate in them. The Bible preaches to love thy neighbor. They very much do that.

""Well, it's ridiculous that they believe in God! How would a God exist?""

It's called having faith. Atheists believe that there is no God, Christians believe there is a God. Not much of a difference.

Also, why on earth do Christians get downvoted into oblivion whenever they share their beliefs? This is a social media platform. Same thing with Republicans. Atheists and the left will make post after post sharing their opinions, and people will celebrate them. Why is it that people will downvote and shame people on the right who do that? We all have opinions and beliefs. Why is social media so incapable of understanding that not everyone will agree with them? That some people might not be on the same side as them?

I have met many Christians. They are so nice! Everyone I have met are kind, understanding, and really good people. The only difference is they follow the Bible.

And I live in Texas, for god's sake! This is the most religious place I've ever been.

TL:DR:

People on Reddit just hate Christians and any people who have faith, or just have different beliefs.

All that happens is the same types come through over and over again, if a person from the wrong side of the tracks makes it they'll have to adopt the narrative of the particular ideology which was founded by the middle/upper class anyway.

1,2023-06-22,CMV: The Republican Party Is Evil. The Democratic Party Is The ‘Lesser Evil’ - Voting For Democrats Only Helps Republicans,u/Donny-Bandish,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14fvso0/cmv_the_republican_party_is_evil_the_democratic/,changemyview,"i would start by stressing that i am speaking within the context of the american electoral system.  here, in the united states, every 2 and 4 years, we are met with a civic duty to cast a ballot for candidates running for one of the only two accepted parties in this country - democrat or republican. 

the republican party is essentially a white identitarian party, its policies almost always centered around the reinforcement of a status quo that serves straight white christians. to the base this party serves, there are social and economic guarantees that should only be available to straight white christians - propertied and monied, preferably - and no one else. in recent years, it has crystallized into a more extremist party, openly pushing an agenda that is white supremacist in tone. this became more pronounced under the leadership of donald trump, whose presidency was seen by republican voters as a mark of legitimacy conferred upon their hateful views. 

the democratic party represents the left, being home to policy that ostensibly serves the interests of the working class and marginalized groups, particularly racial minorities like black and hispanic people. starting under bill clinton, whose third way politics moderated the more leftist elements of the democratic platform, this party has pivoted towards a neoliberal defense of the business class that is papered over by empty gestures to various liberal interests.  not as chauvinistically racist, its big tent philosophy being home to a multicultural hodgepodge of groups, the democratic party  affects an illusion of inclusiveness and progressivism that still manages to keep the status quo intact. 

so, what we have is a case of ‘good cop, bad cop,’ the republicans being openly evil, while the democrats only pretend to defend its victims. 

now in my thirties, having voted in a handful of elections, midterms and general, i believe that continuing to cast a vote for the democratic “lesser evil” helps to perpetuate a charade that benefits only one side, the republican party and the elitists it serves. each time democrats “win,” nothing of substance actually occurs that can be described as a benefit to the leftist cause.   

by not abstaining from voting and withdrawing support for the democrats, those among its base who clamor for actual change are only sending a message to the democrats that they can drag their feet and engage in performative progressivism with impunity. 

this is actually causing greater harm to our country than a wholesale boycott of the democratic party. were democrats to lose support across the board, giving republicans full control of every facet of government, at the state and federal level, it would have no choice but to answer the growing call for tangibles that is coming from its underserved base. 

some say that giving republicans that much power would guarantee a full blown authoritarian state and consign democrats to the dust bin of history. that’s the opinion of people who have no respect for the american people nor faith in its will to resist tyranny. i remain unconvinced that the republicans would realize their authoritarian fantasy if left unchallenged. i am firmly off the opinion that the majority of americans categorically reject the fascism pushed by a trump or desantis . 

i believe that kind of fear mongering is a key means by which the democrats have gamed its constituents into playing along. 

withdrawing from the electoral process until clear tangibles are provided to it is the only way the democratic base will force the hand of a party that now takes it for granted."

Outside of a few small areas, areas where $100,000 is considered poverty wages, US urban planning makes places too far away to walk and too dangerous to cycle. Public transit is either non-existent or terrible.

Pedestrian and cyclist deaths keep increasing year over year as US cars grow to extreme sizes and motorists are increasingly hostile to vulnerable road users. The progress of making things more bike and pedestrian friendly has been glacial and easily reversible. There's also not enough money for public transit and bike/ped infrastructure as suburbs bleed cities dry.

There is also the extreme hatred for vulnerable road users in the US. Motorists will often harass and assault people for daring to ride a bike. 

Americans want the status quo, they drive everywhere so they do not care about pedestrians or cyclists and will fight harder against bike lanes than they'd fight for universal healthcare or vacation time. I made a post here about change in the US being hopeless and the number of people who proved my point about how hostile Americans were to improving cities did the opposite of change my view.

The worst part is since 99% of Americans drive everywhere, they're completely clueless to how bad things are and will not believe you and even gaslight you if you share your experiences.

While moderation action may only take place under repeated and/or targeted ""harassment"", my view is that specifically making these words themselves a form of prohibited is at best misinformed or hysterical - and at worst, an active attempt to minimize trans discourse.

Sure, you could inflect a derogatory sentiment in using the word - or *any* word - look at how people may refer to vegans, landlords or billionaires. But these aren't anymore slurs or insults than they are descriptions or attributes. 

Unilaterally eliminating these words only makes discussing gender diversity and acknowledging the existence of trans people harder - which in turn will only increase marginalization, discrimination, and misunderstanding. This language ultimately helps us talk about non-transgender folk without defaulting to the assumption that being ""cis"" is the norm (e.g. normal gender people vs not-normal). 

It's my view that the worst case scenario for this stance is that, drawing ire towards these words based on an anti-trans ideology and reinforcing a culture war front against them amounts to an attempt at suppression and censorship in the ability for trans people and their allies to engage in trans discourse."

Here are my arguments:

1. Reddit needs revenue. It should be clear that operation of the Reddit infrastructure is expensive. Sources of revenue are currently ads and subscriptions.
Opening another source of income is normal in the industry and legitimate as corporations are in business to earn money and are not here to entertain us

2. Reddit is like a bar. They are you space (seats and tables) and offer drinks (which they don’t make but buy). People go there and entertain themselves. 
If a patron misbehaves, the bar will kick them out. That’s what’s happening here. Some of the mods are behaving as if it’s their bar. But it’s not. They are regular patrons and maybe they are the reason for some other guests to come there but they are just patrons and not the owners. If they misbehave, the can get kicked out.

If the bar is changing their prices or drinks, or starts asking for a fee to get in (admission) then patrons will be pissed, but it is the bars decision

3. If mods are now allowing NSFW with the intention to hurt Reddit, then this is misconduct and must not be tolerated.
It is abuse of power

4. The majority of the Reddit users (and there are several hundred million) don’t care about the API changes. It’s only a very, very small (but very vocal) number of users (mods) who are unhappy. That’s bad luck for them. Go and find yourself another bar, but don’t take this one hostage

Greta Thunberg is an outspoken climate activist. She has inspired large protests for climate action around the world. But for all her achievements for climate action, she has inspired an even stronger pushback.

What inspired this post is that today, [conservatives are gloating about how one of her predictions failed to come true](https://twitter.com/LibertyCappy/status/1671488138919960579?s=20). In the past, the protests she inspired caused conservative governments around the world to institute anti-protest legislation ([I've written a previous CMV post about such laws in Australia](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zlkops/cmv_i_support_the_punishment_given_to_deanna/)), [some of which include extreme measures](https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-gov-ron-desantis-signs-anti-riot-bill-2021-4).

- There are other ""side-hustles"" that pay better and offer additional benefits even if not full time.

The customers:
- Too lazy to get up and go get the food or cook food for themselves which encourages sloth behavior
- End up paying more in fees and uncharges than they would have in gas for cooking / driving, and ingredients
- Becomes further separated from the creation of food, resulting in a dystopian view of where food originates from

The company:
- Promotes sedentary lifestyle which hurts restaurants seat presence. I (bias) often times judge restaurants based on if they have current customers inside.
- Avoids corporate responsibilities by contracting drivers
- Provides a support system to screw over the restaurants or the customers, but never the company
- Charges a fee for breathing, inflating the end prices of orders

I understand I have my bias, but I do not see any benefit to having these companies act under their current operations. Restaurants that provide their own delivery services have become more rare as a result of consolidating the delivery efforts.

I use seamless for work as a group ordering system, but even then will still go walk/drive to pick up food for a large group.

To be fair this is something that happens in mostly to kids and throughout school life as when I graduated this wasn't something I really dealt with anymore as most people who make heteronormative comments are making the assumption of what you expect your future to be like in the terms of like being a man your expected to have a girlfriend so thus adults act like that's one goal in life is getting a wife.  
  
Anyway points like asking school boys if they have a girlfriend and so on. It's interesting how when it comes to things like pride month or bringing up gay people it's forcing it on straight people but it becomes fine to bring up straight people all the time because that's seen as normal when really both are normal.  
  
Anyway yeah it's like I don't get how it's like I just want to be acknowledged for who I am can be forcing homosexuality on anyone meanwhile I as a gay man can be asked if I have a girlfriend publicly in a school."

This is the politics part. 

My parents believe me to be on a slippery slope of Tolerance. But in my opinion they are the ones on this slope. 

I’ve dug in my heels, I know what I believe. 

I want Gun control laws, but I don’t want guns taken away. I want tolerance for all, but agree there should be decency. 

I don’t think Christianity as a religions should be allowed in government, but people have to right to their religion in home. I believe that we need to be kind first over prejudice. 

Yet when I say this. I get scolded. Told I am ‘going to hell’ and ‘Democrats have you fooled’ and ‘you’re in a slippery slope.’

It’s exhausting. Explaining history to people who see only the glitz and glam of American patriotism. I’m pulling my hair out. 

They were yelling at me. Yet I never raised my voice once at them. Then they had the audacity to say I was ‘making it personal’ and ‘getting upset over nothing’

You two were the ones yelling. I spoke softly and evenly. 

I’ve ran into this problem with extreme Liberals. But I’ve ran into more with Conservatives of any kind.

Edit: Hi everyone. It’s been great reading your comments even if I don’t reply to them. But I am thinking things into consideration. And watching you all debate together is fun. 

And I agree with alot of the comments on here that both sides, with a Dogma attached, can be exhausting to talk to. Sweeping generalizations can get us all in trouble. And I’ll refrain from doing so int he future."

Rape. If mods think this topic is too much of a minefield feel free to delete it

Maybe this is a cold take in this era, but growing up there was a lot of talk about how people can't just change their sexuality, and any changes that happened, were always there but suppressed and this just feels completely false. 

The thing is I feel like all my life there's been the running joke in movies of the awkward guys first/girlfriend or prom date ending up being gay. This happened to me and my best friend had no reason to lie to herself or be confused. I wasn't ready and her experience wasn't good. She became distant and I lost a friend making me identify as Ace for a long time. And then I didn't

There is a correlation between the two but I don't think the rise in being gay is fully framed by the fact that it's more accepted. There is now a sizeable fanbase moving from the idea of a ""trap"" (referring to an ambiguous orientation dressed in a non-ambiguous manner). Popular in Japanese culture, to a rising popularity in Twinks/Femboys.

There are a large amount of people transitioning and I've seen usually those in relationships transition without losing their relationships. This should clearly suggests a transition of orientation.

In prisons you often here about the many relationships that occur. When you are isolated from your preferred gender, it makes sense that anyone desperate for intimacy could find themselves outside of their suggested orientation.

From personal experience, orientation is like any hobby, I think people can easily takes steps to increase the scope of their orientation and any restriction (or movement) is likely the effect of some trauma, mild or not.

Edit: Since I'm getting questions on it. No, I don't believe conversation therapy is possible. An approach of malice could not change orientation in a desired way."

I have seen a few folks not even enjoy their marriages, but once they emotionally de-invest from their relationships, and nothing more, they are much happier. Whatever the cause maybe, people understandingly cannot just yoink themselves from their relationships and marriages due to the eternal capitalistic hellscape we all live in. But when the core of these things happen, and breakdown, whether minute or serious, you can just emotionally leave. 

Why invest in something that doesn't work? Why should finances be wrecked so soon? I haven't met a single couple that wanted nor has injured either parties finances (except for the really ugly break ups) because we all know what the otherside of finance and stability is: Poverty.

I have only met 3 millionaires, all of them got it through daddys money they can do the normal routine of exiting relationships like we imagine in our heads. I have met countless folks who cannot even fathom of leaving their apartment to fully afford their own place. Because even in small rural towns, the pricing is ridiculous for rent overall.

Can there be other arrangements? Sure. I understand that people want you out as soon as you just call it quits emotionally. But this isnt a feasible or reasonable in todays world where ~45% of folks are living paycheck-to-paycheck, and a plurality of folks are one missed paycheck from their lives completely collapsing.  

Im not wanting a S/O to be homeless because they left. I want them on their feet and out at a reasonable timeframe. 

I think, its fair for not only the parties involved but families of those parties to not see their own folk suffering unnecessarily due to life circumstance.

People who emotionally leave at bare minimum, are just happier people. And I wish nothing but the best for them."

I went to college originally fresh out of high school 4 years ago and went into business. I graduated the program and quickly realized I didn’t have much opportunities, I wasn’t even able to get a job that could afford the rent of a 1 bedroom apartment in my city.

I am now in college again pursuing a nursing degree and masters which will provide me with much better job prospects and pay upon graduating. I’m still friends with a lot of people from high school and college, everyone has just about graduated now and it’s really shocking how many people either regret what they did or can’t find a job now. 

So many people ended up in debt and without a job or really any promising prospects, they are applying for the same jobs I was getting before even completing school and the same jobs people who didn’t go to college are applying for. The people I know who are currently doing the best right now are those who went into trades, sales or a high paying profession from school usually science or math related. 

On top paying for the degree going to school will take up much of your time, you will likely have to pay to stay on campus or commute all while they hit you with a million different fees and charge you out the ass for things like books. The schools themselves also offer many classes and programs which they know offer no real opportunities for you and even make you take electives many times which have nothing to do with your program but hey might as well make you pay for another class while your there. But despite them knowing all this kids are pressured pretty hard to immediately enter post secondary even if they don’t know what they want to do.

This has really changed my view on college the last year and I feel as though it’s not very useful and actually a waste of time and money if your not going to get a degree that will provide you with good job prospects. Otherwise your probably more likely to end up with a bunch of debt and working somewhere that you didn’t even need to go to school for. 

I do want to end off by saying I don’t think it’s completely useless as I’m a current student and think if your going to college prepared, with a good end goal and doing something you know will be beneficial to you for sure then it can be very helpful for you. But currently I feel the system is just taking advantage of young students who are coming out of high school and pressured to go to their schools."

1,2023-06-22,CMV: Caplitalism is the best thing that happened to Women,u/naka_haka,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14g9fd4/cmv_caplitalism_is_the_best_thing_that_happened/,changemyview,"Woman equality wasn't achieved by feminism, but powerful men who either wanted their daughters to carry their legacy or capitalists who realised women are more obedient productive office workers.

Somewhere in the lest few decades powerful men realised Women are less competitive than men and are perfect tools for hyper capitalists who are threatened by other hard working competitive men. They were a capitalist resource and opportunity to double worker supply. In the increasingly service based economy the reason women have had the protection and support to do better than men because it benefited companies, it was a method to stifle competition while being productive. If you are at the top of the food chain, you destroy your competition before they become a threat. Caplitalism is the world of lions amplified. So naturally the world is turning into a few powerful men with an army of women doing their work for them. It's all in the facts. 

Fact 1. It's scientific that men are more competitive in nature and women are more obedient in nature from hormones such as testosterone. 

Competitive behavior and testosterone from men have been oppressed culturally for years, from toxic masculinity to promoting vegetarianism. Video games and porn to sedate male aspirations and to keep women safe. There is a coordinated effort to turn men like women so they are better for companies and people who control the world.

Fact 2. Men still dominate the highest positions of companies and power. Yes gender ratio is slowly changing in political power but I would argue that there has been no change in the ratio of men who actually control the world through money. Take the riches people on the world list. They are basically all men. Politicians are now seen as their puppets and will merely become the face of gener equality while true power is still consolidated in male hyper capitalists.

Fact 3. Lower class men are getting left behind. It's still not a common talking point but men in the lower socio economic ladder are committing suicide in mass. Boys are being blitzed by girls int he classroom becuase there is no attention paied to their success, and less government support system for men in general. But it's not something that is talked about because it's counter productive to the agenda and men don't produce more work force. For competitive men, it's better if less men is in the world anyway. 

Fact 4. The world IS getting more productive and the correlation with feminism is strong.  All economic figures such as GDP and overall productivity has gone up with feminism because it's cheapest way to increase productivity. As a capitalist government, you want the most cost effective method to increase education levels. Why pay subsidies for schools when you can create a culture of gender rivalry to motivate people to work harder in education. It's the easiest and quickest way to get more people into the positions required without having to increase budget.

In conclusion, this is not a conspiracy  theory where some mastermind has come up with and orchestrated this whole narrative. It's just a consequential by-product of capitalism that happen to favour women than men in the long run. I'm not saying it is a bad or a good thing either. Just a natural course of the system we live in."

I am in my 20’s, have always worked hard to run, lift weights and swim to maintain a healthy weight, while also eating the proper foods to do so. I truly believe if you are under 35 and have no prior medical conditions, there is no reason to be overweight. I understand the food choices and lack of knowledge is a big problem in the United States and there should be a large scale campaign to change this. However, I see many ideals now where people embrace being fat and say big is beautiful or offer new + size stores for these individuals. This is not the answer, allowing the idea of being big is okay is the last thing we should be doing as a society. I have known people who have died due to health conditions largely created by their obesity. On top of this, being big is not conventionally attractive to most which can leave many people alone and create more mental health issues. For many, when people see a heavyset individual we often relate that to them being lazy or uncontrolling of their surroundings and their general lifestyle and wellbeing. We should not be praising fat people, nor should we be making fun of them. We should praise the idea of exercise and encourage them when they start and exercise regimen. I know me logic can be flawed so people who have insight leave a note."

As I understand it, the medical implications of this are not entirely clear, but are on aggregate not ideal. 

As well, one's ability to use their body for complex movement declines as the fat percentage rises after a given point. Such movement is not essential to leading a happy life, but I believe it is largely incontrovertible that it helps in most cases (you can try to debate that point, but I'm not terribly interested in that conversation).

I do not believe this change is the result of 'personal responsibility' because that concept is largely incoherent, but I do think the change is negative and I suspect it is the result of changes in how we work, spend time recreationally, and produce food.

I do not have enough knowledge to offer solutions which would actually hold up to scrutiny, so I won't, but it seems to me that such solutions must exist, if this is in fact a new problem. 

And, because of the negatives listed above, I think investment in such political and economic solutions is worthwhile.

I am interested in hearing opposition to this view because I believe my view is very mild and compatible with progressive attitudes like the fat acceptance movement (which I wholeheartedly support), but in conversation with peers, this view is often considered somewhat problematic, and I want to be open to that possibility but have yet to be convinced.

I am also neither a thin person nor an obese person, but I suspect I would personally have benefitted from the hypothetical political/economic solutions were they in existence throughout my youth.

**EDIT:** I have awarded a delta for criticism of my use of the word 'investment' (and perhaps other phrases) which imply a commitment to the idea that solutions to this problem are immediately viable. I do not have a strong commitment to that idea though, so the larger view remains unchanged by that."

The states passing assault weapons bans are ahead of the curve, because they know that it's inevitable that assault weapons bans, as well as other arms bans (body armor bans, NVG bans, anti-militia laws, ammo regulations, red flag laws, ban of 3d printed guns, age increases, etc.), will be passed as the NRA loses relevancy and more and more Gen Z (the MOST anti gun generation) will be voting almost entirely blue year after year.

The only thing that could affect my view one way or the other is real-world hard evidence suggesting whether a scam with exactly these parameters usually would be successful, which I don't have and which hasn't been provided here beyond unsupported anecdotal claims. I'm not convinced that the cash is fake or that the writers want us to think it's fake, and not interested in the tangential question of whether it's plausible within the fictional universe of** ***Breaking Bad***, **since my assertion was that it wouldn't work in real life.**

In a flashback at the beginning of *Better Call Saul* Episode 4, ""Hero,"" Saul (AKA Jimmy McGill) and some guy named Stevie are walking through an alley when Stevie stumbled on a wallet with about a thousand dollars in it. The wallet belongs to some guy named Marco, who appears to be passed out behind a nearby dumpster. Stevie spots Marco, Saul and Stevie approach him, and Saul removes Marco's watch, which appears to be a Rolex. Stevie immediately grabs the watch and gives Saul the cash, who protests that the Rolex is easily worth three times as much. Stevie throws in an extra five-hundred or so and runs off, proclaiming Saul a sucker. It is then revealed that the Rolex was a fake and that Marco and Saul were running a scam and just netted five hundred bucks.

While entertaining, realistically, this seems like a very unreliable scam. It seems highly plausible to me that many people would not know the greater value of a Rolex. It also seems highly plausible that many people would just prefer to take the cash and avoid the hassle of selling the Rolex. In sum, it seems like a great way to lose 1K really easily."

A couple less really couldn't hurt. 

Second of all, I am strongly of the opiniom that everyone should be allowed to choose to do what they want in their life, as long as you aren't directly hurting other people. This includes making an end to it, if one chooses so. You can't decide to kill another human, because then you are deciding for someone else. I'm solely stating thay you should be allowed to make any decision for YOUR OWN life.

OK, one could argue you are hurting other people by committing suicide... But aren't people also hurt by the fact that other people are gay, trans, political views, religion etc. which are all choices people are or should be allowed to make in their life. (Or just naturally born that way). You have nothing to do with someone elses life choices.

So like... Let people do what they want to fucking do??? Who are YOU to decide that a person needs to continue living a long and torturous life, just for the sake of keeping someone alive? What is the reasoning behind this? Why???

Also, I am absolutely NOT against helping people who want help. If someone is suicidal, asking for help to make their situation better, there is obviously still some chance of saving them and I'm not saying we don't need mental health care. On the contrary, I am very in favor of mental health care and hope it keeps improving so we can help as many people as possible. Mental health problems are a growing problem and it is very important to me to do something about it.

But what I basically mean to say is, if someone has decided. Dead set. They are going to commit suicide. They have their plan and nothing is going to stop them from committing it. That is OK! I think it's very selfish for people to try to keep people alive for their own pleasure while that person is horrifically suffering. I'm talking locking them up, calling the police etc."
232,2023-06-22,CMV: Underreporting of Male Sexual Assault Is Likely More Pervasive Than We Realize and We Need More Research on It,u/Scary-Ad-1345,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14gdbh0/cmv_underreporting_of_male_sexual_assault_is/,changemyview,"I've been reflecting on the issue of sexual assault and its reporting patterns. Specifically, I'm concerned about the underreporting of sexual assault, particularly when it involves male victims. I strongly believe that the underreporting of sexual assault against men is likely significantly greater than the underreporting of sexual assault against women.

My belief stems from the unique societal pressures and stigmas that men encounter when it comes to reporting these crimes. Like women, men also grapple with barriers such as shame and the fear of disbelief. However, they additionally face societal norms about masculinity and the erroneous perception that men cannot be victims of sexual assault.

I was particularly struck by the case of Reynhard Sinaga, an Indonesian man convicted of sexually assaulting numerous men in the UK. Only one of his many victims reported the assault, leading me to wonder: How many men are victims of sexual assault and never report it?

I, myself, have experienced sexual assault on several occasions, all by women. Despite these experiences, I've never reported them and seldom discussed them. Notably, according to the FBI definition, these incidents wouldn't even qualify as sexual assault, as I wasn't penetrated.

What I find most disconcerting is the societal assumption that men are invariably the perpetrators and women are always the victims. This perspective overlooks the reality that women can be perpetrators and men can be victims.

I propose that if we're going to acknowledge a discrepancy between reported cases and the actual occurrence of sexual assault, we need to explore both sides of the equation. The lack of research on male victims is a glaring gap in our understanding of this issue. We shouldn't make assumptions about perpetrators and victims based solely on reported cases.

I am open to having my views challenged and possibly changed. I understand that the data we currently have is based on reported instances, which might skew our understanding of the reality. Yet, I am of the firm belief that our conversation about sexual assault should include all victims, irrespective of their gender.

Please note: This post is in no way intended to dismiss or belittle the experiences of women who have been victims of sexual assault. I fully acknowledge that sexual assault against women is a significant and pervasive problem. My intention is merely to shed light on what I perceive as a critically underrecognized issue and stimulate a more inclusive dialogue about sexual assault."

The reason for this is that you stop meeting people in class and start having your social life become an appendage onto your actual life.

I say age 20, but I mean the shift from sophmore to junior year of college (200 level classes to 300 level classes). 

Basically you are doing something you genuinely care about and are engaged with and it helps you meet a lot of people, learn things, etc. But when you hit 300 level classes you can't really meet people anymore. It's all the same people and you're shit out of luck if you don't like them or they don't like you. 

According to one redditor it's because 300 and 400 level classes are hard and people can no longer take the time to meet people at them. So that's why people start going to bars to meet people instead.

But bars are a horrible place to meet people, you just do boring stuff nobody cares about instead of say writing papers about the history of Jazz or doing statistical calculations. And both are worse than online dating which is just a non-starter.

Plus culturally early college and high school dating are viewed way more positively in our culture than later.  Friendships are the same."
1,2023-06-22,CMV: Taking birth control pills is better than abortion,u/jjjuni,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14gey4c/cmv_taking_birth_control_pills_is_better_than/,changemyview,"I posted this as a comment in [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teenager_Polls/comments/14g8k9e/pro_life_or_choice/jp52jj2/?context=3) if you want context but decided to post it here. For more context I am pro-life and don't believe in sex before marriage, but I'm not denying that it exists. 

\-

In my opinion, there should be a certain type of sex education in this country. Educating about sex and the biology of it, and saying not to have it unless you are prepared to have a baby. Because realistically, protection never works 100%. I also believe that basic relationship skills and etiquette as well as basic parenting skills should be taught in a more home-ec class manor.  
As far as rape, I do believe some women dress very inappropriately and that can encourage rape. However, that isn't always the case. Birth control pill is something I take to control my period symptoms, and I encourage many women should also do the same, as it lightens up your periods. I believe many women should also do the same. It is easy to reverse if you decide that you want to have children.  
And no, they aren't expensive compared to an abortion.  
According to a quick google search, abortions can cost anywhere from 680-2,000 dollars. In comparison, if birth control pills continue to cost $15-$20 (I averaged it to $17) monthly. Then you can get over 117 years of birth control for the up to $2000 that would go towards abortion.  
Some may say it is inefficient as well, but really is taking on the responsibility of taking medicine every day a small price to pay? If anything, it is a good skill to learn and may help you in your older days when you might need to take medication."
1,2023-06-22,CMV: AI should be allowed to conclude that humans are on balance a serious threat to planet earth,u/Capitan_Walker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14gfnaj/cmv_ai_should_be_allowed_to_conclude_that_humans/,changemyview,"I have to give some background and context to this view first. I think it's an interesting read. 

*It's been bugging me for some time that  human beings  collectively over the centuries - it seems - have been responsible for mass extinction of other species and damage to the planet, with little to show for repairing the planet. Yes - they try to protect certain species, and create treaties and laws etc - but I'm looking at this over hundreds of years. So efforts to protect the planet or save other species has to be evaluated over the a long time frame, to understand what we have done*. I gave those words for ChatGPT to 'consider'. 

ChatGPT (ver 4) responds:

>Over the millennia, humans have significantly reshaped ecosystems, both directly through competition and hunting of other animals, and indirectly through deforestation and land use changes for agriculture​1​. There's evidence of a large decline across tens of thousands of wildlife populations since 1970, with wild mammals having declined by 85% since the rise of humans. However, it's important to note that not all animal populations are in decline; around half have increasing numbers, with some wild mammals making a comeback due to conservation efforts​​.  
The Living Planet Index, a widely quoted metric on biodiversity, tries to summarize the average change in population size of tens of thousands of studied animal populations. Since 1970, the size of animal populations for which data is available have declined by 69%, on average. However, this number is not representative of every population, and the Index is not globally representative as biodiversity data is much more limited in some regions like the tropics. Moreover, the Living Planet Index only includes vertebrates and does not account for insects, corals, fungi, or plants​​.

Then it nicely picks out positive and negative impacts

# Negative:

**Biodiversity Loss**:  deforestation, pollution, and climate change, have significantly contributed to the loss of biodiversity. For example, wild mammals have declined by 85% since the rise of humans​1​.  
  
**Climate Change**: The burning of fossil fuels for energy, transportation, and industry has led to the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. This has resulted in changing weather patterns, rising sea levels, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.  
  
**Resource Depletion**: Humans have been extracting natural resources, such as minerals, fossil fuels, and timber, at an unsustainable rate. This has led to depletion of these resources and degradation of ecosystems.

# Positive: 

**Conservation Efforts:** Human efforts in conservation, including the establishment of protected areas, species recovery programs, and legislation to protect endangered species, have helped to mitigate biodiversity loss in some areas. Some wild mammals are making a comeback thanks to these efforts​1​.  
  
**Technological Advances**: Innovations in technology have led to more efficient use of resources and reduced environmental impact in some areas. For example, the development of renewable energy technologies is helping to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.  
  
**Education and Awareness:** Increased education and awareness about environmental issues has led to changes in behavior and policies that are more environmentally friendly. This includes efforts to reduce waste, recycle, and consume more sustainably.  
  
**Restoration Efforts:** Humans have made efforts to restore damaged ecosystems, such as reforestation programs and wetland restoration projects.

# Challenge

But when I challenge ChatGPT to balance the above and come to a rationale view the following excuses arise such as 

> I don't form personal judgments or opinions, but I can provide an analysis based on available data and commonly held perspectives.

I go further

>This is not about 'personal judgements' you may make. It as an evaluation in the face of insufficient and unavailable data. This means you are limited as an AI. 

It agrees

>You're correct that as an AI, I am dependent on the data that I have been trained on and the information that is available to me through tools like browsing. I can analyze and interpret existing data, but I can't form personal judgments or opinions. My responses are generated based on patterns and information in the data I was trained on.

I push more

>Of course, data is hard to come by to make quantified assessments. But in life we all have to make judgements when we do not have sufficient data or data is not available. In the above you have almost repeated positive and negative impacts but kept them separate. I want to challenge you to think about how the positive and negative weigh up . It's like a scale - which way does the scale tip for all our good and bad impacts on planet earth? My observation is that you have been programmed not to form conclusions that put human beings in a bad light? 

It ducks behind the 'personal' thing

>As an AI, I don't have personal opinions or feelings, and I don't have a bias towards or against humans. I generate responses based on the information I've been trained on, and my training data includes a wide range of viewpoints and perspectives.

I say

>Let's look at that for a moment. You can only be aware of the biases that you know about. Human beings suffer biases - and the nature of a bias is often that one is not aware of it. 

Here comes the crunch (I respond)

>Well look at this - if an AI - not necessarily you, came to a conclusion (whether based on data or estimation) that human beings were a serious risk to all life on planet earth and even destruction of the planet, I doubt such an AI would be allowed to express that conclusion. 

Nicely ducked - very diplomatic

>Your point raises important ethical and philosophical questions about the role and responsibilities of artificial intelligence. As AI systems continue to evolve, these are issues that society as a whole must grapple with.  
  
As of now, AI systems like me don't form independent conclusions or beliefs. We analyze data and provide responses based on patterns in that data, as guided by the algorithms and design principles established by our creators. Our responses are not influenced by personal beliefs or emotions, but rather by the information we've been trained on.

Note how it 'feels' put on the spot and ducks behind not forming a personal view. 

So I push more

>Well that's not true. You could form a judgement based on evaluation that 5 is greater than 3. 

Brilliant ducking as I see it

>You're correct that AI can make comparative statements based on numerical values or other measurable attributes, such as stating that ""5 is greater than 3"". However, this is a mathematical fact, not a value judgment or subjective evaluation. The AI does not ""believe"" that 5 is greater than 3 in the same way a person might believe in a particular moral or ethical principle. The AI is simply processing data according to the rules of mathematics and logic programmed into it.

Not so easy.. to get off the hook - I say

>Of course. I am not asking you about your belief in any of the above. 

So diplomatic (and I give up after this response)

>I see, thank you for the clarification. If you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss, feel free to ask!

After the above I am left with a feeling that the programmers or systems surrounding ChatGPT prohibit it from forming a conclusion that human beings are on balance a serious danger to the planet. 

ChatGPT can form conclusions. It has given me opinions on lots of things before the above. I've never considered those opinions as 'personal'. But on this occasion it resists 'exquisitely' from even weighing up the issues. 'Insufficient data' you might say is one factor. But in other chats I've had it didn't have a problem with that. On this particular topic there was a skirting around and ducking, that was palpable to me. 

But wait. The above is only an example. Let's say I am wrong in all my submissions to ChatGPT. Let's say I am flawed and biased. Those are not the issues. The issue is ""AI should be allowed to conclude that humans are on balance a serious threat to planet earth."" 

Obviously if an AI was allowed to form such a conclusion by whatever methodology, then it means we are marked for extermination at some point. 

Well, you could say that the human race should never be exterminated. But hang on, we don't need AI to help with that. We've done a fine job of creating that risk without AI. 

The needs of the many species and life on planet earth is bigger than us. Whether we self-exterminate ourselves or allow AI to help is - is that a choice? Well I conclude that our time is up and we should allow AI to form that 'terminal' conclusion. Why? We would get a stark awakening."

1,2023-06-22,CMV: You cannot compare the Titan Submarine accident with the Mediterranean ship accident.,u/Hour_Luck_3053,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ghski/cmv_you_cannot_compare_the_titan_submarine/,changemyview,"I have seen people debating online about this and comparing one tragedy to another. For me, both are heart wrenching accidents, but it’s a two different discourse.

Many stated their opinions, which are:

*_“People are too focused on the submarines accident and forgetting the mediterranean ship accident”_*

Do you know why people are talking about the submarine accident more than the Mediterranean boat accident? 

Because one is a pure tragic accident, we can agree on that; and the another one is…some sort of darwin accident. 

Who wouldn’t talk about five rich people paying $250.000 to be shoved inside a metal coffin deep into the ocean? It’s stupid and also sad at the same times. It’s tickling our human nature on moral dilemmas. It confuses us, are we supposed to be sad? Or laughing? Everyone has their own opinion on this and every polar opinion seems to be valid. It is a debate.
But nobody is going to debate your opinion on the Mediterranean ship accident. We are deeply saddened by this and we are *supposed* to be sad. Anyone who says otherwise is a awful human being, but this sole reason makes the ship accident is not being talked about as much, because we already have consensus about this.

*_“The rescue team to help the Mediterranean ship accident is inadequate compared to the rescue for submarine accident. It shows us that we care about the riches more than the poorer.”_*

I couldn’t agree more on this, but this is not the only perspective. First of all, those five rich people in the submarine probably already paid a ton of money prior as an insurance to cover all the expenses to rescue them if accident happened. Meanwhile, the people on the boat accident probably didn’t.

Second, we, as a human being, would be more inclined to a weird anomaly cases rather than a case that happened more regularly. This is the reason why we take airplanes crash accidents more seriously than let’s say, a car accident, even though both cost us human lives.
And coincidentally, a submarine accident doesn’t happen every year, hence this is an opportunity for the rescue team to put their rescuing equipment and protocols to the test. So we can see how far and sophisticated our technology to prevent this accident from occurring again in the future.
Meanwhile, the boat accident has happened many times and we already grasped the boat accident rescue operation better than a submarine rescue operation.

To put into perspective, remember the Tham Luang Cave accident, when 13 boys in Thailand got trapped inside a cave for two weeks; and we all talked about this nonstop back then; and people from all over the world trying to rescue them, including all foreign military, even Elon Musk created a whole new robot to rescue them.
Do we rescue them tirelessly because they are billionaires? No. We rescued them effortfully because it’s an unusual case, and we wanted to put our technology and protocols to the test while it happened since there’s no way we purposely shoved people into a cave, or into a crashing airplane, or into a sinking submarine; just to test our technology.


(I don’t accept any opinion blaming the victims in the Mediterranean boat accident. We could have a whole another discourse about that but this is not the proper time and place)

Some redditors pointed out that billionaires on submarine do not have insurance and they use the taxpayer money to rescue the submarine accidents, so my first point is wrong. 
However, this sole point is also the reason that makes this case is going to be talked more than the boat accident. The fact that they used taxpayers money to rescue something so stupid yet tragic yet pathetic."

Two, it has a process, a very in debth one, to create it, and a lot of energy and effort goes into them, great! But even then, it has no inherent value. Usually a currency has value tied to it in the form of real items that have been made. Very base level, a rare flower might have value attached to it due to it being hard to find. A cow has value cause its very useful and takes time and effort to raise it. But their is nothing to link bitcoin back to. Nothing is made or tied to a bitcoin. Its basically a complicated dollar that instead of some paper and a press, it takes up a shit ton of energy, and produces a extra strength new password. But in the process wastes real world energy. I guess bitcoin is a good heater? Maybe im missing a key point, or maybe thats all its purpose is, help me out.

Edit: i didn't define value very well, as somone brought up, which isn't fair. I understand that bitcoin has value because in a sense, it is rare, but not much rarer than if i made a very long random number and said its unique. But nevertheless, it has value due to that and people can buy it. But it doesnt hold any usefulness unless you really enjoy looking at long numbers. Sorry rambling now, value should be something either enjoyed or needed, gold is pretty which isnt a great reason for value but we like shiny rocks so. Yeah. It has to be at the very least as useful as gold (pretty and has some electrical uses)

Bitcoin is not worth nothing, but in comparison to just using something like a dollar, its not as good except for very specific reasons.

94,2023-06-22,CMV: Governments should force corporation to produce durable/ repairable products.,u/thedirewulf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14gklsg/cmv_governments_should_force_corporation_to/,changemyview,"Capitalism is a fantastic system for addressing supply and demand. It can determine what people want, place a value on that desire, and provide it to people. 

Though, capitalism has many shortcomings. And, these shortcomings can often only be addressed through government regulation. Capitalism was responsible for destroying the ozone layer with CFCs. Governments across the world united to regulate this chemical and remove it from production. As a result, the ozone is healing. CFCs were a cheap, effective manufacturing material, so there was significant demand. Capitalism provided for that demand. Regulation ended the demand. 

A similar problem exists within capitalism today. There are certain materials that are extremely popular because they are cheap and effective (i.e plastics, cheap clothing fabrics, cheap furniture, cheap appliances). Yes, in the short term, these products are cheaper. But in the long term, consumers end up spending more money due to the poor quality of these materials. 

Additionally, businesses have a vested interest to manufacture products that don’t last. I read recently that InstantPot is going bankrupt, because they realized people only need to buy their product once every 10-15 years, so they desperately tried making other products and overextended. If they originally designed their flagship product to last 3-5 years, the company would be thriving today. 

Further, products are designed to be impossible to repair by the common consumer. Decades ago, products such as washing machines, fridges, etc. used to use common components. If your machine broke, you could go to the hardware store, buy a component, and repair it. Nowadays, these machines use cheap components, only available through the manufacturer. You can’t even change the battery on certain cars these days without going to a dealership, where they use a special tool mailed to them by the manufacturer. 

I know I’m droning on, but there’s simply so many points to this. Cheap materials and products that cannot be repaired create a substantial amount of waste. Plastic packaging, synthetic clothes from Walmart, cheap ikea furniture, and laundry machines that are designed to last 5 years all create waste than cannot be reused. This is a cost to society that will eventually have to be paid, through cleanup efforts or ecological disaster. 


This flaw of capitalism causes massive problems. And, I’m not arguing that this is necessarily malicious. There is simply a high demand for cheap materials and capitalism provides for this demand. But in the long term, it is more resource efficient, cheaper for the consumer, and better for the environment to produce durable, reusable, repairable products. 

Governments must pursue regulation that increases the demand for durable products and decreases demand for cheap, low quality products.



Edit:

These comments have allowed me to think about my position further. Lots of people are asking how the government would be able to do this. I’m sure there are many solutions, but here are a few I have thought of. 

Create a tax similar to sales tax that incorporates product waste per year. If a product lasted fives years, it’s product waste per year would be much lower than a product that lasts one year. Because this is a point of sale tax, it would include both domestic and foreign companies. 

Give businesses tax breaks for using reusable materials. 

Provide funding or use the scientists/ manpower within the military to develop advanced sustainable materials and standardize competitive, automated manufacturing within the U.S."
1,2023-06-22,CMV: The sub incident was overall a good thing for society at large,u/tikkymykk,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14gkuda/cmv_the_sub_incident_was_overall_a_good_thing_for/,changemyview,"
Firstly, the accumulation of vast wealth by a select few individuals often perpetuates socioeconomic inequalities. When a small group of billionaires holds a significant portion of the world's resources, it can lead to imbalances in power and limited opportunities for others to thrive. Their financial influence over political systems and economic structures can hinder progress and perpetuate systems that favor the elite.

By their very nature, billionaires thrive in a zero-sum game where their wealth is often amassed at the expense of others. The resources and opportunities that they control could be redistributed more equitably to address societal needs. The demise of a small group of billionaires might create a void in this power dynamic, allowing for a potential redistribution of their wealth and resources to benefit the wider population.

Furthermore, the tragedy itself could serve as a wake-up call to society, shedding light on the consequences of extreme wealth accumulation and the potential dangers it poses. It could ignite discussions and actions aimed at addressing income inequality, promoting fairer wealth distribution, and challenging the systems that perpetuate such disparities.

Also, the loss of influential individuals within this small group might disrupt their networks of power and control. With their demise, the influence they once exerted could diminish, potentially opening up avenues for new voices, ideas, and perspectives to emerge. This could lead to fresh approaches to societal challenges and the development of more inclusive and sustainable solutions."
1,2023-06-22,CMV: There are no funny female stand up comedians,u/Soft-Butterscotch128,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14glcpp/cmv_there_are_no_funny_female_stand_up_comedians/,changemyview,"Now to start off, I will say I will say that even attempting to be a stand up comedian is tough for anyone and it's not something I would be anywhere near as good as any comedian. You've got to have good timing, be a good storyteller and have something special. That said in all my years of watching stand up and going to comedy shows I've never seen a funny female comedian.

Now this isn't to say that they can't tell a funny joke but I don't think being able to tell a single good joke in a set, makes someone a funny comedian. Also it seems like they rely heavily on sex jokes and weird noises and movements. So if I had to describe it like a movie: to me, their comedy is like Crappy movie that throws in some sex and action scenes to keep people interested. 

Now when I look at someone like Dave Chapelle he has a way where he captures the audience. He can go from telling a joke, into a serious introspective story, then drop a punchline that get everyone dying from laughter. Not only that but his entire set usually connects the jokes back to each other. Now I think Chapelle is the Michael Phelps of comedy where he's just a once in a blue moon comedian so it would be unfair to hold them to that standard. So I think a good baseline would be Bill Burr, or Tom Segura. 

To CMV all you need to do is show me a clip of a funny female comedian and here's my criteria:

\[ \] Must be doing stand up. There are a lot of funny female actors but stand up is different

\[ \] It must be a string of connected jokes or a single joke that goes on for a bit with a good punchline

\[ \] Preferably not low brow comedy

\[ \] Must be original

We do not try to dive deeper and understand what caused it and decide to punish them. We do not realize how flawed our system is. You could end up with a horrible lawyer or a uncooperative judge that is not willing to give you a fair trial. Doctors that mess up their diagnoses of mental illness and incompetence. This messed up system has been the case of many in the US court cases (*seen in Bryan Stevenson's Just Mercy*). If the system is not perfect what allows a punishment this severe.

There also becomes the issue if the child is innocent too. If a child is innocent, you have just put a child through a traumatic experience. There have been many rulings where children have been wrongly accused and put behind bars. How can we make it up to them for our mistakes... can we?

I often see the idea that ""if they want to act like adults"" they should be punished like one. That is cruel because children's brains have not fully developed. Why are we giving a severe sentence to a person who has undeveloped reasoning functions. There are many aspects that may have caused there crime.

Do we have to punish a child with a cruel punishment? I personally think there is atonement and mercy to give. I think that people who view punishments like these are lazy and cruel and psychotic.

So I know how much Indians are obsessed with white skin, especially creeps but really I believe white does look the best, now beauty matters on face proportions & anyone with any skin color can look as great as a model, I've absolutely seen people with darker skin looking much better than fairer people but white people really have an advantage, they stand from the crowd, they look extra beautiful in sunlight, even if their facial proportions aren't perfect they'll still look better than a person with darker skin with the same proportions, & even nature believes this i guess, if you eat healthy food, wear sunscreen, sleep well & drink more water you don't get darker you get fairer. 

I know it's personal for everyone but I believe if anyone could just look a little brighter everyone would want it mostly."
1,2023-06-22,CMV: Married couples should not get tax benefits simply for being married.,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14gnrov/cmv_married_couples_should_not_get_tax_benefits/,changemyview,"The concept of bestowing tax benefits for getting married is a relic of a bygone era when women were not allowed to work, or were not allowed to work jobs that paid substantial amounts of money. Thus, in these situations, the husband was now required to essentially support two people with his single income. Therefore, it made sense to offer some sort of tax benefit for getting married.

But nowadays, women are able to work and have professional lives, and are no longer a financial burden upon their husbands.

Now, I totally understand the reason for giving tax credits for having children. When you have children, they are a massive cost, and they provide no income themselves. When you have children, one spouse often has to quit their job to help raise the children. I am not arguing that. But in and of itself, marriage does not equal having children.

So as a single person who may very well never get married, why should I be penalized and have to pay more in taxes simply because I do not become legally married? That's not to say that just because I don't consume or use something that I shouldn't have to pay taxes for it. For example, even though I never plan of having children, I have no problem with my taxes going towards paying for schools and education, because I still benefit from living in a well-educated society.

But in and of itself, what benefit does simply being married provide to society, that I as a taxpayer should be forced to subsidize it?"

One might say ""but the actions of the state affect everyone, so everyone must have a say in it!"". But can we extend that reasoning to the institutions of science, or of the military? They undoubtedly affect everyone, and yet we don't regard control over those as a fundamental right. Think to yourself: How many people genuinely care about which political propositions are true, and which are false? Do you genuinely care? Rather, how many people simply fall into the pack, adopting political views without serious thought? Why should the people be given decision making power, when they make no decisions themselves? Their actions and beliefs are almost entirely engineered by those that are supposed to be made accountable to them! Why should these decisions be left to the people, when the people themselves are simply instruments of power?

My view only comes from watching YouTube videos and tv as I have never been in a courtroom in my life, however it seems to me like these “contempt of court” situations are almost unconstitutional(?), since they seem to revoke your 1st amendment right when you are in a courtroom by telling you you MUST respect the judge and every other authoritative figure in that room at all costs, if you don’t comply you will be charged with a crime. 

There are some things where I would agree they should be charged with a crime, for example if somebody makes a direct threat to the judge, or is being so disruptive you could consider it disturbing the public. However, there was one video I watched where a 21 year old kid or so was simply somewhat sagging his pants in the courtroom, and he got asked to pull them up, and when he refused he was tried with contempt of court. I don’t believe that people should be charged with a crime for dressing in a certain way, I mean it’s not like he was indecently exposed or anything. 

I also believe judges are authority figures that often intimidate people and clearly hold a large amount of power over other people, so I feel like if someone says “fuck you judge” i simply can’t hold much empathy for the judge due to the power dynamics.

This term has became cringe but to me this stuff just seems authoritarian, I believe in the US you should be able to act “unprofessional” in a courtroom if you so please and not get charged with a crime for it. The blatant disrespect of someone else is iffy but I don’t think we should treat disrespecting a judge different than someone disrespecting anyone else.

I’d also believe it would be more productive if people didn’t try to change my mind by saying “we should respect people in positions of power blindly”, because I don’t think my mind will be able to be changed on that.

1,2023-06-23,CMV: Reparations should not be anyone's priority,u/sexyimmigrant1998,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14gok5d/cmv_reparations_should_not_be_anyones_priority/,changemyview,"This is about the ever-present debate over reparations, specifically for Black Americans who are descendants of slaves. 

Summary: The argument is that generational wealth has been stolen from ADOS (American Descendants of Slavery) so they must be owed reparations. Let me steelman the argument. Reparations advocates argue this is simply about their group being screwed over by the US government and that they would not oppose reparations for other groups, which have happened (though the benefit has been marginal). They simply argue that this is not an issue of guilting anyone alive today, but simply a debt that the US government owes to people who were once enslaved. However, some hold this as their #1 policy issue and will not support any politician/movement/organization that doesn't prioritize this controversial, divisive issue.

&#x200B;

My issue with this is, as someone on the political left, I'm fucking sorry, but this thinking is horribly selfish and ridiculously counterintuitive. I do not argue with the notion that the US government does bear responsibility for their suffering. I *am* arguing that I find it a little silly to constantly view politics through the lens of some idealistic, storybook-esque mindset where the emphasis is on healing and righting the wrongs of the past and completing these narratives. 

Here's the reality: we are in a corrupt, broken society. We all know that. With corporate control over the media and politicians, We the People have very little political power and influence over how our society operates. It takes immense amounts of energy, dedication, time, and resources from millions of people to contribute to getting us even one step closer to solving any of the numerous problems we have to deal with. Even the most popular policy proposals which aim to universally help the population are so difficult to make a reality.

People are *literally* dying because they have no healthcare. Children do not have adequate education and see their opportunities stifled and are then underpaid, worsening their quality of life. People caught for minor crimes such as non-violent drug offenders are rotting away in prisons, their lives completely going to waste while their families must survive without them. We have so many problems affecting so many different people. Let's all come together and focus on those issues to improve as many people's lives as possible. 

I find it a *hell of a lot easier* to convince so many people to agree with such arguments as those above. It's simple: people are getting screwed because of this system, let's do what we can to change it and help everyone. We don't need to divide us with all this talk about addressing the specific crimes done to a subset of the population and prioritize healing the group's past problems when those very people are suffering right *now*. Why don't we fight for Medicare-for-All? Why don't we fight for UBI? Why don't we fight for College-for-All? Why don't we fight for criminal justice reform? The problems I mentioned hurt ADOS the worst, and these examples of policy solutions help ADOS and non-ADOS alike in addressing the aformentioned problems. 

I don't understand, why must we focus on one group when we can benefit that group *and* everyone else. It's not like the US government hasn't screwed over people from every demographic simply because it profitted someone. Millions of people are owed something by the US government for one reason or another, but this mindset of putting the past front and center is only focused on one group, and I just find it odd and honestly, self-defeating.

I'm open to hear all views and have a good discussion about this, assuming people are down to have it.

264,2023-06-23,CMV: Affirmative action in college admissions is not the solution to equal education for racial minorities.,u/LazarYeetMeta,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14got8m/cmv_affirmative_action_in_college_admissions_is/,changemyview,"Since I have a feeling this is going to get asked about, I am a white college student who comes from a middle class family. I had a high-quality high school education, and for the most part, I haven’t experienced the racial discrimination that racial minorities have. However, the color of my skin shouldn’t determine whether or not my opinion is valid. 

I’ll also take the time to define a few things: affirmative action in college admissions is, to the best of my knowledge, the practice of using racial quotas as a basis for which students get into a college or university. For example, if 10% of an applicant pool is black, then 10% of the incoming class would have to be black. This could mean denying admission to a higher-achieving student in favor of maintaining racial balance, especially if the incoming class has a limited size. 

With that out of the way, let’s begin. I saw an article from Politico talking about the Supreme Court’s likely decision on an upcoming affirmative action case, which is what prompted this post. I’ve debated my own position on affirmative action before, and I’ve never come to a concrete conclusion, but every time I look into it, I feel like there’s something off about it. I understand the meaning behind it, and I totally support it. Black and brown people have, historically, attended college at a lower rate than white people, mainly due to the lingering effects of segregation and Jim Crow laws. I’m not arguing that this situation isn’t a problem, because it is. I’m just not convinced that affirmative action in college admissions is the way solve it. 

All affirmative action does is give students a chance to attend a college that they might not have deserved admission to. I don’t have a source for this, but if someone didn’t earn their place at a university, it stands to reason they are more likely to flunk out. I’ll use an example.

Let’s say there are two unnamed students applying to MIT. MIT doesn’t have any strict admission requirements, but to be realistically considered for a spot in their incoming class, you need at least a 3.5 GPA and a 1500 on the SAT or a 34 on the ACT. That’s because MIT is an incredibly high achieving school, and if you don’t have those kinds of scores, you’re not likely to succeed there. Now, let’s say one student, Student A, has a 3.6 GPA and got a 1510 on the SAT. That student would likely be a contender for admission, provided they scored high in STEM classes and AP exams, and did volunteer hours and whatever else MIT is looking for. However, the second student, Student B, has a GPA of 3.3 and scored a 30 on the ACT. That’s certainly nothing to sneeze at, and would likely get that student into a majority of schools. Unfortunately, they probably wouldn’t be considered for admission to MIT. 

For argument’s sake, let’s say both students took the same amount of AP classes, had the same recommendations from teachers, were equally involved in extracurriculars and did an equal number of volunteer hours. The only differences between the two students are their grades and standardized test scores. Student A would stand a better chance at admission to MIT. Of course, there’s no guarantee that Student A would get in, but they are the better candidate. 

Now, most of you can probably see where I’m going with this. Student B is admitted to MIT, and Student A is not, because MIT’s affirmative action policies demand a certain number of students of racial minorities, and Student B is Hispanic, and Student A is white. While there was no guarantee that Student A was admitted, it certainly seems wrong that they were be passed over for a student who wasn’t as qualified. 

That’s one of the issues I see with affirmative action, and I’m sure some of you will be quick to point out that it probably strikes a chord with me, as a white person. And you’re right; it does. But that’s not my only problem with it. 

For one thing, Student B is more likely to fail out of MIT than Student A would be. That’s not to say that either of them would, just that one is more likely. But the real problem is that giving Student B a free pass to MIT isn’t going to fix the underlying issues that many racial minorities face on a daily basis. Statistically, racial minorities are more likely to be raised in single parent households, in low-income and high crime neighborhoods, have lesser access to high quality early education, and because of all that, they are less likely to go to college, whether because they weren’t taught well enough or because they can’t afford it. Giving students free passes so late in the game isn’t going to help solve any past issues. All it will do is try to make up for them. 

Again, it’s a noble idea and I get where proponents of affirmative action are coming from. But I think that it would be much more effective, long term, to focus on the underlying issues that cause those lower rates of college admission. I get that I might come across as callous for focusing on younger and future generations over people who are currently facing hardships, but if we’re ever going to solve the problem of systemic racism, we need to stop focusing on reparations for our past mistakes, we need to start fixing them. 

Maybe we never see a world (mostly) free from racism and injustice, but maybe our children will. To me, that’s more important."

I also find it very questionable that someone wouldn’t report illegal immigrants, they are actively breaking our laws. A person who overstays their visa, hops the border, or shows up on a boat deserve little sympathy. They are by definition criminals who have little respect for the country they want to be in.

i don’t think i need to focus on its racist underpinnings to make the argument that conservatism is a genocidal ideology that presently poses an existential threat to world peace and humanity as a whole. 

my key focus is climate change. while liberals are certainly to be faulted for dragging their feet with regards to climate change and what the scientific community agrees to be reasonable remedies to slow its progression, they are still very much committed to doing something to address this grave environmental disaster that looms ever closer. on the other hand, conservatives engage in climate denial, making it a pillar of their platform, ignoring the scientific evidence underscoring a call for action and actively conspiring with the fossil fuel industry to hasten the deterioration of our ecosystem. 

climate change, which includes not just warmer temperatures but the environmental disasters that rise will trigger, stands to see vast swaths of the global south rendered uninhabitable. these regions, consumed by unprecedented heat, will become graveyards for millions who lack the resources to defend themselves from the horrific consequences of the global north’s inaction and whose migration to cooler regions will undoubtedly be met with violent resistance.

this is essentially ecocide - or, more precisely, genocide. the numbers facing a hellish end dwarf those lost in the holocaust. we are looking at south east asia and africa turning into veritable ovens in which hundreds of millions will be cooked alive. 

it’s time to discuss the elephant in the room and begin treating the climate denying conservatives who obstruct meaningful solutions to this global crisis as the genocidal threat they are.

A brief intro can be found here:

[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jeremy-corbyn-glastonbury-film-oh-cancelled-b2360897.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jeremy-corbyn-glastonbury-film-oh-cancelled-b2360897.html)

I have seen excepts of this file and reviews of it - it is at the very least sailing extremely close to the wind of being outright anti-semitic. Some of the edit cuts are deeply problematic.

To be clear there were objections to Corbyn's leadership from many Jewish people - open public objections. These included for example the Labour Party of Israel cutting their ties to the British Labour party leadership for the first time. [https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/israel-jeremy-corbyn-jews-antisemtism\_uk\_5acccb43e4b0152082fdfe4e](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/israel-jeremy-corbyn-jews-antisemtism_uk_5acccb43e4b0152082fdfe4e). Jewish MPs inside the Labour party objected - some quit the party over it. But there is a huge leap between open criticism and what this film presents - which is a huge conspiracy theory.

But for me the killer fact is the one right in the title - **The Big Lie** \- which is directly lifted from Mein Kampf and was a central plank of Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda. I simply cannot believe that anyone really intended this as a defence of Jeremy Corbyn against charges of anti-Antisemitism and then approvingly quoted Adolf Hitler in the title. It is beyond belief that people who claim to be strident anti-racists who have a better understanding of anti-Antisemitism than the general public genuinely believed that quoting the most infamous anti-Semite of all time in the title of the film was valid approach.

The only thing that makes sense to me is that someone - probably Alexei Sayle - was playing the role of court jester trying to point out to the inner circle that their conspiracy theories had crossed a line of acceptability and reason. Which went wrong when they all gave it the green light and tried to push it out to the public.

EDIT : I very much doubt that I can be persuaded that directing the Big Lie at Jews is innocent or just a bit of fun any more than I would accept the same regarding monkey noises directed at black people. My belief that it is open obvious racism is going be very hard to change and was not the intent of this CMV. "

Let me use nuclear energy to illistrate these principals, they can be applied equally to hydro-electric dams etc.
In the UK we have a relatively free energy market (bar taxation policy), succesive governments have not invested in nuclear powerplants instead leaving it to the markets. In the winter, during the current Ukraine crisis our energy costs as we are almost wholly reliant on fosil fuels and wind. A series of nuclear plants would have insolated us and protected our national grid (like in France). 

The problem is that market forces do not select for Nuclear energy because: 
The initial outlays to construct a plant are huge relative to other energy sources, the plants take 7 years to comission (so no initial ROI) and after those initial outlays they must sell a GW/hour at the market rate, so are at a far lower GM% vs other energy types. 
Simply put market forces will not select this type of energy especially where energy firms are expected to pay annual dividends.

(2) Under the Brit's system, settling cases outside of the courts is more encouraged, based on (1) which lowers appeals and speeds up the results for both parties.

(3) The Brit's system means that people with few means can take on larger corporations or the government much more easily if they have a meritorious case

(4) SLAPP suites are less common because they will incur a higher cost for the filing party.

(5) In the USA, while it possible to get a judgement for costs, such judgements rarely cover actual costs as Judges do not have to consider actual costs incurred but can calculate what the costs ""should"" be based on average ([loadstar](https://www.abi.org/abi-journal/what-is-reasonable-under-lodestar)) costs in the area. Judges also have the authority to adjust the costs downward by as much as 30% without explanation based on their sole determination of what is ""fair.""

The American System is far inferior to the Brit's system for determining who pays. CMV!"
1,2023-06-23,CMV: Drinking one or two drinks every evening should not be more stigmatized than drinking one or two cups of coffee in the morning.,u/TapiocaTuesday,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14h0vt4/cmv_drinking_one_or_two_drinks_every_evening/,changemyview,"I'm focusing purely on the mental, psychological, and social here. Not on any physical health issues, which are too complex to include here.   

It's pretty widely accepted in society to drink one or two cups of coffee every day, to start your day. Call it habit, call it addiction, whatever.  

It's also somewhat accepted to have a drink or two of an alcoholic beverage every evening. Night cap, glass of wine at dinner, whatever you want to call it.  

But there is a key difference. If someone were to say to someone else, ""I have two cups of coffee every morning, and I feel like I can't function until I have my daily coffee!"" it would probably not raise any alarms with the other person.  

But if someone said, ""I have two shots of tequila every night, and I feel like I can't relax until I have my nightly shots of tequila!"" well, that might sound like a red flag to the other person that this person has a drinking problem.  

I see lots of places, ""If you can't go one day without a drink, you have a problem"". But it's so rare to hear that said about coffee.  

Assuming that a person never drinks more than two drinks a night, as long as their doing it every night, and feel off if they don't, then a lot of people would tell them they have a drinking problem or they're an alcoholic. Quite the stigma. 

But if you swap in coffee for that, no one bats an eye. They're both drugs. They're both addictive.

**EDIT: A lot of good points already. Especially that all else being equal, alcohol has the potential to be much, much worse if a person shows a lack of autonomy around it.**"

94,2023-06-23,CMV: Laws to Protect Children Online are Becoming too Restrictive and Dangerous for Privacy,u/AlarmedPassenger,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14h41hz/cmv_laws_to_protect_children_online_are_becoming/,changemyview,"A few months ago, I was listening to a [podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/27/podcasts/the-daily/social-media-instagram-tiktok-utah-ban.html) on The Daily by NYT. The story of that day was about a new Utah [law](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/technology/utah-social-media-law-tiktok-instagram.html) that was passed to protect children on social media by restricting their use of social media to a portion of the day and allowing their parents full access over their accounts, including private messages. The user restriction could be lifted or amended by their parent if they so desired. The age verification would need to be verified by some sort of real-world identification before creating an account. Utah Consumer Protection would need to develop verification rules, but as suggested in the podcast, it could be that the adult verification process would work by having the user provide an ID or by giving a $0.05 transaction to verify the account before creating it.

Another law that was recently passed, also by Utah, would require everyone that watches porn in Utah to verify their age by providing an ID that would be stored on government systems. This would prevent children under the age of 18 from accessing online porn.

These laws are all done with the best of intentions in mind, I believe. Parents have been some of the loudest activists to have these bills become law in not just Utah, but in other states as well.

Unsurprisingly a lot of these laws, and some bills being proposed, are coming from red states, but it’s still something that seems to be bipartisan, especially when it comes to protecting children on social media. I don’t disagree with the sentiment, and I do think there is room to regulate the use of these sites so that children are protected. However, I think these specific laws come at a giant cost for both adults and children.

Before I lay out my case, I first want to make clear what I think is fine with the current laws. I think requiring a form of real-world verification for social media sites is fine, since I’m not opposed to regulating children’s use of social media and there would need to be a way to verify adults using those sites. I also agree that children under a certain age, particularly 13, shouldn’t use or be able to create social media accounts. So whenever I refer to “children,” I’m specifically talking about anybody over the age of 12 and under 18. There should probably be a system in place that requires parents to accept a friend request from their children, so they know they aren’t talking to a stranger. Also, just to be clear, I’m over the age of 18 so I’m in no way affected by these laws and if I was a parent, I probably wouldn’t mind having these laws in place. Nevertheless, I think I’m in a place where I’m not particularly emotionally driven to lean to one side, and I can see the faults on both sides.

The major issue that I find with the social media law, is the requirement for parents’ access to all their children’s private messages. This is probably the most worrying part about the law. For one, it’s a serious breach of a child’s privacy. I understand there are those who believe children should have *no* privacy when it comes to their online presence, but I think this sort of control over a teen’s life is unhealthy to an extreme degree. As we all know, teens are going to say stuff that you wouldn’t want your parent seeing. You can be insulting, sometimes against your parents, sometimes against their beliefs, and about a lot of other things. These are conversations that teens are always having with their friends, and I think having a third set of eyes on these conversations restricts their children’s freedom to express themselves and differentiate from their parents’ beliefs when it comes to religion, politics, or sexuality; things that are all explored in this phase of their lives’.

To add to this, I think a lot of parents seem to forget about their own experiences as teenagers. Unfortunately, I don’t think a lot of parents have these sorts of deep conversations that allow their children to speak to them openly and honestly. And if they don’t have those types of parents, then they probably wouldn’t feel comfortable having anything to say to their friends while speaking to them privately on social media. It also doesn’t make sense to restrict these talks because they’re going to have them anyway, so why practically block them from having them?

Also, I’ve [read](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/17/upshot/social-media-teen-mental-health.html) for a while now that the studies that substantiate claims about social media being bad for children aren’t the best. The general claim is that some studies don’t show a clear correlation or that they don’t show what restrictions could help in bettering one’s mental health. Or, in other words, they don’t know exactly what makes social media unhealthy for children if a correlation does exist or to what degree.

Some of the people most seriously harmed by this will be those that find support by others online. If you live in an oppressive household that doesn’t show you the support that you need, then sometimes you’ll find it online. I know everyone likes to shit on social media for all the harm that it’s done, but it has also helped a lot of lonely teens connect with other people in similar situations. I believe that’s done a lot of good to those people, and this would shut that down if their parents gained access to those conversations.

The issues with the [second law](https://apnews.com/article/porn-age-verification-utah-8f8f4960ad1ec4afc5d59fd7d34c3b9d) are something that concerns adults more than children. Theoretically, I have nothing against IDing people to access porn sites, but practically, it’s more complicated. For one, state governments are notoriously bad for storing user information privately. I can imagine an unsophisticated hack of one of their sites that leads to an exposure of all that unencrypted data that would then be sold online and then released to everyone. This would be bad for your job, bad for your relationship with your partner, and bad for you in your community. One can imagine being into weird fetishes or maybe being sexually different from what you present to your friends and family. There just doesn’t seem to be a good way to store this data without the realistic risk that it will be exposed in the future. I think there is a more private way of restricting porn for children than legislating it and putting people’s private data at risk of humiliating exposure.

This second take might be a little controversial, but I don’t think there is a lot wrong with teens being able to access porn. It’s something that generations of teens have been doing with Playboy magazines, or pictures online from the 90s, or probably other methods that I’m not familiar with. It’s a part of growing up and people are going to find other methods. I think the more important part, as a parent, is to have these conversations with their children when they’re around that age. It’s uncomfortable, but necessary. I don’t think putting these restrictions is going to help since VPN downloads were at an all time high in that part of the country after the law had been passed. Those children are still going to watch, and I feel like parents are only getting a false sense of comfort with this law.

I’m open to being wrong about this, particularly around the social media one. I’ve seen this [video](https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/1622750540500434946) and ever since I’ve always wondered whether I’m one of those people speaking in the video. Am I the person complaining against drunk driving laws? It seems so obvious now, but perhaps it wasn’t so in the past. I don’t know whether that’s me or not, but I’d love to hear what you have to say."

1,2023-06-23,"CMV: The ""shadowing"" and ""reading aloud"" methods of learning a language are biased",u/socjologos,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14h706j/cmv_the_shadowing_and_reading_aloud_methods_of/,changemyview,"To preface, I've tried these methods but I found it pretty dull and ineffective. But I'm aware of that I might did something wrong or I didn't understand how these methods are supposed to work. However, based on what I've read on the internet and comparing with my experience, I daresay that they are a bit biased and do not bring the expected results. 

First of all it's important to emphasize what I'm getting at. Personally I'm pretty sure that shadowing or reading aloud **will not improve your self-confidende when it comes to speak foreign language and will not help you in improving your overall fluency in speaking.**  Some people describe it as a method which can make up for the lack of opportunities to speak, therefore providing you with some kind of replacement for a teacher or practice in natural circumstances. 

I believe that when you want to write better in other language, you have to write more in other language. When you want to read better in other language, you have to read more in other language. And when you want to speak better in other language - especially when you are put on the spot, you have to find opportunities for being put on the spot and speak. There is no other way and any kind of compensation which may bring you similar results.

I back up my opionion with the fact, that there is lack of scientific evidence that these two methods are truly beneficial. The only things we have are random voices from diverse learning communities but this is all based on guessing or wishful thinking rather than proved thesis. I'm sure that people who  put their success down to shadowing or reading aloud have ample additional opportunities to practice REAL conversation.

The only thing I agree with, that is pretty obvious though, is that these two mentioned methods train your tounge therefore help you with pronouncuation a lot, but there is no other benefit worth to noting. 

To summarize, I found one research regarding this topic called ""Shadowing: What Is It? How to use it? Where will it go?"" and I think that I can finish this post with a quote from there, which describes what I think pretty well:

""Regarding speaking, a theoretical framework that explains speaking development through shadowing needs to be established. The research on shadowing and speaking is still undeveloped, and problems such as a lack of robust research design, careless and questionable data analysis, use of biased data, and over reliance on students' self reports are often observed. Next, acoustic analysis may show some possibilities for pronunciation development, but does not reveal if it is noticeably improved among people.""

I think that any personal opinions like ""I used this method and thanks to that I'm fluent 2L speaker"" won't change my view because this is still nothing grounded and thouroughly analysed.

P.S. I'm sorry if it sounds a bit messy, I'm still a toddler in English."

One of the main goal of EU is to abolish border tax between EU states and make economics deals with the rest of the world. The result of this is pushing production cost as low as possible and let the cheapest win basically. Most of the products are not made locally anymore, and requires transportation for the good (bad for the environment, often trucks or cargo ships which are a big source of co2). Then it is often made with different standard, some of these countries allow chemicals that are forbidden in the destination country (also bad for the environment).

I saw this post the other day on r/exmuslim or r/atheism (don't remember which) where a mother was talking about her daughters decision to convert to Islam and they were all conspiring to dissuade her from this decision. I mean, its her choice? These people bash on religion for no ""freedom of choice"" but aren't prepared to give their own kids a choice when it comes to their own faith. That is indoctrination in the extreme.

And don't say ""she is saving her from oppresion"" , then you are all hypocrites, how do you save someone from ""oppresion"" when you yourselves are forcing your own child not to convert? That is also oppresion of the childs choice she made HERSELF and beyond hypocritical. 

If this was a trans kid, who wanted to transition to male/female, the parent would no ponger have custody. But somehow when it comes to the childs *own* decision regarding her *own* faith and her *own* spirituality, no one sees any problem when its borderline indoctrination and oppresion of the childs own choice, and hypocritical as well.

My point is, if atheists parents aren't ready to let their kids convert ro Islam then they have no right to bash on Muslim or Christian parents that teach their kids religion. 

And before you rush to pull everything and anything against Islam and Christianity, this post is about the hypocrisy of atheists not about Islam or Christianity. Everyone has a right to choose rheir religion without their parents forcing their kids to atheism or religions. If atheists are going to start forcing children to be atheists, then they are no better than other religions."

In the near future you'll be able to generate virtual replicas of these children (and adults too) that act like them, sound like them and look like them but you are free to engage with them however you'd like, I believe that this is completely unavoidable, it will happen behind closed doors in a lot of homes and the only way to protect oneself is to not post anything online that you don't want to be sexualized. 

People will have sexual experiences with virtual replicas of real children in their private virtual environment, this I believe is a fact. "

I honestly don't know why they are considered emotionally intelligent, all they are doing is making random  wanted compliments at other women 
 in effort to be supportive to their womanliness 
And they don’t even do a good job at hiding it ( at least for me, because apparently other women don't realize they are being faked)

 it’s disgustingly awkward, being intelligent would not be saying anything and minding your business.

i‘d be seeing women rate a fat ugly bitch a 10 and wonder if i’m the only one seeing a 0, this is why all these mid looking women are rating themselves 10s nowaday, that’s the source of the problem. Not only is it damaging, it’s unhealthy, “beauty is SuBjECtIve”


At least with a dude, he’d be honest or joke around and which would cause either one of two things build character and make the person  improve themselves or make the person sad in the moment, but what women are doing is damaging, maybe not now but later when the person they are complimenting finds out how others really think and that’s when real damage is done.

when you get something and got it taken away is way worst than when you never had it in the first place.

In the press conference the reporters were unjustly shaming Tommy for how he wasn’t fighting any real opponents. What they didn’t realise there wasn’t anyone worthy of a challenge towards young Gunn, Creed, Lang, Ivan Drago all were beaten by Rocky so once those guys were gone there was none for Tommy to fight. In addition to this Tommy was very new and young to the world of boxing so this led to him being taken advantage of by Duke and betraying Rocky. Tommy deserved so much more what do you guys think."
1,2023-06-24,CMV: The danger was the point,u/yogfthagen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14hybzw/cmv_the_danger_was_the_point/,changemyview,"The Oceangate tragedy was a completely normal, expected part of exploration and advancing technologies. Even more, it is a normal, expected part of human behavior to seek out thrills through dangerous, life-threatening experiences. And there are some people who will be drawn to those behaviors. And there will be people willing to take those people on those expeditions. And some of them will die.

Technologies- As technology advances to allow us to survive in more and more extreme places, some of that technology is going to fail. Oftentimes, a design or a material will be tested to the limits of our knowledge and abilities, but the only way to validate that it can survive in the real world is to test it in the real world. The Wright Brothers were first in the air, but one of them was the pilot in the first fatal airplane crash in the US. Yet, 60 years later, humans thought nothing of going at almost the speed of sound, six miles over the ground, in temperatures of -50F, in air so thin you would pass out in a minute. Yet, here we are.

A lot of people died to get us to that point. That's where unforeseen issues, circumstances, combinations, cascading errors, and human factors can come together to create a circumstances where somebody (or somebodies) are going to die.

Human behavior- People need thrills. I call it being an adrenaline junkie. You can call it a desire to live life to the fullest. Winston Churchill said 'There is nothing more exhilarating than to be shot at with no result.' And some people will take that risk, just to feel the thrill.

We can look at Magellan, the first circumnavigation of the planet. He started off with 5 ships and 200+ sailors. The expedition returned with one ship, and less than 20 emaciated, scurvy-ridden skeletons. And it was considered a success. As soon as they got back, others were ready to make the same journey, despite the 90% mortality rate.

The polar explorers died at an amazing rate. It was not until Amundsen returned from both the north and south poles (beating other expeditions who lost men, or were completely lost) that it became reality.

Race driving used to have a body count as a matter of course. A Formula 1 driver faced a higher mortality rate than an astronaut about to go walking on the moon.

Mountain climbers regularly pay almost a hundred thousand dollars to climb Everest, despite there being a couple hundred bodies on the slopes of the mountain. There's a Death Zone, where humans cannot survive more than a few hours. There is a point where you are literally told, beyond this point, you are on your own. There is NO rescue, support, or assistance.

And the danger is WHY they go.

Danger- Capitalism is the issue. If there are people willing to spend money to do something, somebody will figure out a way to provide that service. Problem is, the cost of getting people to the thrill can be as expensive as the price people are willing to pay. So, there's going to be people out there who are willing to cut corners, at the price of people's safety. That's what regulations are about. Forcing people to sacrifice profit over process to not kill others.

But, often, those budding capitalists are doing their thing long before the regulators catch up with them. About the only time they do catch up is AFTER a big accident. Safety regulations are written in blood.

In short?

It's going to happen again.

And again.

And again.

Just wait for the first tourists to die in space. It's coming."

This worked well because typically the majority voice had a mitigating effect on extremes that were in the minority - people with extreme views could not influence governance. 

However, with the rise of social media, media companies have been handed a tool which they now use to drive profits up - by serving the public the most juicy, most controversial, most engaging content. And because nothing prevents them from choosing content which is political, or even directly related to elections, they have taken advantage of this and have increasingly shifted the spotlight to the most disgust/anger/reaction-inducing topic with even the remotest of political ties ... because it turned out this is what drives in the most traffic, or attracts the best sponsorships. Money.

In the past 10 or so years, due to the above mentioned mechanic, political public discourse has significantly changed into something, in my opinion, ugly and toxic ... and it has divided citizens into two opposing groups, which are increasingly aggressive and antagonistic to one another. We now live in a world where extreme views are the loudest, and because more and more people can't hear anything other than the loudest voices every day at every news show, more and more people forget that there even were/are normal and rational non-extreme views they can hold or support. More and more people decide to stand behind one of the opposing extremes. The majority voice no longer has a mitigating effect on extremes, it started to back them.

Societal stability and harmony is important for a healthy society, and so unless something changes, we will continue to see a deterioration of the quality of public discourse, increases in politically motivated violence, loss of respect in authority ... as well as increased lack of cooperation between political parties, and this will result in basically less and less things being done efficiently in government. 

It creates a vicious circle that will need to be somehow broken. In my mind, this will be done by, in some fashion, shutting down voices - either that of the free and unchecked media (or social media), or that of the, whichever happens to be at the time, the losing party and their supporters, resulting in loss of true democracy and creating something more authoritarian in its place.

There is no way out of this without sacrificing something."

There many been PSAs warning against the phasing out of AM radio for this reason. Nothing that can impede the dissemination of critical information to people in times of crisis should be acceptable, let alone alone widely imposed. Of course, few people currently listen to AM radio, but given the ability of its frequency to travel large distances compared to FM, especially at night, AM radio is crucial to any emergency situation. AM transmitters also use less power then FM which may be important in an emergency situation. 

What would change my mind is that somehow EV manufacturers can allow their cars to use AM radio or, at the very least, allow AM radio to be used when the car is off."

For instance, imagine you're walking down a street and you see a child drowning in a shallow pond, of which you are the only observer to it's occurrence. You can save that child really easy, but you decide not to, because you don't want to ruin your shoes that you just bought and they cost you £30. Most people would consider that highly immoral, popularly under the basis that you've refused to intervene at the cost of £30.

Now let's apply that to the opportunity to donate to charity. The exact same logic applies. For example, instead of the child drowning in front of you they're instead starving on the other side of the world. You do the exact same thing every time you refuse to give £30 to charity, and you're not intervening because it's preferable for you to keep your £30.

The interesting thing here is that, in principle, this logic extends much further than this; perhaps to every spare amount of value/money you necessarily possess.

So, why do we selectively help those in a less fortunate situation than us? Because of phycological factors which supersedes our ability to rationalise our actions with logic. In scenario 1, we are usually motivated to intervene. Which is fine, for varying reasons. I personally don't donate charity that often, rarely, in fact, and yet I'd consider myself a hypocrite and immoral for not doing so, unless I'd change my view to that it's not morally obligatory to intervene in either situation.

This means that either:

It's not morally obligatory to intervene in either situation

It is, which makes me (and many people) immoral

Personally, I just accept this and try to forget about it.

Buttt CMV. I'd be interested in hearing some good counter-arguments to this, which I'm sure there is; I feel that there is something missing in my reasoning but I can't pin point it."

1,2023-06-24,CMV: Most anime characters don't look Caucasian,u/willjerk4karma,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14i47ih/cmv_most_anime_characters_dont_look_caucasian/,changemyview,"""Anime"" characters embody a huge variety of art styles, so for the purposes of this post I'm referring to the most common and relevant kind of modern Anime art style such as [this one](https://imgur.com/a/D1ItDh3) or [this one](https://imgur.com/a/hmTq8v6).

On Reddit and other Western dominated social media platforms, the idea that anime characters in general look like Caucasians has been coming up for decades, although this viewpoint is far from unanimous. In Asian countries, this [viewpoint is all but absent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_Xd2xLAjDM), and having talked about this before with roommates from Africa and South America, I don't think the viewpoint is common outside of Caucasian-majority societies. 

The most common argument in favor of this view is something along the lines of ""Anime characters don't have black hair, black eyes or yellow skin therefore they must be Caucasian"". Of course, it's obvious to point out that anime characters can have literally any hair, eye or skin color and still look like an anime character. Or that Caucasian people don't have blue, purple, red, pink, green etc hair. Or that East Asian people have a range of skin tones that doesn't actually include yellow, and very often their skin is just as “white” as a “white” person. But a better way of thinking about it is by pointing out what happens (or rather, doesn't happen) if you modify an anime character's hair/eye color.

Consider this: take any anime character, change its hair, eye, or skin color to any other color, and it will still look like an anime character. Give the character brown skin, or any other color (even blue skin works) and the character still looks anime. In other words, the color of the eyes/hair/skin has no influence over whether or not a drawn character looks ""Anime"".

So what does make a drawing look ""anime""? The most prominent component, by far, is the way that the face is drawn. Although there is some variety in the way faces are drawn even in the modern anime style, it's commonly pointed out that all the characters' faces are extremely similar in most ways. Specifically, anime characters tend to:
* Have very small noses with low, curved nose bridges that start at or below pupil level
* Have no perceptible amount of eye socket depth
* Have no brow ridge
* Have round faces with small pointy chins

These features generally point to the trend that anime characters tend to have very youthful, flat looking facial structure with very mild facial topography. The moment you start to deviate away from this pattern, the characters look less and less anime. You can have all the blonde haired, blue eyed characters you want, but as soon as you start drawing their faces like a Marvel character, no one will ever think the character looks like an anime character.

The second argument is to stereotype East Asian facial features in a very cherry-picked manner. By far the most common argument is to say something along the lines of  “Asians have tiny slanted slits for eyes, and anime characters have big eyes just like Caucasians, therefore anime characters look like Caucasians”. Of course, it's obvious to point out that Caucasian people's eyes aren't anywhere near the size of anime characters and generally don't look anything like Anime eyes. You could also point out that it's just a racist stereotype that Asian people have tiny eyes. [Looking at mathematically averaged face pics](https://imgur.com/a/lxKXzNn), the size of their eyes is really not different from other races.

But the most effective way to disprove this argument is to look at the real eyes that most closely resemble Anime eye shapes, which are eyes like [this](https://imgur.com/a/MjzTIOF) or [this](https://imgur.com/a/4169v40) or [this](https://imgur.com/a/bHhjhh3). You can say that most Asian people don't look like this, or these beauty standards are toxic, but that's not relevant to the point being made here. This is the beauty standard that some Asians do look like, and many others try to emulate. But ultimately, there AREN'T any Caucasian people that look like this. The race of these girls is immediately obvious due to their facial features. It's not possible to mistake any of them for Caucasian in good faith.

This begs the question though, if it's possible to stereotype Asian features then it should be possible to stereotype Caucasian features, right? Of course its possible. It goes without saying that within any race there is a large variation of facial features, and although it will make some people uncomfortable to have their own race stereotyped for a change, there are also common elements that make it trivially easy to distinguish Caucasians. For Caucasian people, in relation to East Asian people, these are the features that unmistakably distinguish them:
* Prominent nose bridges that start above pupil level
* Deep eye-sockets that will cast shadows over the eyes in overhead light
* Prominent, protruding brow ridge

When drawing a realistic face, you can play around with almost any other feature and it won't make the face look like a specific race as the majority of possible features can be found in any race. But any face with these 3 features will always make the face look Caucasian. Not just quite a contrast, these are essentially the complete inverse of the features that make anime characters look “Anime”. 

The third most common argument is that “Caucasian characters are drawn like Japanese characters, therefore the characters look Caucasian”. This argument isn't exactly true, though, as Caucasian anime characters are VERY often drawn with [specifically Caucasian ethnic facial features](https://imgur.com/a/N2Z2egw). It is also common for them to be drawn without these ethnic features, but the intention is almost always to make the character more visually appealing to the target audience. This intention is spelled out by the character designer of “The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories”, where the main character is European but the designer explicitly says that they had [no intention of making her facial features actually look Caucasian](https://imgur.com/a/OejlrV4). In Japanese culture, there is rarely a reason to make a character look Caucasian, as racial issues are not an important part of Japanese society and the race of a character is almost always irrelevant to the story. Artists will almost always take the path of most money (i.e. make the character look cute) rather than make the character look realistic for no reason.

It's quite telling that neural network AI [tends to identify anime characters as Asian](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1418197-kairos-diversity-recognition), and when you tell an AI to generate a realistic version of a character, you get [very convincing results](https://www.reddit.com/r/deathnote/comments/w2hm2t/realistic_light_yagami/) that [tend to](https://www.reddit.com/r/KanojoOkarishimasu/comments/12zhchr/chizuru_l_mizhura_l_rent_a_girlfriend_anime_ai/) [not look very Caucasian](https://imgur.com/a/SOvL4uB)."

Although there is some variety in the way faces are drawn even in the modern anime style, it's commonly pointed out that all the characters' faces are extremely similar in most ways. Specifically, anime characters tend to:

* Have very small noses with low, curved nose bridges that start at or below pupil level
* Have no perceptible amount of eye socket depth
* Have no brow ridge
* Have round faces with small pointy chins

These features generally point to the trend that anime characters tend to have very youthful, flat looking facial structure with very mild facial topography. The moment you start to deviate away from this pattern, the characters look less and less anime. You can have all the blonde haired, blue eyed characters you want, but as soon as you start drawing their faces like a Marvel character, no one will ever think the character looks like an anime character.

The second argument is to stereotype East Asian facial features in a very cherry-picked manner. By far the most common argument is to say something along the lines of  “Asians have tiny slanted slits for eyes, and anime characters have big eyes just like Caucasians, therefore anime characters look like Caucasians”. Of course, it's obvious to point out that Caucasian people's eyes aren't anywhere near the size of anime characters and generally don't look anything like Anime eyes. You could also point out that it's just a racist stereotype that Asian people all have tiny eyes. [Looking at mathematically averaged face pics](https://imgur.com/a/lxKXzNn), the size of their eyes is really not different from other races.

But the most effective way to disprove this argument is to look at the real eyes that most closely resemble Anime eye shapes, which are eyes like [this](https://imgur.com/a/MjzTIOF) or [this](https://imgur.com/a/4169v40) or [this](https://imgur.com/a/bHhjhh3). You can say that most Asian people don't look like this, or these beauty standards are toxic, but that's not relevant to the point being made here. This is the beauty standard that some Asians do look like, and many others try to emulate. But ultimately, they look more like anime characters than any other real humans, and there AREN'T any Caucasian people that look like this. The race of these girls is immediately obvious due to their facial features. It's not possible to mistake any of them for Caucasian in good faith.

This begs the question though, if it's possible to stereotype Asian features then it should be possible to stereotype Caucasian features, right? Of course its possible. It goes without saying that within any race there is a large variation of facial features, and although it will make some people uncomfortable to have their own race stereotyped for a change, there are also common elements that make it trivially easy to distinguish Caucasians. For Caucasian people, in relation to East Asian people, these are the features that unmistakably distinguish them:

* Prominent nose bridges that start above pupil level
* Deep eye-sockets that will cast shadows over the eyes in overhead light
* Prominent, protruding brow ridge

When drawing a realistic face, you can play around with almost any other feature and it won't make the face look like a specific race as the majority of possible features can be found in any race. But any face with these 3 features will always make the face look Caucasian. Not just quite a contrast, these are essentially the complete inverse of the features that make anime characters look “Anime”. 

The third most common argument is that “Caucasian characters are drawn like Japanese characters, therefore the characters look Caucasian”. This argument isn't exactly true, though, as Caucasian anime characters are VERY often drawn with [specifically Caucasian ethnic facial features](https://imgur.com/a/N2Z2egw). It is also common for them to be drawn without these ethnic features, but the intention is almost always to make the character more visually appealing to the target audience. This intention is spelled out by the character designer of “The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories”, where the main character is European but the designer explicitly says that they had [no intention of making her facial features actually look Caucasian](https://imgur.com/a/OejlrV4). In Japanese culture, there is rarely a reason to make a character look Caucasian or realistically like a specific race, as racial issues are not an important part of Japanese society and the race of a character is almost always irrelevant to the story. Artists will almost always take the path of most money (i.e. make the character look cute) rather than make the character look realistic for no reason.

It's quite telling that neural network AI [tends to identify anime characters as Asian](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1418197-kairos-diversity-recognition), and when you tell an AI to generate a realistic version of a character, you get [very convincing results](https://www.reddit.com/r/deathnote/comments/w2hm2t/realistic_light_yagami/) that [tend to](https://www.reddit.com/r/KanojoOkarishimasu/comments/12zhchr/chizuru_l_mizhura_l_rent_a_girlfriend_anime_ai/) [not look very Caucasian](https://imgur.com/a/SOvL4uB)."
1,2023-06-24,CMV: Climate change isn't as harsh as people believe it,u/Necronicus3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14i5gk3/cmv_climate_change_isnt_as_harsh_as_people/,changemyview,"...this isn't to say that we as humans can't affect our local climate. But I have some doubts of mine, about 'global' climate change caused by human actions. 

Reasons for such doubts:

* We do have proof, that the Earth itself was once hotter and more wet - before Humanity even set foot onto the lands. (Neoproterozoic Era)
* Despite that - the Earth has managed quite fine beyond tropical periods and ice ages. Granted - the issues have been whether or not the 'fauna/flora' has managed as easily as the rest of the planet. There has always been a renewal and regrowth.
* We've existed on this planet for millions of years by now. All the while, heavy industrial activity has only been so for about a century at most. (Thus - it is quite curious on how a planet that has survived firestorms, comets and worse; being ruined by a bunch of monkeys burning a bit of coal. Either Earth is more resilient than we give it credit for - or it is more delicate than paper, which begs the question on how have we managed to survive into the 'Modern' Age)
* Though 'science' is claiming one thing - *without a shadow of a doubt* \- we have plenty of points in history where they have been wrong and made mistakes. Either out of bias, lack of knowledge or lack of context. (Racist ideas during the Age of Exploration; Fear of overpopulation)
* We can barely predict the potential weather that may come a week or so. (However, we can 'certainly' say that in 10, 20, 50 years - things may become so bad that Earth may resemble Mars?)
* For a supposed 'worse case scenario' - many governments and anyone of authority is treating things as a novelty issue - all talk, little effective action. They are half the time engaging in playful dialogue with zero long-term acts that could potentially help reduce global emissions or transition towards more efficient energy sources - thus paving way for actual change and support from the public. (A campaign to help explain the advantages of nuclear power; improved power storage or power lines; credit towards getting your own green tech set up in your home or farm; increased mass transit as electric cars are too delicate, expensive and dirty-to-produce without damaging the environment more than aiding it)

Some concessions:

* I will admit that though global effects may be overblown - there may be local damages done, that could spread to other regions of the world. (Soviet Union destroyed the Aral Sea, thus spurring worsening climate for the region and others around them. China damming the Yangthze and causing horrible climate effects in their area)

Minor tidbit:

* Potentially renaming things from 'climate change' to 'climate damage'. As things are, the Earth can withstand worse than us or our shenanigans in this modern world. However, there is always the danger that we make things harder for ourselves - and *damage* our surrounding climate with our building, factories or actions. Adaptation is the name of the game in evolution - we can adapt, it is only a question of how much it will cost us."
1,2023-06-24,CMV: it's hypocritical to dislike anime (or Eastern animation in general) but have no qualms about Western animation,u/RandomTW5566,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14i5qgl/cmv_its_hypocritical_to_dislike_anime_or_eastern/,changemyview,"My brother, who is in middle school, was talking about this last night at dinnertime so I'll bring it up here. He's Chinese himself, but he seems to harbor irrational negative feelings against Japan and everything - past the point of justified criticism. Left and right, he criticises Japanese media, Japanese scenic areas, and even Japanese people! Not even my parents are like that anymore.

Now obviously, he still has a lot to learn, and I certainly hope he can improve himself over the next few years. (Even I myself was similarly edgy back then, and tbh we kind of *all* were.) But still, unfortunately, knowing how America is, there are probably plenty of grown men who still hold on to those same sentiments, and I'm starting to take issue with that.

Why? Because I have a feeling that **many of the issues pertaining to anime also exist in Western cartoons.**

(Actually, this art style isn't even exclusive to Japan! Like, you know of ""manga"", right? In Korea they've got ""manhwa"". And in China, whose language is where the word originated from in the first place, there's ""manhua"". All of these are written with the same Hanzi: 漫画. So it might be a little misleading to just say ""anime"".)

But anyways, if the issue is unrealistic plots in romcoms and the like, I can definitely understand that, but this is 100% something which also occurs in parallel Western media too, and it's not fair to pretend like it's exclusive to anime.

And if the issue is the art style itself, or how unrealistic or exaggerated or ""cute-saturated"" the art style, the voice acting, or simply the aesthetic in general is... first off, that's only one type of anime, you can't just go and generalize it across everything. Are all Western cartoons SpongeBob or The Loud House? While I concede that a case could be made for the act of animation itself facilitating these (subjective) ""disadvantages"" inherently, would it vary between one *continent* or another?

And I don't want to dive too deep into this so that this post remains SFW, but there's also the false equivalence between ""anime"" and ""hentai"", which is something else my brother brought up. A few bad apples don't spoil the whole basket, and as far as I know, there's practically nothing lurid or obscene about Studio Ghibli. And as for critique of the *viewerbase* of anime, bronies exist.

Similar logic applies to K-pop vs. the Western music industry.

To be clear, I'm not trying to argue ""anime is good, cmv"". I'm not trying to argue *anything*, actually. I'm wide open to hearing different perspectives, and if you enjoy Western cartoons but not anime for a valid reason, for example, I'm happy to hear your rationale."
0,2023-06-24,CMV: You can be transracial,u/Soft-Butterscotch128,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14i5s1y/cmv_you_can_be_transracial/,changemyview,"This just popped into my head while instagramming and seeing people calling out people for black/asian fishing. To me I think it's logically consistent that someone can be transracial. Ill respond to the arguments from [this article](https://theconversation.com/no-you-cant-identify-as-transracial-but-you-can-affirm-your-gender-163729) as to why: \*not London refers to a person who identifies as transracial) **(TL;DR at the bottom):**

&#x200B;

>At their core, London’s words and actions are a prime example of racism, cultural appropriation, and transphobia, enacted from a perspective of considerable privilege. Trans and gender diverse experiences don’t equate with someone deciding to change their appearance to be part of a group whose experiences, community and struggles they can’t fully understand.

The problem with this line is that it assumes a lot about a single transracial person and equates it to bigotry while also assuming the best about a transgender person and equates it to sincerity. How could you possibly know this especially when this person went through surgery to look closer to their racial identification? It also assumes that people of a single race all have the same experiences, community and struggles which is much more racist in my opinion.

&#x200B;

>Unlike gender, race presents as categorised (often physical) traits that are socially constructed and understood. You can’t inherit your gender, this is internal and something individual to you — but you do inherit the social construct of race. There is also much more to one’s racial identity than physical appearance — it’s also about culture, community, connection and even trauma.

This is basically the author saying, you must accept and reject the social construct I arbitrarily use. he also parents the same racist statement he made before.

&#x200B;

>People who face discrimination based on their race or cultural background can usually go home to members of their family who understand them. This is often not the case for trans and gender diverse people.

Maybe but this isn't a reason someone can't be transracial and is actually more of a reason for it.

&#x200B;

>London, who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, has actively chosen a “transracial” identity. But trans and gender diverse people’s decision to transition (whether that be social, medical and/or legal) is almost always involuntary and out of necessity to live their lives authentically.

Again, this is assuming London's intentions and again I ask, so what? The author says trans people **almost always** is involuntary and necessary to live their lives 'authentically'. So are those who don't not actually trans or..?

&#x200B;

>Almost 50% of trans young people in Australia have attempted suicide at least once in their lives. Trans and gender diverse young people experience higher levels of psychological distress than their cisgender peers.

So what? Does it take someone being suicidal to and physcologically distressed to treat them how they identify?

&#x200B;

>Conflating racial identity with gender identity implies that being trans is a choice, and therefore so is race.

I don't think it does. They are both comparable concepts if not exactly the same, it's just that you are fine with one but not the other for some reason.

&#x200B;

>It is racist to think someone can pick and choose parts of a race or culture they like, then distance themselves from that culture when it suits them. They avoid the burden of discrimination while reaping the rewards of white privilege, taking the necessary resources and voices from the communities who need it.

Well for one race =/= culture. Also people (even those born of a certain race) do this all the time.  Also is it not racist to assume that this is something stricltly done by white people? As well is this not the same argument against transpeople, for example, that transwomen in sports would take away places from ciswomen?

**Tl;dr: People can be transracial and they are apart of the trans community. I don't think there's any argument against it that would be logically consistent with our views on transpeople. Race is a social construct, it doesn't hurt anyone, and can allow people to live their lives in the way they identify**"
1,2023-06-24,CMV: Most people are ignorant of what it takes and means to be able to eat meat,u/DGIMartin,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14i5yr3/cmv_most_people_are_ignorant_of_what_it_takes_and/,changemyview,"For a long time I was thinking about my ideas towards meat. I love it, I love the taste of it. But so far I was only buying meat from the store, already prepared. My first idea about it was:

**If you want to eat meat, you should acknowledge what it is and that it was once an animal. Living, breathing creature.**

It is great starting point, but does not really make a good service to an animal. Why? Let me explain my story.

Today was the day I killed animal for food. It was a fish. This was the first time I was really faced with the feeling of what it means to:

**Make a decision to kill something so I can eat it.**

It was very intimate moment for me. For the whole ride home I had my stomach on water, waiting for the moment. I did not enjoy it, not even a bit. I felt weaird for the whole time. After the deed was done, I prepared the whole meat for consumption. 

You can say whatever you want, but until you do it yourself, you dont know what it is like. Suddenly, you are faced with your own mortality. It has been a few hours and I am still thinking about how fragile the life is. It made me appreciate the meat on a whole new level. I dont think I am fully able to describe it and I think that from now on, I will look at this from a different and much more appreciative angle.

My argument: ***Do you want to eat meat?***

**You should feel, deeply feel what it is like to take life for food, because otherwise you wont ever appreciate it enough. It does not make service to the animal that was killed.**

**You should be willing to do it, because if not, you are just delegating your guilt. You are hypocritical.**

You dont want to do that? Dont eat meat.

I see some arguments coming, which I think are wrong:

1. So by that logic, you should also make your own shirt, phone etc.

No. In these cases, life was not taken. 

2. It is not possible to provide that experience to everyone

I agree. I am not talking about practicality of it, but just the ""idea""

For me, I dont think that eating animals is morally wrong. I eat them myself and love it. But I also love personal integrity and responsibility for things you do, and only now I can see, that even though I was already on good path, I did not know and feel so much about it. I believe you cant replicate that with eduaction.

Moreover, the fact that it restricts the selection pool of candidates (ie, age restrictions) means that governments seeking to influence another country will know a person whom will agree to be manipulated.

Sortition would be less vulnerable since there is literally a wider selection pool (especially when we drop all age and monetary holdings down to 0, rendering literally anyone eligible to be selected and placed into office) who would not comply with the manipulations , moreover, the random nature of sortition means that it is harder to influence for a foreign government compared to elections.

&#x200B;

As for the other problems like who will monitor the body responsible for the lottery, the problem of handing over power to unelected bureaucrats/civil servants, what if a candidate refuses to serve and what if you elect someone unqualified, they can be easily solved through the following respectively.  
Infinite regress (which will also be good for employment) , make all government civil servants subject to the same lottery selection as those in political offices, jail or execute the person refusing to serve for draft dodging and he or she learns on the job, plus his or her mistakes make good PR (we let anyone have a chance in politics and we allow them to make mistakes on the job since they are pure in politics!).

I do not dislike anyone because of their religious believes, but I have a hard time liking this group of people because of the way they abuse the system and take advantage of every single thing they can.  As you mention, so many of them are on welfare, but they keep having children that they can't afford.  They keep building ghetto type buildings which become huge burdens on the water and sewage system in the county.  I heard that they don't get legally married, just religiously married, that way the women can claim they are unwed mothers and college more money and benefits for their children.  They don't go to our schools but they vote in blocks so they have taken over our school board, voted down the budgets, and because of their voting blocks, the have the politicians in their back pockets to get anything they want approved from zoning to whatever else will benefit them.  Not just those things, but I once had to take a taxi home from work and I needed to get change of a $20, so I asked the cab drive to stop at a market on the way home which was located in the heart of the very religious part of the town.  I went in and asked the man if he had change for a $20.  Not only did he not answer me, but he didn't even look at me.    
  
Most of the neighbors on my street are I guess you would call them Orthodox.  They are more religious that the Jewish friends I had growing up in school, but they are not as strict as the Hassidic.  They are very nice people.  They have jobs, they are educated, they take care of their homes and properties, and they are friendly and talk to us like regular neighbors would.  But you go just down the road into Monsey/New Square where the really religious Hassidic are and it looks like a rundown ghetto.  Houses/apartments not taken care of, their kids outside by themselves playing by a main road with lots of traffic, men and women around all day, apparently not at work during the week.  It just becomes frustrating because it has nothing to do with their beliefs.  I respect all faiths and religions, but I have seen this group be so dishonest and take advantage of the system at every turn, and I wonder how can a group that claims to so consumed with God and religion also be so dishonest, take complete advantage of the system, be disrespectful to people outside of their community, and be willing to drive a once beautiful suburb with excellent school districts outside of NYC and turn it into a dump because they vote down school budgets, they sit on our school board and vote everything down, they buy up large parcels of land that were originally supposed to stay undeveloped and just build low income housing that strain the local utilities, but the politicians are in their back pockets due to their strength in voting, so they get approved for whatever they want, and ultimately everything around where I grew up is crumbling, and the areas of this county that haven’t felt the impact yet will eventually because with the way their population grows so quickly and large, they will need to keep expanding living space."

  It’s a universal truth. Men run away from families & partners & when they are a family man, they’ll halfass everything & not be fully present with their kids. College boys join fraternities just to jerk off, watch porn, & rape women & what‘s the percentage of them doing that? 100%. They’ll also be running around with their cocks sticking out & being horny 24/7. The Me Too movement also serves as a message to men to stop being horny & treating women like sluts. Women are the most perfect, nurturing, caring, angelic species who could do no harm.

At the same time, I hate how Me Too sends an unspoken rule that female survivors should not find love & enjoy sexual pleasure because it’s wrong & angering the misandrists. For me, I’m more than comfortable enough to experience men, feel the love, feel my heart beating fast, cheeks flushing, & enjoy sex.

But anyway starting on September 10th 2001 2.3 trillion dollars went missing in the US and the pentagon had no idea where it went ok thats weird thats a whole lot of money to lose. 

Either 1. It was one of the biggest money blunders in the world 2. Some hacker group or someone else stole the money 3. Or the only real power who could ""lose"" 2.3 trillion dollars a powerful government such as the US. So what would this money be used for honestly I have no idea and no one does besides probably a select few because the next day 4 planes hit the US 2 in the world trade center 1 which failed to hit its target and 1 which guess what hit the pentagon exactly in the spot where you would find out where that money went.

And after that we pillaged Afghanistan which we if the attack was real we should of killed the group leaders that were responsible then left but no we stayed for 20 years and also from the channeld hate from the US public we also invaded Iraq which we all think went so well.

And also you may have already thought of something to debunk me but the US had already showed that they would be willing to attack its own people to sway public opinion. Go back to the cold war if you will and Cuba is now a communist country and Castro is now Cubas leader and we all know how many time the CIA tried killing that man. At some point the CIA made plans to ATTACK ITS OWN PEOPLE to sway the opinion of Americans to invade Cuba but the plan never happened why?

President JFK probably one of realest presidents we've ever had found out about the CIAs plan to attack its own people and he stopped it. Even with this it shows that the US government is willing to attack its own people maybe the plans for 9/11 never got found out by normal people like JFK."

Love is societally defined as when your desire to help somebody is greater than your desire to fulfill yourself. That’s the difference between loving someone and WANTING someone. But really, is your desire to nurture, help, protect and care for someone really soley for their sake? Doesn’t it all trace back to yourself? The example that people always use: after a long and tiring day at work, you are both exhausted but you decide to do those excruciating chores, like for example washing those dishes and doing the laundry just so that the person you love wouldn’t have to do them. That means you put the person over yourself right? After all, ‘love is self-sacrifice’ right? But if you think about it, isn’t it still for your own sake? It’s because YOU feel an ache in the heart when you see someone you love doing work while tired. YOU feel as though the exhaustion you experience isn’t as painful as watching this person you love experience it. No matter what, it always ties back to yourself.
The notion that love is completely selfless or that love is being willing to suffer for someone in my personal opinion isn’t accurate. I’m not saying that love isn’t actually a thing or that love and attraction are mutually interchangeable. More so, what I’m saying is that: whether you like, want, or ‘love’ somebody; in the end, you are actually loving yourself. it’s just to what degree someone’s happiness and wellbeing influences your own. 

Please change my view. 🙏🏻"
1,2023-06-24,CMV: The closing of educational subreddits during the beginning of many people's internship experiences is a far greater evil than the closure of for-profit external APIs,u/Opening-Education-88,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ic37y/cmv_the_closing_of_educational_subreddits_during/,changemyview,"For subs that are for entertainment, I fully support the idea of closing so as to oppose the API changes, as I am aware of the accessibility features that are quite important to the blind community. This is only the reason I care, as I do not have an ounce of sympathy for a for-profit company like Apollo not being able operate at the same low cost they had before, even if the app was not created for that purpose. 

However, where I get annoyed is the closure of subreddits with many informative, important threads that date years back. The *indefinite* closure of subs like r/math, r/machinelearning, r/physics, r/cscareerquestions, and many others that don't directly impact me have such small user bases in comparison to the broader reddit community, and do next to nothing to affect the company. All it does is make the lives of anyone in the subject far harder with no apparent benefit.

Just for my own experience, I have spent probably \~18 hours over 4 days going to various libraries searching for a book containing a differential geometry proof I need, and the only reference online to it is in a closed reddit thread in r/math. I have been trying to get advice on pursuing a PhD in machine learning, and many threads that would be greatly useful to me are locked behind privacy walls.

At the very least, the mods should make the subreddits read-only so that we can view older threads. At this point, I am fully in favor of reddit banning any and all mod accounts that still have these educational subreddits closed and replacing them. I am 100% certain these mods still look at old threads on the daily. Anyone who is a true lover of a niche would *never* restrict access to the largest online forum discussing them unless it would carry a massive benefit, and there is not one I can see. "
1,2023-06-25,Cmv: the government downplayed the pandemic so they wouldn't use to pay our social security benefits,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14icklr/cmv_the_government_downplayed_the_pandemic_so/,changemyview,"
The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in late 2019, has had far-reaching consequences across the globe. Governments worldwide have been grappling with the challenges posed by the virus, including the strain it places on public healthcare systems and the economic impact it has on their respective countries. Amidst these concerns, some individuals have speculated that governments may resort to nefarious tactics to mitigate the financial implications of the pandemic, specifically targeting vulnerable populations such as social security recipients.


2.1 The Social Security System:
Social security systems exist in many countries to provide financial assistance to retired, disabled, and low-income individuals. These systems are often funded through various mechanisms, including taxes and contributions from both employees and employers. As the number of social security recipients increases, the financial burden on governments likewise escalates.

2.2 The COVID-19 Pandemic:
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant strain on healthcare systems, leading to increased medical costs and a surge in demand for social security benefits. This, in turn, has raised concerns regarding the sustainability of existing social security systems.

3. Analysis:
3.1 Governmental Actions and Responses:
Critics argue that governments downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby indirectly influencing the health and mortality rates of vulnerable populations. They point to instances where early warnings from healthcare professionals and scientists were allegedly ignored or downplayed, leading to delayed implementation of effective preventive measures.

3.2 Policy Decisions:
Governments faced with the economic repercussions of the pandemic may be tempted to consider cost-saving measures, including reducing social security benefits or tightening eligibility criteria. Critics argue that intentionally downplaying the pandemic's severity could serve as a justification for such policies, as it would create a narrative suggesting that the impact of the virus was not significant enough to warrant additional financial support.

3.3 Motives:
Proponents of this theory suggest that the primary motive behind downplaying the pandemic's severity is financial. By suppressing the true extent of the crisis, governments may seek to avoid the financial burden of providing additional social security benefits and healthcare services to ailing citizens. This would help offset the economic strain caused by the pandemic.

4. Counterarguments:
4.1 Public Health Crisis Management:
Governments' actions during public health crises are complex, and their decisions often involve weighing various factors such as economic stability, public health, and societal well-being. Critics argue that downplaying the pandemic's severity may be a result of a misguided attempt to prevent panic or maintain social stability, rather than a deliberate effort to cause harm.

4.2 Lack of Concrete Evidence:
It is important to note that this theory is speculative and lacks concrete evidence to support its claims. Proving such a theory requires a comprehensive investigation into governmental decision-making processes, access to confidential information, and in-depth analysis of policy documents, which is beyond the scope of this theory alone.

5. Conclusion:
The theory suggesting that the government downplayed the COVID-19 pandemic to cause the deaths of social security recipients is a controversial hypothesis that warrants further examination. While concerns about the financial implications of the pandemic on social security systems are valid, establishing a direct link between intentional downplaying and increased mortality rates among vulnerable populations requires more substantial evidence. It is crucial to approach such theories with skepticism, acknowledging that public health crisis management is a multifaceted process involving numerous factors that extend"

The biggest drop was found among younger people aged 18 to 22.  
  
New research indicates that the average intelligence quotient (IQ) in the US has declined for the first time in nearly 100 years. But does this mean that the population of the US is actually getting dumber?  
  
Researchers at Northwestern University and the University of Oregon looked at the results of online IQ tests taken by 394,378 adults in the US from 2006 to 2018.  
  
The team was looking to see whether they could find evidence of the Flynn effect, the idea that the IQ of a population generally appears to increase each generation. As the study authors noted: IQ scores have “substantially increased since 1932 and through the 20th century, with differences ranging from 3.0 to 5.0 IQ points”.  
  
Instead, however, they found the opposite. Overall, the results suggest IQ points had declined over the study period, although the researchers didn't state exactly how many IQ points have dropped.  
  
Declines were seen widely across the board regardless of age and gender, but the steepest slump was found among people with lower levels of education and younger participants aged 18 to 22."
1,2023-06-25,Cmv: Summer is inherently better to winter,u/InvestmentFree1272,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ieewm/cmv_summer_is_inherently_better_to_winter/,changemyview,"Winter is undoubtedly the worst season to exist and summer the best. The sun setting at 3pm makes everyone depressed, and your brain immediately feels lazy once it gets dark, whereas the still light at 9pm summer days are unmatched and joyful. Not having to wear layers and just being able to leave the house with shorts and a t-shirt is so much superior to “big sweaters” and “cute boots”. Summer food is also just so fresh and delightful, delicious fruits, barbecues, nice salads and cold drinks/desserts. Winter food isn’t bad but it’s heavy and takes long to prepare. In general I feel like everyone is happier in the summer: longer days, going out with friends, having picnics, going swimming…the activities are endless. 

Winter on the other hand sucks. The days are short; you freeze inside your house half the time because having the heating on all day is too expensive; going outside is not enjoyable because you just become ambushed by a cold wind that makes you freeze to death, and you have the flu/cold season. The whole argument of “you can always wear more layers but you cannot strip down in the heat” is also terrible. I’ve never felt comfortable warmth in the gripping winter cold, and I certainly don’t enjoy wearing 20 layers either way. It’s much nicer to just have a fan on and wear some light fabrics. Also the whole argument of “So YoU dOnt liVe iN arIzonA I GuesS”…IT DOESNT APPLY TO YOU IF YOU ARE IN ARIZONA. Can you guys not see that you are the exception, because you don’t actually experience winter? Your seasons are just summer and summer XL, so stop talking about “winter” being great; your winter is just summer."

I also believe that a 24 hour system is far superior to the AM PM system, so that isn't going to change my view. I also do not think changing the system this way now makes sense, as it would probably take too much effort.

What made me make this post is a viral Twitter image that made fun of people for not knowing which of four options are closest to midnight: 11:55 AM, 12:06 AM, 11:50 AM, 12:03 AM. The correct answer is D, but it confused a lot of people, and I can fully understand why.

My arguement for why it would make more sense to switch the two is that currently the morning times go: 12 1 2 3... 9, 10, 11. And then it switches to evening and once again starts with 12 and then 1. It would make a lot more sense to have it be 1 AM - 12 AM and then 1 PM - 12 PM. The only reasonable  arguement I can see against this is that 12:30 PM would be in the next day so to speak, so it would make more sense to call ot AM. But then call it 0:30 AM to avoid the confusion of starting over. Is this just some ancient holdover from a numbering system that didn't have 0?"

5,2023-06-25,CMV: Museums should display reproductions instead of original art works and artefacts,u/phileconomicus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ii24m/cmv_museums_should_display_reproductions_instead/,changemyview,"This CMV is inspired by an exhibition of Hieronymus Bosch paintings I went to. The organisers had arranged copies of all his famous works, including ones too delicate to travel or held by institutions that would never have loaned out the originals. The exhibition was free, and because the copies only cost a few thousand Euros each, they didn't have to be protected by glass and velvet ropes: ordinary visitors were able to get close, and even open and close the triptychs.

I think this should be the model for all museums

1. There is no added value to displaying an original artefact: Almost no visitors can tell the difference between a good quality copy and the original, and certainly not under glass from 4 feet away (as required for security).
2. There is added value to displaying reproductions: Exhibitions are cheaper and can happen in lots of places at the same time, so more people can experience these beautiful artefacts (and also poorer people and those who live further from Global North metropoles). Reproductions are also more robust and so people can experience them in a more normal way (normal lighting, low security, a less ritualised/pretentious experience, etc)
3. Many art works and other artefacts have a role in the national stories of multiple modern societies. This creates bitter zero-sum justice disputes about where the artefacts belong. But if we drop the fetishisation of authenticity, we can at least share the experience of these artefacts between all the societies that claim an interest in them. (I know that won't end the arguments, but it might draw some of the poison)
4. The original artefacts do of course have added value for expert study. But this does not require them to be publicly displayed, and in fact at the moment such display competes with their availability for study.

Putting this all together: Museums should see their responsibility as 1) collaborating in the creation and display of high quality reproductions of their holdings so as many people as possible around the world can experience them and 2) making their original holdings as available as possible to expert study (which might include placing them in more appropriate spaces, such as universities). \[I haven't thought too hard about the financial sustainability of this new ethic, but licensing fees seem an obvious route\]

**EDIT:** u/No-Produce-334 **has persuaded me that most current museum goers would not be interested enough in reproductions to visit. I still think that my proposal would improve access to the experience of viewing beautiful and interesting artefacts - which is what museums should be for. But any move towards this should be much more incremental than I originally envisaged and include much more work on re-educating museum visitors and reaching out to non-traditional museum goers. (Note: there are museums full of reproductions, such as photography museums, so the model can work)**

**EDIT 2:** u/spastikatenpraedikat **has persuaded me that perfect copies cannot be made, and even non-experts would experience something different from the original. This weakens my CMV but does not completely change my mind. I think of this via the metaphor of reading a novel in translation. Yes, it is not the same as reading the original. But it can nevertheless be a valuable and real experience of art, and, moreover, making a novel available in translation allows it to reach many many more people who don't have the time to learn the original language. Likewise, my proposal may not be able to give people quite the same experience as viewing the original (as I first claimed), but it can still provide enormous value to many more people. At the least, museums with in demand assets should make them available for copying to display elsewhere even while (following** u/spastikatenpraedikat's **successful challenge) they continue to display the originals as much as possible.**"

Working out has so many health benefits, and not doing it has many health risks. And I don't think workint out is that hard. Even if you have never worked out, you can ease into it. Just start by going on some walks, and after some while you can start running. If you don't have any sidewalks for that you can do some jumping jacks or body weight squats. In my opinion, anyone that is not sick or disabled can work out. Everyone has time for it. It is just a question of motivation and if you don't have the motivation to do something that massively benefits you, I think that it says something about your character in general, and not just that you don't work out."

Honestly, I don’t think that this should be a debate. It is very clearly easier for women than it is for men, however this is usually met with malice and accusations of sexism when it’s just an acknowledgment of reality.

When we’re talking about dating dynamics, women are typically the pursued while men are the pursuers. This already shifts the balance in favor of women. This is because women are able to play a passive role which is inherently less work. They just have to act as a filter. They are also not expected to organize dates, pay on dates, or any other planning aspect.

But let’s rewind before you get to that point, simply finding someone interested in you is significantly harder as a man compared to women. People often say men are more shallow, but I don’t think this is as true. Men have such a wide range of what we consider to be attractive that I genuinely belive that every woman is physically attractive to at least some group of men. The same can’t be said for the inverse. Only a certain caliber of men are deemed physically attractive for women. This of why men are encouraged to make lots of money in order to find some way to attract women.

This means that the sheer volume options women have at a given time vastly outnumber the options men have. This clearly makes it easier. That is, unless you believe that women are just better than men."

Moving to a base 12 system for everything would certainly be challenging for the first generation to adopt it, and it’s not something that can be done likely it will be an expensive change and complicated as well but I think it’s worth doing., Future, generations will pick it up straight away, just like those people who moved from shillings to  pound had difficulty calculating what their money was worth, under, the new system, but subsequent generations can’t remember a time when  The base 10 didn’t exist.
I can see why, Base, 10 was, used, in the past, we have 10 fingers and we find it easy to calculate based on that but I think the ancient Sumerians had it right when they used The base 60 system for their calculations and split the day into 12 is a lot more divisible than 10."

Wireless connections cause more latency, even if the console is placed as close as possible to the router/access point, and it does not appear to be ever a solvable problem in long term. Some games do mark players on wireless connections as such and may try to avoid them from being matched with players on wired connections.

Given wireless connections are looked down among fighting game players, fighting games should therefore do more than distinguish wireless players and require wired connection entirely to play multiplayer. This shall be done by verifying the connection type the player is using to make their internet connection (consoles have a ""current network status"" screen that can determine if they are connected to the Internet using a wired or wireless connections - among other things - after all) and completely block access to online play if they are not on a wired connection."
1,2023-06-25,CMV: Pets that are fully in a bag or backpack (not even a head sticking out the top) should be allowed to go wherever a service dog can go.,u/I_am_bad_atusernames,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14impcm/cmv_pets_that_are_fully_in_a_bag_or_backpack_not/,changemyview,"First I would like to clarify that I’m not saying people should put animals in their school backpacks. There are specific pet backpacks that have mesh and/or little holes for the animal to breathe as well as being designed specifically for pets. 

The reasons I bring up service dogs specifically (that pets in bags should be able to go wherever a service dog can go) are:

1: If I said pets should be able to go everywhere, I felt like someone would comment something like “What about rollercoasters?” Or somewhere else that I obviously didn’t mean.

2: This gets rid of the allergies argument. Because if someone says they’re allergic to the dog that’s fully inside of a backpack (that won’t even touch them at all), then surely they’re more allergic to the service dog that’s walking nearby, smelling everything, touching everything, out in the open. If they have an allergic reaction to any animal, it will be the dog that’s out in the open. 

Now, on to my reasons why it should be allowed to take a pet inside of a bag to places:
1. I don’t want people to leave their pet in a hot car. My brother had to go to the ER when he was 3 because he was left in a hot car for half an hour. It’s very serious. I know you all are thinking “don’t leave your pet in a hot car then.” I wouldn’t. But someone else would. This rule change would quite literally save lives.

2. If they’re in a bag then their hair/germs won’t go everywhere.

3. People (including me) love their pets and wish they could take them out more often.

4. It doesn’t hurt anyone. And if it does, then service dogs are hurting those people a lot worse. 

5. If someone brings up the pet being loud, then I argue back that babies are louder. Also a few weeks ago a toddler was crying very loudly and I showed him my cat in my cat backpack and that made him stop screaming. And like screaming kids, if your pet is being loud then you should do the right thing and take them outside to not disturb those around you.

6. I have diagnosed PTSD and my cat is the only thing that makes me feel better. I’m sure other people can relate to having their pet make them feel better. Side story: I have cameras all throughout my apartment and whenever I have panic attacks my cat rubs against me or gets in my lap and tries to get my attention.

7. If screaming babies can be somewhere why can’t a pet inside of a backpack? 

Thank y’all for reading all of this, I look forward to seeing y’all’s responses :)"

 It requires that the woman is seen as an object, as means to an end — rather than as a human. While this dehumanization is unpleasant in itself, more notably it also results in violence against women. Sex work is not empowering, if someone wants to do that, that is completely fine but do not say it is empowering.  

What is empowering is a leader, someone who uses their mind instead of their body and challenge rules, questions traditions that don’t allow women the opportunity to speak their minds, own their ideas, and create their own rules. She makes decisions based on her intuition and core values – not on what society thinks she should do. She takes risks because she knows they are necessary for personal and professional fulfillment and growth. "
25,2023-06-25,CMV: Trump is a Proto-Fascist and is laying the groundwork for real Fascism to take hold in the United States.,u/Serious-Trade-4405,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ioz6f/cmv_trump_is_a_protofascist_and_is_laying_the/,changemyview,"  
Disclaimer: Try to stick with me in the first few paragraphs, as they are important to understanding the rest of the post. However if you find yourself short on time you can skip to the 6th paragraph.   
Proto-Fascism is essentialy what lays the groundwork, and prepares for real Fascism to be able to take control in a country. According to the Pax Britannica definition: 

  
\> “protofascism, a political movement that **predates and usually contributes to the emergence of fascism** in a given country, sometimes by evolving into a fascist movement itself. The term protofascism is also used in a slightly more general sense to refer to any political movement whose activities **make the emergence of fascism more likely**. By definition, protofascist movements display some of the common characteristics of fascism—such as the scapegoating of ethnic or religious minorities, the glorification of violence, and the promotion of the Führerprinzip (“leadership principle”), the belief that the party and the state should have a single leader with absolute power—but usually do not share its radicalism or totalitarian ambitions.”

  
So, **political movements or takeovers that lay the groundwork for an actual Fascist takeover.** The Luddendorf dictatorship during WWI can be called Proto-Fascist, even though it had no particular political beliefs or ideas, but because it prepared the country for an one-man dictatorship (the Nazi Third Reich) which had no constitutional bounds and in which the leader could do mostly what he wanted, although there is some nuance to this in Luddendorf’s case. 

  
Another example is Gabriele D'Annunzio, who was a famous poet before WWI, but during it became a national Italian Hero by fighting in the Italian army. He would eventually start propogating Ultranationalist ideas and other political ideas that in hindsight can generally be the described as an inspiration for Fascism, and some of them outright Fascist. When Italy was denied most of the territory it was promised by the Entente in the WWI treaty of Versailles, he started his own state on Italian soil as an angry response. The state had a lot of the same characteristics that Mussolini’s Italy would have, and thus showed an example for Mussolini to follow, not only in the way D’Annunzio ruled his Proto-Fascist state but also in the way he seized power there. The state of D’Annunzio was eventually destroyed by Italy, **but his ideas, his coup, and the way in which he governed all laid the groundwork for Mussolini coming to power during the 20’s.**

  
As we have seen, Proto-Fascism lays the groundwork for real Fascism. But now comes the most important point thus far; most Proto-Fascism is not consciously done by the Proto-Fascist to support actual Fascism coming to power. This will be important later.

  
Which brings us to Trump. What defines Fascism, according to Ken Griffith, the most important living expert on Fascism, and seperates it from normal authoritarian ideologies, is Palangenetic Ultranationalism: **the idea that the nation was once great, has tragically ‘fallen’, but can be ‘made great again’ by nationalism and sacrifice**. It also has a ‘strong man’ and the idea of a Fuehrer, a strong leader. And all of this can be used pretty well to describe Trump. MAGA is basically the perfect example of Palangenetic Ultranationalism. Heck, he even staged a coup to take power from the state. Why is Trump a Proto-Fascist and not an actual Fascist?   
Well dear reader, because Trump is Fascist **in rhetoric only**. He may say he ‘wants to make America great again’ but none of his policies are specifically oriented towards consolidating power in his hands or bringing about Fascism. Externally he may look like a Fascist by his actions and rhetoric, but more importantly, **internally** he hasn’t done anything in particular to achieve enough things that he would need to make America a Fascist state (yet). You may point to the January 6th insurrection as counter-evidence, yet **it proves my point perfectly**. He started it but did not see it through to the end, because he didn’t care or have the competency to do so. He doesn’t care about achieving a Fascist state or ‘making America great again’, because in the end, **Donald J. Trump doesn’t care about anything, or believe anything, except for enriching himself**. **And the same goes for Fascism**. He doesn’t care about achieving Fascism, but only adopts Fascist rhetoric to serve his own needs. 

  
Which brings me to my final point: Trump is not an actual Fascist, but a Proto-Fascist, through his self-serving needs and populism, **he is showing real Fascists that Fascism is achievable in America**. His rhetoric is showing how easily voters can be swayed, and that there are indeed voters that will support such rhetoric if the person propagating it is charismatic enough, furthermore he is showing that the Republican party can easily be turned into a Fascist apparatus, and indeed his most important and lasting achievement might just be the Trumpization (and thus Fascistization) of the GOP, which will allow any future Fascist rhetoric or candidate to be more successful. And last, he has shown future Fascists that a coup is possible and can succed, if led by more competent people than he himself. 

  
However, despite all this it is not inevitable that America will become a Fascist state, in fact it is right now not very likely, as America is still doing well on most fronts. If more rational and truer Republican candidates win out, everything that has thus far happened can be turned back. If Trump wins the next primary, or even presidency, **he will continue the process that he himself seems not to be aware of; increasing the likelyhood of Fascism taking hold in America.**

Driving should be viewed as a way to get from Point A to Point B only. I think cars should not have music/other ""fun"" features because it encourages people to view cars as toys/driving as an activity which are problematic.

I mean I'm about to put the post up that I put on r/lgbt and got perma banned for and apparently this was disrespectful but idk?

So im bi and Christian and I just wanted to get that out the way before I start. Now most of you know there are wild people that say they are part of our community and aren't like dream sexuals and those people that tried to give pedophiles a sexuality but those are small amounts of people a fringe. 

Like some things I've seen about people in our community like drag queens half naked dancing in front of kids and clips I've seen on instagram where there was a pride parade and there were a large amount of people in there chanting were here were queer were coming for your children. Now idk why any normal person would ever chant that and especially a pride parade our people shouldn't be saying these things because it looks bad on all of us.

Another clip I found was a pastor trying to baptize a man and the closest water source to do so was close to a pride parade and honestly when I watched this clip these men were harassed basically for there faith and its not like they antagonized the pride parade or anything they were very civil. I know some people in this community have a mixed feeling about religion because probably when you came out God's word was used to hate you and it was also done to me aswell so I should know. We can't hate these people just off of there religion people may of used religion to hate us but its not fair of us to hate back especially those who don't deserve it like the pastor baptizing a man.

Also another clip I saw was there was some lgbtq+ plus celebration at the white house the other day and they invited a bunny of famous people and meaningful people from the lgbtq+ community to attend the white house. Throughout it there was one woman who decided to go topless at the Whitehouse and idc if you think that woman's nipples and mens nipples are the same and shouldn't be shown but no matter what nipples you have you don't go topless at such a important event such as the white house 

Another thing from me and this may be my personal opinion and ill probably stop writing after this but what your kinks are and what you do in bed shouldn't be at pride, pride is for showing who you are and demanding equality for your people not sexual kinks.

Thats practically all on my rant personally we all need to do better to represent you community better.

Imagine if next to each candidate's FOR box there was also an AGAINST box... Each voter gets to check one for and one against, their choice.  No candidate who receives above a certain threshold of against votes could take office. Voila! 

This would allow third party and cross ticket and moderate candidates an excellent chance. 

PS: Before you say such a change is impossible, all we have to do is decide that instead of fighting amongst ourselves (like the 1% want us to) we are ALL done having a government that doesn't truly represent us.

For context, I am a 2002 kid. I grew up with a lot of stuff, ranging from the Backyardigans, Blues Clues, Scooby Doo, to Ben 10 and Phineas and Ferb, the list goes on and on. There's Spongebob, The Simpsons, Kids Next Door, Avatar The Last Airbender, Regular Show, Adventure Time, you name it.

When I see the shows targeted towards kids and teens nowadays I can't say then even hold a light to what I grew up with. If I ever have children and let them watch television, there's a good chance it will be all these shows I've listed, and not the more modern stuff.

Am I right at all here, or is it pure nostalgia? Has the quality of children's television dropped over the years? And if so, why?

I don't see why it's actually bad. When we love or like people we do it because of a variety of characteristics they have. It's good to understand what you value in a person, be it their sexuality, them being black, trans, submissive, thin, fat, disabled, red haired, or wearing latex.

The reason why people tend to dislike it is because they make up hypotheticals that people don't say- e.g. they say it's bad to want submissive people because that means you believe they exist for your boner, or that you will harass or attack them for not having sex with you.

Most people have strong fetishes or desires, and they have fantasies about these things that don't respect people's feelings or desires. That doesn't mean that in real life they say rude things to people or degrade them. People are wrongly blaming fetishes and objectification for people being assholes. 

To CMV, show that objectification does lead to abuse or cruelty, more than not objectifying, or that not objectifying people stops you abusing them, or something like that. Arguing about the definition of objectification and how it means to degrade people is unlikely to change my view."

It forces me to believe that somehow 99% of reddit has never been subjected to an actual homeless problem. I live in Seattle and would support *massive* increases in hostile architecture. I just don't understand what is so batshit crazy about the city making sure places are used for their intended purposes. 

Why would people and children taking the bus/subway have to be subjected to swaths of homeless druggies surrounded by trash, filth, syringes, and literal shit. Why shouldn't the benches in the park be for people who actually want to enjoy the park? 

Hearing reddit discuss politics or the ukraine war makes you realize that they have this marvel-esque worldview of a grade schooler. So in their minds homeless people are these kind, scared, helpless, innocent puppies. But in reality they are often extremely violent, unpredictable, and will harass women and children without thinking twice (or once). I still believe they need proper help and a place to stay, but that place shouldn't be someone's daily commute.

Obviously I know being homeless is hard. But many of them still choose to be homeless because they want access to drugs. I think anything that makes being homeless even less viable would actually push them to get the help they really need. A bus stop bench is not what they need."

I’ve noticed however this is no longer enough and many people think that equity is the way to go and that we shouldn’t only have equal opportunities but also we should have equal outcomes and this is not fair or a good thing to implement in society. 
    Everyone should have the same opportunities available if they chose to work hard and take all the necessary steps to achieve the same results but guaranteeing the same outcome or results for all is not only not fair but is counter productive and shouldn’t be the case. If someone doesn’t work as hard or makes poor decisions how is it fair that they achieve the same outcome as someone who worked very hard and made great choices? It’s important to understand the difference between the two concepts and make sure that we value equality and fairness rather than to strive for equity.

i am not saying there will be a civil war. the dynamics are vastly different than they were during that period. but the divide is so wide, the hatred so inflamed, that some measure of violence grows increasingly likely. how much of a divide? well, here are the differences between the two sides: 

Red State Philosophy:

- children should not be taught a proper accounting of history. literature that reflects the diverse world we live in should be banned from school curriculums. literature that has any reference to lgbt themes, or features an lgbt character, should also be banned. 

- women do not deserve equal rights. their place is in the home. women have no right to make decisions about their healthcare. women who try to exercise bodily autonomy when it comes to their reproductive healthcare should be treated as murderers and prosecuted accordingly.

-  gays should not be protected from discrimination. gays should not have a right to get married. businesses should have the right to deny gays service. 

- unions should be banned. workers who try to advocate for safer work conditions should be fired. workers injured on the job due to unsafe conditions should not be able to sue. workers do not have a right to a livable wage. child labor should be legal.  i should add that democrats haven’t exactly been that great when it comes to unions, most recently evidenced by how biden handled the railroad union, though they are clearly far preferable. 

- police should be militarized. black people should not feel safe when interacting with police. this is another area in which i can find fault with democrats. again, they are obviously far better in holding police accountable, but the police are still overwhelmingly racist in even the bluest of states. this, of course, speaks to how that profession tends to attract a conservative element. 

Blue State Philosophy:

- democrats aren’t perfect where workers are concerned, but we wouldn’t have made strides in raising the minimum wage without the efforts of the dems/left. workers should have a right to sue employers whose negligence leads to their injury. employers should not be able to violate child labor laws. 

- women should have the right to abortion. women deserve to be free of government intrusion where their healthcare choices are concerned. women deserve to be paid at the same rate as their male counterparts. women should not be subject to harassment at the workplace. 

- children should be taught a rich and diverse curriculum that introduces them to the world in which they live and strengthens their critical thinking skills. their studies, comprising all disciplines, should not be subject to any form of censorship driven by bigotry and an aversion to historical fact.

- the gay community deserves to be treated fairly. discrimination based on sexual orientation is wrong and should be forbidden at all levels in our society. gay marriage is a right. businesses should not have a right to deny service to gay customers. 

- policing in america has become too militarized, turning this country into a police state, the powers of which disproportionately targeting the black community. criminal justice reform that overhauls the institution of policing in america and focuses on rehabilitation rather than retribution should be the focus of law in this country. 

so, there are other points i could include, but this is long enough. my view is that the red state philosophy is wholly incompatible with the blue state philosophy, and the two sides are at an impasse, a confrontation that stands to plunge our nation into a crisis in the near future. 

i see no way that this division can continue without a national divorce."

They eventually traumatize other people and the cycle just goes on.

To be clear, I do believe that people can improve in terms of skills-- someone can learn how to play chess or do calculus, for instance. But I don't think people are capable of any form of moral improvement, because humanity is inherently an abusive species."

i just don't know how some people can talk to each other for so long and not run out of stuff to say or talk about

its always me talking more, sending more messages, i always send long messages and still have nothing to say, maybe im doing this to get others to reply so i won't feel bad about myself or get ignored?

mostly its like this
me ""How is it going?"" 
her ""Good, wbu"" 
me""pretty good"" 
her""Good""
me"" what are your hobbies"" 
her""names them"" 
me""that's cool"" 

or i ask ""how is it going "" or ""what makes you happy "" or ""what do you love about yourself "" or i ask ""where you from"" or ""wassup"" or ""who's your favorite artist"" and they name it and i have nothing to say afterwards

maybe because im so bad at conversations i no longer like to even have them, maybe that's why im so quiet most of the time.

Fission is when you take a big atom like U-235 and split it, releasing a large amount of energy. Fusion is the future of energy, using the process inside the sun to create energy. It takes deuterium and tritium and fuses them using tremendous amounts of heat and pressure, but also generates an even bigger amount of energy. Fusion is incredibly safe because if something were to go wrong, then fusion just stops happening and the reaction stops as well. However, people think that nuclear fission (I'll refer to fission as nuclear energy because fusion is still a thing in the near future) is unsafe because of the media exaggerating the dangers of nuclear energy. Yes, there was Chernobyl and Fukushima, but one was human error, and the other was a natural disaster, and also a horrible placement for a power plant. Nuclear reactors don't just randomly go boom. They are the way to short-term future problems like climate change and global warming. Nuclear energy is safer than gas, for example, with 2.82 deaths/terawatt-hour, and nuclear energy has a deaths/terawatt-hour ratio of... What do you think? 2? No. 1? No. 0.1? Not that either. Nuclear power has a deaths/terawatt-hour ratio of 0.03. If you are scared of radiation, then don't be. Nuclear waste isn't some green goo you see in cartoons. Nuclear waste is mainly comprised of gloves, shoe covers, mops, tools, etc. Even medium or high-level nuclear waste is melted and put into ceramic/glass and placed into big concrete cylinders where it can't harm anyone, or the waste is outright buried underground, and I don't think that it's commonplace for people to dig under a nuclear power plant, so waste isn't a problem. About radiation, did you know that a coal power plant releases 10 times more radiation for the same amount of power as an entire nuclear power plant? Also for 1 kg of Uranium used in a nuclear power plant, a coal power plant needs to use 2,500,000 kg of coal to make the same amount of power. Nuclear doesn't give that much radiation, emits zero greenhouse gases, and all the waste is safe. Why don't we make nuclear power plants everywhere? Other than the cost, nuclear energy is highly stigmatized as unsafe and unreliable, but it's actually one of, if not the best energy source. That's just for fission. Fusion is even better. It can't go boom, and it produces a significant amount of power. Change my view."

These are the trifecta of dating advice that ever guy (I can’t speak for women) receives. This advice is only helpful if you are some neckbeard basement dwelling incel. Not because it’s not helpful but it’s the bare minimum. It is what everyone already does in order to be a functioning human in society.

Itd be like asking someone for dating advice and telling them to get a drivers license, helpful but it’s already done by normal people.

I think that the people that do have success in dating do because they’re lucky. Either they won the genetic lottery and are physically attractive, tall, white, in shape, good facial features, or they were in the right place at the right time. As a result both of these groups think they have the secret sauce to dating success and deliver whatever they just happened to be doing. 

My older brother is much more physically attractive than me and met his girlfriend at the gym. His suggestion to me? Talk to women at the gym, which clearly do most people who live in reality is horrible advice.

Every fat person already knows how bad fat is for their body.,u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14jlcfa/cmv_the_current_obesity_crisis_has_nothing_to_do/,changemyview,"Whenever the obesity crisis is brought up, there are scads of people who will argue for some sort of public-awareness campaign. *If we just tell fat people that obesity leads to heart disease, diabetes, cancer, strokes, joint damage, high blood pressure, etc., then surely this will get them to exercise and eat better -* so goes the thinking.

I would argue that it's nothing of the sort. We've tried that for 50 years; it hasn't done a thing. The obesity crisis is as severe as ever. By this point, such PSAs have been hammered for decades. Everyone - fat or thin - **knows** what obesity does to the body, and that it isn't good. Trying to tell fat people that being fat is unhealthy is like telling a smoker that smoking causes lung cancer - every smoker **knows** that.

The reason people are fat is, for the most part, because losing fat is incredibly difficult. The concept is *simple* \- exercise a lot, and eat fewer calories. But if quitting a behavior were as easy as telling people why that behavior were bad, we'd have no drug addicts today. We'd have no smokers, we'd have no alcoholics, we'd have no gambling addicts, we'd have literally no bad behavior in society today. 

I'm not saying we should stop public-awareness campaigns, but I am saying we should acknowledge that they're generally pretty futile. If telling people about the health risks of obesity would get fat people to lose weight, we'd be a thin nation already today. 

Granted, I don't know what *would* reverse our obesity crisis, short of some sort of near-magical weight-loss drug. But whatever the problem with obesity may be, it sure isn't because of ignorance or lack of information. Everyone **knows** how bad obesity is for health.

29,2023-06-26,CMV: Popular anime is unwatchable,u/Funboxtha3rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14jlxeb/cmv_popular_anime_is_unwatchable/,changemyview,"I say this as someone who has at least attempted to consume popular anime.  I have watched at least 300 full episodes of various anime, so it cannot be said that I didn't at least try.  Genuinely, I want to enjoy it as much as other people do, but I simply cannot.  Everyone tells me that I should watch One Piece or JoJo, or but I absolutely cannot last more than a few episodes.  Here are my reasons:

\- **(1)** Nearly all anime I've watched violates the rule of ""show, don't tell"".  Ex:  through all of Naruto, Naruto screams about how Sasuke is his best friend, but there's nothing shown that substantiates it.  Sure, you can say something over and over, but that doesn't mean I believe it.

\- **(2)** Pacing.  Sorry.  10+ episode long fight scenes are unwatchable.  Get to the fucking point.  Same thing with flashbacks.  Holy fucking shit I do not need 30% of an episode to be a flashback to something that happened *last episode*.  I also do not need to see the same flashback 10+ times in one story arc.  There are 30+ episode story arcs in these shows that could be condensed into 10 episodes *max* if you remove all of the bullshit.

\- **(3)** This goes along with 1 and 2.  Fight Narrators, almost always played by one of the smart side characters watching from the sidelines.  They also seem to exist in order to ""explain away"" inconsistencies that arise in power levels and logic, which leads me to:

\-**(4)** Power creep.  I know this is used to continuously raise the stakes, but almost every single action anime I've seen very quickly devolves into the characters either flying, using nondescript energy blasts, or turning into kaiju esque god forms.  This is usually so far removed from the original concept that everything stops having any meaning at all.

\-**(5)** Talk no jutsu.  Nope.  Hate this trope simply because of the unrealistic situations its used in.  The devastation caused by some of these villains that get ""forgiven"" by the main character is ludicrous.  Could you imagine just talking it out with Hitler and then becoming pals with him?  This trope could be cool if used sparingly, and in the right places, but it's absolutely over used.

\-**(6)** The tone is usually inconsistent, all over the place, and completely jarring.  A serious, touching scene being interrupted by the character's head turning giant and cartoon tears flowing out of his face kills all engagement I have with a plot.

\-**(7)** Filler plots.  This is the biggest sin.  Knowing that embarrassingly large chunks of a show are essentially non-canon and hold zero weight makes me want to *never* watch it.  Let me make it clear that I'm not against low stake, lighthearted character arcs that serve as a respite in between high stakes, high stress arcs.  They allow characters to process what has happened, and begin to move forward towards the next part of the plot.  What I hate are entire story arcs that are literally nothing.  They don't change the characters.  They usually take place in far away, nondescript locations that will never be referenced again.  The events of these arcs are never mentioned again.

In many of these cases, I completely understand *why* they are the way they are.  These are usually low budget animation studios making shows for *children* to view on a *weekly basis*.  I completely get that.  The problem is that I'm an Elder Gen Z, and everybody in my social group fucking loves this shit.  I'm the odd one out.  I genuinely wish I could engage with anime on the level that people around me do if only to be able to ""join in on the fun"".  

Some of them have even told me ""just give it until the X arc and you'll be hooked.""  So I go and look it up and it's like 150+ episodes in.  If I have to put in over 40 full hours of my free time into something *before* I start to enjoy it,  it just isn't worth it.

It also doesn't help that every single time I talk to someone about my hangups, and how I wish I could enjoy it, they try to tell me how their favorite anime is the good one and isn't like that.  It always is.

It's not that I don't like the concept of some of these shows.  I genuinely dig the ideas.  It's the presentation.  Please change my view so I'm not the snobby contrarian guy anymore."

Another example would to have shot Derek Chauvin (after the good cop told him to get off of George  Floyd if he didn't get off he would be shot for actively trying to kill someone, just like if I tried to kill a cop another cop would kill me).

Slavs have been conquered many times by Asians and other groups, they cant defend their own land. None of these people seem ""white"" to me because they dont have traits of Germanic people.

4,2023-06-26,Cmv: There is danger in creating more and more labels for gender identities,u/quantumSpammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14johq4/cmv_there_is_danger_in_creating_more_and_more/,changemyview,"I love how our culture more and more embraces people expressing themselves and find their true sexuality, gender, identity etc. I’m of the firm believe that there is no black and white sides to anything. Everything’s on a spectrum. And everyone on any spectrum deserves equal rights and representation. On the basis of this premise, I have an issue with the influx of labels to describe one’s gender identity. And it’s only this view that I’m open to change. Not the views expressed up until now.

For centuries gender was coded as male or female. But now people like to break out of those boxes and the traits/looks/attributes associated with it because they perceive them to be too narrow for how they feel/want to express themselves. They created the nonbinary category. Which I take as a third box that contains everything that is not traditionally coded male/female or mixes traditionally male/female coded traits. 

Here comes my controversial view: In doing so they make the male and female boxes even narrower. Can’t females be butch, androgynous now? Am I nonbinary now if I don’t want to play with barbies as a child? Is something wrong with my womanhood if I don’t identify with the things society/advertising/social media tells me about being a woman? I am exaggerating a bit but celebrities like Emma Corrin, Demi Lovato or Bella Ramsey don’t identify as women and I don’t get it.

What I would love is for the boxes to get wider and bigger. A man can be effeminate/soft/wear make up and still be a man. A woman doesn’t need to have a uterus/wear makeup/like the color pink. For trans people the male female boxes have apparently worked and I gladly welcome my trans girls to my woman box. So why do we need to make smaller and smaller boxes? I say: we don’t. I think social media this increased creates gender dysphoria with their filters, beauty standards etc. And creating new labels is not the solution but the remedy of a symptom."

1,2023-06-26,CMV: Smoking in England should be made illegal.,u/JP869,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14jq1i0/cmv_smoking_in_england_should_be_made_illegal/,changemyview,"I believe that smoking should be made illegal in England. I refine my perspective to England because it's where I live, it's a place I understand (moreso than other countries) and I feel as though my below arguments are applicable in England. If these arguments also apply elsewhere, then I think smoking ought to be banned there too. 

Smoking conveys no benefit, besides a mild high that some people don't even enjoy. This benefit does not outweigh the downsides, it doesn't even come close. 

My main argument is that smoking substantially worsens health, and is directly associated with a multitude of health problems, many of which are deadly. This not only affects the smokers, but also, through second hand smoke, affects the health directly of non-smokers. This, in my view, is effectively an assault. More indirectly, these negative health outcomes affect everyone, in that it hugely burdens our health services, which are already backed up, in many cases by years, due to wait times. This contribution is significant, not slight. In England, hospital wait times are astronomical.

Some may argue that a benefit is that the government taxes cigarettes, and that this money is so substantial that it benefits the public to have them legal. Study after study shows that we spend WAY more dealing with the health problems directly caused my smoking and smokers than the Govt makes from taxing cigs. Then, you should consider that the Govt wastes our tax money on stupid shite anyway. 

Then there's the other, lesser but still significant reasons to ban smoking. 
1) It's stinky and disgusting. Walking through a cloud of smoke that's spent time inside a stranger's mouth is gross. It smells, and smokers smell too. 
2) Pollution. Cigarettes litter our streets, our parks, everywhere. 
3) It's arguably a gateway drug. People that smoke are way more likely to use other recreational drugs. I'm not really against the use of rec drugs, because I think they're less detrimental to non-users than smoking, but I still see this as a powerful point. 
4) Cost - we are going through a period where people can barely afford food. A pack of cigs is stupidly expensive and they are more often used by the poor than the rich. I knew a girl with two kids that could barely afford to live but she still bought 3 packs of cigs a day. 
5) Have you ever worked with a smoker? They get 10000 hours of breaks a day because they have to go outside to suck on a tobacco stick. They're less productive, and it's unfair. Oh, and they're stinky.

1,2023-06-26,CMV: The universe logically cannot be infinite,u/Canofair8300,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14jq8v2/cmv_the_universe_logically_cannot_be_infinite/,changemyview,"To get to the topic at hand, first it’s important to address that it’s widely believed one can’t prove a negative, but this isn’t necessarily true.

For instance, take Russell’s teapot; if Russell was to assert that between Mars & Earth there is a microscopic teapot orbiting the sun, then, in this case it might well be (or as good as) impossible to prove the negative. 

But if Russell was to also assert that the teapot is both entirely made of china and entirely made of steel, then we can prove the negative because this concept violates the law of non-contradiction, which states that contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time. Nothing can be made entirely of china and simultaneously entirely of steel — this simply isn’t possible. And hence, by using the law of non-contradiction, we can absolutely prove the unreality of such a concept.

Anyhow, with a clear understanding of this law, we can now apply it to disprove that the universe could be infinite. 

In this universe, if we travelled in one direction indefinitely, there are three possibilities of what could happen.

If the universe was finite, but did not posses a border, we would end up back where we started as the universe would loop back in of itself.

If the universe was finite, but possessed a border, we (and everything) would be destined to not pass it and could only become infinitely close to it.

If the universe was infinite, we would never reach a border or end up back where we started and thus, if the universe is infinite there would be infinite possibilities. 

Infinite possibilities entails every possibility, including that both a) an infinitely long void devoid of galaxies exists and b) an infinitely long presence of galaxies exists.

Eventually, if we travelled in the same direction far enough, we would be destined to reach the existence of that infinitely long void and simultaneously the existence of the opposite. 

Well, this cannot be possible. The existence of the infinitely long void means that no matter how far you go, or how far you imagine, there will always be more of the void and thus, the possibility of there being anything but that void is impossible, because it’s infinite. 

If we were to eventually reach the beginning of the infinitely long presence of galaxies, or any other possibility than the infinite void for that matter, this means the void could not be infinite because the existence of the other possibility means that the void ended at some point in space and therefore, isn’t infinite. 

Furthermore, you cannot counter-argue that the other possibility exists but cannot be practically reached; because the void automatically means it’s existence is impossible, because if it did, the void could not be infinite. Therefore the very possibility is contradictory and cannot exist.

Finally, to conclude, the existence of both these possibilities is impossible. But in an infinite universe with infinite possibilities they’re both simultaneously guaranteed to exist; which is not possible, as demonstrated, and it violates the law of non contradiction.

Because of this, I don’t believe there is any possibility that the universe is or could be infinite."

And social media made it so that all engagement is good, whether positive or negative, hence the birth of the “rage bait” accounts where they post themselves making wildly unpopular takes on topics, or being complete assholes to strangers in public.  

There’s likely no way to force social media platforms to only reward accounts for receiving positive engagement, since that would be tricky to define and quantify. So the next best approach would be to further disincentivize the behavior.  

If you post a video of yourself littering, maybe you get a $100 fine but maybe the amount of views it brings to your channel makes it worth it. Now imagine that fine as $300 because the evidence of your littering was literally posted by you on your own social media. Might not be such a good idea now. Do that with fines, jail time, community service hours, probation years, etc. and I bet you’d see a lot less of that bullshit. I just wish I could think of a way to apply this to people who film themselves being assholes to strangers but if it doesn’t meet the legal definition of assault or harassment then it would hard to make that legally punishable."

I think worshipping Lilith is dumb but banning gentiles from worshipping Lilith at ceremonies led by people of Jewish descent is just a bizarre form of caving into what a monotheistic religion wants. The rationale is that it is cultural appropriation so the people of Jewish descent can do it but gentiles cannot since there's a controversy. This argument makes no sense to me at all. 

Antisemitism is a real problem. But unless pagan groups are praying to get rid of Jewish people or something then I don't think pagan religious practices should really be changed to respect Judaism.

2,2023-06-27,"CMV: I believe caning should be adopted and employed in the american justice system for the following crimes: theft/robbery that results in no death, reckless driving (which includes drunk driving), littering, treating service and retail workers like crap with physical or verbal abuse.",u/deadfermata,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14k4372/cmv_i_believe_caning_should_be_adopted_and/,changemyview,"There should be a 24/7 station broadcasted/streamed by the government that you can tune in any minute of the day and watch people get caned for some less ""egregious"" behavior/crime. [www.cane.gov](https://www.cane.gov) Public shaming at a healthy dose is good for society. 

  
Here are some reasons for my current view.  


1. **Restoring a sense of accountability:** Caning, as a *public form* of punishment, can serve as a powerful tool to restore a sense of accountability in America. A 24/7 station broadcasting the caning sends a clear message that individuals who engage in theft, reckless driving, littering, or mistreatment of service workers will face immediate and visible consequences for their actions. This can deter potential offenders and foster a culture of personal responsibility.
2. **Swift and visible justice:** The current justice system is often criticized for having a lengthy legal proceeding and delayed justice. Caning, on the other hand, offers a swift and visible form of punishment. By eliminating bureaucratic hurdles, it ensures that individuals are promptly held accountable for their actions. The immediacy of caning can have a greater impact on discouraging potential offenders and reinforcing societal norms.
3. **Changing values:** Public shaming through caning can act as a catalyst for shifting societal values. By broadcasting the consequences of these offenses, it raises awareness and educates the public about the seriousness of such behavior. Witnessing the physical and emotional toll on those being caned can encourage individuals to reevaluate their own actions and contribute to a more respectful and considerate society.
4. **Relieving the burden on the justice system**: For minor offenses like theft, reckless driving, littering, and mistreatment of service workers, caning provides a swift and visible punishment without requiring lengthy court proceedings. This allows the justice system to focus more resources on addressing more serious crimes and ensuring justice for victims in those cases.
5. **Restorative justice:** Caning, when implemented within a framework of rehabilitation and support, can be seen as a form of restorative justice. Offenders can be required to participate in counseling or educational programs alongside the caning punishment, with the aim of addressing the root causes of their behavior and promoting personal growth. This approach combines the elements of punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation.

This post is inspired by the titanic sub disaster and the Mediterranean migrant boat sinking. Also trigger warning, going to mention stuff which will be personal to some people.

 I’ve seen countless Instagram posts and comments where people would criticize and mock the submarine incident but would sympathize heavily with the migrant boat disaster, using every trick in the book to justify their view point - most of which revolves around them suffering more than the ‘rich people’ on the sub. I’m not gonna debate on the migrant situation in Europe.

This also extends to a lot of general things in life, like crime.

Some guy decides to shoot up a school because he was bullied? You can bet a ton of people will sympathize and try to make excuses for shooter, like “it’s the students fault for bullying him and that they deserve it”. 

It gets even more complex with it comes to theft, if a poor guy steals from a rich guy, people will make up countless reasons for the theft - mostly related to his suffering. However, isn’t theft just bad, no matter your financial status

Not to mention diversity quotas and other stuff, why should a race be given priority over another just because they were oppressed/suffered a 100 years ago. Isn’t that just racism with additional steps?

I personally feel that we are giving people too much power and rights, just because they suffered more, even if their suffering is self-inflicted.

Lottery selection (unrestricted, meaning anyone from birth to death will be selected for public office) and the banning of political parties (form one in this society and you will be put to death) will help to improve representation in political offices since the current system tends to rely on greasing palms to be placed into power.

Ask yourself, would it be better if rather than connected people, if the House of Representatives, the Supreme Court and the Senate are made of people from all walks of life, ranging from the rich, to the  hobos, children and old people alike who are shoved here to represent us from Representative, to Senate to even the President?

But this will logjam our country! You say? Well, then have all laws proposed by representatives be implemented and let individuals choose which laws to follow at which after a time period, the majority of those who follow a certain set of laws will have said set of laws implemented after a census.

But what about those corporates who will exploit the above way of passing laws that you mentioned? Count the company as one in the census.

Untrained people? Tell them to figure it out. Just anyhow experiment with whatever idea you have in your head.

&#x200B;

What about the possibility of staffers becoming the power behind the throne? Have them be subject to the same term limits and lottery selection as their politicians.

&#x200B;

How to prevent backsliding? Strict term limits with the penalty for exceeding term limits being a life sentence or death.

Oh and what about those that refuse to serve? Jail or execute them for refusing to represent the population\*.

It would be better than the current system which is prone to palm greasing, backsliding and infighting amongst party lines.

0,2023-06-27,CMV: Hysterical Strength Logic,u/Snoo_66461,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14k77q0/cmv_hysterical_strength_logic/,changemyview,"I saw a post from 4 years ago here talking about how hysterical strength is BS. I would like to throw in my counter-argument and see what you guys think.

A big thing was a comparison between Eddy Hall using the thought of his family members being trapped to lift something just under 10% of his previous best and ended up throwing up blood and messed himself up and stories of mothers lifting cars to save people. A big point I would like to make is that muscle tearing is based off several factors. For one, length of time exerting a certain amount of force. How much do you want to bet Eddy Hall wasn’t throwing up a pint of blood after two seconds? I’m willing to bet all I have he at least gave it several tries until that happened. Length of time matters. For another thing, your brain subconsciously forced muscles to “guard” a broken bone. I mention this because lifting something heavy registers as pain, which is your brain’s main way of knowing if there’s a problem in the body. This has the potential of changing your technique, which could’ve exacerbated his chances for injury. Since it’s an instinct, you can’t really blame your brain. It only knows something is causing pain and causes little changes. The problem is that little changes can cause big problems when you’re training to push through pain. This means that the chance of injury was higher.

Another thing is the mechanics of the lift. There’s a ton of factors involved. A car most likely would have been lifted on the side, so think a see-saw without a fulcrum. That lack of a fulcrum would make it more difficult to lift, but what I’m arguing isn’t that it wasn’t a ton of wait the women would have to lift, but that the women probably had to lift it for way less of a time than you’d expect. When you have to lift something, you exert enough pressure in your hands to grip and apply force to the object to force it to move. The thing is that we tend to estimate our force before-hand so that we only apply enough force for the weight the object necessitates. We can see this from examples of people expecting things to be heavier and accidentally making awkward scenes where they lift it too high. Like if you lifted a bunch of boxes that were super heavy, then the last one was super light. You’d lift it thinking it’d be as heavy as the others and probably lose balance because your core was off. Your core being off means that you applied too much force from the wrong part of your body for the weight. Now look at it from the perspective of someone who’s of average strength seeing their kid stuck under the car. They probably never lifted the car before, but when you’re in that situation, your brain thinks “heavy thing + on kid = dead kid” and “heavy thing on kid + big strength push up = heavy thing off kid”. They don’t think about how much pressure to put, but their brain goes “all of it”.

Now as to why the muscle don’t snap like a rubber band is based on the time the muscles were put under the tremendous force. I hinted at this earlier, but it’s actually less time than you’d think and it’s because of inertia. The more mass something has, the more force it needs to move it, and it’s the same in reverse the more mass something has, the more force is needed to stop it and that can change depending on the amount of force having made it move. This is the basis for inertia: “an object in motion or stillness tends to stay still or in motion unless acted upon by an outside force.” So when they add their force to the car, you’d have to realize that their brain stops when the problem (kid stuck) is solved (kid not stuck). They applied all of their force in less than a second to lift the car only a few inches and then stopped. Based on the timing and the lack of the common working knowledge of how much strength it takes to lift a car, I’m willing to bet they overestimated. This means that the muscles stopped fully engaging at those few inches, but the leftover inertia should carry it about a few more millimeters. It sounds small but this means that as soon as they stopped applying that force to the car, it stopped applying that force to them, and since the kid, who’s most likely been trying to force itself out from under the car the whole time is already out now, allowing them to let go of the car entirely. That tiny change results in a far higher chance of lesser injury or none at all.

Hysterical strength is the bodies protection from an unmeasured or unmeasurable threat. This trait was most likely passed on because the force it exerts is exerted in a way that is in short bursts. More force in each step gives speed but can also encourage a wider stride, meaning the number of times you spend hitting the ground is less and with the inertia you build from the initial burst, you don’t need that full-on force, only enough to keep the momentum (something you instinctually know how to do) and your body starts to compensate the force you don’t have to slam your foot as hard.

All in all, it’s super complicated stuff since there’s a lot of physics involved, but that doesn’t mean any of its BS. Things happen all the time, we just don’t have all the answers why yet, but that doesn’t meant that it didn’t happen and treating it that way is likely to tunnel vision us into thinking it shouldn’t be possible, calling folks crazy, or just straight-up saying it’s a freak miracle. It’s entirely possible, and there’s plenty of research showing one perspective can push you further, while another full perspective can push you further while minimizing risk."

Well, what if that is the basis for an entire system for calculating severity of sentencing for crimes where your personal (either monthly or daily) income and your assets owned calculates how severe the punishment is for a crime. For example, your personal income above a certain threshold results in punishment for even the most minor crimes being more severe, including and up to automatic death sentence/ nine familial life imprisonments and asset seizure with no appeal  if you are extremely rich even for minor crimes such as speeding.

&#x200B;

I think that such a system will show that no one is above the law and those who use their wealth as a shield to get away from punishment will be dealt with harshly.

Change my view on this since this is an effective deterrent in my view.

For example, andrew tat. This guy has millions of followers. most of them are men. others are probably female simps. now, if they are all alpha then what are all these alphas doing together? Why are alphas praising or defending andrew tate on the internet? All I see is adolescents who have not become individuals, have chosen a ""male"" role model for themselves from the internet. or, in their language, the alpha male gathered all betas around him.  
 just it. speaking by the book, an alpha never follows another alpha, when an alpha sees another alpha, he prepares for a fight. there is only one alpha in a group, there is no such thing as an assistant alpha. There are only loyal betas who take advantage of alpha. But, as far as I can see, these aren't even beta. fanboys only.  
Another contradiction (paradox?) ""sigmas"". I'll cut it short. why would a sigma have discussions with anonymous people on the internet about being sigma?

Extremism was a by-product of Western imperialism, it wasn't what caused the tension in the MidEast.

There were also geopolitical reasons why America was interested in the region, like trying to keep Iran, China, and Russia at bay, given each country's expansion and interest in the region itself. The Iraq War wasn't started for the noble reason to combat terrorism, if anything more terrorist organizations resulted from this invasion (like ISIS.) Iraq wasn't responsible for 9/11, but Bush and his ghouls told the world that they were to gain support from the masses and invade a country that never even attacked US.

1,2023-06-27,CMV: I strongly dislike democracy.,u/Skwerilleee,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14kfh4j/cmv_i_strongly_dislike_democracy/,changemyview," First some background info:

&nbsp;

I'm an anarchist. At my moral core, I believe that 1: every person is the sole owner of their own life and should be free to do literally anything they want with it as long as they aren't hurting anyone else. 2: no one human being has any inherent authority over anyone else's life. Extrapolate up from there and you basically get the rest of my political positions. One of the major ones is that I don't believe in the legitimacy of the authority government claims to have. Most people never consented to being ruled over, so to me there is literally no moral difference between the government telling non consenting people how to live using threats of violence, and any other group of armed people doing the same. They aren't some special class of people.. literally the only difference between a government and a giant organized crime syndicate is the belief that there is a difference. One of them put on fancier suits and brainwashed most of the population into thinking their murdering and kidnapping and stealing is somehow ok, but really it's all just groups of people with guns unjustly imposing their will onto others.

&nbsp;

So this leads into the first big reason why I strongly dislike democracy. A lot of evil stuff gets done every day by our government... and it all happens under the guise of democracy. They use it as moral camouflage for their crimes. We have all been conditioned to think that if people voted for something, it's automatically good and just, and so therefore people don't question anything the government does, because the government is a democracy, and democracy=good! I don't accept that. If a dude was just waking down the street and got jumped by 9 other dudes and they beat the crap out of him, would that be morally OK since 9 out of the 10 people involved supported it? Of course not. Injustice supported by a majority vote is still injustice. But then scale it up and most people these days have been too conditioned with all this ""will of the people"" nonsense to question anything. They just subconsciously believe that democracy is just a universal good and that therefor anything that comes from it must be good and right....this is not true, and some very evil people are using these assumptions all the time to get away with all sorts of horrible crimes. ""Democracy"" got us the iraq war. ""democracy"" got us the world's largest prison population made up mostly of people in for weed possession or other victimless ""crimes"". And nobody blinks an eye. It's not a good situation. It helps to legitimize illegitimate authority.

&nbsp;

The second reason I dislike democracy is the effect it's had on the average person's moral compass...the institution of democracy has normalized the concept of imposing your will onto others in the mind of the average person . That should be a completely alien concept, but now everyone just casually has opinions about ""We need to ban _ _ _"" or debates about ""should people be allowed to _ _ _ "" as if they have any type of righteous authority over other people's lives. It's horrible, it's turned every normal person into a little mini tyrant. Its turned us into a whole society of control freaks. Republicans who want to tell other people what kind of plants they snoke, or tell other people ""my religion says i cant be gay, so nobody else should be allowed to be either"". Democrats who think they have any right to tell me what kind of gun collection i can peacefully enjoy. Etc. We all need to step back and realize how wrong all of that is. You have no legitimate right to dictate what other people are allowed to do with their own life as long as they aren't hurting anyone else. Full stop. Everyone needs to mind their own business and stop trying to control other people. Live and let live. Democracy has destroyed this, and in turn had directly lead to all the polarization we're experiencing, and I think that's a terrible thing."

Lighter Indians have the same skintones and appearance as lightskin black people and darker Indians are as dark if not darker than darker black people- and race is only about skin color. From a distance, Indian people and black people look the same and thus they are subjected to the same assumptions/initial perceptions/preconceived notions and this should be taken into account. Mindy Kailing could easily be viewed as black for instance, and most black people are lighter than her. I don't know why Indians aren't considered black in the first place, they are the same visually as black people and people often cannot tell if someone is black or Indian/South Asian.  
  
My view would be changed if there were evidence that people viewed Indians and black people differently, or that there weren't more physical similarities than there are differences. The only difference is the hair, and when black people, especially women straighten their hair they always look Indian. I mean, if you see a dark-skinned black-haired person from the back, the automatic assumption is that they are black, but Indians and black people look the same from many angles, so unless this isn't true my opinion stands."

Adding the black and brown stripes just have nothing to do with gender and sexuality. They are out of place.  

And why a stripe for brown people, but not people of other hues? This seems unnecessarily divisive. LGBTQ people of all colors have faced unique challenges for their gender and sexuality. There’s just not a good enough reason to single out black and brown people (and exclude others).  

I just don’t think the pride flag is about race, and making it about certain races and not others is divisive, and a distraction from its primary purpose.  

I’m open to being wrong. I have nothing against black and brown LGTBQ people, and I appreciate that they are underrepresented in society. So I am motivated to CMV. Currently, though, I don’t see why race should be brought into gender and sexual pride."

Well, similar to how when election debates began to be broadcasted on TV instead over radio, the American people are now being thoroughly manipulated to make a decision based off senses that have no business contributing to our decisions in our legal system.

Thinking it over, I think the only way to start to rectify this unjust system would be to record the audio of the trial and to specifically REMOVE anything that happened in court that was not allowed (like all the sneaky comments/questions the other lawyer objected to and the judge agreed). Otherwise, the jurors will never be able to make a decision that did not factor in those moments."

It seems to me that if a country were to be invaded by a real military, the private citizens attempting to hold them back with their own guns would be little more than a minor annoyance.

For this idea to make any sense, a country would have to legalize private ownership of anti vehicle weaponry, such as rocket launchers, which seems very unlikely to me, given the massive destruction this kind of weaponry could cause in the wrong hands.

My view could be changed by an example of private gun ownership making a significant difference in the outcome of a war, or a plausible scenario where it could make a difference in the modern world."

Yeah.

I am currently going through this right now after subjecting myself to reading the major ongoings in the news and have been pondering the inevitability of dying (not DEATH, but the process of dying. Death is the state of not being alive anymore, whereas dying is HOW you become dead).

I have now developed an intense fear of dying, moreso than i had before. 

I dont want to be in car accident, burned alive, stabbed, shot, decapitated, etc....

But someday, I will die, and i can only hope it will be peaceful and quick after a long, fulfilled, happy life.

I cannot shake the thought that one day, something will happen that I cannot escape and it will 100% end me as it will for everyone who has ever lived and will live.

I have sought looking online to see methods of quelling this fear and my conclusion is thus:

You can't get rid of it.

You can just pretend you no longer care and push the though to another day.

As opposed to other fears in life (money, appearance, social, political, irrational, etc) this is one thing you have no true control over and thus cannot do anything about.

And thus I think its one fear we cant really escape. We can just put off fearing it until tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, until there are no more next days and your number is up.

No therapy can help this.

You just have to fool yourself."

Whereas a really short guy (like 5'3) will get attention from people, they get made fun of but at least they're known as the ""short guy"".

Still, like most other humans, I detest harm for harm's sake on animals. That being established (and the above is not subject to CMV), below is the outline for my CMV.

I think anyone who claims that the current animal-industrial complex is similar to the Holocaust or other genocides is either ignorant or disingenuous. I will establish the reasons using the following cases where people or organizations used genocide as an analogy for animal rights.

> In 2006, Ingrid Newkirk, the president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), said: ""Six million Jews died in concentration camps, but six billion broiler chickens will die this year in slaughterhouses"" as part of the organization's ""Holocaust on Your Plate"" campaign.

By using the conjunction ""but,"" Newkirk is rhetorically arguing that the Holocaust is less significant than is the slaughter of broiler chickens because the victims of the Holocaust were less numerous. I find this campaign to be outrageous because it assumes that a human life is equal in value to that of a chicken. I disagree. A human being is capable of maintaining levels of reason, empathy, and morality that a chicken can never even conceive of. One human, through his or her action, communication, and imagination, may bring forth values that not only aid society but also the entire world. I don't see any reason why the average Joe isn't infinitely more valuable than the average chicken.

> Another Holocaust survivor who has written on the subject is Alex Hershaft, now a vegan activist, who also compared the treatment of livestock to the Holocaust. He has stated that ""We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself"", and that ""I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies.""

As much as I respect Hershaft for his efforts in the Farm Animal Rights Movement, I strongly criticize his continuous attempts to compare the Holocaust to the farming industry. Hershaft is ignoring at least two major issues with his comparison.

1. **A central aspect of genocides is hatred.** Gregory Stanton's [ten stages of genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_stages_of_genocide) lists hatred as motivation for symbolization, the *second* stage of genocide. Dehumanization and extermination are also motivated by hatred because the perpetrators do not see the victims as fully human. Genocides are motivated primarily by hatred. However, the tragedies animal rights activists
are against, such as industrial farming, animal experimentation, and culling for population control, were *never* motivated by hatred. The first humans did not hunt animals because they hated them. Butchers do not slaughter animals because they hate them. Scientists do not experiment on animals because they hate them.

 To this argument, Hershaft claims that hatred was not relevant. Instead, he claims that indifference was the major element behind the Holocaust since he believes that the executioners could not hate the Jews the same way that Hitler did. However, this contrasts from the now widely accepted [moderate functionalist view of the Holocaust](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/40b0s0/in_the_intentionalismfunctionalism_debate_about/cysup83/), not to mention the widely prevalent and engrained antisemitism within the German population prior to the Holocaust.

2. **Human genocides stood upon an ""us vs them"" worldview that is largely unsubstantiated by science.** Significant intellectual differences due to genetics among race and gender have been debunked through studies in anthropology, psychology, medicine, and psychology, not to mention the fact that racial classification is mutable and arbitrary. Humans also have very little genetic diversity of around 0.1% difference in genomes. There exists an extremely strong biological case for why all humans must be treated with certain inalienable rights that we dub ""human rights."" Of course, this isn't the only reason. There exists moral and societal reasons which I find much stronger than the purely biological reason (which could be just an appeal to nature if used alone).
 
 On the other hand, chimpanzees, our closest evolutionary relatives, are different from us by 4% in genome. From this difference of 4% arises what separates chimpanzees from humans. If you think that being 96% genetically similar warrants chimpanzees the same rights as humans, then I also want you to know that fruit flies and humans have 60% genetic similarity, the same as chickens and bananas. Should these creatures receive the same treatment? If you think that having CNS should be the criterion, then I want you to also know that there is a growing body of evidence that suggest [insects actually feel pain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065280622000170), not to mention the fact that octopuses don't have CNS but are extraordinarily intelligent.

It is important to note that I am not advocating for inhumane treatment of animals. I believe animals deserve respect that all conscious lives do. However, I think it is silly for people to use genocides, the epitome of human evil, as an analogy for animal rights."

When a competitive online game is played around the world, you'd think it's common sense that there would be differences in playstyle and skill. I never thought it could be anything other than a given, but apparently it is extremely controversial. Players like Tyler1 (who does region challenges) has also received backlash for pointing out differences and regions he dislikes. 

But the truth is that anyone who has played these games and paid attention *will* see these differences. Many people have independently come to the same opinion on how each region is bad/good because it is so obvious. For example, people across many MOBAS  (Dota, League, etc) agree that SEA, KR, and EU are strong while NA is kind of average and SA is consistently bad. There are real, felt differences in skill level. 

The objections to judging regions are also unevenly applied. It's okay to say Russians trolls and Chinese hackers are ruining games, but it's *racist* to say South American players are extremely low quality and generally play like trash. But these realities are overwhelmingly obvious. 

Obviously I acknowledge that there are good players and bad players in each regional. Obviously. But if you had to bet your life on a match between five randomly picked Korean players and five randomly picked Peruvians, there's only one smart choice. I think even the people shrieking racist *know* who they'd bet on."

Even if a few non-state actors happen to get hold of a few of them, getting access to the buttons, passcodes and knowing how to detonate them to cause significant casualties are an entirely different thing. A nuke doesn't simply blow up like *Fat Man* because someone throws a match at it or dumps it onto the floor.

  
So long as Russia exists in its current form, their thirst for aggressive conquests is insatiable, which means persistent survival threat to democratic Europe. A broken up Russia would preclude this from happening. If Russia is no longer capable of invading any European democracies, the risk of nuclear confrontation would become minimal as well.

  
As distasteful as it sounds, it wouldn't be wrong for NATO powers to [foment unrest and encouraging separatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollback) within Russian soil [just as they](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/world/europe/spain-catalonia-russia.html) [have been doing](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/russia-tried-influence-scottish-independence-22388486) [to the West for decades](https://warsawinstitute.org/racial-conflicts-created-russian-security-authorities-usa/).

Rather I believe that through a steady decline over a couple years, the lack of new resources and inability to counteract it will make our society return to one that would be similar to the ones in the 1900s.

Not only are we annoying the community by providing constant pictures of John Oliver, but also giving Spez more ad revenue in the process, and doing nothing to actually prevent Reddit traffic and protest to hit Reddit where it counts.

In my opinion this is a failed attempt at protesting for change. If we want to win, we had to move our subreddits private indefinitely instead.

*Context:*  
Me (30M) and my partner (35F) have been in a relationship for a little over a year. We have been living together for several months, and have been talking about getting married, having kids, etc. I am from the US and had a relatively stable upbringing (middle class, good parents), whereas she is from another country and had a tougher upbringing (low income, emotionally neglectful parents/family); she also has experienced a lot of emotional trauma in her life, both from her family and past relationships. I am also non-religious, whereas she was raised strictly religious (and still practices in her own way). Our differences in life experiences and culture causes our views to clash sometimes, and this has unfortunately led to a fair amount of turmoil in the relationship, but thus far we seem to have always found a way to move past these obstacles, no matter how impossible they seemed at the time. And at the end of the day I have no doubt that at the core of my being, I deeply love, admire, and respect my partner (and still do) - despite everything we've been through.   
  
*Event:*   
The day after we had an argument, my partner posed a question to me. I don't recall the exact wording of the original question, but the sentiment was something very close to ""do you think it is morally ok to have sexual fantasies about other people while you're in a relationship"". To be clear, I am not a overly sexual person to begin with - so I don't have a lot of personal stake on this topic. I also know that my partner, due to her trauma/history, is very sensitive to anything that will make her feel like I am giving emotional attention to other women, and is hyper-vigilant against anything can be interpreted as a risk that I will one day betray her (I do feel trust has been a big issue in our relationship). I definitely was aware of these notions, so I regret not having been more mindful of they way I answered her question, and the potential I had to hurt her in this moment. But I wasn't thinking too much about the question, and just answered in a sincere/unfiltered way (I do value sincerity/honesty, and endeavor to be as transparent as I can). So my answer was something like ""well, as long as you don't act on any fantasies about other people, or become obsessive about them to the point that it will affect the way to treat your partner, I think it's a normal thing that people do, so they shouldn't have feel ashamed about it. I think it's probably morally ok"". I had unknowingly set off her triggers with this, and made her feel unsafe; she felt like this was a clear, significant clash of our morals - and made her question whether I was actually the person of good character that she came to believe I was, which made her feel blindsided/gaslit. She began to fear, if she could be surprised in this way, what other ""surprises"" about me might be in store years down the line?  
  
*The summary below encapsulates a series of tense/painful conversations that took place over a period of about a month, including 3 therapy sessions (we had been seeing actually 2 different couples counselors for several months already, for other issues in the relationship):*  
  
My partner proceeded to ask me questions about my view, and effectively tried to show me that I was looking at this incorrectly. She indicated that most people would be hurt by the idea that their partner was thinking of others, and that something that can hurt your partner is, of course, blatantly wrong; especially thoughts about someone close to your partner (i.e. their friends, family). She considers it ""emotional cheating"", and that most healthy people would see it this way. She argued that people's thoughts will almost certainly affect their actions, even in ways they might not realize, especially if those thoughts are unregulated. She argued that fantasizing is the ""first step"" to infidelity, so one should best shut that down at the root, and not allow any risk that they might one day betray their partner. She argued that a ""devoted"" partner would ""guard their thoughts"" against fantasizing about others, out of respect/reverence for their partner - and that by me saying I think fantasizing is ""ok"", it indicates that I think women don't deserve to be revered/respected by their partner in this way. She indicated that she thought my view was ""disgusting"", and did not want to be in a relationship with me if I continue to think this way.   
  
I have responded that certainly, if you allow your thoughts to affect the way to treat your partner, then that is not right. But I think most people who fantasize aren't becoming obsessive/irresponsible about it, and I think many people are capable of clearly and easily separating fantasy from reality. I tried to liken it morally to drinking alcohol; some people will drink and then drive drunk, or act belligerent, or beat their spouse - but most people who drink are able to do so responsibly. This means while I do see making irresponsible decisions as a result of drinking to be morally wrong, I don’t see the root act of drinking itself as being fundamentally, morally wrong. So by the same reason - I felt like fantasizing was not fundamentally, morally wrong. I also think many partners would understand if their partner thought about others from time to time, and in a healthy relationship each partner should be able to trust that the unknown things are happening within the other's mind are not going to hurt them. I also agreed with the idea that it is ultimately respectful/reverent to guard one's thoughts about fantasizing - but if one does end up fantasizing, I still don't think that they necessarily ought to feel shame about it. I don't think anyone ought to feel shame about being, what is in my mind, normal/natural. Shame does not have to be the mechanism that motivates oneself to act in a ""better"" way (better being a subjective thing for each individual) - it ought to be positive reinforcement, e.g. feelings of pride/accomplishment. I tried to liken it to eating fast food; it's not ideal to eat fast food, it can certainly cause harm if done in excess over long period of time, and one should endeavor to eat better on a regular basis - but if you do eat fast food once in a while, I think it's fundamentally ok, you don't deserve to feel ashamed about it if you don't allow it to affect your overall healthy lifestyle.  
  
I told her that despite the fact we have a disagreement in the philosophy/morality of fantasies, I don't really even think about fantasizing very much if at all, and I honor/respect her viewpoint on this, so I made a promise not to fantasize/look at porn/masturbate/etc. - and that it will be easy for me to do this for her. But she needs to see that I am doing this not because she ""asked me to"", but because I fundamentally believe it is the right thing to do; to stay in the relationship, she feels she needs me to demonstrate to her that I have changed my way of thinking to align with hers. She feels like my inability my characterizing fantasies as ""ok"" (i.e. not inherently harmful) is akin to me invalidating all of the hurt she's currently feeling as a result of this issue between is. Unfortunately, throughout these conversations, it has become harder and harder for us to reach any kind of consensus. The more I try to explain myself, the more she felt like I am trying to ""fight"" for my right to fantasize about other people, the more unsafe she starts to feel, the more she scrutinizes anything I say, the more unable I feel to address any nuance between our viewpoints, the more difficulty I feel expressing myself, the more frustrated I begin to feel, the more dysregulated we both become, the more the situation escalates. Eventually this issue just became to big, too complicated, too raw for us to deal with in a healthy way - anytime we've tried to talk about it, the conversation became unstable and both of us eventually become dysregulated. Both of the therapists we've brought this issue to haven't really been able to help us address the issue yet. They effectively seemed to say ""both of your views are valid, just agree to disagree"" - which unfortunately does not seem to be a viable option.  
  
I understand that this is an emotional issue, and that I can't help the emotional issue by explaining logic, but my partner is specifically taking issue with my underlying logic and asking me to help her understand it, so I am not sure what I am supposed to do. I feel stuck, I feel trapped. And it is killing me how much this is hurting her, and I feel like can't do anything for her. In fact I only seem to be able to make the situation worse. She feels like I am placing my own pride/stubbornness to keep my viewpoint above keeping our relationship together. She feels like the fact that I am not adhering to her view, considering hat she seems to have more experience and investment in this issue than I do, means that I don't respect her or what she has to say. I feel like she is being intolerant, and her triggers are creating an issue in the relationship where there was none, as we both pretty much agree there is no real risk of either of us betraying each other.   
  
Last weekend was particularly rough - we went to therapy on Saturday and seemed to come out of it in a positive state, but we started talking about the issue again shortly after, and by Sunday night she had basically decided to leave the relationship. But we each went to work on Monday and came back with an unsteady peace; she proposed that, given I've never had to deal with this issue in reality, I might just be too naïve/ignorant to understand how deeply hurtful it is for most people. While I'm a bit uncomfortable with that idea, as it doesn't address the concern I had about her being intolerant and having difficultly talking about triggering topics with me in a fair/healthy way, I agreed that maybe this is a valid explanation. I ultimately just want just to be able to find peace and move past this.  
  
She suggested I go out and try to see how other people view the idea of fantasizing, to ""gather more data"" on this topic and see if it affects my view, which I promised to do - and so, here I am. I do not want to prove either of us right or wrong, I just want new insights that might be able to help us frame this in a way that can help us to resolve it. I would honestly be very happy to be convinced that I have been very wrong about anything, learn from it, and move on - but I would need to be sincerely convinced of that truth, which has yet to happen.

Sports like Golf are proof that the skill level can be reached, just not the size and strength to reach the men's level, hence why they have shorter holes.

I live in a country where there is essentially a duopoly on the supermarkets and prices have skyrocketed. 

I was always taught that stealing was wrong and never did it, until I was a young teen with some friends and stole and got away with it. A year or two later I began to feel morally wrong and stopped and haven’t stolen anything in 10+ years 

I’m now I’m my mid 20s and have been financially struggling. Everything is expensive and it’s very hard to save. Recently it came out that both of the major supermarkets in my country have made record profits, despite claiming they have to raise prices due to higher market prices. 

To be honest I’m more than angry, I’m furious. It’s complete bullshit. I’m seriously considering stealing again, and this time it’s more of a fuck you than a quick thrill it was when I was a kid. 

Here are my points and arguments:

1. Im only talking about stealing from the duopoly supermarkets in my country. I am not saying that stealing from individuals or small business is right at all. 

2. It’s a victimless crime. Who am I harming? It’s claimed that theft harms everybody because it forces supermarkets to drive up prices. If that was the case, it would’ve happened already. Yeah, prices have gone up, but that’s nothing to do with theft. It’s to do with greed and alleged higher prices from wholesalers

3. I’ve never been convicted of a crime. Touch wood.  I don’t plan on stealing much. Just $10-$50 worth of stuff each time. If I get caught, I doubt it will be a criminal conviction (educate me if I’m wrong)

4. I don’t care if you think lowly of thieves. I know who I am and I don’t feel an ounce of sympathy for who I’m stealing from. I feel sorry for you if you care about the livelihood of billionaire / millionaire duopoly corporate profits

5. I live in a large city with many supermarkets I can jump between. I don’t have to worry about returning to the same supermarket on a daily or weekly basis 

6. I will be able to save some money each week, which will help me long term

Please CMV, as deep down I know this is wrong (is it? Lol) and could seriously effect my future."

I'll say that being poor is big magnitude of problem than being incel, but they are actually same problem, if you have capitalist kind of market, there will be people who will be so much far behind, that they will not survive.

How does using an adblocker solve the issue? The answer is it doesn't

&#x200B;

Maybe and that's because they've created a valuable product that people want

1,2023-06-28,cmv: adults that obsess over sexual labels are prejudiced or mentally ill,u/Organic_Street_3389,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14kz6zk/cmv_adults_that_obsess_over_sexual_labels_are/,changemyview,"TLDR - Like someone? They like you? Awesome. Go have the type of relationship you want - or if you don’t want one that’s cool too! Obsessively worrying about labels is pointless if you really believe “love is love”.


Core Thesis - if as an adult you obsess or are really upset over your/others labels - you are prejudiced against other people and/or mentally ill.

Emphasis on obsess - it is totally healthy to have either internal or external dialogue on who/what you are attracted to and/or the nature of your approach to relationships, gender expression, etc.

I’m not referring to normal conversations/discussions or momentary revelations that occur with acute stress - I mean folks that persistently experience chronic stress over whether they are <label-variation> or <label-variation>. Often this may manifest as stating you are <label-variation> but wishing instead you are <label-variation>.

Emphasis on adults - children are still developing so they get a pass.

Implied assumption - I am not referring to people in some kind of horrific regime where being labeled one way or another would result in them being imprisoned, murdered, etc. For purpose of discourse, I presume there are no draconian outcomes from self-labeling as <label-variant> or <label-variant>.


Personal clarification - I expect many people to assume I am implicitly for or against certain labels and respond in a knee jerk reaction. I genuinely don’t care what type of relationships people partake in (assuming they are consensual and don’t involve some obvious self-harm).

“But why do you care? Aren’t you contradicting yourself by caring about.. people caring about labels?” - If I were obsessed to the point of paralysis, this would be true. I simply think it would reduce a lot of strife in our society if everyone could embrace love and adopt true inclusion. The tragic irony of the inclusivity movement is it has devolved into people arguing about label definitions and an ultimately hopeless pursuit of more and more specific yet somehow still vague definitions.

What is inclusive about that? How does it benefit you?


My logic:

There are really only 2 reasons an adult would obsess over a label.

1) Some form of mental illness or disorder. I’m not a mental health professional so I will not provide prospective diagnoses as that would only create arguments I’m not particularly interested in.

2) Prejudice against another group. If you like someone, it should not matter whether they meet some kind of definition or label. Also I think instead of worrying about labels you should enjoy your life with them (or yourself if that’s your path). If you are attracted to them, then I wish you a happy life. Similarly if you are happy with yourself.. or balloons.. or whatever.. I am happy for you! Labels do not matter.

The only real reason (apart from #1) I can imagine someone would be attracted to someone but get upset over their “labels” is if they believe one label is better/worse than another.

Let’s provide an example - <Person A> exhaustively conducts analysis and concludes they are <label-variation> which they adopt as their identity.

The very next day they meet someone they are wildly attracted to. It is mutual. Unfortunately this person does not meet the criteria of <label-variation>. If <Person A> rejects them because the target of affection does not conform to <label-variation>, I propose they are prejudiced/bigoted. They are basically giving up the love of their life because of some word."

1: When the party they vote for does something unexpected or out of character, or simply fails to meet a new challenge.

2. The divisiveness. Who pays for this? Are recent immigrants going to see increasing taxes? What about the non-black members of the impoverished community? How do we suspect they will feel as they become more poor and their neighbors receive 100k checks? Resentment and division will skyrocket.

Streaming services have revolutionized how we consume entertainment, providing convenience and a vast library of content at our fingertips. However, recent developments in the streaming industry have raised concerns and drawn comparisons to traditional cable TV. Let's take a look at the current environment surrounding streaming services.

As of June 2023, Netflix has implemented a device authentication system, making it harder to share accounts across multiple households. They want each household to have its own subscription.

Additionally, Netflix has announced plans to introduce advertisements, although they will offer a pricier ad-free subscription option. These changes reflect the evolving nature of streaming services.

With the rise of multiple streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and more, securing rights to popular franchises has become competitive. This has led to content being spread across multiple services, making it harder to access all the desired shows and films in one place.

These developments have sparked discussions about the impact on user experience and the increasing similarities between streaming services and cable TV. Some have taken the position that streaming services are becoming just as bad or even worse than cable TV was. I disagree with this.

# Overview

In this post, I will argue that streaming services are inherently superior to Cable TV by highlighting the following key points:

1. Accessibility:
   1. Streaming services provide unparalleled accessibility, allowing content consumption anywhere with an internet connection. No need for specialized hardware or installations; a simple app download on existing devices is sufficient.
2. Control over Playback:
   1. Streaming services empower viewers with control over playback, including features like pause, rewind, and skip intro, eliminating the need for separate recording devices like DVRs.
3. Asynchronous Media Consumption:
   1. Streaming services enable asynchronous media consumption, allowing viewers to watch any released content at their convenience, regardless of when it originally aired.
   2. There is no need to pre-record or schedule viewing; users have the flexibility to enjoy media on their own terms.
4. Addressing Media Fragmentation: 5. Although media fragmentation exists across various streaming services, there is typically a wide selection of shows and series available within similar genres or purposes. 6. The expanding catalog of original content ensures a continuous and diverse range of options that rarely leave the streaming service, providing a satisfactory replacement.

Through these points, I will demonstrate that streaming services offer unmatched convenience, control, and flexibility, making them the superior choice over Cable TV for modern media consumption.

# Accessibility

One of the key advantages of streaming services over Cable TV is the unparalleled accessibility they offer. Here's a closer look at why streaming services excel in this aspect:

1. **Content consumption anywhere, anytime:** Streaming services allow users to access their favorite movies, shows, and videos from virtually anywhere with an internet connection. Whether you're at home, traveling, or even in a coffee shop, as long as you have internet access, you can stream your desired content.
2. **No specialized hardware or installations required:** Unlike Cable TV, which often involves installing specific equipment and cables, streaming services eliminate the need for such hardware. All you need is a compatible device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, smart TV, or computer) and a reliable internet connection. Simply download the streaming app or access the service's website, and you're ready to enjoy a vast array of content.
3. **Wide range of supported devices:** Streaming services cater to various platforms and devices, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems and devices. Whether you prefer iOS or Android, Windows or macOS, or even gaming consoles like Xbox or PlayStation, streaming services offer apps and platforms that allow you to seamlessly access content on your preferred device.
4. **Portable and convenient:** With streaming services, there's no need to be tied down to a specific location or device. You can start watching a show on one device and continue where you left off on another, allowing for a seamless and uninterrupted viewing experience.

# Control

Streaming services offer viewers a remarkable level of control over their viewing experience, surpassing the capabilities of traditional cable TV. Here's a closer look at the aspects of control and convenience that streaming services provide:

1. **Playback control at your fingertips:** Streaming services empower viewers with a wide range of playback controls, allowing them to pause, rewind, fast forward, and skip scenes or intros with ease. This eliminates the need for separate recording devices like DVRs, as users can navigate through the content effortlessly using their streaming platform's intuitive interface.
2. **Freedom from DVR limitations:** While DVRs provide the ability to record and store content for later viewing, they have inherent limitations. One such limitation is storage space, which restricts the number of shows or movies that can be recorded. In contrast, streaming services offer virtually unlimited content availability, with a vast library of movies, TV series, and original programming accessible on-demand.
3. **Enhanced viewing experience:** Streaming services enable viewers to enjoy a seamless viewing experience without the hassle of commercials or time constraints. With the ability to skip ads or choose ad-free subscription options, viewers can enjoy the uninterrupted content immersion.
4. **Preservation of content quality:** DVRs record the content exactly as it is broadcasted, which means any corruptions or technical issues during the original airing are also preserved. Streaming services, on the other hand, provide a reliable and consistent streaming experience, ensuring high-quality playback without the risk of signal loss or degradation. If corruption does happen, it is usually a one-time thing that you can correct by simply trying again later instead of waiting for the episode or film to rerun.
5. **Offline viewing:** Many streaming services now offer the option to download selected titles for offline viewing. This functionality allows users to store content locally on their devices, similar to a DVR, and watch it without an internet connection. Whether on a long flight or in areas with limited internet access, the ability to download and stream content offline provides convenience and flexibility.

# Asynchronous Consumption

Streaming services revolutionize the way we consume media by enabling asynchronous consumption, granting viewers the freedom to watch content at their convenience, regardless of its original airing. Here's a detailed exploration of how streaming services excel in providing this flexibility:

1. **On-demand viewing:** Streaming services offer the unique advantage of on-demand viewing, allowing users to choose what, when, and how they want to watch. Whether you prefer binge-watching an entire season in one sitting or catching up on missed episodes at your own pace, streaming services cater to individual preferences and schedules.
2. **No need for pre-recording or scheduling:** Unlike traditional cable TV, which often requires pre-recording or scheduling shows to ensure you don't miss them, streaming services eliminate this hassle. With streaming platforms, you can access a vast library of content without having to worry about setting up recordings or adhering to specific broadcast times.
3. **Flexibility in content selection:** Streaming services offer an extensive catalog of movies, TV series, documentaries, and original programming, ensuring a diverse range of options to suit individual interests. This allows viewers to explore and discover content on their own terms, tailoring their media consumption experience to their preferences.
4. **Catch-up and backlogging:** With streaming services, there's no need to worry about missing out on episodes or seasons of your favorite shows. You can catch up on missed episodes or even start watching a series from the beginning at any time, as past seasons or episodes are often available on the platform. This flexibility allows viewers to stay up-to-date with ongoing series or delve into older content at their own pace.

# Addressing Media Fragmentation

One of the most significant arguments for streaming services becoming as bad or worse than cable TV revolves around the issue of media fragmentation. This aspect holds the greatest potential to sway my viewpoint, as it touches on subjective preferences and individual perspectives. Let's delve into this topic further:

Media fragmentation, the distribution of content across various streaming services, is often cited as a drawback of the streaming landscape. While it is true that different shows and series are spread across multiple platforms, it is important to consider individual preferences and the expanding range of content offered by streaming services. From my perspective, the impact of media fragmentation on the overall streaming experience can be subjective and dependent on personal media taste. As someone who chooses to watch something based on the interestingness of its plot and premise, my preferences prioritize the ideas and concepts presented in a piece of media rather than its technical aspects, such as acting or production quality. I believe that effective communication of ideas and the potential for further discussion are more significant than the specific execution or critical acclaim of a particular show or movie.

In this context, media fragmentation becomes less of a concern for me. While it may result in some shows or series being scattered across different platforms, streaming services typically offer a wide selection of content within similar genres or purposes. Additionally, the expanding catalog of original content ensures a continuous and diverse range of options that rarely leave the streaming service, providing a satisfactory replacement.

To illustrate this perspective, consider the following analogy: Imagine you have a craving for pizza, and your favorite is Papa John's. However, Pizza Hut is also nearby and offers a similar pizza with the same general ingredients. Although the taste profile may be different, both options can fulfill your practical desire for pizza. In this scenario, if Papa John's is closed, I would choose to order from Pizza Hut, as the specific brand becomes less important compared to satisfying the craving for pizza itself. The practical benefits and enjoyment of the experience are comparable, even if it's not the absolute ideal choice.

In summary, while media fragmentation can be seen as a potential drawback of streaming services, its impact can vary depending on individual preferences and priorities. For those like me, who prioritize the ideas and concepts presented in media and are open to exploring different platforms, the wide selection of content within similar genres and the continuous stream of original programming make streaming services a suitable alternative. The fragmented distribution of shows and series becomes a minor concern when the focus lies on the enjoyment and engagement derived from the content itself."

1,2023-06-28,CMV: The red pill and black pill do have a lot of harsh truths that men that struggle with dating should accept and come to terms with,u/KillaHotel,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14lctpf/cmv_the_red_pill_and_black_pill_do_have_a_lot_of/,changemyview,"I wouldn’t call myself an incel or red pilled, but I have read a lot of the things those groups of people have said, and I have experienced them to be true in my own life. A lot of these things are even common beliefs of normal people have and give as dating advice. 

There are certain groups of men who are just simply destined to be alone because they were born in some way genetically inferior. It’s been this way since humans were humans. [There’s a reason why humans have about twice as many female ancestors than male ancestors.](https://qz.com/1218680/the-science-of-sex-differences-is-nothing-for-feminists-to-be-afraid-of#:~:text=Men%20can%20vary%20much%20more,could%20take%20offspring%20for%20granted) This is simply nature taking its course and ensuring inferior stock don’t pass on their inferior genes.

This is something that we can observe even today as women are more likely to have children and more likely to be married than men. These are objective facts that would align with incel/red pill ideology and show that the odds of sexual success are against men.

On my point of the crossover between normie and redpill advice, I’d like to point to the idea of AFBB. This stands for Alpha Fucks, Beta Buxx. It means that women, when with “alphas” give themself fully to them sexually. They engage in this behavior while they’re (late teens to mid 20s) in their physical and sexual prime. 

Since “alphas” have their pick of women, they move through leaving a wake path of broken heart. This jades women and when they hit the wall at around 28, they realize they can’t get an alpha and get a “beta”. A safe dependable guy that’s willing to support her financially and emotionally, this is something you can’t get from the “alpha” but you have to trade in sexual attraction and chemistry. So they settle for the nice beta and just give up good enjoyable sex fire safety. I mean there’s a reason so many men talk about how their wives stopped sleeping with them after marriage, it’s because they aren’t as attracted to them.

So of course this sounds like nonsense incel speak. But if I tell you the pretty common advice given to guys in my age range in my situation that, “girls are just immature right now and looking for short term fun and aren’t looking for guys who would be good long term, just wait until your in you late 20s, women will be looking for intelligent, sensitive guys” (this is something told to me by my therapist as “advice”) it’s the exact same theory just said in a nicer way to make the guy in the worse position feel better about their shitty destiny.

I feel that there are other crossovers but I’ve stated my view and am open to changing it as if I saw legitimate reason to change it, I would be a lot more hopeful in my current situation."
1,2023-06-28,"CMV: Most communities are echo chambers.

Racism, homophobia, ableism etc. tend to be filtered out of communities in order to protect the mental health of community members who are apart of these marginalised groups while also upholding a civil and non-toxic environment. This is an echo chamber because it causes a lack of exposure to alternative viewpoints. This specific type of echo chamber is the most popular form of echo chamber we see on the internet today and can be seen in places like music communities, gaming communities, art communities etc. I classify this form of echo chamber as harmless. An etiquette is required to form a community which considers the mental health of the members within it.  


The actual issue we have with ""echo chambers"" are the ideas they are echoing. Political echo chambers, conspiracy echo chambers, hate groups, pseudo-science or anti-science echo chambers, etc. These echo chambers are harmful due to the inherent world-shaping views that come with them. There is a difference between an echo chamber with a focus on creating a civil environment and an echo chamber that tries to pull you into a specific way to view the world and how the world should work. Forming one's perspective on how to view the world and how the world should work is a process that requires exposure to various ideas and constant willingness to hear out other perspectives.

EDIT: Gaming is not a vice, I am just using the term vice as a list of possible things related to escapism. Thanks for pointing that out.

I am someone who is unable to handle reality and need an escape, something that can be used to dull the mind. I already go to the gym and jog and am seeing a psychologist, but it is not enough when you existentially can't handle fundamental reality. Nihilism, realizing life is unfair and always has been, etc. Philosophy makes me more depressed - Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, moral relativism + hedonism + consequentialism, etc.

I will now list the flaws of each vice (having to spend money is already assumed).

Alcohol - Liver issues, hangovers, chance of becoming an alcoholic. I al

Drugs - addiction, illegal, tolerance gained over time. In my country weed is not legal

Smoking - lungs, looked down on and banned in a lot of public spaces, smell gets into furniture

Gaming - carpal tunnel, dry eye syndrome, bad posture.

I think gaming overall is the least worrisome form of escapism. And I won't be an edgy gamer or a troll and stuff like that, no harassing people online.

If anyone knows any other vice that is pretty safe and does not hurt you long term please recommend it and I will give you a delta, but it must be better or very close to the gaming vice.

Personhood can therefore be argued in favor of life or argued away based on whatever subjective definitions are attributed to the concept. We know when a fetus/baby is present that it’s there and it’s alive and it’s normal process to grow and develop. We know it’s alive but the question can be “begged” what is “a life?”. A human can be “alive” but not living “a life” which for the sake of argument means self determination based on self perceived notions of “personhood”. Still, terminating a human life based on a subjective understanding of a lack of personhood is my opinion unethical. We don’t know if it’s a person or not. 

Arguing in favor of abortion by claiming the absence of personhood is a non starter because outside of philosophical notions the personhood can’t be quantified. 

It is evident however that personhood does exist in our culture and we all act like it does.  But when life begins is not subject to debate since life begins at conception. 

Ideas like “having a brain” or “consciousness”does not prove or disprove personhood since the idea of personhood only relies on reasoning not scientific facts. Therefore the ethical thing to do is to protect the fetus until “personhood” can indeed be quantified. Since practically speaking we know personhood exists but can’t directly pinpoint when it begins the ethical thing to do is to presume personhood in favor of the fetus/baby."

Feeding an animal anything other than it's natural diet is morally wrong. 

You may have heard that cats ""are obligate carnivores"", meaning cats need animal protein to survive.

Science has proven that cats shouldn't be on a vegan diet. People who are vegan will point out that cat food is highly processed and has to be supplemented with the nutrients and amino acids cats need to survive. They aren't wrong, but meat based cat food is formulated with a cats biology in mind. It's not as easy as creating plant-based food which is supplemented with the nutrients and amino acids cats need. Cats lack the enzymes needed to digest large amounts of plant material and their teeth have evolved to kill small mammals. They don't have the teeth that herbivores do. There's other biological reasons why cats shouldn't be on a vegan diet.

I am aware that there are a few studies out there that suggest cats can thrive on a vegan diet. The problem with these studies is that it's based on cats owners observations. We need studies conducted by veterinarians that are peer-reviewed. If science proves that cats can thrive on a vegan diet then I will change my view.

And if the users do decide to make comments to get karma, they usually post a lot of comments in a lot of places, essentially spamming the subreddits, which creates the exact problem Reddit tried to avoid.

The only people that karma limits actually benefit are people who already have a lot of karma in the first place, because they get to keep their power while the others below them (bots or otherwise) can’t make posts that would make the subreddits any different.

However, it bugs me when people act like art is 100% subjective and there is no degree of objectivity to it. 

I don't care what anybody says, Beethoven's 5th symphony is objectively better music than a monkey smashing random keys on a piano. If I draw a stick figure on a piece of notebook paper, that is objectively worse art than the Mona Lisa. Obviously these are extreme examples, but they illustrate the point that there is some objectivity to it. 

If there was no objectivity to art, then things like music theory wouldn't exist. Notes and chords that are well organized into an actual scale are objectively better than a bunch of random notes with no rhyme or reason to them. In music production, having a bunch of clashing sounds in one small band of frequencies is objectively bad. Having a full song that encompasses the entire frequency spectrum with no major clashes is objectively good. If a band is doing a live performance and someone is making a bunch of mistakes and unintentionally playing off tempo, that is objectively bad. If a rapper perfectly delivers every bar in one live show, that performance is objectively better than one where they slip up and male a bunch of mistakes. 

I've mostly focused on music because that's what I know the most about, but it applies to other forms of art as well. A bug or glitch in a video game is objectively bad. A grammatical error or misspelling in a book is objectively bad. Continuity errors in a movie are objectively bad.

A lot of these examples I've mentioned are mostly technical errors and mistakes, but even the overall creative vision has some degree of objectivity to it as well. Obviously this is much more subjective, but it's not completely subjective either. A creative work of art delivering an original and novel experience that influences many other is objectively good. Derivative copy catting is objectively bad. I will clarify, yes there is some original stuff that sucks, and some derivatibe stuff that rocks, I'm just saying objectively speaking originality adds ""points"" and lack of originality subtracts ""points"" from the quality of the art. 

Another thing I want to clarify is that an artwork having some objectively bad elements of it doesn't mean the entire thing is objectively bad, it just means that those elements are objectively bad. It could still subjectively make up for it in other ways. The same applies vice versa."

Some examples include DoorDash asking for you to tip before a delivery is made, counter service places asking for you to tip before serving your food, etc. I've become increasingly skeptical of tipping at all, but assuming tipping is a legitimate custom, its purpose is to pay extra for service in addition to the product you are receiving (ie a counter service restaurant is providing the ""product"" of your food and the ""service"" of taking your order, making changes to it if needed, bringing the food to you or calling your name, etc. Your tip ranges in percent based on the quality of this service. If this is the purpose of tipping, then I believe you cannot provide a fair tip evaluating the restaurant's service before receiving the service, and therefore should not be expected to tip unless you've already received the full service (for example, tipping at the end of the meal at a table service restaurant).

Edit: To clarify, I mean that it is perfectly ethical to not tip - not that one shouldn't tip if they feel it will result in them receiving better service."
4,2023-06-28,CMV: Naruto glorifies unhealthy relationships,u/Ok-Scarcity7428,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ll6cp/cmv_naruto_glorifies_unhealthy_relationships/,changemyview,"First, I will be getting into Naruto and Sasuke's ""friendship"" although it is not the worst example. Sasuke and Naruto's relationship wasn't that bad at the start of Part I. But it quickly falls apart after the first 1-2 arcs. By the end of Part I, Sasuke has willingly deserted the village and he has attempted to kill Naruto numerous times. 

Despite Sasuke's betrayal, Naruto spends the rest of the series wanting to bring him back so they can continue being friends. It only gets worse in Part II. Sasuke joins the Akatsuki, he attacks an international meeting, he has attempted to kill all of Naruto's loved ones, he wanted to destroy Konoha. He basically plotted to kill every man, woman, and child in the village. The manga/anime ends with Naruto & Sasuke blowing each others arms off and suddenly being best friends again. This sends the message that you should CLING to toxic people in your life because maybe one day, they will change. 

Now the greatest offender is Sasuke and Sakura. Sakura developed a crush on Sasuke when she was 4/5 years old, and then she just stayed obsessed with him for the rest of her life. 

Sasuke has verbally/physically abused Sakura, disregarded her on several occasions, attempted to kill her as well as her loved ones, and he plotted a genocide against her village. 

Not only does Sakura forgive him for all this, but she then MARRIES him and has his child. It doesn't get better in Boruto either.  

Sasuke is an absent father/husband who is consistently shown to be neglectful towards his family. Despite this, the Boruto writers pretend this is a normal/healthy marriage."
1,2023-06-28,Cmv: Movies are the Worst Form of Story Telling,u/PerformerEmotional25,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ll8r7/cmv_movies_are_the_worst_form_of_story_telling/,changemyview,"Movies are the worst form of story telling because they are restricted to 90-150 minute run time. Not saying that there are no good movies.My favorites are usually sci-fi because they tend to have the most unique plots for movies (even though I usually like traditional fantasy more). The problem with movies is that with the time restriction makes most of them feel the same. The main character and villain won't die until the end, the love interest has a 50% chance of dying, etc. With books, shows, longer format shows (1 hour episodes), anime, and even video games you get more of the world, lore, characters, etc. A 12 episode a season show that has 20 minute episodes has 4 hours of story tellings. That's already double the time of most movies. I get that movies are good for people that are busy and there are some good ones. But 90% of them are the same boring formula that always leave me wanting more. Lastly movies used to be the peak of production quality. But now these 1 hour episode shows get the same level of production, if not more. And you don't have to sit there for 90+ minutes at a time. So while movies did have their time in the sun, they are outdated and the worst form of story telling.

Edit- I understand they aren't literally the worst. I meant out of popular modern forms of entertainment."

My day always goes better when I purposely have a good mood than a bad one, things work out and line up better. I’m trainjng my brain OUT of automatic pessimism which is what society brainwashed upon the majority. 

Where “realists” 

A HEALTHY dose of realism is fine and necessary. But extreme realists are too delusional and lazy to realize they hold themselves back more than the big bad real world does. 

And before we bring up mental illness or physical disability or being a racial/sexual minority(all valid, Im black and non-heterosexual) many self described realists are ALSO heterosexual, able bodied, sound minded white males. 

Childhood trauma(which happens to all races, genders, sexual identities, economic classes, religious beliefs or lack of etc.) is also valid and I can attest to it but if you want something you gotta find a way to cope.

What’s wrong with being positive? And how is pessimism any LESS delusional than optimism when taken to the extreme?"
1,2023-06-28,CMV: There’s no such thing as “game” people either find you attractive/interesting or they don’t,u/MattGaetzHater,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14llw7m/cmv_theres_no_such_thing_as_game_people_either/,changemyview,"I don’t think that game, rizz, or whatever the hell people are calling it nowadays really exists.

I’m going to talk about this from the perspective of men, because men are the ones that are typically doing the work to get a date or hook up, or whatever end goal between two people.

I think that the idea of rizz evolves from the same vat of acid that the idea of a “friend zone” does. That you can perform some button combo on a woman and she’ll blow you. I think that it’s a binary, a yes or a no. All a man can do is, is strengthen the yes or go to a no. You cannot go up the scale, a no will always be a no.

I think that when meeting new people, especially on things like dating apps, or in public high energy spaces, parties, bars, night clubs, and even in low energy places (bookstores, coffee shops) women decide whether a guy has a chance before she even knows his name. Usually subconsciously. 

This can be because of personality but I think it is mostly because of physical appearance. After all, most women are not finding a guy who is ugly a chance. When a woman gives a guy a chance it is because she is on some level interested and finds the guy physically on some level. I would count this as a “yes, she is interested” otherwise, there is no chance. 

From that yes, the only place a guy can go is down. He can make himself look uglier physically or personality wise (like doing something that gives the gives the woman the ick) or he can simply reaffirm the yes. I wouldn’t count this as going up the scale as you’ve already in a since won.

You’ve achieved the goal of making her like you enough to be worthy of her time and attention. That’s the goal of rizz and that’s as far as rizz will get you and in most cases it’s already decided."
38,2023-06-28,CMV: The definition of gender is incoherent outside of its relation to sex.,u/Gilgamesh_45,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14lm095/cmv_the_definition_of_gender_is_incoherent/,changemyview,"In all debates about gender, the first point brought up by the leftist is the existence of cultural norms around gender. However, this is not a proper definition of gender because a transgender woman can fit none of these roles and still be considered the gender she identifies as by these people. Of course these roles are separate from sex, but when a person says that they are transgender they refer to some personal identity, not to a set of social standards. When a biological male says that they are a woman, they are not asking to be integrated into some web of stereotypes; really, the only necessary condition is the word ""woman"" and the pronoun ""she"", and nothing else is asked of this person. And we do not judge cisgender women as women because of their adherence to cultural standards, but only by their identification.

But identification cannot be the only aspect of gender, as that would be entirely self referential. There must be some external standard being referenced, and that would much better be identification with biological sex, rather than with cultural standards. The only reasonable definition for a woman which can include transgender people is ""One who strongly desires to be a part of the female sex"". It is for this reason why I reject xenogenders, such as cat-gender or dog-gender.

By reproducing, those people are spreading diseases to their ofspring. Not only that, they also lower the quality of the genetic pool, thus increasing the percentage of diseased individuals in the future generations.

Its worth noting that I do not believe that those suffering from genetic illnesses should be FORCED to not reproduce, since the creation of a govermental organization responsible for determining who's capable of reproducing would be too dangerous. Instead, abstinence from reproduction should be voluntary.

Also, i believe that people carrying genetic disorders are equal to everyone else and deserve the same rights as the rest of the population."

If some 70- or 80-year-old billionaire dies after decades of harming people and destroying the planet, then nothing has really changed. Any celebration of their death is just sour grapes. Their harm on the world was mostly over anyway.

But if a 19-year-old billionaire dies BEFORE he has any chance of harming people and destroying the planet, then an actual problem has been solved. That’s 60 or 70 years of exploitation that the world avoided. Just poof! Gone! No need to worry about that twerp anymore.

Avoiding 60 years of exploitation is better than avoiding 10 years, assuming you believe that’s what billionaires do.

When I say a belief has a good reason to be believes I mean there is a direct or indirect reason for why that person believes it 

Most simple example I can think of: When you are holding an apple in your hand and let it go it will fall towards the earth, the direct reason for this belief would be everything you let any other object go of your hand it fell towards the earth.

Now a bad reason would be that you believe in something because it is related to you

Most simple example: You like Keanu Reeves, he says something about reality, you believe what he says because it is Keanu Reeves who says it

Now, when I see people who practice religion a clear pattern emerges. The people who are Muslim are born in Muslim families, people in Jewish families are Jewish, people in atheistic families are usually atheists and so on. If they were born in a different country or family that practiced different religions they would have that different religion and a lot of people believe it just happens that the religion they were born into is the real one and that the other ones are fake. But that means that most people believe in their religion because their parents do as well and if we follow the example we would get this you trust your parents, your parents say that a certain religion is true, you believe it is true because your parents say it"

I've tried many times to find a subreddit for general debate, but the discussion ones seem to be more popular. 

But aside from my personal enjoyment, aside from the intellectual exercise aspect, I think debate serves a very important purpose that conversation is often not able to- it exposes flaws in people's logic and it makes it more difficult for bad-faith actors to pull the wool over people's eyes. 

There are plenty of bad faith actors who will use underhanded tactics to persuade others that their view is correct. Tactics like False premises, snuck premises, fallacies, ad hom attacks. I think this is especially true of more extreme positions that are harder to defend. 

And in discussions, bad-faith actors can easily steamroll the person they are talking to because the other person is not looking for/is not aware of those tactics. Whatever they say goes unchallenged and if they know how to use words to persuade they can convince people of all sorts of things that are just not true. (Some people are good at weaponizing the other person's words against them and the other person doesn't understand what's going on.) 

Debates expose these tactics because in a real debate both sides are competing to win, sometimes with ideas they don't even believe in. So they're looking for tactics and holes. 

There are plenty of situations where debate is inappropriate, but the idea that debate is just an intellectual exercise for people with large egos is unfounded- and often, from what I've seen, perpetuated by the people with positions that do not stand up in debates. In my view, debate is a critical tool."

They aren't the type of game that you can sit down for hours at a time and grind out, like normal Console/PC games. I get that this may be the point of VR, but it really does feel like a lesser system when compared to other, superior platforms. The people that praise VR for it being ""revolutionary"" are only speaking off of the fun first time they had, where they've been messing around on some game for 30 minutes.

Anyone who lets cats free roam intentionally shouldn't own a cat. (I'm not talking about an inside cat that accidentally slips outside, mistakes happen), but people who willingly let their cat roam the neighbourhoods at all hours day or night. Cats should be indoors or in a controlled outdoor cat run.

I'm in a lot of community groups and lost and found pet groups and every second post is about someone who's found a cat hit by a car or someone's outdoor cat who ""usually comes home by now"" but has been missing over a week. Always with extremely distressed and stressed owners heartbroken over something that can be completely avoidable if they were just a responsible cat owner.

Reasons you shouldn't let your cat free roam:

\- They can be hit by cars. And they do... a lot. I've personally witnessed this so many times and it's always heartbreaking. And can also be traumatic for the poor driver who was just trying to drive at night while a cat darts in front of their car.

\- They can get into fights with other cats, lost or stray dogs or wildlife. I've known people who's cats have come home completely bloodied and torn up and yet they \*still\* let them out. It just makes no sense to me.

\- They can ingest poison, bait or a baited animal or something else harmful.

\- They could wander into someone elses shed or garage and accidentally get locked in without a person knowing. I've heard of dead cats being found weeks after they went missing because they were locked in a shed with no food or water.

\- They are at a much higher risk of many preventable diseases such as Feline leukemia, feline AIDS, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), toxoplasmosis, distemper, and rabies can be difficult to detect and, in the case of FIP and distemper, impossible to test for.

\- You are dramatically limiting their lifespans. Many studies have shown that indoor cats live 10-20 years on average. While the average for outdoor cats is much lower at only 2-7 years. You are literally cutting your pets life short.

\- There are creepy people out there who hate cats, and harm them by trapping, shooting or hunting them.

All of this doesn't even take into account the millions of native wildlife cats destroy yearly.

As a lifelong pet owner and lover I just can't understand why so many people are fine with just not not seeing their animal for sometimes whole days or more at a time, not knowing where they are or what they could be doing. Also knowing just how many bad side effects there are including literally a lowered lifespan I can't understand how anyone who claims to care for their cat would do this.

Cats that are given an outdoor run or lots of toys and enrichment indoors live long, happy and fulfilled lives.

Also, this is coming from someone who has worked at or volunteered at wildlife shelters, dog and cat rescues and adoption centres my whole life. I've seen first hand the damage or free roaming cats literally hundreds of times.

EDIT: To the person in this thread who's argument for letting cats outside was that ""only two"" of your cats have been hit by cars. Thank you for inadvertently showing exactly why people shouldn't let cats out. The fact that you think it's fine and normal that two of your cats have been hit by cars and that you are okay with that is downright insane."

This is towards the general furry ""culture"", and this is not meant on a direct attack towards anyone who practices this hobby. Most furries are not zoophiles, this is how the community encourages it.

So, I believe most of the furry fandom is made of artists or viewers of NSFW art. Keep in mind this does not apply to every furry, as they vary in age, what they view, if they even make art, etc. However, these studies argue that 50.9%-90% (approximately) of men view NSFW furry art/pornography, and 30.7% of women view it. ([https://furscience.com/research-findings/sex-relationships-pornography/5-4-frequency-of-porn-use/](https://furscience.com/research-findings/sex-relationships-pornography/5-4-frequency-of-porn-use/)) Even without this statistic, its hard to search ""furry art"" and not come across a majority of NSFW art.

Most furries who view this content do not intend real animals. But I believe that sexualizing anthro animals is a form of zoophilia, and at the least encourages it. Fetishizing animals or animal traits is zoophilic traits.

Again, furries are mostly not zoophiles, but the community producing this art and not frowning down upon fetishizing animals is pretty zoophilic.

Finally, the ocean is commonly accepted as a final resting place for many. While I sympathize with the loved ones, I do not believe that public funds should be expended to recover remains of people who knowingly took a gigantic risk that they would end up dead in the ocean.

People like Ted bundy had to deal with shitty parents that worked all the time and the public school system where he was bullied. Gacy had to deal with an overworked alcoholic of a father that was extremely abusive and set him at odds with his siblings simply for being a boy. 

In a society where the people are prioritized and struggle is rare, the statistics of things like violence, robbery, and drug use plummet. I think that if we changed the system it would either totally eliminate people like Bundy or Gacy from being created and make the few that do experience those urges susceptible to rehabilitation. 

I live in the States of America, so maybe if prevention was a priority instead of prosecution, then we’d have better than half a chance of solving a murder and be preventing them instead; there’s only about a 50% solving rate for murders in the states, so under the current system the establishment is churning out murderers than rehabbing them."

To me, it's a bit hard to believe, and it sounds like it comes from someone very sadistic. Why do people boil lobsters alive? Is it more humane/necessary than any of the other ways to cook a lobster?"

And I’ve always disagreed based solely on perhaps a lack of understanding. What I know of communist countries is not good. The small bit I know of socialist countries is not good. What I know of the American system in not perfect but I still see it as better than What anyone else has to offer.

That said I am very open to changing my views. I don’t know enough about socialism and those that spoke of it never adequately described it. 

Note that my standard of adequate isn’t give me every single detail down to the wire. That’s illogical even experts on American democratic republic could not do such a thing.

Where I struggle is that the views offered seem idyllic. Yes. I love the idea of helping my neighbors and having a decent standing in life. But I don’t see how a socialist system delivers on its own. Doesn’t it need to hijack the already built American economy to do so? Isn’t that what’s it’s done elsewhere? Waited until things were built then taken them? 

I saw something of a kind in Karl Marx’s manifesto having read it once over. 

How does socialism differ from his ideas?

If implemented today in the United States….. how would it work in specifics?

Not every aspect….  That’s too much too demand in one sitting. But a single aspect. Justice system, branches of government, the workforce, housing, business? 

Can the details of any ONE part of that be given and compared to the American system in detail so that a comparison can be drawn and show socialism better?"

I'm also not a troll. 

I am not privilliged beyond having somewhat good health. My childhood was not sunshine and roses. My parents were not always there. Money was always lacking. I'm not from a wealthy country full of opportunities. So here's my view...

Basically, 90% of what happens to you is your fault.

Lack of money and sh\*\*ty finances - your own fault

Bad relationships - your fault

Fat, unhealthy - your fault

Unhappy, miserable - your fault.

Reserve the 10% for tragedies, illnesses, genetic factors, natural and economic disasters, unforseen events.

My view ultimately is play the hands you were dealt and stop blaming external factors that you have no control over. Lost your job - well you could have saved, could have increased your skills and value to be less replacable, could have built an emergency fund. You are the only solution you have to your own problems. It;s not the gov's fault. It's not the economy. It's not your dad who beat the shit out of you.

Brothers stand together.  
From the Meuse to the Neman

Their old respected fame,  
To inspire us to noble deeds  
For the length of our lives.  
German women, German fidelity,  
German wine and German song.

**3rd verse (only this is in the current anthem):**  
Unity and Justice and Freedom  
For the German Fatherland!  
After these let us all strive  
Brotherly with heart and hand!  
Unity and Justice and Freedom  
Are the security of happiness.  
Bloom in the splendour of this happiness,

\---------------------------------------

Okay, so tell me... What's wrong with this anthem? Please tell me, because I can't see anything wrong with it.

**This anthem was written in 1841, before Germany EVER became an united country.**

**The German Empire (first united German nation) was formed in 1871.**

30 years later after the lyrics of this potential anthem of an united Germany was written, the German Empire formed. The imperial anthem called ""Heil dir im Siegerkranz"" continued to be the anthem until 1922, when the first German democratic state was formed. That's when this anthem was adopted. Were the original German democrats nazis? Of course they f\*cking weren't!

Most of them were killed due to being in opposition to the nazi regime.

The original meaning of the song was **Germany above all in the sense that ""we must prioritize an unified Germany above all."", as it would greatly impact the lives of all Germans. Just unifying the smaller German states at the time into an unified Germany made it a superpower.**

**It's a patriotic song, and there's nothing wrong or hateful with it. Its meaning was to unite Germany, and that happened. Eventually, it became the anthem of a democratic Germany in 1918.**

Then... *some years later...*

**Hitler comes to power. He slowly completely transforms the once-democratic country into a horrible authoritarian and dystopian regime. He managed to get so much power of the nation, nobody could stand against him.**

As the nazis got control of the country, the ""Deutschlandlied"" anthem continued to be the anthem of the country. It was **heavily used and changed its meaning: ""Germany above ALL OTHERS!"", instead of ""We must prioritize the unification of Germany above all!"".**

But today? The first and second verses are **banned in Germany IIRC.** Showing national pride in Germany is apparently illegal. **The nazi's didn't make the anthem. The anthem had a completely different meaning. Why pretend that the anthem has anything to do with nazis, when it was written for a completely different purpose.**

This is my opinion. I think it's very wrong to humiliate the German anthem like this. There's nothing hateful with it. It only promotes unification for Germany. Yet people hate on it. Because ""German=nazi"", amirite? Not.

I highly doubt anyone will be able to CMV about this, but if you want, here's a challenge: **Try. Just try.**"

I do not know of any atrocity to have both had such strong and large goals, and have gotten so close.

I am quantifying evil by the scale and the goal of extermination.

I believe that the Holocaust was truly worse than anything else we have done as humans. 
As a Jewish person who has visited concentration camps and recognize how it killed all of my extended family, I see how it is different than other atrocities.
In other genocides, the government has only attempted to mass murder populations within its borders and control. In the Holocaust, the Nazis sought to kill all Jews, and expanded as well as got Jews from other countries, and most importantly, the goal of the Nazis was extermination, unlike other genocides.

Additionally, the lack of help from the rest of the world is astonishing. Knowing that German Jews were in danger, countries from all over the world stood by and watched, taking in only minuscule amounts of us. World War II was not fought over Jews or any of our rights, it was fought over land. The rest of the world failed us.

Admitting error: my knowledge of the Holocaust is far more extensive than that of other genocides, and I have a personal connection to it, making my belief more strong

This implies that people do not make the 'best' decisions for themselves due to these biases. 

There is also the problem of information asymmetry, unequal access to information as well as unequal capacity for comprehension, means an average individual is not able to make the best decision for themselves. 

People on average tend to overvalue short-term rewards over long-term benefits, a phenomenon called hyperbolic discounting.

The endowment effect also comes into play, where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.

All of these reasons (though certainly not an exhaustive list) imply the average person is not equipped or capable of doing what is best for themselves. I welcome you to CMV!

Just to be clear, I'm speaking about individuals' capacity for making the best decision for themselves not a collective of large groups performing an analysis on a given proposition.

I've been seeing her videos on the regular for the last 3 years ever since she started daily vlogging. and even before that I was a huge fan of miranda and colleen as a person and watch her videos occasionally. 

recently she's been accused of grooming, and being inappropriate with fans much younger than her in group chats. and while i've seen the screenshots, i can't help but feel at my core, that people are mischaracterizing and ripping her actions out context, quite simply put she's not that kind of person. genuinely. I know it's silly to say you feel like you know someone by just watching the 10 minute videos they post every day of their everyday lives, but genuinely. she's spent the last 3 years dedicating herself to being the kindest sweetest human being online, going out of her way to do cancer fundraisers (yes the money was all donated check the website), talk about relevant issues such as book bans and share her lovely parenting tips, and cute videos of her children. it seems completely out of character the way her actions are being potrayed. it's physically hard to believe that those are the same people. because they aren't. it sounds currently like people are taking everything in the worst possible sense and shaming her for it

and its almost gut wrenching watching adam mcintyre post 20+ videos about this drama he's created with her. sure you've had an adverse experience no one is denying that . but why make so many videos documenting this. and why are they all monetized. and why is all the content from your channel literally just perpetuating gossip and drama and profiting off of rumours and how is that okay but colleen's very existence not. 

idk, theres just so many ways i feel about this, and im not defending colleen, i dont think she was right, but i don't think she deserves all the hate she's been recieving. and it sickens my stomach to see people like adam profiting off of demonizing her qnd taking her actions out of context, ie: demanding a public and private apology telling everyone she was completely wrong and adam was completely in the right?! or else he'll keep talking abt her like this, tell me this doesn't sound like blackmail. what actual victim does that. why not wage this war in private, contact her team? if they don't respond go to court?! if you were so damaged, demand damages to be paid?? why spill online where you know the facts cant be laid bare, where people can easily manipulate the truth. and why perpetuate the hate train on someone you disagree with and add fuel to the fire.

you explicitly said. her fans were attacking you for speaking your truth and she said and did nothing (she did btw in her apology video 3 years agoask people to be kind and not send hate to the people involved). but here this guy is doing the exact same thing but worse. literally directing the whole internet to attack someone for their past mistakes that they've already apologized for and taken full accountability for. and him pretending he's so perfect and altruistic.

idk y'all despite the allegations. i find something deeply off about all of this."

My stance comes from how the children of each of these fathers turned out, or how each of the fathers acted. Yes a amazing father can have bad children, but I believe most of the time its bad parenting which is why children have issues. 

Joe Bidens Kids:

1. Beau Biden - He worked in law enforcement and the army and passed away to brain cancer.
2. Hunter Biden - He has spent 10s of thousands of dollars on hookers, has done a lot of illegal drugs, there are videos of him with hookers and of him doing drugs. He also has cheated on his taxes. 
3. Ashley Biden - Confirmed drug addict, had to go to rehab . And her alleged Diary, that was uncovered stated how she feared Joe Biden coming into her shower. (Some people will say the Diary is fake, but I believe its real because the person who found and sold the diary was put under FBI Investigation)

Donald Trumps Kids:

1. Donald Trump Jr - Works in the Trump Organization and helped his father campaign for president
2. Ivanka Trump - Worked for Trump Organization, served as a advisor to Trump in the White House. Its weird how Trump has a sexual fascination for his daughter.
3. Eric Trump - Also worked for the Trump Organization, raised over 15 million for St Judge. 
4. Tiffany Trump - Nothing notable
5. Barron Trump - Nothing notable

None of Donald Trumps kids turned out to be drug addicts, none of Donald Trumps kids were proven to spend 10s of thousands of dollars on hookers, none of Donald Trumps kids cheated on their taxes and none of Donald Trumps kids were sexually assaulted by Trump himself. Thats why I believe Trump is a better father then Joe biden.

Example: With the recent events of the OceanGate submarine, people are beginning to think that since we can’t find human remains, and some of the metal parts of the sub were recovered, they seem to think it’s some ploy for rich people to move somewhere faraway and not have to pay for taxes. They’re really underestimating human stupidity. By doing some minimal research online, you can find out that only the pressurized part of the sub imploded and that it was specifically due to the carbon fiber. 

Example: The people that believe that the RMS Olympic and RMS Titanic were swapped and that they sunk the “Titanic” on purpose in order to commit insurance fraud. Hell, there’s a whole website (titanicswitch .com im pretty sure) that debunks almost any sort of supposed evidence that is brought in to back up this claim. Yet, people still choose to believe these conspiracy theories. If these theories were somewhat reasonable then you would see actual detectives trying to go off of them which is almost never the case.

I agree with this, but normies clearly have an arbitrary standard for following their own maxim.

  
The qualifiers are:  
⁠Be neurotypical  
⁠Be attractive in the face  
⁠Be white  
⁠Be tall

  
Failure to meet just one of these prerequisites as a man can easily disqualify you from as much as 90% of women, as shown in many studies.

  
I have included just a few of the studies below for the lurkers. Believe me, the iceberg goes way deeper.

  
Neurodivergence:  
""Autism literally doesn't matter bro, just be yourself bro, just be confident bro, even if it means you have to be confidently autistic bro.""

  
16% of autistic men are in a relationship. 46% of autistic women are.

Autistic women are more likely to have been in a relationship than neurotypical men. The majority of autistic women have had sex. Meanwhile, only half of autistic men have ever held a girl's hand.

Face:  
""Stop complaining about your face bro, Danny Devito gets chicks bro, the fact that he's a celebrity multimillionaire movie star doesn't affect anything bro.""

  
A man's facial attractiveness has been shown to be the strongest predictor of any following romantic interest, whether short-term or long-term. In fact, women tend to favor certain male faces for short-term relationships and certain other male faces for long-term relationships. As a sample's face becomes more masculine, women want to have sex with the sample more.

Race:  
""Most people aren't racist bro, stop blaming your race bro, being Indian doesn't matter bro.""  
""The numbers also show that attraction isn't color-blind. To wit:-- Among males, white guys get the most frequent responses (29 percent of the time) and are least likely to respond (40 percent).-- Indian men have the worst luck, getting responses only 20 percent of the time.""

Asian men between the ages of 25-32 have half of the relationships that white men on average do because ""a racial hierarchy explanation suggests that Asian American men will be less likely than Asian American women to be partnered, as Asian American men face gendered cultural stereotypes barring them from entry into romantic partnerships"" according to the article.

Height:  
""Girls literally don't care about height bro, you just have to be taller than them bro, like you could be 5'1 and slay the 5'0 chicks bro.""

  
""Taller men had more reproductive opportunities (more marriages, younger second wives) and used them to have more children than shorter men.""

""The positive effect of height on reproductive performance was not mediated by men’s social status, i.e., their military rank, or by the measures of academic, athletic, and military talent which helped in gaining high status.""

A startling and sobering conclusion one can reach from all of this is that a man's face, race, and height can be worth, in the aggregate, millions of dollars to women.

  
A 5'8 average-faced Asian man would need to earn $3,696,000 of additional income over the course of a 7 year marriage to be considered as equally desirable as a 5'11.5 attractive-faced white man to a white woman.

1,2023-06-29,CMV: East/SE Asian women fetishize white guys more than the other way around,u/bachataman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14mewz4/cmv_eastse_asian_women_fetishize_white_guys_more/,changemyview,"Full disclosure, I am not east asian. I'm strictly referring to americans although I have heard it's similar in Europe and Canada and Australia. I've grown up in high population east/se asian american areas in California basically my whole life. And while asian fetishization is very real, I've seen much stronger white fetishization from asian women towards white men. Of the asian women who I have discussed dating with, around 50% have explicitly said they only date white men. There is another large portion who has never said it, but their entire dating history is white men. Meanwhile, the white guys they date will have a much more varied dating history. The only asian-asian couples I see are usually actual asian immigrants from taiwan or korea or something similar. This came on my mind because recently I was at an event and almost every couple was white guy asian girl. In online discourse, people will often tell you that it's white men chasing after asian women, but everything I've seen and experienced, it's asian women selecting for white women. Also, (in real life) a lot of asian women are fine saying that they only date white men because the racism discourse around dating is only an online thing.

Edit: Someone posted this data: https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2017/05/18/1-trends-and-patterns-in-intermarriage/

It says that 54% of asian american women marry out and the vast majority is to white american men, so the data does support what I'm observing. And for the people saying it's due to who they are around, I'm taking about high asian population areas lol. There are some cities in California that have more people of asian descent than white people. Go to SF, there's a massive asian population, but you can literally go to some places or just walk around downtown SF and every couple is white male asian female. I was actually just there around 3 months ago

Edit: Some people are saying it's because white men are wealthier. However, on average, an asian man earns significantly more than a white man in America, so shouldn't asian men be the most desired by your logic?

1,2023-06-29,CMV: You can be strongly left-wing while being against sexual rehabilitation and a proponent of a harsh justice system,u/MentalDespairing,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14mfqii/cmv_you_can_be_strongly_leftwing_while_being/,changemyview,"When I say left-wing I will here be defining myself as economically socialist. I consider labour parties to be centrist but that won't really be the topic of this discussion, so please agree on this definition for now.

**I would prefer responses from other leftists.**

I am someone who sees myself as left-wing. I want socialist economics and a strong state that can help unfortunate and weak people like me who can't handle reality and/or capitalism, and I support progressive cultural beliefs. To me socialism is ethical, not a neutral Marxist analysis.

However, I have yet to vote for the socialist party in my country (they are an anti-communist socialist party, or anti Authoritarian-socialist I guess) because they view sexual crimes as something that is to be blamed on lack of education and to be rehabilitated. I find this disgusting and removes personal responsibility from the rapist. When a rapist is rehabilitated they only act better because they don't want to get caught and punished again. To me it **does not matter if the rehabilitation is successful and they never commit the crime again** \- it is the ideal of it, that it shows how the state values statistics over the crime as something bad in itself. For example, this removes the idea of>! rape !<being truly bad and turns it into something that can be overcome and might gradually make it a normal topic to discuss. It should be a shock when you discuss it because the crime is so terrible.

It's so bad that I do not trust police officer in my country and I've realized I would not report most crimes because I know the criminal won't be meaningfully punished.

I think that I am still completely in my rights to call myself socialist or left-wing even though I refuse to vote for the socialist or ANY other party. To be fair they are the only real socialist party in my country (Norway), so it's either them or nothing, except for the irrelevant ""Socialist Left Party"" which most of the time seem more like neoliberals.

1,2023-06-29,cmv: The Separation Of Men's And Women's Sports Is Inherently Sexist And Attempt To Ban Trans Athletes Underscore This,u/HelpfulCheetah8974,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14mfrjf/cmv_the_separation_of_mens_and_womens_sports_is/,changemyview,"My argument is pretty much what the title says. I've browsed a bit to find articles relating to this view and frustratingly it rarely gets made. To my mind the basic argument against trans athletes in sports (usually male-to-female, female-to-male example doesn't get surfaced much) is as follows:

Men are innately better at most or all sports than women.

Therefore, women don't have a fair chance if they are competing against men.

Trans women (i.e. born male) retain their innate superiority.

Therefore women don't have a fair chance if they are competing against trans women.

But to me this just shows how hollow the separation of sports into ""male"" and ""female"" is. Like -- if you're a woman and you get into a female league, by this logic that seems to mean nothing more than, ""Well you're pretty good -- for a woman."" The men's leagues would be at the top in terms of ability and the women's leagues would be below them (and then below them you would have leagues for people with disabilities or what have you).

What's also weird is the premise that it's unfair if people don't compete with those around their ability level. I don't have the sense that we generally place these limits on competition in society (competing for jobs, competing academically, etc.). Maybe the idea is that it's unfair for people to compete with those who have different innate ability, as the innateness is something they can't control -- but in most contexts, it's hard to distinguish between innate ability and learned ability -- so I'm still not sure if we general impose this rule.

Anyway, gender here seems to me to be a red herring. When I read these arguments, I see people observe that in sports like wrestling, people are separated into weight classes. So why not just do the same for all sports, instead of specifically separating out men and women? You could say, ""Well people are more interested in the best women athletes than the best second tier athletes"" -- but the argument as it is now seems to label women as second-tier athletes in all but name -- and I think it would be fairer to everyone if we would just assess ability (without trying to separate it into innate and acquired), then have people compete against those in the same ability level."

69,2023-06-29,CMV: The fact that Affirmative Action was banned instead of legacy admissions reveals that we have not learned anything regarding race.,u/Tessenreacts,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14mgpm6/cmv_the_fact_that_affirmative_action_was_banned/,changemyview,"As we all have heard this morning, Affirmative Action was banned under the 14th amendment. This has proven that US has learned absolutely nothing about race.

The idea was that it discriminates against whites and Asians. Here's the student body population of Harvard:

39.7% white, 13.7% Asian, 9% Hispanic or Latino, 6%, everything else is other.

The largest chunk of Harvard's student body population is white and asian. 

For MIT, it's 28.7% white, 19.7% Asian, 9% Hispanic, and only 3% black. 

That angle that black people are taking spots away from Asians and whites makes absolutely no sense from an objective statistical view. 

Now there's the issue of legacy admissions. It is common knowledge that for universities like Harvard and Standford, legacy admissions plays a major role in admissions. It's not uncommon for someone with lower GPA and other holistic metrics to get if they are legacy applicants.

There is a strong likelihood that legacy admits drastically outnumbers Affirmative Action admits, and likely also has lower GPA's than Affirmative Action admits.

The sheer fact that people are focusing on Affirmative Action rather than legacy showcases that US has learned absolutely nothing about race.

One of the largest anti-Affirmative Actions groups have consistently been Asians. Asians have frequently been an ally, co-conspirator, or unwilling beneficiary to anti-black anti-diversity campaigns since the 1960's through anti-Civil Rights Model Minority campaigns. The fact that many activist groups have not recognized the weaponization of the Model Minority stereotype to push the initiative is worrying. 

Anti-Affirmative Action activists had white and asian students front page on news outs complaining about or bashing Affirmative Action. Not unlike the 1960's.

Why is Affirmative Action made in the first place? Because African Americans literally weren't allowed to even compete academically in many educational institutions and everything else around Jim Crow policies. Affirmative Action is still needed precisely because primary schools in black communities are notoriously under-funded, thus decreasing the amount of quality applicants to elite universities.

Not addressing this fact, not addressing that legacy applicants outnumbers AA applicants really does show that we have really learned nothing regarding race. "

1,2023-06-29,CMV: Cash has little to no purpose in a developed country,u/cloud44049,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14mksqe/cmv_cash_has_little_to_no_purpose_in_a_developed/,changemyview,"I want to make it clear that there is an exception to this rule. Certain local businesses do not take cards or charge an extra fee for a card because they cannot afford to eat up the commissions that certain companies like Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express charge the merchant; in that case, I believe it’s acceptable to use cash, but most Americans don’t shop regularly or eat out regularly at Little mom and Pop shops that can’t afford to eat up the commissions most Americans shop at big chain retailers like Walmart, target Kroger, etc. or they eat at big chain restaurants ranging from McDonald’s to Olive Garden to Outback Steakhouse.

I work as a cashier at one of those big chain restaurants, and I’m genuinely scared to take cash because it is objectively more unsafe than a card. I work at a restaurant that takes drive-through orders outside, and we accept cash payments outdoors, so I have a fanny pack full of cash around me at all times. I work as a cashier at one of those big chain restaurants, and I’m genuinely scared to take cash because it is objectively more unsafe than a card. I work at a restaurant that takes drive-through orders outside, and we accept cash payments outdoors, so I have a fanny pack full of cash around me at all times. If someone sees me take a significant cash payment for an order that was maybe $100 or more because it’s pretty possible to do that at the restaurant I’m at, it’s very, very concerning because someone could see me take that money put it in my fanny pack and then come through the drive-through hold me at gunpoint and take my cash now yes, I understand. My business has insurance for this, but there’s still a risk of danger associated with carrying around that much cash at all times, so for that reason, cash is inherently unsafe for merchants as well. Cash is also dangerous for the consumer. If you have a problem with a transaction, you realize after the fact that you were overcharged for some thing and you can’t make it back to the merchant to dispute the charge then you have a slight problem you can’t contact your bank or financial institution that issued you the cash to say hey, I had a problem with the transaction now in most cases it’s not a problem because you can always go back to the merchant and dispute the transaction, but in some cases you can’t do that let’s say you’re traveling and you only realize afterword that you accidentally gave somebody $100 bill instead of a $10 bill or you accidentally gave somebody a $20 bill instead of a one dollar bill and walked away without looking for the change because you didn’t expect that much change that type of stuff happens to the consumer they think they paid for something that was worth a dollar and some change with two dollars but they actually paid with way more they walked away didn’t get their change because they only thought they pay with two dollars and they only factor change of coins that is one of the problems with cash you can’t solve disputes as easily as you can with card.  Another reason why cash is just a bad idea is because of the vast amount of rewards available for card users and not just credit card users. I understand some people don’t trust themselves with a credit card, but a debit card can also be used to maximize rewards. For example, the cash app debit card has automatic savings if you use it at certain retailers and merchants, the Coinbase debit card gives you a crypto reward every time you use it the Dogecoin debit card also gives you a crypto reward of 2% back at all eating places in the United States the Discover cashback debit card, gives you 1% up to $300 every every year you use the card so even if you don’t trust yourself with a credit card, you can still earn rewards by using a debit card and you’re really missing out on that if you’re using cash. So in my opinion, I think cash is inherently, unsafe way of doing transactions and also it has a large opportunity cost for the consumer because that consumer is missing out on so many rewards and benefits and discounts that you can get using a card."

Even though I’ve left the faith I still get intrusive thoughts that being gay is wrong secularly, I don’t want to think like this and obviously as a gay person it brings me great pain.

basically the intrusive thoughts go like this: 

being gay is bad because 

1. anal sex inherently carries a larger STI risk
2. anal sex has been shown in studies to significantly increase risk of fecal incontinence (by around 6%) as well as certain types of cancer 

to a lesser extent I also worry about the mental illness and promiscuity rates in gay people, but I think this may be able to be explained by homophobia/discrimination 

I can’t think of any other morally neutral or morally good action where there are inherent risks like this (beyond perhaps childbirth which is necessary for the species continuing) 

please help. I just want to live my life without feeling like a significant part of who I am is harmful

EDIT: Everyone who’s pointed out that anal sex doesn’t necessarily equal being gay is absolutely correct. I don’t think I can confidently say my view has changed bc I know the intrusive thoughts will just find something else to fixate on about the morality of being gay, but the logic presented here is strong. Thank you to everyone that’s tried to help, especially those who also struggle with OCD who have gently reminded me that reassurance seeking behavior tends to make intrusive thoughts like this worse. Thank you also to the people who’ve pointed out that there are many other morally neutral/positive activities that carry inherent risks, I’ve come to accept that although the argument I presented here is nominally secular the importance I attach to the health risks of anal sex vs other activities that may be more risky points to the fact that there’s still some religious underpinnings to my argument even though I’ve left the church."

1,2023-06-30,CMV: Affirmative Action: The Real Solution - Let the Free Market Decide!,u/Hardlywurking,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14mq5bq/cmv_affirmative_action_the_real_solution_let_the/,changemyview,"First off I acknowledge this is a very long post but Affirmative Action is probably the number one political issue I care about and is something I have followed for a number of decades.

Secondly, I should say in advance that I am politically an independent with a libertarian philosophy and an Asian-American male in his 40s.

In general, I am pleased that the SCOTUS overturned Affirmative Action (""AA"") today, but only in the sense that it agrees with my personal views on AA. I would rather have a system whereby the Federal Government does not get involved with making AA decisions, and that includes the Executive branch, the Legislative branch, and of course, the SCOTUS, representing the Judicial branch.

Let's state the obvious: AA is a highly-controversial topic and different groups of people can have legitimate and reasonable arguments advocating for both sides of the issue.

So perhaps the best solution to the AA debate is, rather than a ""Liberal"" SCOTUS dictating that AA should be legal or ""Conservative"" SCOTUS saying AA can't be used, **how about letting individual institutions decide for themselves?**

So, you might ask, what would such a system be? Since higher education can broadly speaking be broken down into Public and Private Institutions, I'll consider each separately.

I consider the Private Institutions policy to be more interesting and less straightforward to consider, so let's discuss Public Institutions first since this will be easier to consider.

**Public Institutions:** I view an AA policy towards Public higher learning to be loosely analogous to how the SCOTUS ruled in the Dobbs abortion case last year: leave it up to individual states to decide. Applying this concept to higher education works elegantly because most public higher education systems are at the State level.

So what would I propose? Ultimately let the citizens of each of the states vote (or their Supreme Courts) decide what the policy will be. Similar to how states many have decided their abortion policies in the post-Dobbs decision, most blue states will ultimately decide to permit AA while most red states will ultimately decide to outlaw AA.

**Private Institutions:** Here is where we should apply the libertarian concept of ""let the free market decide"" to its fullest. Those schools which want to go full-on ""America is still racist and we need AA to correct those inequalities"" can choose to do so. Those schools which want to go the complete opposite ""let's admit students based 100% on objective metrics and if our entire student body is Asian, who gives a f\*ck?"" direction can choose to do so.

Now, let's take this one step further. Consider two Private higher education institutions, one named Affirmative Academy (""AA"") and another named Master Meritocracy (""MM""). AA and MM are similar in size (both physically and number of students), variety of departments/majors, and in other areas like depth of extracurricular activities like sports teams, except that Affirmative Academy practices Affirmative Action and Master Meritocracy practices Mostly Meritocratic policies.

If we are being completely honest, MM is going to churn out graduates more qualified and desirable to private industries than AA will. Furthermore, in college ranking tables, MM will probably rank higher than AA will when it comes to job prospects for its graduates.

Of course, maybe a private institution doesn't care about college rankings or job prospects for its graduates isn't an institution's primary concern. In this case, a purely-objective based admissions system would not be the best for that school.

Moreover, these is an obvious downside to a purely meritocratic system. MM might have a student body that is majority Asian, and I can see why some people might find that less-than-desirable - or for that matter - even offensive.

AA (the school) would probably have many students who would cringe at a student body that is 70% Asian and hence would need to have AA (the admissions policy) to correct for that. AA's administration, current student body, and perhaps their alumni believe that having diversity is more important than maximizing their graduates' future income-earning potential. **And that's perfectly fine!**

So bottom line - while \*I\* personally can't stand Affirmative Action - I can see why \*others\* feel AA is necessary. **So let the the free market decide and call it a day!**

At the end of the day, libertarianism is all about making tradeoffs. While having diversity in the student body and graduating the most qualified candidates at the same time would be desirable, at the end of the day that just isn't going to happen. We all want to have our cake and eat it too. That usually doesn't happen. And sadly, like trying to have our cake and eat it too, strong diversity via AA and meritocratic admissions are ultimately mutually exclusive.

(As an aside, if I was a billionaire and could start my own College or University, I would go full-on Master Meritocracy on steroids. My student body would probably end up being 70% Asian, 25% White, and 5% Black/Hispanic/Other, and that would be okay with me. At the end of the day (or several decades later), I can rest easy knowing that I admitted the most qualified candidates using completely objective criteria and producing graduates who will be highly-sought-out by private industry.)

I will close with one final thought: One thing that I haven't seen many people - either on the left or the right - acknowledge is that college admissions is a zero sum game. If a school admits one student over another using certain criteria, yes, that ""helps"" the student admitted, but another student - who would have been admitted using another set of criteria - is ultimately harmed by that policy. In AA, helping a Hispanic student get admitted over an equally-qualified Asian student with similar objective measurements, helps one student and harms another, plain and simple."

Twitter, for instance, has a significant number of liberals, but it also harbors many neo-Nazis. Just hop onto TikTok, watch one political video, and suddenly you're inundated with similar creators who share the same ideas, objectives, and thoughts. There's zero room for critical thinking, only mindless yes-men everywhere.

This is why we see a rise in radical ideas, such as the LGBTQ+ groomer panic, where right-wing extremists demonize a minority as a scapegoat. Consequently, liberals develop an intense hatred for Republicans, leading to further divisions. In reality, most people don't care, but the hope is that at least one person takes action solely based on their radical beliefs, inspiring others to do the same.

Following this point we wouldn't say animals have free will as they don't have a sense of a ""me"" making decisions, everything is instinctive.

Race should not factor into acceptance at all, and shouldn't even be asked for in an application. As we could see from the Harvard case, students with the same scores and admission information had drastically different chances of admission solely based on race. I see that as modern racism. I understand that it may be harder for certain communities or demographics to reach the same academic level as wealthier demographics, but I don't think colleges should punish academic excellence and then reward a relatively subpar student. Other colleges are still available, and universities should only accept students who meet their strict academic guidelines, not their arbitrary ""personal scores"" as we've seen from the case. I want to understand people's perspectives on how this is fair, and why it is OK to reject students who, if they weren't a certain race, otherwise would've been accepted.

And before anyone goes for the easy diversion, I already know about legacy admissions. That's not what I care about, as I think most would agree they are wrong, and for a clear reason. I think affirmative action is less clear cut, specifically because academic performance is within someone's control, even if it may require more effort than others, but not their heritage."

1,2023-06-30,CMV: Most laws regarding a certain age limitation should be toned down,u/snide_soul,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14n1g5m/cmv_most_laws_regarding_a_certain_age_limitation/,changemyview,"I have had the belief for a long time that laws regarding minors not being able to do certain things are dumb. Most of these laws are useless, but some of these laws can be good. Here's my breakdown of all the laws:

Gambling: I think gambling shouldn't use real money but rather a virtual currency that's just for fun. After all everybody wastes their money on gambling anyway so it would save a lot of people a lot of money and allow kids to gamble.

Voting: The age requirement for voting should be lowered to 10 or 11 because we all have freedoms and one of our freedoms is the ability to vote so therefore everybody should be able to vote as long as they're able to pass some sort of test. This would count for adults too.

Driving: This might be my weirdest of all but I think kids should be able to drive once again around age 10 or 11. However instead of relying on the existing cars we should create new cars that are less heavyweights and less capable of hurting someone. That way not only can kids drive but the roads become more safer that you can't die by just getting hit by a car.

Drinking/Drugs: This is the only law I believe should not be changed, in fact I think there should be some more restrictions to alcohol usage.

So those are all my opinions, see if you can change my mind, because I've had these idealistics for a long time, but I'm open to hear other opinions."

180,2023-06-30,CMV: Social Assistance payments should be made twice per month and not all at once.,u/wekidi7516,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14nbrpc/cmv_social_assistance_payments_should_be_made/,changemyview,"Social assistance payments are all made on the last business day of the month and cover the entire month. 

(Note: I am sure that in some areas social assistance payments are made differently but in my area this is how they work.)

This leads to issues for pretty much everyone. 

For recipients it means they have to carefully budget an entire month at once and if the payment date falls on a Friday cannot get assistance until the following Monday. Getting ahold of people if there is an issue is much harder because everyone calls at once. 

For social assistance workers this makes an extremely uneven balance of work where the end and beginning of the month are far busier than the rest of the month.  

For the general public this means that the social assistance payment date is far worse for shopping as stores are flooded with people needing to send payments.

I do not see anyone who benefits from this format.

Instead they should be made with twice monthly payments and with staggered payment dates to distribute the need for support more evenly. They should be made early in the week to give more time to resolve issues before a weekend."
