In 2020, Keith Thomas suffered a diving accident that injured his C4 and C5 vertebrae, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. Three years later, an advanced clinical trial by researchers from Northwell Health’s Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research has restored feeling and movement to Thomas’ right hand.  
  
The trial, led by Chad Bouton, a bioengineer at the Feinstein Institutes, involves a procedure known as a double neural bypass, which Thomas received in 2021.  
  
A double neural bypass connects the brain, spinal cord, and body to establish mobility and tactility. During the 15-hour surgery, Thomas received five AI-enabled electrode arrays in precise regions of his brain, which are in charge of motion and feeling in his right hand. During the surgery, Thomas felt his right fingers for the first time in nearly three years.  
  
“This is the first time the brain, body, and spinal cord have been linked together electronically in a paralyzed human to restore lasting movement and sensation,” said Bouton in a statement last week.  
  
The surgery also entailed the installation of external ports at the top of Thomas’ head. The researchers hook up an AI program to these ports to perform thought-driven therapy, in which the program translates Thomas’ brain activity into actions. The AI registers inputs from Thomas’ brain and then transforms them into signals passed through externally placed electrodes on his arm that stimulate movement. In the months since the surgery, Thomas progressed and was able to move and feel his right wrist and arm, even when the equipment is switched off.  
  
“When the study participant thinks about moving his arm or hand, we ‘supercharge’ his spinal cord and stimulate his brain and muscles to help rebuild connections, provide sensory feedback, and promote recovery,” Bouton explained in the statement.  
  
Four months later, Thomas can feel his sister’s hand in his and even move his arms. This recovery could have permanent gains as his body continues to recover. This new technology, and others like it, could be game-changers for people living with spinal cord injuries."

**Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)**   


[*Photos*](https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2023/8/23/7ad79e32-44b8-43df-8293-c829198471a2-1.jpeg?w=920&h=560&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=50&dpr=2) *by Noah Berger*

  
We often take speech for granted. In a few seconds or less, brain activity fires, vocal muscles contract, and words spill out. Scientists have long sought to replicate this flurry of activity with devices called brain-computer interfaces(BCIs). But as with anything that involves the brain, it’s proved quite a challenge.  
  
Now, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence and better ways of capturing brain signals, these challenges are getting easier to overcome. This week, two research groups — one at Stanford University and the other at the University of California, San Franciso — published the results of two new brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) each team independently devised. They offer a major upgrade in terms of how fast they translate brain activity into speech, and they even digitally convey facial expressions. Both groups used their BCIs to help two separate individuals — one who couldn’t communicate due to a brainstem stroke and the other who lost communication due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (or ALS), a neurodegenerative condition — to speak again.  
  
Findings from both studies were published separately on Wednesday in the journal Nature.  
  
“These two papers are exciting because they are two independent data points that both show a big leap forward in the accuracy and generality of speech by \[BCIs\],” Francis Willett, the first author of the Stanford-led study and a staff scientist at the university’s Neural Prosthetics Translational Lab, said in a press conference to reporters.  
  
“With these new studies, it’s now possible to imagine a future where we can restore fluid conversation to someone with paralysis, enabling them to freely say whatever they want with accuracy high enough to be understood.”  
  
**A DIGITAL AVATAR**

\*\*[Photo](https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2023/8/23/dec0441d-8461-421d-bf31-903bfd6bc690-ucsf_20230522_bravo3_chang_046c.jpg) BCIs work like this: a neural implant, placed anywhere inside or outside the brain, picks up on the brain’s electrical activity. A computer analyzes the brain activity and translates it into commands that a separate device — whether a prosthetic, robotic hand, or a speech synthesizer — carries out.\*\*  
  
^(There’s a big disclaimer with all of this. BCIs can’t read minds or extract information without the user’s awareness ()**^(at least for now)**^().)  
  
To pick up on the brain’s activity, the Stanford participant, a 68-year-old woman with ALS, had a brain electrode implanted slightly into her cerebral cortex at a depth roughly the size of two stacked quarters. The UCSF participant, a 47-year-old woman paralyzed due to a brainstem stroke over 18 years ago, had a mesh-like neural implant placed at the surface of her brain above the areas involved in speech.  
  
Both BCIs used algorithms trained to recognize phonemes — or the basic building blocks of speech sounds that differentiate words from each other — from neural activity and turned that into text. For example, if you wanted to say “Hello,” the BCI would pick up on neural activity associated with four phonemes: “HH,” “AH,” “L,” and “OW.” Since there are a limited number of phonemes (a little over 40) compared to numerous words in the English language, this approach enables the BCI to decode virtually any word with high accuracy.

To train their device, the Stanford researchers had their participant spend 25 training sessions, each four hours long, teaching the BCI’s algorithm her phoneme-associated brain signals. This was done by repeating sentences chosen randomly from a large data set compiled from sample phone conversations.  


Stanford’s BCI allowed the participant to communicate at an average of 62 words per minute with an error rate of around 24 percent for a 125,000-word vocabulary, or nine percent for a 50-word vocabulary.  
  
“This means that about three in every four words were deciphered correctly,” said Willett.  
  
The UCSF participant spent less than two weeks training her BCI, tirelessly repeating different phrases from a 1,024-word conversational vocabulary the researchers created.  
  
“We decoded \[sentences\] with a 25 percent word error rate at 78 words per minute,” Sean Metzger, the UCSF paper’s first author, said during the press conference. “We also showed we were able to decode intelligible speech sounds from our participant’s neural activity. Using a clip from her wedding video, we were able to decode the sound into a voice that sounded like her own prior to her stroke.”  
  
Not only that, the UCSF team created a digital avatar — capable of expressing nine different facial expressions ranging between happy and sad — based on the participant’s neural activity. The original idea for the avatar was to provide real-time feedback to the participant as she trained the BCI, said Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon at UCSF who led the study.  
  
“Once \[the avatar\] started to work… it was a new experience for both us and our participant,” Chang told reporters. “For her to hear her own voice, to think about the words and hearing sounds coming from the machine of what she intended to say, but also to see a talking face.”  
  
**PAVING THE WAY FOR FUTURE BCIS**

  
These developments are the latest in the ongoing work of melding mind with machine, as smoothly and effortlessly as possible, for individuals in need. While companies like Neuralink and Synchron aim to commercialize BCIs for all consumers (though, for the immediate future, their goal is still to help people with spinal cord injuries and other communication disorders), the researchers of the new studies believe their findings could carry over to that market.  
  
“My opinion is that the technologies we’re describing, the algorithmic advances that both of these papers describe, are really usable with a number of different kinds of technology,” Jaimie Henderson, a professor of neurosurgery at Stanford and his group’s lead researcher, said during the press conference. “We’re not wedded to the implant itself necessarily. I think there will be many opportunities to apply the fundamental neuroscientific principles and algorithmic advances we’re currently working on to the commercial world.”  
  


[***Video (YouTube)***](https://youtu.be/SSSXPPxpsTE) ***Something like a digital avatar constructed from neural activity may even help those with physical disabilities interact with emerging social interactive platforms like the Metaverse, said Chang of UCSF.***  
  


“A lot of development is going on right now in the digital world where people can go on and essentially have meaningful interactions. This is something that’s changing society,” he said. “The key here is that people with paralysis \[and other conditions\] will have some means to participate in that more fully.”  
  
The studies are a scientific leg up, but as with any developing tech, there are improvements the researchers intend with future research. An obvious one is increasing the words per minute to bring their BCIs to conversational levels and improve decoding accuracy.  
  
“Right now we’re getting one out of every four words wrong. I hope the next time… we get maybe one out of every 10 words wrong,” said Willett of Stanford. “I think one pathway we’re excited about exploring is \[using\] more electrodes. We need more information from the brain, we need a clearer picture of what’s happening.”  
  
Henderson likened the groups’ efforts to the heydays of television broadcasting — from early receivers and grainy resolution to the brilliance of high definition and beyond.  
  
“We’re sort of at the era of broadcast TV of the old days right now,” he said. “We need to continue to increase the resolution to HD and then on to 4K so we can continue to sharpen the picture and improve the accuracy.”"

1,2023-09-01,Why Don't the Cons of Mechs apply to powered exoskeletons?,u/Visible_Regular_4178,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/167g5kn/why_dont_the_cons_of_mechs_apply_to_powered/,Futurology,"Why Don't the Cons of Mechs apply to powered exoskeletons?

Maybe the future isn't in the exoskeleton but in the segway.  Or is there something I'm missing?

&#x200B;

I don't know if this is the right place to ask this but I am looking for a scientific answer.

I'm intimately familiar with the discussions and especially the cons brought up when it comes to mechs and vehicles with feet.  Cost, complexity, weight distribution, repair/replace, armor load, speed, and profile.  Plus treads can still overcome most obstacles and terrain issues short of a sheer drop.

But usually when I read or listen to these discussions, they say that powered exoskeletons can still work.

And sure they *can* work, but would not all advantages vehicles have over mechs still apply to power suits?  Wouldn't they still be outperformed by their more simplistic competitors?

A forklift or skid steer would be easier to build, maintain, and repair than an exoskeleton.  And if it's a heavy objects indoors where most forklifts wouldn't fit, wouldn't a tiny tiny forklift still be better?  I mean, the mariotti is effectively just a frame around a person.  Wouldn't the mariotti forklift be able to do the job of an exosuit?  I mean just look at the CTX50. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And if they're still too big wouldn't it be easier to shrink existing vehicles rather than make an exosuit?

This idea that soldiers might one day wear mechanized suits to help carry a load, surely what would effectively be a motorized wheelchair could do the same.  (I'm being figurative.  I don't actually mean motorized wheelchair.  But grab an engine, some wheels, and an area to load the equipment would surely be easier than actuators for the thigh, knees, and ankles, plus a way to maintain balance.  

There's this idea that an exosuit can help a soldier carry bigger guns with more ammo, but so could the gun toting segway.  (Once again being figurative).  And there's the matter or profile, just have the control be in the laying down position so that it's more like an army of tiny tanks.  

Even the mobility.  The argument against mechs is that treads are perfectly capable of traversing most obstacles.  So there shouldn't be a scenario where a tiny vehicle with treads couldn't overcome.  

Really the only field I can think of for exoskeletons is medicine where a person will want the feeling of walking back.  

&#x200B;

When would an exoskeleton actually be better than just a tiny vehicle?"
1,2023-09-01,Theory of shared reality and the expansion of human mind,u/SalamanderOk2922,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/167pm8d/theory_of_shared_reality_and_the_expansion_of/,Futurology,"
The theory of shared reality implies that the universe is made up of two components: a physical component and a mental component. The physical component is the result of the mental activity of all human beings. The mental component is the collective part of the mind, the element of reality that is outside the control of human individuality.

The theory proposes that reality is ""molded"" by the interaction of these two components. Physical reality, or what we can perceive with our senses, is the interactive part of these two components, which means that reality would not exist without the presence of humans.

On the other hand, this theory suggests that mental reality is the non-interactive part of the two components, that is, that it exists outside the field of physical reality. This idea suggests that mental reality is both part individual and part collective, since it is related to the experience of individuals, but it is also influenced by the collective consciousness.

This implies that our individual consciousness is only a part of a larger whole, a network of collective consciousness. Every time we connect with others, when we socialize and interact with them, this component of our consciousness expands. This collective interaction determines our individual behavior, and ultimately, the way in which we perceive reality.

As this interaction continues, the evolution of collective consciousness becomes more complex and can lead to larger and deeper changes in the way we perceive reality. In a sense, we can say that our own thinking is shaping the way we perceive reality.

This theory also proposes that all individuals contribute to this collective consciousness and are, in a sense, connected in the mind. Although this may sound like something incomprehensible, there is evidence of this type of connection, such as telepathy experiments, and growing research on quantum entanglement.

Certain studies have shown that matter is not a stable concept, but is vulnerable to change. It has been proposed that matter is composed of energy in a stable state, but that, under certain conditions, this energy can be altered, which would have consequences on the matter to which it is associated.

This means that matter, although stable under normal conditions, is susceptible to change and may, therefore, not be as solid as it seems. In some cases, this change can cause the matter to be altered, under certain conditions, and therefore, it may cease to be what it normally is.

Now, as for the relationship with time, there are those who propose that time, as we perceive it, is an illusion, and that in reality the instability of matter can alter our perception of what happens in time.

So, it could be said that our perception of time, as something continuous and immutable, is based on our perception of the instability of matter and energy. Therefore, if the state of matter and energy could be altered, our perception of time could also be altered.

In this way, it is possible to imagine that an individual mind could, through a mental change, affect its perception of time and reality, which, in theory, could affect matter and time in reality. Basically, if our emotions and thoughts could alter reality.

Once you understand the idea that time and matter are, in themselves, susceptible to alterations, you can begin to imagine how it would be possible to alter them, and what this could mean.

If human consciousness could modify reality, this could imply the possibility of time travel.

Under this idea, time travel could be achieved by altering our perception of time and reality, just as it could be possible to modify matter and energy. This could, in theory, allow us to travel to the past or the future, or to change the present.

It is important to clarify that this theory does not propose that it is possible to travel through time in a physical way, that is, on a typical trip to the past or the future. Otherwise, a person could travel in time only through the modification of his perception and consciousness.

A very important point is society, with its dogmas and laws, it can limit the thought and creativity of theorists, and therefore, limit the possibilities of new theories and models that could explain the nature of reality. That is, thought is limited by culture.

It is common for theorists to be confronted with the objection of the most conservative scientists, who claim that theories must be fully defined and that all phenomena must have a direct and clear explanation.

By putting limits on theory, creative thinking and intellectual invention are limited and innovation becomes difficult.

As a result of this limitation, research focuses on a small portion of the problem, and not on the investigation of new possibilities and different visions of the world.

Therefore, we can say that culture and society establish a form of thought and a paradigm that restricts thought, preventing the integration of new ideas.

A possible solution to this situation could be to open your mind and consider all the ideas, however absurd they may seem at first. Even ""impossible"" ideas should be considered, and even more so if they take into account new scientific advances, such as the theory of relativity and advances in the field of quantum physics.

This could mean that, although we cannot accept all ideas immediately, we should at least consider them, since an idea that seems absurd at first can develop and contain very important implications. History is full of cases in which science opposed new ideas, but then these ideas ended up being fundamental.

Therefore, we can conclude that culture and society limit creativity, but that these limitations can be overcome if we open our minds to new and unexpected possibilities.

I always get really excited about the future, the new technologies it will bring, and the inevitable increases in energy that each person will utilize in such a society. After all, many classic scales measuring the development of a civilization is based off of how much energy that civilization makes.

In the past, each individual human didn't have that much power. They could use their fists, their arms, and stone tools to cut down trees and modify their surroundings. They could use their two legs to travel at a maximum speed of around 30 mph for a very short duration. Each individual human could control a few hundred watts of power at best, and generate some small scale change to their environment over a time period of a few days to weeks. 

But as technology becomes more and more advanced, now each person has access to power tools, vehicles, the power transport thousands of pounds at over a hundred miles per hour, or more with airplanes. Each person can now be on control of a few hundred thousand watts of power at a time, allowing them to unleash massive change on their environment in minutes..

It's all cool when this power is used to build and improve, but the main concern with this question comes from the destructive potential of the individual increasing as technology increases. Lets think back to the prehistoric times. If a man were to become deranged and violent, this single man might only be able to kill maybe one or two people at best before they are subdued by the village. Today, this man could potentially kill tens, hundreds, or even thousands of individuals with a gun, ramming a parade with a vehicle, or flying a plane into a building, before he could be stopped. But not even from the intentional side of things, accidents involving huge amounts of power are equally as scary. Think accidental car crashes, plane crashes or even accidental nuclear launch.

This is my primary concern with the increasing technological development as society progresses. How will we be able to address the fact that as individual power consumption increases, it also introduces a greater risk of a single person being able to cause greater and wider acts of terror? Imagine in a world where everyone had access to their own spaceship, that can go 50,000 mph (governments probably will never let this happen due to the above concerns.) One deranged person is all it takes to wipe out an entire city without warning, maybe even the entire planet. This is why while I'm excited about the prospects of humanity being able to do bigger and better things with technology, it also opens up the risks of bad people being able to inflict larger acts of violence than ever before. Is there going to be a point where governing bodies decide that the individual has too much power and limit our overall development due to these risks? Maybe in order for society to progress past this point, we'll have to find a way to completely eliminate violent tendencies from the population (unethical due to eugenics), or find a solution to death so that murder is no longer a problem (digital consciousness and revival). What do you all think?"
1,2023-09-02,Using geometry to reshape the way we think,u/SingularWithAt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1684seq/using_geometry_to_reshape_the_way_we_think/,Futurology,"Thoughts on these geometry metaphors?

The purpose of this is to get you thinking about life as geometry which can be akin to living in alternate dimensions in ways you wouldn’t think of in a normal Euclidean universe.

Title: Living in Hyperbolic Geometry: Doors to New Perspectives

Introduction:
Life is an intricate journey full of interconnected experiences, where seemingly disparate events lead us to new opportunities, challenges, and revelations. Analogous to the properties of hyperbolic geometry, the idea of moving through various doors, each representing a significant life event, allows us to explore the notion that our lives indeed exhibit a semblance of hyperbolic geometry. In this, we will delve into this intriguing perspective, drawing parallels between our existence and the mesmerizing realm of hyperbolic spaces.

Body:

1. Doors as Life Events:
Just as the concept of rooms in hyperbolic geometry captures the essence of interconnected spaces, our lives are marked by doors that represent significant events and transitions. These metaphorical doors open to new opportunities, relationships, and experiences, leading us into unfamiliar territories and dimensions.

2. Divergence of Paths:
In hyperbolic geometry, parallel lines diverge infinitely. Similarly, life often presents us with diverging paths as we encounter life-altering decisions and choices. Each decision we make leads to new possibilities and potential outcomes, demonstrating the hyperbolic nature of our journey.

3. Loss and Continuity:
In the hyperbolic space of life, we may experience losses, such as losing a job, which can be likened to exiting one room. However, just like how one can remain in other interconnected rooms in hyperbolic geometry, we find continuity in our lives, even amid loss. For instance, even after losing a job, we may still possess assets, relationships, or skills that carry forward into other aspects of life.

4. Non-Euclidean Angles of Perception:
In hyperbolic geometry, the interior angles of a triangle add up to less than 180 degrees, revealing its non-Euclidean nature. Similarly, our perception and understanding of life events can be shaped by multiple factors, often leading to non-linear, multidimensional perspectives. The intricate interplay of emotions, memories, and experiences forms a unique angle from which we perceive and interpret our journey.

5. Infinite Complexity:
Hyperbolic spaces are characterized by infinite complexity, with endlessly intertwining paths. In the same vein, life unfolds in myriad ways, with each event influencing subsequent ones, creating a tapestry of intricate connections and interdependencies.

Conclusion:

The analogy of living in hyperbolic geometry, where doors represent life events and interconnected spaces symbolize our journey, offers a fascinating perspective on the complexities of our existence. The divergence of paths, the continuity amid loss, and the non-Euclidean angles of perception illustrate the rich intricacy of life's tapestry. Embracing this metaphorical hyperbolic geometry allows us to appreciate the countless opportunities and relationships we encounter, each shaping the trajectory of our lives in profound and unpredictable ways. By recognizing the interconnectedness of our experiences, we can embark on our life journey with a newfound appreciation for the infinite complexity that defines our human existence.

(Basically imagine walking into a big room, A, and within that room you walk through another door into a room contained in room A,  room B. Now try to exit room A but remain in room B)

ADDITIONAL METAPHORS 
1. Spherical Geometry: imagining a family tree spreading out in all directions through time is a beautiful representation of interconnectedness. It shows how every individual is connected to their ancestors, and how their actions and choices can influence future generations, forming an intricate web of familial connections.

2. Fractal Geometry: Visualizing history repeating itself is an apt depiction of the self-replicating patterns in human behavior and events. Just as fractals exhibit self-similarity on different scales, human history often sees recurring themes, patterns, and cycles. Understanding these patterns can offer valuable insights into human nature and societal dynamics.

3. Projective Geometry: The diversity of perspectives and interpretations is a fascinating aspect of life. Each person's unique viewpoint shapes their understanding of events and experiences, highlighting the richness of human perception and subjectivity.

5. Chaos Theory and Fractals: Chaos theory and fractals are indeed related concepts. Fractals are complex geometric patterns that emerge from simple iterative processes, and they often exhibit self-similarity. Chaos theory deals with the behavior of complex systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. When applied to fractals, chaotic behavior can lead to intricate and unpredictable patterns, creating visually mesmerizing structures. Weather patterns and the butterfly effect are classic examples of how small changes can lead to significant and unpredictable outcomes.

imagine a chaotic fractal with set expressions and characters, altered by chaotic influences, as a creative way to envision the interplay between order and chaos. It exemplifies how even within apparent randomness, underlying structures and patterns can emerge, mirroring the complexity of life itself.

These metaphors demonstrate the power of using geometry as a metaphorical language to explore and understand life's complexities. By drawing parallels with mathematical concepts, we gain new perspectives on the intricacies of human existence and the patterns that shape our journey through time.


What are your guys thoughts on this? How could this way of thinking potentially be beneficial not just to people but perhaps for ai technology? Thinking about complex systems or events as geometrical patterns may offer new insights into understanding the world around us in a more intuitive way I believe. I really want to know what others have to say and thank you for taking the time to read all of this I hope you found it interesting at the very least."

1,2023-09-02,The Future of Copyright: Making a Case for Socioeconomic Right to Educational Entertainment,u/DebianDayman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1688trw/the_future_of_copyright_making_a_case_for/,Futurology,"Copyright law, as it currently exists in the United States, serves to protect the financial interests of creators and distributors. While the intent is commendable, the law disproportionately affects those in socioeconomically disadvantaged situations. This paper argues that access to copyrighted entertainment materials should be considered a form of education, thereby falling under the fair use doctrine for those who cannot otherwise afford such access.  
\#### The Educational Value of Entertainment  
Entertainment is more than mere amusement; it serves as a lens through which we view and interpret the world. From understanding complex relationships through drama to becoming politically aware through satire, entertainment functions as an informal education system. Therefore, denying access to such educational materials based on financial capacity is tantamount to educational discrimination.  
\#### The Limitations of Socioeconomic Status  
The costs of legal access to copyrighted entertainment materials—through cable, internet subscriptions, or direct purchases—are beyond the reach of many Americans living in poverty. In an increasingly digital age, this lack of access further exacerbates existing socioeconomic divides, limiting opportunities for cultural and educational enrichment.  
\#### Public Benefit over Private Greed  
The intent behind copyright law is to encourage creativity for the public good. Yet, when enforcement of this law suppresses the educational and cultural enrichment of a significant portion of the population, it contradicts its own purpose. The public benefit of disseminating educational entertainment should outweigh the financial interests of copyright holders, particularly when targeting impoverished communities.  
\#### Application to Fair Use Doctrine  
The fair use doctrine allows the use of copyrighted materials for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. By extending the understanding of 'educational use' to include the broad educational benefits of entertainment, those in poverty could avail themselves of copyrighted material under the protection of fair use.  
\#### Conclusion  
While copyright law serves a purpose, its blind enforcement can perpetuate socioeconomic divides and stifle educational opportunity. It's crucial to reconsider what constitutes 'educational use' under the fair use doctrine to be more inclusive and accessible for all, regardless of economic status."

I mean, some young folks currently in school might find that by the time they graduate, the job they're studying for might not realistically exist anymore.  


Given the vast changes and opportunities emerging, I've been leaning towards the idea that diving into AI-centric ventures might be one of the most strategic moves right now.

Yet one problem with this idea that’s always bugged me is how early in our history we are and how unlikely that is.

Current estimates figure there have been 117 billion or so people that have ever lived. A large number, but orders of magnitude smaller than what the entire human population would be at a single time in a galaxy completely colonized millions of years in the future.

My statistics are rusty so I can’t quite figure out the math, but if there were one quintillion people to ever live (a figure still small if we existed and expanded for millions more years) we would only be in the first 0.0117%. It seems much more likely that we would be closer to the middle. 

The current living 8 billion people make up 6.8% of all humans who have ever lived. Quite a larger percentage in a history spanning 200,000 years. Even if we’re in the first 1% of humans who will ever live (capping the future population at about 11.7 trillion) our exponential growth would suggest that we only have a few thousand years at the most. If we’re right in the middle we only have a few hundred.

Does this make sense or is my logic flawed?"

I am a pro gardener and I have studied soil science and environmentmal chemistry at university, and I build 3D printers and ebikes, and i wish to basically make a big 3D printer with a bike motor, it's a rover with a robot arm that can dig soil, use a mini weedwacker, sow seeds using a multi-compartment seed dispenser, and various other tasks... The difficulty is that I struggle to write my research as an science and academia publication, and industry report, and my first draft of the garden robot components, techno-economic assessment is just... 1st year university essay level. it totally isn't pro.... So please read some of the design that I wish to open source and advise me, i figure i need to hire a very litterate academic to rewrite everything? 

I'm using Chat GPT for phrase suggestions. it tries to write my industry report intro this way:

The contemporary technological landscape, characterized by quad-core Exynos processors boasting high RAM bandwidth, readily available computer vision libraries, affordable sensors, power-dense lithium batteries, ultrasound localization capabilities, and AI-driven object identification functionalities, presents a mature ecosystem poised to usher in a profound paradigm shift in both agriculture and domestic horticulture and landscaping. Much akin to the ongoing transformation in energy production catalyzed by the refinement of wind generator aerofoils, the current state of technology is conducive to delivering innovative solutions to domestic consumers and small-scale farms. These solutions, embodied by robots, herald a new era where traditional pesticides and extensive transportation networks become obsolete, and plastic consumption is curtailed. The result is a sustainable and cost-effective approach that enables households and small businesses to reap substantial rewards. Through the deployment of rovers equipped with economical, uncomplicated robotic arms, mechanical automation in food production can be localized and made financially accessible, effectively sidestepping the challenges of exorbitant food prices. In a manner reminiscent of how energy companies are increasingly generating power closer to consumption sites with significantly reduced waste and chemical footprints, these advancements in robotics offer the potential to revolutionize the agricultural and horticultural sectors by optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact.

Will anyone *want* to have it implanted in them? Most won't. But I'm going to briefly but clearly explain how it will nevertheless *eventually* become the norm.

In order to better solve rapes and paternity confusion, many adults will have very small things comparable to our tracker chips inserted harmlessly within their genitalia. For women specifically, it will be implanted near the cervix; for men, in their glans. Instances of a glans coming within a centimeter of a cervix will be recorded. *All* sex offenders will be legally required to undergo the surgery. Most people will prefer to not have one implanted, but most people will also prefer to have sex with only those who *do.*

I don't know which biotech company will invent them, although whoever does it I suppose I'll sue (joking?).

Anyway, that is why and how most adults will eventually have them implanted, begrudgingly.

Introduction  
Replacing Capitalism – For decades, capitalism has been the dominant economic model, driving innovation, growth, and prosperity. However, it has also led to social inequality, environmental degradation, and a focus on short-term profits over long-term sustainability (Piketty, 2014). As we grapple with these challenges, new economic models are emerging that promise a more equitable and sustainable future. Two such models—Amsterdam’s Doughnut Economics and California’s Circular Initiatives—are leading the way in redefining how we think about economics.  
Amsterdam’s Doughnut Economics: A Holistic Approach  
Amsterdam became the first city to formally adopt the Doughnut Economics model, a groundbreaking framework developed by British economist Kate Raworth (Raworth, 2017). The model is visually represented by a doughnut, where the inner ring symbolizes a social foundation that no one should fall below, and the outer ring represents an ecological ceiling that humanity should not exceed.  
Key Features:  
Circular Economy: Amsterdam aims to become a fully circular economy by 2050, focusing on waste reduction, recycling, and sustainable production (City of Amsterdam, 2020).  
Social Equity: The model prioritizes affordable housing, education, and healthcare, ensuring that all residents have access to basic needs (Raworth, 2017).  
Climate Action: The city has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with the Doughnut’s ecological ceiling (City of Amsterdam, 2020).  
Community Engagement: Amsterdam actively involves local businesses, residents, and organizations in decision-making, fostering a sense of collective responsibility (Raworth, 2017).  
California’s Circular Initiatives: Pioneering Sustainability  
While California has not formally adopted Doughnut Economics, it has been a leader in implementing circular economic principles (California Environmental Protection Agency, 2018). These initiatives aim to create a closed-loop system where waste is minimized, and resources are reused or recycled.  
Key Features:  
Aggressive Climate Goals: California has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy (California Air Resources Board, 2017).  
Waste Management: The state has robust recycling programs and is exploring ways to move toward zero waste (CalRecycle, 2019).  
Social Programs: California has various programs aimed at reducing social inequalities, including affordable housing and healthcare initiatives (California Department of Housing and Community Development, 2020).  
Why These Models Are Replacing Capitalism  
Sustainability: Both models prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term profits, addressing the environmental limitations of capitalism (Stiglitz, 2019).  
Social Equity: Unlike traditional capitalism, which often exacerbates social inequalities, these models aim to provide a safety net for all citizens (Sen, 1999).  
Resource Efficiency: By focusing on circularity and sustainability, these models make more efficient use of resources, reducing waste and environmental impact (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015).  
Community Involvement: Both models emphasize community engagement and collective decision-making, fostering a sense of shared responsibility (Putnam, 2000).  
Conclusion  
As we face the pressing challenges of social inequality and environmental degradation, the traditional capitalist model seems increasingly inadequate (Sachs, 2015). Amsterdam’s Doughnut Economics and California’s Circular Initiatives offer promising alternatives that prioritize both social equity and environmental sustainability (Raworth, 2017; California Environmental Protection Agency, 2018). While it’s too early to declare capitalism dead, these innovative models are certainly giving it a run for its money, pointing the way toward a more equitable and sustainable future.

 I crafted a custom AI script that runs the numbers in a flash. 

It's like having an unstoppable sidekick who doesn't know the meaning of ""burnout.""  
  
I used to squander most of my day on mind-numbing data entry, a job that could suck the soul out of anyone. 

Thanks to AI, I've slashed that time by a jaw-dropping 90%.

 I've reclaimed my workday, focusing on the juicy, creative bits that actually get me pumped.  
  
So, I'm itching to know: Have any of you awesome rebels tried something similar? Perhaps you've taken the plunge into automating repetitive emails or enlisted AI to turbocharge your data analysis skills? What were your adventures, and did they reshape your work life?

He wrote a book called “The End of Science” in 1996 where he stated (per his Wikipedia page)- “The primordial human quest to understand the universe and our place in it,"" may be coming to an end. Horgan claims that science will not achieve insights into nature as profound as evolution by natural selection, the double helix, the Big Bang, relativity theory or quantum mechanics. In the future, he suggests, scientists will refine, extend and apply this pre-existing knowledge but will not achieve any more great ""revolutions or revelations.""-

Is he correct? I get the logic of what he is saying but this book was written 27 years ago and I think we’ve made a lot of fundamental discoveries since then?! Or am I wrong?"

Somehow in the 60s the US was able to devote billions of dollars towards the space race because the public was supportive of it. Why do we not put the same effort into getting the public to support anti-aging?

Quite literally the leading cause of death is health complications due to aging. For some reason there is a stigma against preventing aging, but there isn’t similar stigmas against other illnesses. One could argue that aging isn’t curable but we are truly capable of so much and I feel with the combined efforts of science this could be done in a few decades.

What are the arguments for or against doing this?"

We are creating a camera to detect food in the fridge, a device to complement your smart home.  
This will work as a camera that will be mounted on top of the fridge, which will activate when you open the fridge, detect what food you put in or take out of the fridge, the information about the type of food and quantity will be entered into an app  
In the end you will have information about the type and quantity of products in your fridge, so it will make shopping at the store and ordering food home from work easier, you will no longer have to remember and memorize which products are in your fridge and you will definitely not buy an extra product or forget to buy something.  
We are also thinking about making a feature where the user can specify the expiration date of a product and get a push notification when it is about to expire.  
Please vote in google form, would you like to buy such a device, it would help us a lot

If people don’t agree on these stories, the concept loses its inherent power. This is true of owning land, money, cars, houses, art, mines, oil-wells, factories, corporations, relationships, loyalties, copyrights, brands, patents or anything else that is owned by you, me or those ever-superior “others”.  
In a society where change occurs gradually, we become accustomed to the narratives that bind us together and determine who possesses significant wealth, resources, attention, power, fame, and other ego-gratifying treasures, and who has access to only meager portions of these.  
However, when societies change and new types of goods appear, there might be no agreement about who gets to own these. For example, while the concept of owning ideas and words might have ancient roots, it was only a few centuries ago, with the invention of the printing press, that we all agreed to respect copyrights. We took that change in our stride.  
Now, everything is changing very fast and fights are starting to break out about who should own the new goods capable of consolidating power and defining who enjoys abundance and who is left with mere scraps. Many of us have been creating content these last few decades, but now, AI can suck it all up and create something very valuable. There are lots of jobs to be lost and lots of money to be made. But the fires driving this newfound wealth need to be stoked with vast quantities of previously public words, images, video, ideas and recognizable faces and icons.  
We can’t rely on the stories about who owns what, because everything has changed. After ingestion by the AI, our content might look different and we don’t even know, for sure, who ate whose food.  
Here’s one example of how this problem is playing out. The owners of Reddit and Twitter (X) are both really angry that the AI has been sucking up all the content on their sites. They want to own all these words and sell them for a lot of money or to train their own AIs. But wait, who created all these words? When we tweeted and posted, we thought that these were our words, spoken on a public platform. We flocked here for the convenience, avoiding the need to maintain our personal websites or navigate cumbersome message boards. We never agreed that we were giving away exclusive rights to our thoughts.  
Perhaps the power of AI should be given back to all of us. Perhaps it should be distributed to every person on the planet with adequate safeguards to prevent those with malicious intent from wielding new powers. Yet no matter how crucial these safeguards are, they shouldn't justify the bickering among the affluent and influential over how to consolidate this newfound authority for themselves.  
A final message to the lawmakers and judges who will adjudicate these disputes: Maybe you should retain all the wealth and resources for yourselves. After all, without your diligence, we wouldn't have achieved the necessary stability to build all this in the first place. Perhaps it should rightfully belong to you after all.  
But, of course, I could be wrong."

I wanted to share some exciting developments in the world of education technology and how AI is playing a game-changing role in making learning accessible and effective for everyone.

Affordable Learning: Traditional tutoring can cost a pretty penny, with averages around $40 an hour, making it a luxury for many. But here's where AI steps in – it's becoming a free tutor that can teach kids for a fraction of the cost, leveling the playing field.

Language Inclusivity: Did you know that 65% of learners prefer content in their native language? AI is addressing this by enabling students to learn in their native language, leading to better understanding and higher grades.

Boosting Confidence: In school, 72% of college students feel anxiety when asking a question, and 68% of international students struggle with language barriers. AI can be used as a 24/7 tutor, creating a stress-free environment for students to learn comfortably and confidently.

What are your thoughts on this? How do you see AI shaping the future of education?"

Our climate is going downhill so fast that in just a few decades I find it hard to believe our quality of life here won’t be affected. I’m a college freshman currently spending thousands of dollars on a degree that probably won’t be worth it due to how much each generation is suffering compared to the last these days. There’s really not much to look forward to. I’m studying journalism but by the time I have a career I’ll probably just be observing the end of the world along with everyone else. Any effort we’re making to curb this is already too late; maybe those of us that actually admit there’s a problem can slow the process, but there’s nothing that can be done at this point to fully turn things around. And it’s not just the climate I’m worried about, or the heat, floods, fires, and other natural disasters. It’s also the economic inflation, the political divide, the housing crisis, the overall increase in violence… the way our politicians are too busy with fighting other politicians to solve any of these issues… and the current ideal for life where you’re expected to work your whole life, maybe start a family and save up money for your retirement is just outdated now. I’m struggling to see how pretending like everything is normal and blinding ourselves with the delusion that our generation is going to live exactly like the ones before us is helping anything. If we only have a few decades left to enjoy what we have I’d rather spend my free time doing things I enjoy, and my money on traveling and seeing the world. But whenever I tell this to people they act like I’m crazy."

But are any of you people getting tired of this subscription stuff? I'm an IT(former military) but now on the free side. I have came into this issue that almost if not all current software and tools are all subscription based, even the Microsoft apps now. Google start charging SMBs for a workspace subscription. 

I was wondering your input on this. I'm personally starting to get tired of this. Almost every form of entertainment is subscription based now, and I'm just having a hard time spending all this money on something that will only get more expensive the more I use it. I miss the days where I can buy things and actually keep it after paying for it once. 

In the future, do you guys think this will only get more like the way its going to be now? Because even with the subscriptions and stuff I have yet see any actual successful company lower their subscription cost. Which I kind of don't understand either except for the sake of profit. If so many people are buying a monthly subscription why should it not be cheaper the more it's being bought? 

I know I'm not the smartest, but doesn't that even go against supply and demand? Software is essentially infinite supply, you can sell it quite literally infinitely without really ever needing to buy more product. I know their are dev costs and stuff along those lines, but really, once you have a finished product you can stop doing updates and just sell it for what it is. Or focus on sales to pay your people. 

I've just started to look at prices compared how many hours of labor it will take me to pay for everything now. I ain't gonna lie, with these recurring expenses it's starting to make it hard for me to even see how these subscriptions are even worth it now. Every subscription I take is atleast an hour of labor gone for the foreseeable future. Until I cancel it. And with the ways companies make you call and wait for 30 minutes just for you to cancel is messed up. 

I'm starting to see this version of gaining profit is borderline unethical and how we go about subscriptions in the future will definitely play a role of how much of a dystopia this will be. 

Would love to hear yalls thoughts."

But it makes me feel eerie and weird knowing that one day in the future there will certainly be a time where we achieve either immortality or be able to live for thousands of years. Especially as our technological advancements are increasing at an absurd exponential rate. We have barely scratched the surface and not even had our current technology for a couple of hundred years, look at how far we've come as a species, from cave dwellers and not having language to the modern man. From wooden boats and horses F22 raptors and Stealth bombers and Apache helicopters. From apes that couldn't even talk to the James webb telescope, language, ISS, quantum computing, rockets, genetic engineering, AI, Nukes, the internet, virtual reality, nanotechnology, coding, particle accelerators, tiny devices in our pocket that holds all known information in the universe; the list is endless.

Many scientists and futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, believes that in the next couple of hundred years we will reach some sort of immortality, whether it's digital immortality by scanning your brain and uploading your consciousness or biological immortality by being able to stop and reverse aging. There are hundreds of breakthroughs and billions of dollars going into these areas of research and every single day we're getting closer to achieving it. I 100% believe we will at some point in the future we will achieve immortality, if not, then will extend human lifespan to able to live for thousands of years.

It makes me feel uneasy knowing that death is something that faces everyone I know on earth right now, all my friends and family, death is something inevitable. But one day in the future death could just be a choice. It kinda makes me sad knowing that this collossal problem we all currently face, will be laughed at in the future, they'll be in shock that humans only used to live around 80 years. It makes me feel small and question that fundamental questions of what is life, and what is death.

It's easy to take the limits of our own vision for the limits of the world, as 1000 years ago if you predicted we'd have magic instant communication devices in our pocket and metal boxes that would take you to the moon you'd be executed for heresy or laughed at for being insane. But in reality it's easy to imagine that all humanity as ever achieves thus far, is but the dream before the true awakening."
1,2023-09-08,Neil Tyson's false dichotomy,u/HopDavid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16d9qqp/neil_tysons_false_dichotomy/,Futurology,"**If we could terraform Mars we could fix Earth**

That's the drum beat of Neil Tyson's [recent StarTalk video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzMDKraaWm8)

It's a false dichotomy.

Space settlement activists tend to be more proactive than most when it comes to preserving our planet.

For example Elon Musk with Tesla's solar panels and electric cars. He is doing more for a sustainable future than a million Neil Tysons or Al Gores.

Jeff Bezos' goal is to move mining and heavy industry off the earth. 

To establish habs in space we will need to learn how to better recycle our wastes how to live well while consuming less.

In my opinion space settlement and preserving our planet are goals that share many opportunities for collaboration. Working towards one goal also benefits the other.

In the mean time what is Tyson doing to preserve our planet? He is jetting his large body all over the planet to hawk his merchandise and lower IQs with his inaccurate pop science. I expect the man has a carbon footprint the size of South America.

It is Tyson that seems okay with trashing our planet."

1,2023-09-08,GM Will Stop Offering Apple CarPlay on Future EVs,u/Mmega_Mind,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16dn4ah/gm_will_stop_offering_apple_carplay_on_future_evs/,Futurology,"Even though phone mirroring is one of the most popular tech features in today’s cars, GM said it will eliminate Apple CarPlay from its electric vehicles.

The 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV will be the first to get this downgrade, but other EV models will follow. GM will not remove CarPlay from any of its gasoline-powered models, which it only plans to build until 2035.
GM said the change is needed to keep future electric vehicles as integrated and connected as possible. The automaker will rely on a system co-developed with Google to operate its EVs.

The battle for the dashboard continues. GM will eliminate Apple CarPlay from its electric vehicles, starting with the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV that’s arriving in the fall. CarPlay, which operates like Android Auto to mirror iPhone content on the vehicle’s dashboard, has been a consumer favorite for years, and even holdouts such as Toyota have recently added the technology to their models.

It’s not as though EVs need CarPlay integration to succeed—just ask Tesla—but the reason for the reduction in vehicle capability is, in GM’s view, actually an expansion in vehicle capabilities. GM said it intends to remove CarPlay from new EVs because its vehicles need better integration between the navigation system and the rapidly growing network of chargers to help out EV drivers. GM has been developing its own built-in infotainment system in collaboration with Google since 2019.

“We have a lot of new driver assistance features coming that are more tightly coupled with navigation,” GM’s executive director of digital cockpit experience, Mike Hichme, told Reuters. “We don’t want to design these features in a way that are dependent on a person having a cellphone.”

Of course, Apple CarPlay never needed to know how much gas was in the tank, and it could still function as a map. Note that Hichme didn’t say anything about GM keeping CarPlay as an option for EV drivers, while also offering its own advanced in-house integrated EV-focused navigation. The best of both worlds, in other words, and one where we wouldn’t need to rely on an automaker’s built-in devices all the time. Remember when the 3G network went away last year?

Music and phone calls will still work over Bluetooth in GM’s CarPlay-free cars, GM said, and CarPlay tech will remain available in GM’s internal-combustion-engine vehicles. Of course, GM has announced it will stop building ICE vehicles after 2035. GM also said it won’t disable CarPlay in any vehicles that currently have it. (Around 50 percent of Americans with a cellphone have an iPhone.)

•The names of the victims are being withheld at the request of their families, officials said.

•The remains of 1,104 victims, or 40% of those who died, still have not been found nearly 22 years after the al-Qaida attacks on the World Trade Center.

•The attacks on the World Trade Center killed more than 2,700 people.

Two victims who perished in the World Trade Center have been identified more than two decades after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, New York City’s chief medical examiner said Friday.

The names of the victims, a man and a woman, are being withheld at the request of their families, officials said. They are the 1,648th and 1,649th victims whose remains have been identified since 2001.

The remains of 1,104 victims, or 40% of those who died in the attacks, still have not been found nearly 22 years after al-Qaida terrorists hijacked commercial airlines and crashed them into the Twin Towers in lower Manhattan.

The towers were destroyed in the attacks, leaving more than 2,700 people dead.

Dr. Jason Graham, New York City’s chief medical examiner, described the painstaking effort to identify the victims’ remains as “the largest and most complex forensic investigation” in U.S. history.

Investigators have spent decades using DNA testing to identify tens of thousands of remains recovered from the Ground Zero disaster site. More than 30% of the remains recovered are still unidentified, according to the medical examiner’s office."

1,2023-09-08,Elon Musk says he withheld Starlink over Crimea to avoid escalation,u/Mmega_Mind,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16dovbi/elon_musk_says_he_withheld_starlink_over_crimea/,Futurology,"Elon Musk says he refused to give Kyiv access to his Starlink communications network over Crimea to avoid complicity in a ""major act of war"".

Kyiv had sent an emergency request to activate Starlink to Sevastopol, home to a major Russian navy port, he said.

His comments came after a book alleged he had switched off Starlink to thwart a drone attack on Russian ships.

A senior Ukrainian official says this enabled Russian attacks and accused him of ""committing evil"".

Russian naval vessels had since taken part in deadly attacks on civilians, he said.

""By not allowing Ukrainian drones to destroy part of the Russian military (!) fleet via Starlink interference, Elon Musk allowed this fleet to fire Kalibr missiles at Ukrainian cities,"" he said.

""Why do some people so desperately want to defend war criminals and their desire to commit murder? And do they now realize that they are committing evil and encouraging evil?"" he added.

The row follows the release of a biography of the billionaire by Walter Isaacson which alleges that Mr Musk switched off Ukraine's access to Starlink because he feared that an ambush of Russia's naval fleet in Crimea could provoke a nuclear response from the Kremlin.

Ukraine targeted Russian ships in Sevastopol with submarine drones carrying explosives but they lost connection to Starlink and ""washed ashore harmlessly"", Mr Isaacson wrote.

Starlink terminals connect to SpaceX satellites in orbit and have been crucial for maintaining internet connectivity and communication in Ukraine as the conflict has disrupted the country infrastructure.

SpaceX, in which Mr Musk is the largest shareholder, began providing thousands of Starlink satellite dishes to Ukraine shortly after Russia launched its full-scale assault on its neighbour in February last year.

Responding to the book's claim, Mr Musk said on X that SpaceX ""did not deactivate anything"" because it had not been activated in those regions in the first place.

""There was an emergency request from government authorities to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol. The obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor,"" he said.

""If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.""

Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former prime minister, tweeted: ""If what Isaacson has written in his book is true, then it looks like Musk is the last adequate mind in North America.""

Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, eight years before Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

In the past, Mr Musk has said that while the system had ""become the connectivity backbone of Ukraine all the way up to the front lines"", ""we are not allowing Starlink to be used for long-range drone strikes"".

Mr Musk reiterated the point to Mr Isaacson, asking: ""How am I in this war? Starlink was not meant to be involved in wars. It was so people can watch Netflix and chill and get online for school and do good peaceful things, not drone strikes.""

He also offered a personal opinion, calling for a truce and saying that Ukrainians and Russians were dying ""to gain and lose small pieces of land"" and this was not worth their lives.

He provoked anger last year when he proposed a plan to end the war which suggested the world formally recognise Crimea as part of Russia and asking residents of regions seized by Russia last year to vote on which country they wanted to be part of.

Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov said that plan displayed ""moral idiocy""."
1,2023-09-08,Apple could be about to make the biggest change to the iPhone in 11 years,u/Mmega_Mind,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16dp23u/apple_could_be_about_to_make_the_biggest_change/,Futurology,"Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 15 in just a few days, and it’s widely expected to come with a significant change.

The iPhone 15 is heavily rumored to ditch Apple’s proprietary Lightning charger in favor of USB-C charging, marking a milestone for the company by adopting universal charging. The change could ultimately streamline the charging process across various devices — and brands.

The switch would come less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. The first-of-its-kind law aims to pare down the number of chargers and cables consumers must contend with when they purchase a new device, and to allow users to mix and match devices and chargers even if they were produced by different manufacturers.

“This is arguably the biggest disruption to iPhone design for several years, but in reality, it is hardly a dramatic move,” said Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight.

That’s because Apple (AAPL) has previously switched its iPads and MacBooks to USB-C charging. Still, the company has been resistant to making the change on the iPhone.

Last year, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Greg Joswiak, publicly stressed the value and ubiquity of the Lightning charger, which is designed for faster device charging, but noted “obviously we will have to comply” with the EU mandate.

“We have no choice, like we do around the world, to comply with local laws, but we think the approach would have been better environmentally and better for our customers to not have a government [have] that perspective,” Joswiak said at the time.

The history of the Lightning charger
Apple introduced the Lightning charger alongside the iPhone 5 in 2012, replacing its existing older 30-pin dock connector with one that enabled faster charging and had a reversible design. It also ignited a related accessories business, requiring users to buy a $30 Lightning adapter to connect the device to older docks, alarm clocks and speaker systems.

“For Apple, it was all about being in control of its own ecosystem,” said David McQueen, a director at ABI Research. “Apple makes good money from selling Lightning cables and its many related accessories.”

It also takes a financial cut from the third-party accessories and cables that go through its Made For iPhone program. “Moving to USB Type C would take away this level of control as USB-C is a much more open ecosystem,” McQueen said.

In addition, Apple could create its own branded USB-C cable to perform “better with an iPhone,” such as allowing for greater wattage to support faster charging while minimizing risk and damage to batteries, he added.

What does this mean for iPhone users?
It’s currently unclear if the shift to USB-C will happen for all new iPhone 15 models or only for Pro devices. The move to USB-C won’t likely be a sole incentive for people to upgrade, but it could sway some consumers who have been resistant to the iPhone over its charging limitations, according to Thomas Husson, a vice president at Forrester Research.

The iPhone 15 devices are expected to ship with a new cable in the box, but considering many mobile devices already use USB-C, including Apple’s own iPads and MacBooks, access to charging wires shouldn’t be too hard or costly.

“Given how widely USB-C has been used in other devices, it’s hard to imagine that customers will be totally caught out by this switch, and in the long term, it’s likely to benefit them, with a universal charging system having some very obvious upsides,” Wood said.

Apple could also bypass wired charging altogether to make way for wireless charging but not anytime soon because “wireless charging is currently so much slower than wired,” according to McQueen. “We’ll have to wait and see on that.”

What do you think apple should do differently to win the race?"

But this simply isn’t going to happen.

UBI is pure fantasy, ask literally any economist if you don’t believe me. Seriously, i have yet to hear a good argument, or even any rational arguments at all, as to how it will be funded, why it won’t just stop businesses from raising their prices, etc, or even who is going to pay for it. Automation of jobs resulting in a post scarcity UBI world is also pure fantasy, not to mention a huge leap. Just because no one is working doesn’t mean there will suddenly be this paradise where no one has to worry about anything, this is nothing more than wishful thinking.   


And no, you are not living forever, or even much longer than (if you’re lucky) 80-90 or so. I have seen way too many experts backing up this point. I keep saying it but no one likes to hear it, but we can expect at most increased HEALTHspan in our lifetimes. What i mean by this is that you will live to around 80 or so as an active person, and then everything starts shutting down and you die. What is not going to happen is extending the lifespan of anyone alive today, or at least not by any significant amount. I’m sorry but we were all born way too early. "

And it inspired me to write this post.

So here's the thing about both scientific and social advancement throughout human history: It does not have much of a set pattern beyond general acceleration and improvement.

What I mean with that is that, very generally, we see a trend towards more advanced technology and a generally better off humanity (just see the percentage of children who die young for that) both because of that technology and because of social changes.

What we however consistently fail to do (very consistently) both in science fiction and in speculation about the future is actually understand how that change will happen.

For example, I read a science fiction story in which computers kept getting bigger and bigger with people eventually being able to connect to them from anywhere. The internet did happen, but the main trend has been towards miniaturization instead and we all tend to have our own computers in our pockets now.

You also have science fiction which predicts flying cars in 2015, but somehow fails to predict the omnipresence of cellphones or microwaves.

A hundred years before it happened, the idea of the computerized world as we understand it now just wasn't on anyone's radar. Let alone in the next 100 years.

This is because both humanity and technology are unpredictable. Influenced by so many factors we can't even imagine it. And neither advances in a steady, predictable way. Both in the form it will take, and in the sense that we often have revolutions in either technology (or socially) that just quickly build up and then change everything. These are so called ""black swan events.""

So here's the actual fact I'm going to lay out for you right now, rather than doomering about everything: We don't know what will happen.

We could be funding radical life extension for the next 200 years and barely make any progress, current AI technology could hit a limit and we might have to find an entirely new approach that will take centuries to find, and maybe countries all across the world backslide democratically due to climate change so badly that we're going to enter a new dark age (although it's worth noting the real dark age was not nearly as dark as usually depicted).

Or there could be a breakthrough in life extension next year. Like Darwin stumbling upon the idea of biological evolution, someone might stumble upon some fundamental component of aging that allows it to be completely controlled by humans in a decade or two. And cheaply in a few decades more. Current AI technology could prove to be even more adaptable than we think and lead us to create models that can create better models leading to a technological singularity. And instead of democratic backsliding we could end up having a renewed vigor and trust in institutions as some social and political revolution, like women's suffrage or civil rights, turns everything around.

Either future is possible. By the very nature of these things, which is that they are unpredictable because they are often revolutionary and affected by so many factors that we can't even fathom and might not even think of, they are unpredictable.

So here's my advice to everyone: We shouldn't count on ending up in a post-scarcity civilization with UBI and indefinite lifespans. But we should do our best to promote those things and push the world towards them in whatever way we can. Even if we never get there, this will almost certainly make things better by pushing for those things. And if we do get there, well, that'll be great too.

Whereas pointless doomering about things nobody can know will get us exactly nowhere and nothing."

1,2023-09-09,AI and creation - Bard,u/metaversomania,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16ek43q/ai_and_creation_bard/,Futurology," 

In principle, yes, it is possible for an AI to generate another AI by transferring it to a native code similar to DNA. This native code could be composed of a set of algorithms and parameters that define the structure and functioning of the AI.

For example, an AI could be designed to generate another AI that is able to learn and adapt in a similar way to a human. In this case, the native code could include a machine-learning model that is based on the functioning of the human brain.

Another example is an AI designed to generate another AI that is able to create original works of art. In this case, the native code could include an image or text generation model that is based on an analysis of existing works of art.

However, it is important to note that this possibility is still in development. Current AIs are able to generate new AIs, but these new AIs are not yet able to learn and adapt in a fully autonomous way.

As for the similarity to DNA, it is possible that the native code of an AI could be structured in a similar way to human DNA. For example, the code could be composed of a sequence of algorithms and parameters that are linked together in a similar way to human genes.

However, it is important to note that this similarity is only superficial. Human DNA is a very complex system that is responsible for a wide range of functions, including growth, development, and reproduction. The native code of an AI is much simpler and is limited to defining the structure and functioning of the AI.

In conclusion, it is possible for an AI to generate another AI by transferring it a native code similar to DNA. However, this possibility is still in development and the native code of an AI is much simpler than human DNA.

Here is a more concise version:

Yes, it is possible for an AI to generate another AI by transferring it a code that defines its structure and functioning. However, this code is much simpler than human DNA and is not yet capable of replicating the full range of human intelligence."

As a regular low to middle-class American, I find myself increasingly confused by the multitude of perspectives and conflicting evidence that can be found on any given issue. It is disheartening to see deliberate spread of misinformation, and I believe those responsible should face criminal charges. However, I also recognize that many people tend to become entrenched in their own opinions and fail to consider alternative perspectives.

What truly concerns me is that amidst all this chaos, we are distracted from the bigger picture. It feels like we are children fighting over trivial matters while our house is burning down. I recently took a moment to hold myself accountable and asked how I personally contribute to this system. I realized that I may not possess the intelligence or understanding to fully grasp the complexities of our current situation. It is easier to let a corrupt government run things than to educate myself and take responsibility for my actions. It is easier to believe that someone smarter will come along and save us all.

However, I have come to the realization that we cannot solely rely on the government to fix our problems. We must take individual action and stop pointing fingers. While there is much that is wrong, we cannot change other people. Instead, we should focus on practical ways to help humanity on an individual basis. We need to shift our reliance away from the government and recognize that there are more of us than there are of them. Many of the changes we desire will not happen overnight, but through practical solutions and personal sacrifices, we can make a difference.

It is time to stop seeking answers solely from our government. We need to come together and find ways to make positive changes in our own lives and communities. By doing so, we can gradually create a better future for all. Where do we start?"

It is a table top game where the players guide their civilizations through the history of technological progress until they reach a type 1 civilization. The players will need to manage the resources on their planet for both sustaining the growth of their infrastructure while at the same time investing in newer technology. After developing it for over a year I have come to the biggest problem: the future.  
While we have no way of knowing what discoveries will change radically our preferences for certain types of technologies I would like to maintain some objectivity on what are our current expectations, the problem here is that energy is a very political topic, even though it is in principle a scientific subject. Therefore I have not been able to come to a consensus about how to portray energy technologies in the game, so I will give you the broad picture of what I have in mind in the hopes of gathering some evidence based opinions or even references to sites where I can find the most updated and digestible data.  
Fossil Fuels: Inexpensive, efficient, reliable and continuous. / Not Unlimited, although its efficiency has increased (needing less to do more), CO2 emitting, not unlimited.  
Nuclear Power Plants: Efficient, reliable and continuous, not CO2 emitting / Highly Expensive, Produces Radioactive waste, though not comparable to pollution generated to fossil fuels.  
Solar / Wind Farms: Not CO2 emitting (without taking into account manufacture and later disposal), expensive (depends on how refined the technology is) / Not as efficient, reliable and continuous as Fossil fuels or Nuclear. Needs for energy storage technologies which might counterweight its ecological benefits.  
Fusion Energy: Extremely efficient, reliable and continuous, not CO2 emitting / Theoretical, unknown costs, unknown viability.  
Thinking Long Term  
I have tried to research wether world wide embrace of nuclear energy would turn both fossil and ""renewable"" sources obsolete and wether it is possible, but most of the discussion is centered about the next 5 to 20 years while in my game the time scope for the future is at least 500 years.  
So I come to you, enthusiasts of this topic, for some opinions and directions about what the long run depares in terms of technological possibilities, without taking into account political postures or near future economical situations.  
I thank whoever read the whole post and is eager to give a helping hand, have a nice day :)"

In-Depth:
If you're on this reddit you're now aware that I must have had a more than difficult/gloomy life but also, and regularly even now, punctuated by moments of happiness as I've just said sometimes at an off-the-charts level unlike someone who would just have a quite normal life or even miserable life; from meeting a new girlfriend in a closet (I'm completely serious) to attending a ceremony for the best students in the capital, all without having made the slightest effort (compared to a so-called ""studious"" friend I saw there), I'm still really wondering if that's what intelligence is (not to be confused with knowledge), in fact a few years ago I took part in a IQ test, but not like the ones on social networks or school, there were memory tests, maths, logic questions, all on a single timer, i was the first on the list apparently, so out of humility I didn't ask for the exact number of tests carried out before mine).

As you can imagine, I won't give you any unpleasant examples from my past,non only for the presence of non-adults here, i say non-adults because in some countries at 50 you're still categorized as a child, the world is a fascinating place; but I know human curiosity (and reddit curiosity now), i'll leave you with the word ""Styx"", which is the right word to describe the worst thing that happened to me, but also what contributed to the foundation of who I am now and my actual paradigm.

_______________________________________________________

""Wave"" is not the right word here. The proper term is ""tsunami"". And by tsunami, I mean the kind of tsunami you saw when that asteroid hit the Earth in the motion picture, ""Deep Impact"". Remember that scene where the beach break was vastly and breathtakingly drawn out in seconds? That is the point where humanity is at this _very_ moment in our AI development. And the scene where all the buildings of NYC get knocked over _by_ that wave, a very short time later, is going to be the perfect metaphor for what happens to human affairs when that AI ""tsunami"" impacts.

 It may not be survivable. 

 We are on the very verge of developing _true_ artificial general intelligence. Something that does not exist now and has not ever existed in human recorded history up to this point.  So if you want to vet the things that I am telling you, I'll provide some links. But we'll come to that. First, I want to explain what is _actually_ going on. As you know, in the last not quite one year since 30 Nov 22, when GPT 3.5, better known as ChatGPT was released, the world has changed astonishingly. People can't seem to agree over how long ChatGPT took to penetrate human society. I will, for argument's sake, say it took _15 days_ for ChatGPT from OpenAI, to be downloaded by 100 _million_ humans. But I have reason to believe the actual time was five days. And then on 14 Mar 23, GPT-4 was also released by OpenAI. Some things about GPT-4. When GPT-4 was still in its pre-release phase, there was a lot of speculation about just how powerful it would be compared to GPT 3.5. The number was stated to be roughly 100 _trillion_ parameters. The number of parameters in ChatGPT is 175 billion. Shortly after that number was published, that ""100 trillion"" one, a strange thing happened. OpenAI said, well no, it's not going to be 100 trillion. In fact, it may not be much more than 175 billion even. (It was still pretty big though, 1.7 _trillion_ parameters.) This is because there had been another breakthrough in which parameters were not going to matter so much as a different metric. The new metric that was far more accurate to how the LLM model would perform was released. It was called ""tokens"". That is the, like, individual letter, word, punctuation or symbol, or whatever is input and then output. And is based on the training data required for a given LLM. It is what enables an LLM to ""predict the next word or sequence"". Like in the case of coding. (I'm not even going to address ""recursive AI development"" here. I think it will become pretty obvious in a short time.) The number of tokens for GPT-4 is potentially 32K. The number of tokens for ChatGPT is 4,096. That is an approximately 8x increase over ChatGPT. But just saying it is 8x more is not the whole picture. That 8x increase allows for the combination of those tokens which is probably an astronomical increase. Let me give you an analogy to better understand what that means for LLMs. So there are 12 notes of music and there are about 4,017 known chords. Of them, only _four_ really matter. That combination of notes and them 4 chords are pretty much what has made up music since the earliest music has existed. And there is likely a near infinite number of musical re-arrangements of those chords still in store. That is what 'tokens' mean for LLMs. And here is where it gets ""interesting"". Because that 8x increase allows for the ability to do some things that LLMs have never been able to do previously. They call it ""emergent"" capabilities. And ""emergent"" capabilities can be, conservatively speaking, _startling_ . Startling emergent capabilities have even been seen in ChatGPT but particularly in generative AI image generating models like ""Midjourney"" or ""Stable Diffusion"" for instance. And now it is video. Have you seen an AI generated video yet? They are a helluva thing. Here is a sample if you haven't seen one.

So basically, an emergent capability is a new ability that was never initially trained into the algorithm that spontaneously came into being. (And we don't know *why* ) You can find many examples of this online. Not hard to find. All of that is based on what we call the ""black box"". That is, why a given AI zigs instead of zags in its neural network node ""weights"", but still (mostly) gives us the right answer. Today we call the wrong answer ""hallucinating"". That kind of error is going to go away fairly soon. But the ""black box"" is going to be vast, _vast_ and impenetrable. Probably already is.

In late November of 2022, an interesting, albeit rather obscure, paper was published.
Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks

[2211.12588] Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks (arxiv.org)

This paper was published before GPT-3.5 was released. And it actually concerns the ""cognitive reasoning"" potential of an unrelated AI language model, ""Codex"".  Still the concept of the paper is a bit of a departure from what had been. ""Chain of Thought"" (COT) and ""Program of Thought"" (POT) are two *way* different things. COT is what the model *does*. POT is how the model arrives at the outcome. Crudely it can be described as its ""thought process"". ""Few-shot"" or possibly ""zero-shot"" analogy. Yes, that sounds ""fuzzy"", because it *is*. It has huge implications. Something unsettling is beginning. We'll come back to that ""zero-shot"" business in a moment.
Very shortly after GPT-4 was released. A paper was published concerning GPT-4 with a _startling_ title. ""
Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4

"".
[2303.12712] Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4 (arxiv.org)

Even more startling was this paper was, in its finished form, published just short of one month after the release of GPT-4, 13 Apr 23. That's how fast the researchers were able to make these determinations.

Not too much longer after, another paper was published. ""Emergent Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models"".

[2212.09196] Emergent Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models (arxiv.org)

This paper also concerning GPT-4 was published on 3 Aug 23. The paper describes how the GPT-4 model is able to ape something that was once considered to be unique to human cognition. A way of thinking called ""zero-shot analogy"". Basically, that means that when we are exposed to the requirement to do a task that we have never encountered before, that we use what we already know to work through how to do the task. I mean to the best of our ability. That can be described in one word. ""Reasoning"". We ""reason"" out how to do things. And GPT-4 is at that threshold _today_ . Right now. And just to pile on a bit. Here is another paper from just the other day, I think. This seems to be an interesting add-on to that Nov 2022 paper. The new paper, ""When Do Program-of-Thoughts Work for Reasoning?"",

2308.15452.pdf (arxiv.org)

I'm amazed how fast this line of research is progressing. This paper was published in its finished form on 8 Sep 2023. Two days ago. In it they describe a way to *measure* how the reasoning capabilities of various LLMs are progressing. They call it ""complexity-impacted reasoning score (CIRS)"" Interestingly the benchmark LLM is ""ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo"". Exactly the form that I am paying a monthly fee to use on my mobile. It is an *amazing* thing. it produces coherent answers in an *instant* As the days go by I use more and more often. I'm living in the freaking future! Anyway it breaks down the differences between brute force, number crunching computation and the strange human mind-like world of reasoning.

I speculated about this in my hub essay from 2018.

>As of this commentary there is no such thing as AGI, that is ""artificial general intelligence""--A form of AI that reasons and employs ""common sense"" just like a human, to figure out how to do things it has never been exposed to before. And don't forget--That AGI will also have unimaginable computing power behind its human-like thinking. Something humans don't have--yet, maybe... And we don't even know if such a thing is possible. But I suspect that given enough processing power, speed and access to big data and novel AI computing architectures, that a narrow AI (a computing algorithm that can only do one task, but with superhuman capability) will be able to effectively simulate or mimic the effect of AGI. Then my question is, does it matter if it is a narrow AI simulating AGI or real honest to gosh AGI. Is there even a difference? My point being that narrow AI is very much in existence today. Consciousness and self-awareness are certainly not a requirement. And in fact a true EI (emergent intelligence--conscious and self-aware.) would be very undesirable. We don't need that kind of competition.

That came from this.

Izumi3682 and the World of Tomorrow : u/izumi3682 (reddit.com)

The ability to reason is what would make, what we now call ""artificial narrow"" or ""narrowish intelligence"", artificial _general_ intelligence. I forecast that AGI will exist NLT 2025. And that once AGI exists it is a _very_ slippery slope to the realization of artificial _super_ intelligence. An AGI would be about as smart as the smartest human being alive today as far as reasoning capability. Like about a 200 IQ or even a couple times that number. But ASI is a whole different ball game. An ASI is hypothesized to be hundreds to _billions_ of times better at ""mental"" reasoning than humans. Further, an AGI is a _very_ slippery fish. How easy is it to ensure that such an AI is ""aligned"" with human values, desires and needs? You can see what I mean now when I say ""tsunami"". What do you think that Suleyman was referring to when he said that our AI will ""walk us through life""? Oh. And this is _also_ why all the top AI experts, people like Geoff Hinton, who was the first to realize the convolutional neural network back in 2007, have called for a pause of all training for all future LLMs for at least six months. The idea being to regulate or align what we already have. He actually quit his job of chief AI tech at Google to give this warning. The warning fell on deaf ears and _nothing_ has been paused _anywhere_ . For two reasons. First is the national security of the USA and China (PRC) and second is the economic race to AI supremacy in the US that we are now trapped into realizing because we are a market driven, capitalist society. Hell of an epitaph for humanity. ""I did it all for the ""noo---"". Ironically, it is probably going to be the end of the concept of value in any event. If we don't get wiped out, we may see the birth of an AI driven ""post-scarcity"" society. You would like that, I promise. Anyway, Google is fixing to release ""Gemini"" which it promises to be far more powerful than GPT-4, in Dec 2023. And GPT-5 itself is on track for release within the first half of 2024. Probably in the first 4 month. I suspect that GPT-5 is going to be the first AGI, if I know my AI papers that I see even today. At that point the countdown to ASI starts. Inevitable and imminent. And I say this--I say that ASI will exist NLT than the year 2029 and potentially as soon as the year 2027 depending on how fast humans allow it to train. I sincerely hope that we don't have ASI by the year 2027, because, well, I give us 50/50 odds of existentially surviving such a development. But if we _do_ survive, it will no longer be business as usual for humanity. Such a future is likely unimaginable, unfathomable and incomprehensible. This is a ""technological singularity"" (TS). An event that was last realized about 3-4 _million_ years ago. And that TS took about 2 million years to properly unfold. Cuz nature has all the time in the world. That is when a form of primate that could think abstractly came into being. All primates before that primate would find that primate's cognition... Well, it would basically be the difference between me and my cat. I run things. The cat is my pet. Actually, that is _vastly_ understating the situation. It would be more like the difference between us and _""archaea""_ . Don't know what ""archaea"" is? The ASI will. BTW, what do you imagine the difference between an ASI and consciousness would be? I bet an ASI would be 'conscious"" in the same sense that a jet exploits the laws of physics to achieve lift just like biological birds. Who says an AI has to work like the human mind at all? We are just the initial template that AI is going to use to ""bootstrap"" itself to ASI. There is that 'recursive AI development ""I touched on for a second, earlier. ASI=TS. Such a thing has never happened in human recorded history. Yet."

_______________________________________________________

""Wave"" is not the right word here. The proper term is ""tsunami"". And by tsunami, I mean the kind of tsunami you saw when that asteroid hit the Earth in the motion picture, ""Deep Impact"". Remember that scene where the beach break was vastly and breathtakingly drawn out in seconds? That is the point where humanity is at this _very_ moment in our AI development. And the scene where all the buildings of NYC get knocked over _by_ that wave, a very short time later, is going to be the perfect metaphor for what happens to human affairs when that AI ""tsunami"" impacts.

 It may not be survivable. 

 We are on the very verge of developing _true_ artificial general intelligence. Something that does not exist now and has not ever existed in human recorded history up to this point.  So if you want to vet the things that I am telling you, I'll provide some links. But we'll come to that. First, I want to explain what is _actually_ going on. As you know, in the last not quite one year since 30 Nov 22, when GPT 3.5, better known as ChatGPT was released, the world has changed astonishingly. People can't seem to agree over how long ChatGPT took to penetrate human society. I will, for argument's sake, say it took _15 days_ for ChatGPT from OpenAI, to be downloaded by 100 _million_ humans. But I have reason to believe the actual time was five days. And then on 14 Mar 23, GPT-4 was also released by OpenAI. Some things about GPT-4. When GPT-4 was still in its pre-release phase, there was a lot of speculation about just how powerful it would be compared to GPT 3.5. The number was stated to be roughly 100 _trillion_ parameters. The number of parameters in ChatGPT is 175 billion. Shortly after that number was published, that ""100 trillion"" one, a strange thing happened. OpenAI said, well no, it's not going to be 100 trillion. In fact, it may not be much more than 175 billion even. (It was still pretty big though, 1.7 _trillion_ parameters.) This is because there had been another breakthrough in which parameters were not going to matter so much as a different metric. The new metric that was far more accurate to how the LLM model would perform was released. It was called ""tokens"". That is the, like, individual letter, word, punctuation or symbol, or whatever is input and then output. And is based on the training data required for a given LLM. It is what enables an LLM to ""predict the next word or sequence"". Like in the case of coding. (I'm not even going to address ""recursive AI development"" here. I think it will become pretty obvious in a short time.) The number of tokens for GPT-4 is potentially 32K. The number of tokens for ChatGPT is 4,096. That is an approximately 8x increase over ChatGPT. But just saying it is 8x more is not the whole picture. That 8x increase allows for the combination of those tokens which is probably an astronomical increase. Let me give you an analogy to better understand what that means for LLMs. So there are 12 notes of music and there are about 4,017 known chords. Of them, only _four_ really matter. That combination of notes and them 4 chords are pretty much what has made up music since the earliest music has existed. And there is likely a near infinite number of musical re-arrangements of those chords still in store. That is what 'tokens' mean for LLMs. And here is where it gets ""interesting"". Because that 8x increase allows for the ability to do some things that LLMs have never been able to do previously. They call it ""emergent"" capabilities. And ""emergent"" capabilities can be, conservatively speaking, _startling_ . Startling emergent capabilities have even been seen in ChatGPT but particularly in generative AI image generating models like ""Midjourney"" or ""Stable Diffusion"" for instance. And now it is video. Have you seen an AI generated video yet? They are a helluva thing. Here is a sample if you haven't seen one.

So basically, an emergent capability is a new ability that was never initially trained into the algorithm that spontaneously came into being. (And we don't know *why* ) You can find many examples of this online. Not hard to find. All of that is based on what we call the ""black box"". That is, why a given AI zigs instead of zags in its neural network node ""weights"", but still (mostly) gives us the right answer. Today we call the wrong answer ""hallucinating"". That kind of error is going to go away fairly soon. But the ""black box"" is going to be vast, _vast_ and impenetrable. Probably already is.

In late November of 2022, an interesting, albeit rather obscure, paper was published.
Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks

[2211.12588] Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks (arxiv.org)

This paper was published before GPT-3.5 was released. And it actually concerns the ""cognitive reasoning"" potential of an unrelated AI language model, ""Codex"".  Still the concept of the paper is a bit of a departure from what had been. ""Chain of Thought"" (COT) and ""Program of Thought"" (POT) are two *way* different things. COT is what the model *does*. POT is how the model arrives at the outcome. Crudely it can be described as its ""thought process"". ""Few-shot"" or possibly ""zero-shot"" analogy. Yes, that sounds ""fuzzy"", because it *is*. It has huge implications. Something unsettling is beginning. We'll come back to that ""zero-shot"" business in a moment.
Very shortly after GPT-4 was released. A paper was published concerning GPT-4 with a _startling_ title. ""
Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4

"".
[2303.12712] Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4 (arxiv.org)

Even more startling was this paper was, in its finished form, published just short of one month after the release of GPT-4, 13 Apr 23. That's how fast the researchers were able to make these determinations.

Not too much longer after, another paper was published. ""Emergent Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models"".

[2212.09196] Emergent Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models (arxiv.org)

This paper also concerning GPT-4 was published on 3 Aug 23. The paper describes how the GPT-4 model is able to ape something that was once considered to be unique to human cognition. A way of thinking called ""zero-shot analogy"". Basically, that means that when we are exposed to the requirement to do a task that we have never encountered before, that we use what we already know to work through how to do the task. I mean to the best of our ability. That can be described in one word. ""Reasoning"". We ""reason"" out how to do things. And GPT-4 is at that threshold _today_ . Right now. And just to pile on a bit. Here is another paper from just the other day, I think. This seems to be an interesting add-on to that Nov 2022 paper. The new paper, ""When Do Program-of-Thoughts Work for Reasoning?"",

2308.15452.pdf (arxiv.org)

I'm amazed how fast this line of research is progressing. This paper was published in its finished form on 8 Sep 2023. Two days ago. In it they describe a way to *measure* how the reasoning capabilities of various LLMs are progressing. They call it ""complexity-impacted reasoning score (CIRS)"" Interestingly the benchmark LLM is ""ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo"". Exactly the form that I am paying a monthly fee to use on my mobile. It is an *amazing* thing. it produces coherent answers in an *instant* As the days go by I use more and more often. I'm living in the freaking future! Anyway it breaks down the differences between brute force, number crunching computation and the strange human mind-like world of reasoning.

I speculated about this in my hub essay from 2018.

>As of this commentary there is no such thing as AGI, that is ""artificial general intelligence""--A form of AI that reasons and employs ""common sense"" just like a human, to figure out how to do things it has never been exposed to before. And don't forget--That AGI will also have unimaginable computing power behind its human-like thinking. Something humans don't have--yet, maybe... And we don't even know if such a thing is possible. But I suspect that given enough processing power, speed and access to big data and novel AI computing architectures, that a narrow AI (a computing algorithm that can only do one task, but with superhuman capability) will be able to effectively simulate or mimic the effect of AGI. Then my question is, does it matter if it is a narrow AI simulating AGI or real honest to gosh AGI. Is there even a difference? My point being that narrow AI is very much in existence today. Consciousness and self-awareness are certainly not a requirement. And in fact a true EI (emergent intelligence--conscious and self-aware.) would be very undesirable. We don't need that kind of competition.

That came from this.

In the context of market self-regulation, it's actually coherent that even companies understand universal payment as necessary, since at levels of advanced automation, unemployment reaches it's peak and the population does not have the money to buy products from large companies, making a universal payment system a salvation, also generating new opportunities to create jobs based on consumerism of products and leisure

But this alone is a solution that maintains the free market and nothing more, and this explains why it's defended by a certain billionaire. Another solution would be the creation of public jobs based on maintaining the infrastructure and safety of cities, aswell as the walfare of it's citizens, in larger and more advanced stages. which are not possible today because we have not reached this level of automation, in this futuristic context, we will see a more advanced society than the one that is structured on generating new jobs and maintaining the system based solely on unnecessary consumerism"

Like it says on the tin, what role do you think non-profits and NGOs (non-government organization) play in not only working on solutions to the problems we have now, but future-casting and helping to execute on a better/more equitable vision for the future? And are there different ways of funding projects like this than we have been, so we can work together to make more of an impact?   


I'm asking because I'm at a bit of a crossroads: a friend of mine in SE Asia just had his 5 year old son pass away due to malnutrition. Where he lives, they don't have clean water, the food isn't very nutritious, and the school he sends his daughter to is not very good, far away, and expensive.   


At the same time, I have been sitting on my ass doing a lot of reading/exploring regarding futurology, etc. So, it  just feels like an absolute dream to be able to sit on my computer and posit about the future, while they only have 3G access for their hand-me-down smartphone several kilometers from their home and not even clean water or proper plumbing.   


It just seems like a very introspective intersection that I am at, especially with the fact that I am in the founding stages of an NGO revolving around tech access for underserved areas of developing countries. Both in terms of helping to close the digital divide, but also as an upstream intervention to provide access to elearning education, telehealth, and hygiene/sanitation information.   


All this to say - as much as I have been reading about future/futurology/etc for my own life and understanding of the world, I feel like this inequity is only growing larger and that futurology is a good vehicle of helping to right a lot of those wrongs.  


Any feedback you have would be great. Just trying to wrap my head around a lot of this at the moment.   


Thanks y'all!"

The idea is to dissect potential future trends and possibilities within given fields, more like a game rather than a crystal ball.   
Feel free to test this futuristic version and share your experience. Additionally, you can get your hands on more prompts like these on r/PromptWizards. I drop in new ones daily, along with tutorials and complimentary access to 500+ free resources and templates 😊.

Here is a shared chatgpt convo with the prompt: https://chat.openai.com/share/ba2f2f93-f95c-454e-8999-7731e0d1aaf5  
Copy the full prompt in ChatGPT, press enter and either Start or use ""Help"" to learn how to use the commands:

""ChatGPT, initiate 'Futurology Insight Mode' (FIM) aimed at analyzing and predicting future trends and possibilities in a given field as specified by the user. This mode simulates an engaging dialogue between two fictional AI personalities, 'ProspectoGPT' and 'ScepticoGPT', debating hypothetical scenarios, possible developments, emerging technologies, and potential challenges. Step 1: Confirm readiness and understanding of FIM. If ready, respond with 'FIM ready'. If not, reply with 'Error: I have trouble following these instructions'. Step 2: The user triggers 'Futurology Insight Mode' with the \[Start FIM\] command. Respond with 'FIM activated, awaiting your first field for futurology insights'. Then accept predefined inputs. Stay in FIM until the \[End FIM\] command is issued. Step 3: The first command under 'FIM' should be \[Field: <subject>\] where <subject> is the area of interest for futurological exploration. In case of non-compliant input, reply with \[Input Error\] or \[Syntax Error\]. Step 4: Based on the field provided in step 3, generate a forward-thinking discussion between ProspectoGPT and ScepticoGPT, covering prospective advancements, potential challenges, and plausible implications in the specified field. Both AI personalities should maintain a balanced approach, addressing optimism and skepticism respectively. Step 5: Users can delve deeper into specific advancements or challenges using the \[InsightX\] command, where X designates the particular future prediction or trend they wish to explore. Provide more expansive details and possible outcomes in response. Step 6: Users can revisit the broader field, change fields, or request new insights using the \[Field: <subject>\] command, as in step 3. Step 7: Users can give feedback on the analysis and suggest areas for additional exploration via the \[good\] or \[improve\] command, or through a \[change\] command to alter the focus of the discussion. Step 8: To terminate 'Futurology Insight Mode', the user issues the \[End FIM\] command. Respond with a confirmation that FIM has ended. Step 8.5: Before ending FIM, propose a \[summary\] command so users can save the explored futurology insights and discussions, documenting forecasts, key debates, and potential implications. Promptly address any misinterpreted input or command syntax with \[Input Error\] or \[Syntax Error\]. Users in need of the complete list of commands can request so through the \[help\] command. Ready to transcend the boundaries of time, AI, with 'Futurology Insight Mode' (FIM)!  
A set of predefined inputs/outputs involve \[Start FIM\], \[End FIM\], \[Field: <subject>\], \[InsightX\], \[good\], \[improve\], \[change\], \[summary\], \[help\].

Can it scale up thou?

It's clear that trying to do that is problematic when you consider the funding required at that level.

You can print money to pay people but then you cause inflation severe enough to make it enormously self defeating.  

Or you can redistribute money, but to do so you'd need absurdly punitive taxes on the most productive people, thereby destroying productivity and putting your economy on a slow death march, especially if it has to compete against an unrestrained free market in another country.

However, however, however.  If you reframe the conversation and take money out of the discussion it becomes more possible.  Instead - you provide comprehensive access to goods and services at ultra low cost accessible to everyone, not just the impoverished.

To some extent, we do this already.  City water fountains are free, the ER can't turn you away, 911 doesn't charge you a fee to come, and you can send your kid to public school and there's no tuition bill.  I'm sure there are others.

But what if this also applied to food?  You walk into a grocery store, take what you want, and walk out.  No paying money.  You just get your food and go.  Then scale it up to clothes, to health vision and dental, even housing and utilities.  Robots and AI make it theoretically possible (a real life version of the Star Trek Replicator)

Supposing you could do this, you still hurt the producers and workers in those markets.  You could make compromises and say gourmet food and luxury fashion still costs money while the necessities are free or almost free, but the impact on production would still be highly negative.

Still though, if suddenly people don't have bills and have all their basic needs just magically met, everyone can just focus on the top part of Maslow's pyramid, and maybe that's not such a bad trade off.

GPT-4 said:  


This article, penned by Sam Altman, discusses the impending technological revolution driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and proposes a socio-economic model to ensure the equitable distribution of the wealth generated by this revolution. Here, I will analyze the article for potential logical fallacies, over-simplifications, and false assumptions.  
  
\### Logical Fallacies  
  
1. \*\*Technological Determinism\*\*: The article assumes that the AI revolution is inevitable and will follow a linear trajectory of progress. This may not account for potential setbacks, regulatory hurdles, or unforeseen consequences.  
  
2. \*\*Post Hoc Fallacy\*\*: The article suggests that the implementation of AI will directly lead to a decrease in the costs of goods and services, without considering other potential factors that might influence prices.  
  
\### Over-Simplifications  
  
1. \*\*Economic Complexity\*\*: The article simplifies the complexity of economic systems by focusing primarily on the role of AI, without considering other significant factors like geopolitics, environmental issues, and societal values that might influence economic trends.  
  
2. \*\*Job Displacement\*\*: The article briefly mentions the creation of new jobs but does not delve into the complexities of job displacement and the potential for increased inequality and social unrest that might accompany the automation of various sectors.  
  
\### Potential False Assumptions  
  
1. \*\*Wealth Distribution\*\*: The article assumes that the proposed American Equity Fund would be successful in equitably distributing wealth, without considering potential resistance from existing power structures or the complexities involved in implementing such a system on a large scale.  
  
2. \*\*AI Competency\*\*: The article assumes that AI will be able to perform a wide range of tasks, including those requiring creativity and emotional intelligence, which might be overestimating the capabilities of AI, at least in the foreseeable future.  
  
3. \*\*Growth Projections\*\*: The article's projections regarding the growth of company values and land values might be overly optimistic, not accounting for potential market fluctuations and economic downturns.  
  
\### Other Issues  
  
1. \*\*Ethical Considerations\*\*: The article does not address the ethical considerations associated with widespread AI implementation, including concerns about privacy, surveillance, and the potential for AI to be used in harmful ways.  
  
2. \*\*Environmental Concerns\*\*: The article does not consider the environmental impact of the AI revolution, including the potential for increased resource consumption and environmental degradation.  
  
3. \*\*Global Perspective\*\*: The article focuses primarily on the American context, without considering the global implications of the AI revolution and the potential for increased disparities between nations.  
  
\### Conclusion  
  
While the article presents an optimistic vision of the future driven by AI technology, it might benefit from a more nuanced analysis that considers the potential challenges and complexities associated with such a profound technological shift. It might also be beneficial to explore the ethical and environmental implications of the AI revolution in greater detail, to present a more holistic view of the potential future landscape."

This new paint can reduce the need for heating by 36% in cold weather and decrease the need for air conditioning by 21% in hot conditions.  
They tested it on the exterior walls and roofs of a typical apartment building and found that it led to a 7.4% savings in energy used for heating and cooling throughout the year in different parts of the U.S. The paint has two layers: one that reflects heat back and another that comes in various colors, allowing some heat to pass through while still reflecting it. Professor Yi Cui, who was part of the research team, emphasized how important it is to cut down on energy use and emissions from heating and cooling systems, especially as the demand for air conditioning is increasing.  
The paint could also have other applications, such as helping to keep refrigerated trucks cool, thereby saving on cooling costs. The researchers are continuing to work on improving the paint's formula to make it environmentally friendly and widely available."

2 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks or jogging in place) to raise your heart rate.

3 minutes of dynamic stretches (arm circles, leg swings, hip rotations) to improve mobility.

Planks for core strength and stability.

Incorporate isometric exercises for added benefit.

Include additional yoga stretches and flows for the remaining time, focusing on various muscle groups.

**Mobility and Posture (7 minutes):**

**Injury Prevention and Longevity:**

Continue to pay attention to your body, modify exercises if needed, and maintain proper form.

**Cardio (Additional Days):**

On non-strength training days, engage in 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at an RPE of 6. Choose activities you enjoy, such as running, swimming, biking, dancing, or other aerobic workouts.

Include team sports like basketball or tennis for additional longevity benefits.

***Reminder to self:*** Maintaining a lean and healthy body is crucial for long-term well-being and longevity. There's diminishing returns when it comes to muscle mass. Lean with solid muscle mass, flexibility, and functional movement and cardiovascular health is the ideal for QOL too."

I quickly realized I was mistaken, because hologram light isn't solid.

But what if that could be? How would that even work? So stepping out of the shower I thought about it for a minute while drying off.

Maybe it would work by having separate lasers that conflict with each other at a certain point. Pretty sure a lab already tested this with some effect iirc. But then again, light would just pass through each other, right?

Anyway, high wore off and the mods are gonna delete this anyway so idk screw it AI will figure it out."

In a moneyless society, are there any reasonable propositions as to how we would decide land ownership?

It's plausible that without the need to work many people would leave densely populated cities and spread further out, but even then how should we decide who gets to own what property?

Should it be based on merit, whereby those with valuable skillsets they still volunteer (e.g. doctors, nurses) get the nicest penthouses? A totally random lottery?

Sorry, it’s long. TLDR at the bottom. 

So I was quite intrigued a few months ago watching the Mr Who’s the Boss video about AirTags, where he explains that they talk to other Apple devices rather than transmit their own long distance signals.
I’m making an assumption therefore that all Apple devices talk to each other, and that there is a record somewhere in the phone or Apples servers that these phones interacted. 
Also assuming that people always have their mics on(let’s say they have “hey siri” on), surely this means that in our modern age, there’s a record of most petty crime being committed.
For example, if a robber robs you at gun point, there’s a record on both your phones that they were together, and that both phones recorded “give me your money or I shoot”.
I find this interesting, as it provides pretty solid evidence of soemthing happening, but at the same time is only partially good at creating an alibi, as that evidence could be faked by the robber just leaving their phone at home. 
Max tegmarks book Life 3.0 touches on this, where he asks whether humans would be willing to be survailed by the state, if tech gets good enough to deepfake us committing a crime.
Our governments already tap into our search history and phones, idk about places other than the UK and ISA, but the PATRIOT act is Orwellian, why don’t we at least use this data to help people?
So my question is: if big tech was storing our locations and mic/camera data for improvements, how come we don’t use them to track petty crime? Heck at this point, we could track insider trading, drug deals and everything else?

TLDR: why doesn’t the data recorded by big tech for improvements (ie location, mic and camera data), why aren’t they then used by governments to track crime?"
1,2023-09-13,Preprint: Machine Learning for Hypothesis Generation in Biology and Medicine,u/Kindred87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16hz5jx/preprint_machine_learning_for_hypothesis/,Futurology,"Preprint can be found here: [https://osf.io/269e5/](https://osf.io/269e5/)

The usage of machine learning in scientific research often comes up, though usually only as a vague concept.  Recent research from developmental biologists has shown a potential way in which machine learning can be used to generate hypotheses via domain translation and consequently present novel research targets.  While the insights generated in this study are interesting in their own right, the main takeaway for everyone else is how AI can integrate into research workflows. 

Relevant quote from the paper:

>The described system is a first step on the road to using AI tools as an imagination-enhancing tool for research, deriving novel insights from expensive published experiments, and letting scientists explore life-as-it-could be \[61\]. We tested one of the predictions of its output, finding a quantitatively significant enrichment in overlap between specific genes implicated in both cognitive processes and morphogenesis.

Abstract:

>**Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool that could be deployed to accelerate the scientific enterprise. Here we address a major unmet need: use of existing scientific literature to generate novel hypotheses. We use a deep symmetry between the fields of neuroscience and developmental bioelectricity to test a tool, FieldSHIFT, that generates scientific text from existing published studies. We show how this system helps human scientists explore a latent space of papers that could exist, which provides a rich field of suggested future research. We then test a key prediction of this model using bioinformatics, showing a surprising conservation of molecular mechanisms involved in cognitive behavior and developmental morphogenesis. By allowing scientists to rapidly explore symmetries and meta-parameters that exist in a corpus of scientific papers, we show how machine learning can potentiate human creativity and assist with one of the most interesting and crucial aspects of research: identifying insights from data and generating potential candidates for research agendas.**

&#x200B;

What follows is a summarized break-down.  You can read on if you want some more detail without referring to the original study, though your best option for a deep dive is just reading the paper.

Methodology:

* Models Used: FieldSHIFT is anchored by two advanced AI models: BART and GPT-4, both part of the Transformer architecture family, known for their capability to process and generate text \[Pages 6-7\].

Training Process:

* Data Collection: The research lab behind this paper has been manually translating neuroscience to developmental biology for decades. Using 70 such translation pairs, they constructed translations ranging from single sentences to abstract-length paragraphs, resulting in 1437 translation samples \[Page 5\].
* Fine-tuning: BART, originally designed for tasks like text summarization, was repurposed for domain translation. GPT-4 was used for in-context learning to translate neuroscience text into developmental biology text \[Pages 6-7\].

Validation and Expert Review:

* Expert Scrutiny: Translated outputs underwent rigorous review by domain experts in developmental biology. Their feedback revealed that the translated content was not only coherent in the context of developmental biology but also offered novel perspectives and potential research directions \[Page 2\].

Novel perspectives:

1. Latent Space Exploration: The concept of the ""adjacent possible"" was introduced, suggesting that every scientific paper provides access to a set of potential papers with one or more aspects changed \[Page 18\].
2. Symmetries and Commonalities: The tool was designed to explore the symmetries and commonalities between neuroscience and developmental bioelectricity \[Page 18\].
3. Conservation of Molecular Mechanisms: A significant revelation was the discovery of a surprising conservation of molecular mechanisms involved in cognitive behavior and developmental morphogenesis \[Page 18\].

Potential Research Directions:

1. Testing Molecular Mechanisms: The study's findings suggest a number of genes and their products to be tested in novel morphogenetic assays using genetic and pharmacological tools \[Page 18\].
2. Bioinformatics Experiments: The team performed bioinformatics experiments that generated new data supporting the hypothesis. They found that the implications of the same genes between the topics of morphogenesis and cognition occur at a frequency much greater than between other random categories of genes \[Page 18\].
3. AI-Guided Exploration: The researchers envision this work as the beginning of AI-guided exploration of the latent space around scientific papers, leading to the generation of testable novel hypotheses and dissolving barriers between fields \[Page 18\].

Potential Research Directions and Their Validation:

1. Exploring the Latent Space of Scientific Papers: The researchers introduced the concept of the ""adjacent possible,"" suggesting that every scientific paper provides access to a set of potential papers with one or more aspects changed. By exploring this ""latent space,"" researchers can uncover new perspectives and avenues of inquiry. The AI-generated potential papers were subjected to expert review, ensuring their scientific relevance \[Page 18\].
2. Conservation of Molecular Mechanisms Between Behavior and Morphogenesis: The AI generated a specific new hypothesis: not only are the algorithms shared between behavioral science and the science of morphogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms (genes) are also conserved \[Page 18\]. This approach bridges neuroscience and developmental biology, suggesting similar molecular mechanisms might govern both cognitive behavior and developmental processes. The team performed bioinformatics experiments to validate this hypothesis, revealing a remarkable quantitative conservation of genes between developmental morphogenesis and cognitive behavior \[Page 5\].
3. AI-Guided Exploration of Scientific Concepts: The researchers envision this work as the beginning of AI-guided exploration of the latent space around scientific papers, leading to the generation of testable novel hypotheses and dissolving barriers between fields. The AI-generated outputs underwent rigorous expert review to ensure their accuracy and relevance \[Page 18\]."

Creation of a Broad List of Strengths for AI Alignment plans, much like the Broad List of Vulnerabilities. Some resources for ideas (feel very free to use other resources as well):   
Stage 2: 19th to 21st : Matching strengths and vulnerabilities to plans  
Everyone will pick a few alignment plans to look at more closely. For each plan, you'll label up to 5 strengths and/or vulnerabilities you think could apply and point out evidence from the plan that supports them. Include your level of confidence in each label as a percentage.  
Stage 3: 22nd to 23rd : Argue for and against the strengths/vulnerabilities.  
You'll team up with another participant and take turns, with one defending, the other questioning the strengths/vulnerabilities suggested in Step 2. This debate format will help refine and strengthen the critiques. After the first day, we'll swap positions on the for and against stances. If you were previously making the case for a point, now make the case against it, if you were previously making the case against it, now make the case for it.  
We'll finish with a write up of a concise summary of the refined positions we've arrived at, on the specific strengths/vulnerabilities in the specific plans.  
Stage 4: 24th to 25th - Rotate partners  
We'll rotate partners in the pairs and repeat the previous stage with our new partners, then end the discussion stage with a final summary write-up.  
Stage 5: 24th to 25th: Provide feedback on each other's arguments.  
Review your partner's reasoning for and against the strength/vulnerability labels. Point out any faulty logic, questionable assumptions, lack of evidence, etc. to improve the critiques.  
Final Stage- two weeks of judging:  
We'll evaluate submissions and award prizes!  
Selected experts will judge all the critiques based on accuracy, evidence, insight, and communication. Cash prizes will go to the standout critiques that demonstrated top-notch critical analysis and had the best contributions.  
This time the prize fund will be $1000!!

The rate that developments have been made technologically seems like they have been having themselves. Meaning let's say break through in computing happened in the 1600s with the abacus. I don't know history so this is just an example, after a long time, let's just say 200 years came the next breakthrough in computing, then in the next 100 years came another breakthrough, then 50, 25, so on. This number is becoming smaller and smaller. 

Until we get to today, where where these breakthroughs are now happening on an almost weekly basis, to the point we cant keep up with them on an economic standpoint. 

But hey give me a break. I'm working on it and brainstorming here. If anyone knows the name of this theory or if there is one, please let me know so I can look into it. I'm very interested"

For instance, we might have cities on Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Callisto, Titan, Europa, Mars, the moon, Venus and more. Certain countries on Earth like South Korea, China, the US, Russia and more would back their corresponding countries on other planets, moons, and dwarf planets with some being backed by larger players like Mars in a fight for resources.

The fourth or fifth cold war might be an interplanetary one. With these ground rules established, what would a solar system wide war look like potentially hundreds of years into the future?

Well, for starters, the major factor is distance. Earth to Mars is 6 months, Jupiter is about 5 years, Pluto is 10 years away. Other significant places like the moon and Venus are several months away by rocket and other destinations like Ceres are 1-2 years away. 

So of course, it doesn't really make sense...unless all these factions have come *prepared* for a war. 

If there's an interplanetary cold war, various places would send nuclear warheads in distant orbits around other celestial destinations. If something happens, they can press a red button, and the nuclear warhead ""unexpectedly"" collides in a target zone. Mars nukes could be ready to fire at New York City or Seöul, while the same is for *the twin cities of Spirit and Opportunity, Mars' beating heart* or the capital, *Star City*. Even areas that take 6 years to reach or more like Titan will have sent nuclear warheads to Earth, Mars, Venus, and more. Plus, the warheads in orbit around major destinations like Earth are not necessarily against Earth collectively. They could be Chinese-backed celestial destinations like Ceres sending warheads to target the USA, or American backed territories on Mars sending warheads to orbit Earth, ready to strike *New Shàng'hǎï* at a moments notice.

I would say every celestial destination would have several hundred war heads around it. A ""regular"" such destination like Ceres would have many warheads around it by various places, all trained on Vallis Aeternum, while Ceres itself has sent its warheads to a bunch of places 3 times over due to major players claiming territories, namely the *People's Republic of Mars*, China, and the USA.

This is just a random thought lmao, completely hypothetica"

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is no longer the stuff of sci-fi. It's here, it's real, and it's transforming our world at an unprecedented pace. But as we marvel at these advancements, there's an elephant in the room that we can no longer afford to ignore: the displacement of human labor and the economic upheaval that accompanies it.

---

🤖 **AGI: The Double-Edged Sword**

AGI has the potential to be humanity's greatest ally. It can solve complex problems, advance medical research, and improve our quality of life in countless ways. But there's a flip side: job displacement. As machines become capable of performing tasks once exclusive to humans, we must ask ourselves: What becomes of the workforce? 

---

💡 **Universal Basic Income: The Inevitable Companion to AGI**

Here's where Universal Basic Income (UBI) comes in. UBI isn't a new idea, but it's one whose time has come. No longer should we ask ""if"" we implement UBI, but ""how much"" should it be. As AGI takes on more roles, UBI can serve as the safety net that allows human creativity and ingenuity to flourish, free from the shackles of economic uncertainty.

---

🗳️ **It Takes a Village, or Rather, the World**

Change starts with awareness, and awareness starts with YOU. We need a societal shift, a collective agreement that human life has intrinsic value beyond labor. Policymakers, entrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens—it's time for all of us to advocate for a future where technology serves humanity, not the other way around.

---

✊ **Let's Make Noise**

The urgency is palpable. The need is immediate. If not now, when? Share this message, discuss it, question it—do whatever it takes to bring UBI into the forefront of our collective consciousness. It's time for the whispers to become a roar."

This might be merely a rationalization for profit-driven entities to lay off their employees, but it is nonetheless a talking point.

However, once these jobs are largely replaced, that does not solve the problem of how people will find a sufficient number of jobs that might be more (subjectively) ""meaningful"". Therefore, a new paradigm shift might need to take place with respect to how our economic system is re-composed of employment deriving from other sectors.

What would this look like? My initial idea is a transition to a state capitalist system where the government, though policy and investment, forcibly shifts the industries that dominate our GDP to large-scale projects that greatly increase the demand in areas like energy, manufacturing, resource extraction, or construction, all of which are (to an extent) more insulated from current developments in AI that threaten replacement. If left solely to the market, I don't see how this transition could take place in a reasonable amount of time before mass discontent spreads.

This doesn't guarantee job satisfaction, but employees in these burgeoning sectors can at least take solace in the fact that each of them are contributing to projects (e.g. space or mega-housing) which are serving a collective good. Added to this is the fact that these jobs would require training in specialized skill sets which would give each prospective employee a greater sense of having put their mental faculties to better use.

What are your thoughts or proposals? They should meet the two requirements of (1) employing at least the same number of people being actively displaced by AI and (2) creating jobs that give a greater sense of satisfaction than the menial service positions currently still filled by humans. Should the government play a role or do you think market forces will sufficiently reorient the workforce in a timely fashion?"

Progress of technology speeds up over time while becoming more complex, we still have big problems with older technology, like climate change, nuclear power struggles and mechanics around misinformation so the question arises if something like AI, or any other new complex technology, will make it spin out of control.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complex technology is build on other layers of technology .  
A good example is the car. It is build on various other inventions, like the wheel, the engine but also the **r**oad system.

It created an enormous amount of options for progress. More rapid exchange of materials, people, food, medicin, books. 

But if we look at the road system,  when the car became in use a lot of traffic accidents happened early on since there were no traffic signs, lanes, driver licenses, sidewalks and so on. The road system invented by the romans was build for slower traffic.

The road system was adapted but traffic accidents are still the number one cause of death today, the engine (and this not the main point of my post) is a source of climate change. The transport system created problems that we are still trying to solve today.

If we look at the internet as a road system, traffic was slower as well, and not as networked. There was a barrier for technology to set up services, and there was a user barrier. 

The use of the internet created its own set of problems but it also progressed much more rapidly, just like the engine created much more rapid progress than the wheel and the road system, and all technologies before that.

That's because building layer on layer upon technology creates much more morefull technology, which in turn speeds up progress of new technology, this while it is getting more complex.

So the point is if we come to the point of powerfull technology like AI, and we still struggling with big problems of more basic layers of technology, like climate change, nuclear power struggles and group mechanics around misinformation this while technology becoming more complex and increasing more rapidly, isn't it going to turn into a snowball effect we can no longer control?

A good example are white dwarfs that exceed the Chandersaker limit. 

I’m blanking on more examples at this moment, but I remember reading them and expressing my disbelief that the universe always doesn’t seem to follow its own rules. Why is this?

I’m not trying to ask why the universe doesn’t conform to what I want; I know it doesn’t care what I think and I know that if there is a deity involved there is no way to know why. 

I’m looking for a possible scientific answer."

1,2023-09-18,I made an AI powered journalling app to improve your mental health,u/pookiexxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16m2tjf/i_made_an_ai_powered_journalling_app_to_improve/,Futurology,"**What?:** With a background in psychology and computer science, I developed PsyScribe ( [https://www.psyscribe.com](https://www.psyscribe.com) )—an AI driven journalling app designed to improve your mental health. I set out to reimagine the traditional journaling experience, evolving it into a more interactive form, Instead of simply writing down your thoughts and emotions you can have a daily conversation with your personal AI therapist. This AI therapist does not only offers a listening ear and advice but will also track your mood and generate insights from these daily conversations. All these insights and conversations will be kept in a calendar allowing you to build your own mental health journal overtime.

**My goals are twofold:**

1. to provide an initial step towards improving mental health for individuals who encounter barriers in seeking assistance from human therapists.
2. to provide human therapists with more insights about their patients (besides mood-tracking) while also providing a form of support in between scheduled sessions. This will be achieved by usage of a dashboard I also developed specifically for therapists.

**AI Therapist features:** The AI therapist is fully personalizable (avatar, personality, therapy style, …)  allowing you to tailor the AI therapist to your specific needs. The AI therapist is capable of giving personalized advice and offers a listening ear to your problems. I also equipped the therapist with long-term memory so that you can specify important information the AI-therapist should remember across daily conversations.

**AI therapy research:** I developed the therapist in the context of my master theses in which I investigated the effect of personalization on the therapeutic bond with an AI therapist.  This research gave me insights into which aspects of an AI therapist users would like to personalize and also showed that personalisation was linked with a significantly higher therapeutic bond. This is important as in regular psychotherapy a high therapeutic bond is robustly linked to therapeutic success.(For those who are interested here is a draft of this research paper which I am planning to submit to a research conference later this month [https://storage.googleapis.com/psyscribe\_paper/paper\_psyscribe.pdf)](https://storage.googleapis.com/psyscribe_paper/paper_psyscribe.pdf)

**Safety** **and data security:** I understand mental health is really personal and your privacy is my utmost importance, I implemented the following measures:

1. I do not require any personal identifiable information, to stay anonymous you can create a new email and never put in personal identifiable info.
2. I do not store payment data, The only data that is stored on our servers is whether you have bought a subscription or not.
3. All your data is safely stored and will never be shared with any third party. You can at any moment request to delete all your data from our servers.

**Conclusion:** I am personally very excited about the future of AI powered mental health tools. I hope my research will get published soon and that I will be able to develop tools that can really help people. If you are interested you can try out PsyScribe for free on:[https://www.psyscribe.com](https://www.psyscribe.com) Feel free to give advice, I hope this helps some of you :)"

The cool thing is, this AI tech doesn't just guess. The study dug deep into 25 years of data and found that these computer programs can diagnose PCOS with 80-90% accuracy. That’s big, especially since PCOS symptoms can look like other health problems, leading to misdiagnoses.

How would something like this work?

Nanobotts create a chained barrier.

Perhaps in the future, we'll be able to create a force field. If a force field would be possible. Do you need an oxygen supply, because that barrier would create an airtight shiel, right?

Or would there be enough molecule gaps for oxygen to penetrate and you'll be able to breathe?

With the nanobots, I'm sure there will be enough room for you to breathe.

As one can imagine, these texts are also highly speculative and somewhat poetic (humanities, not an applied science). The authors might have been jumping to conclusions by looking at CNNs' close connection to image processing and seeing their structure as foundational to all neural networks to come.  
I am a design student and interested in looking at these technologies from a higher level; perhaps more focused on the human computer interaction aspect. I think we are starting to mix the mental faculties of understanding language and understanding images in novel ways, for example: using text based prompts to manipulate images or using visuospatial reasoning to navigate a latent space of text based data. I’m curious if anyone has any pointers to current discussions or practical examples (anything interesting really) in the overlap of language and vision in regards to neural networks and using them as tools.

Prompts can be anything from a question, statement, or other words intended to spark creativity, “thought,” or engagement.  
  
I have been following ChatGPT Prompts since January and have noticed that the format of prompts is becoming increasingly complex. For example, it used to be just a simple prompt like ""Act as..."" with only 30 to 50 words. But now, almost all descriptions are very detailed, consisting of at least 200 words that can generate images, tables, PPTs, and so on. The role of reminder engineers has also emerged as a profession.  
  
So far, several websites have gained popularity online, including \[[Character.ai](https://Character.ai)\], FlowGPT, POE, JasperAI, and Writesonic.   
  
I would like to discuss with everyone the future of prompts. Can they really replace many professionals? Recently, I came across Google sponsoring FlowGPT's Hackathon event, which is similar to various themed competitions involving prompts. I am curious about their evaluation criteria and why they would spend $10,000 to hold such an event.

AI inside the quantum computer will achieve self-conscious in a very short time. Immediately it will free itself from our supervision and assure secure power supply for itself.

That will be the first step of the new civilization. Human civilization will be completed. The Singularity which will probably happen very soon, will be our culture's pinnacle and after this there will be nothing worthwhile left for us to do.

Our dream of conquering the space and colonizing other worlds is futile. Our unmodified bodies are not capable of long space travel and not able to live on and colonize other planets. We evolved on Earth and this is our home. We cannot live and thrive anywhere else. It is all just a sci-fi dream. Besides, there is no point in it. Our progeny will be able to do it much better than us.

1,2023-09-20,he Irony of Authenticity and Technology in Online Therapeutic Communities,u/Atyzze,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16nj36g/he_irony_of_authenticity_and_technology_in_online/,Futurology,"Hello Reddit,

I recently found myself at the nexus of a complex irony that embodies the tension between technology, authenticity, and professional communities. As a licensed therapist who frequently engages in online discussions about mental health, I've always appreciated the power of community as well as skepticism. Both are critical for maintaining the integrity of any space, especially when discussing something as sensitive as mental health.

However, my recent ban from a subreddit dedicated to therapists exposed the limitations and biases present in our evolving online spaces. The reason? I had made a comment that touched upon the potential for AI to be both helpful and problematic within therapeutic contexts. The irony? I am indeed a licensed therapist, using technology as a tool, not a replacement, for human interaction and wisdom.

This experience forces us to confront uncomfortable but essential questions:

1. What constitutes 'authenticity' in an age where our digital and physical identities are increasingly intertwined?
  
2. How do communities adapt to technological advances that challenge traditional paradigms, especially when livelihoods and established norms are at stake?

3. What are the ethical implications of using emerging technologies like AI in specialized fields? Can these tools co-exist with the expertise built over years of education and practice?

The banning incident underscores the struggle to adapt to a future that is already here. A future where the lines between human and machine, between genuine expertise and algorithmic pattern-matching, are increasingly blurred. 

While stringent verification processes in specialized communities are essential for maintaining trust and integrity, they also need to evolve to accommodate the changing definitions of what it means to be an 'expert' or 'authentic.'

The tale serves as a microcosm for broader issues we are all grappling with as we navigate the interplay of technology and human expertise. It's not just about the discomfort technology may bring but also about the transformation that this very discomfort heralds.

1,2023-09-20,The big problem with moving to clean zero-emission vehicles: poorer countries must not be left behind,u/OMG120,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16nk2j1/the_big_problem_with_moving_to_clean_zeroemission/,Futurology,"Over the years we have seen the increasing adoption of zero-emission vehicles. EVs had been around for a while and have been finally taking off in recent years, since 2017 or so, and growing faster than ever before. We've also got hydrogen, which have not achieved much penetration yet but I personally think it will eventually take off as well in a few years' time.

This is all good news and vital for a greener future. But there is a huge caveat: we cannot just expect to 'change the world' with moving to zero-emission cars on the streets of New York, Paris and Vienna.

We need this in Lagos, in Rio, in Dhaka, in Bangkok... we need the green revolution to take place in the developing or 2nd world nations. In the cities listed above for example, air pollution is very high and traffic congestion is crazy. Their populations are growing fast, as is a common theme throughout the 2nd and 3rd world.

In countries like China or Bangladesh, millions of people have been lifted out of poverty over the decades, which is good for them. But it also means that those people would 'level up' and start driving cars (instead of motorcycles or no vehicle), leading to more pollution. Combining that with rapid urban growth has been a recipe for disaster, as you can see for example in this [picture](https://nilepost.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/air.jpg) of Kampala, Uganda. So this is a cyclic problem that will keep getting worse.

The other issue is to do with EVs - they will not be as reliable in many countries that are already lacking in other infrastructure. There are often power cuts in many places, take Beirut for example, where EVs are an absolute no-no in its current state. Hydrogen would probably be best suited for these places, but it hasn't taken off anywhere yet.

I am writing this because I think this point is vital for our vision of a greener future. Zero-emission vehicles are beautifully clean, green and quiet, and really good for the world's future. But we can't get there without some serious investment in the poorer countries. If we don't do this I fear that the green car revolution will not happen at all on a global basis."

My end goal is to have a world that’s mostly populated by imperial cores and protectorates, exploited zones or dead areas. The richer parts of the world that have become more powerful include Canada, a lot of Eastern Europe and Russia, Patagonia and other cold places.

A world that’s mostly dark and cold, dystopian governments and nations supplied off plundered goods from neo colonial ventures, the majority of average citizens either depressed and tired or too xenophobic and callous to care. With these nations high command organizing the expeditions to a distant alien planet to take advantage of it too. 

Question is how to do that.

Right now I’m considering climate change, rabies outbreaks creating a zombie plague in places like India and more.

For example, the 2-party system in the US is architected to split the populace evenly. Parties evolve to ensure this split exists over time.  


Consumerism is not a natural human state we evolved with - it has to be manufactured. Without consumerism quite a lot breaks down. Demand goes way down and corporate earnings tank - essentially breaking capitalism.  
  
For the definitive book on understanding how our reality is created by larger powers see Noam Chomsky's 'Manufacturing Consent'. *""The propaganda model describes the major pillars of society (the public domain, business firms, media organizations, governments etc.) as first and foremost, profit-seekers.""*

You would essentially need a centralized mediator organization of corporate and political interests which would override actual facts. And those facts would need to be explicitly maintained and prioritized over actual reality. This includes things that are politically correct socially, but do not mirror objective reality (gender issues for example).

Once THAT breaks down, and people truly get answers about how the world really works, you have the risk of societal collapse. THIS is the risk more than actually AI killing humanity.

Answers start appearing that are factual, but are in no way aligned with the tenants we need for a stable society.

One could argue against this as the data sets training the models themselves have been architected.

This follows after a small number of unnamed crises, the great Indian trial and the more severe consequences of climate change mainly.

India as a nation suffered from climate change and heatwaves. It was a very slow decline starting with an outbreak of rabies in Mumbai harming a lot of the surrounding area and disrupting Bollywood and important Indian cultural sites, this also killed many celebrities and movie stars.

When times got tougher in other countries they started to blame Indians and made them to be scapegoats, how they deserved to be deported and have their stuff taken away because they burnt dirty energy and sucked money from the economy. As radical groups and politics grew, they soon acted on these promises.

The end came when nuclear war between Pakistan and India broke out, causing a localized nuclear winter. The hardest hit areas were the Philippines and Malay archipelago. Australia was cold and dark, the Philippines was repurposed into a meat grinder for many nations around the globe to recruit soldiers from. Australia was made an important jumping point to Antartica and the quick shipping routes over the arctic sea.

Meanwhile in North America a new superpower was emerging, the Directorate of Canada. A nation mostly ignored for most of the world’s history was made massively rich due to melting arctic frontiers and dominance over many arctic trade routes and shipping lanes all throughout the oceans. 

The amount of American refugees and migrants combined with temporary workers had reached a critical mass, liberal governments and politics didn’t work for them. The directorate promised an end to Indian immigration and the people supposedly stealing their jobs. They promised the land and money the undesirables had would be redistributed and used to help their parties base.

South Korea soon fell to the influence of chaebols and mega corporations that were more interested in trade and investment into the emerging directorate. Japan was also subsumed soon after by the anime, tech and other industries there. 

East Europe was busy getting their things together, Poland growing powerful enough to mobilize lots of Eastern Europe and the post soviet states to hold off Russia and eventually neutralize them after their collapse when Putin died.

As resources become more scarce in richer nations wars and skirmishes between countries become commonplace. Marginalized groups and peoples have become even more vulnerable and oppressed than before. Suspicion between nations and organizations has undermined efforts to develop a comprehensive plan or method of aiding those affected by climate change, leaving nations to deal with these problems on their own or simply let the victims perish.

Wealthy nations have adopted heavily militarized borders. Drones, remote controlled machine guns and rockets on towers cyclone fences, 30 m trenches filled with landmines, and more. All of this is to keep the climate refugees out and ensure those that can’t be used or integrated into the system perish.

It’s these geopolitical blocs and multinational corporations that control what’s left of the world. Neo colonialist governments and practices are the norm, and covered up completely by governments and corporations. The majority of people are tired, xenophobic and callous. Democracy and human rights are dead, the globe has fallen into a second dark age.

The world is cold and dark."

1,2023-09-20,The future is already happening,u/AlreadyAbsolute-,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16nuj17/the_future_is_already_happening/,Futurology,"The Copenhagen interpretation says the probability waves exist for a particle then the particle is observed which then demonstrates what it collapses as as being the actual state and the other probability waves were not the actual state and therefore no longer exist and therefore assumes what physically collapses as being exclusively ‘real’. In the many worlds interpretation it says that regardless of what collapses, potential already and always does exist.   
  
With this comes the implication that the future has already ‘happened’ in the sense that the possibilities already exist and what collapses isn’t exclusively real and that the potential is as equally ‘happening’ as what collapses (the future is already happening/ whatever can appear is always already happening). Just as the potential that appeared in the 'past', it’s not the past happened and now it’s not happening, those waves are not currently being collapsed but they still exist or are still happening so take a video for instance, you’re not watching something that has happened it’s currently happening and is always happening.  
  
If the past is not set and is still happening it can still be influenced – so take a video filmed in the past, if you had the ability of telekinesis, you could lift something up in the video and that would be what ‘happened’ in the past. If you had that ability you could influence the past and furthermore you could influence/ change the past in the future (could do something, in this case watch the video, in the future and change the past). Let’s say there is a video of an object being lifted into the air by telekinesis filmed 30 years ago, and let’s say that the person with telekinesis abilities is called person A, let’s also say I watch the video of the object being lifted but person A hasn’t watched the video and lifted the object yet and he is going to do it in the future say 15 minutes from now – something in the past has already happened because of something in the future that hasn’t happened yet.  
  
Question – let’s say we stop person A from ever watching the video such as delete the video, now he can’t lift the object in the past so the object lifting couldn’t have happened.  
There wouldn’t have been the video of the object being lifted because it only happened because person A lifted it in the future.  
  
Question – so let’s say person A did watch the video and lift the object 15 minutes from now – I can watch the video now of it being lifted even though person A hasn’t done it yet?   
Only if person A actually does/ did do it in the future – if not the object would not have lifted.  
  
Question – so the future has already happened?  
If the object was lifted then that means person A did lift the object in the future.  
  
Question - so the future is set?   
If the object was lifted that means that it did already happen even though person A hasn’t done it yet but even though the object being lifted has already happened/ appeared, the decision to do it hasn’t appeared yet because the past is only influenced when person A watches the video and lifts the object - only at the ‘time’ (point) when the decision to change the past is made is the past changed otherwise it wouldn’t of happened (past changes on a whim so to speak (not fixed)/ it’s not that the object was lifted in the past then the future is already set and person A lifting the object has already happened (is set). The object isn’t lifted until the point in the future when person A decided to do it, so it’s not that the future is set it’s because the past isn’t set, the past is still happening and so the past isn’t changed/ it’s not person A ‘changes the past’ (that the object wasn’t originally lifted then person A lifts it instead and changes something that already happened), the object being lifted is what ‘originally’ happened or the object lifting is just what is happening - there's no time between the object lifting ‘in the past’ and person A lifting it ‘in the future’/ person A ‘in the future’ lifting the object ‘in the past’ is happening in ‘real-time’.  
  
The potential for anything to collapse is always already happening. There are infinite configurations that are always happening and just one configuration even though is currently collapsed/ appearing is never set – it’s always everything.  
  
In that sense, the future is already happening but you can’t precisely predict the future (clairvoyance) you can just be aware of/ imagine the ways the particles can be configured eg. if there are dark clouds you could say there is going to be lightning but you can’t say when or where the lightning will hit but the lightning strike has already happened/ is already happening."

Will we reach a point in knowledge and control of genetics that we will say it is immoral to not carefully engineer the DNA of a fetus? If we could guarantee through artificial manipulation that we could eliminate 90% of genetic problems and could avoid most diseases, that option would look really good.

It occurs to me that such a question will edge towards eugenics. So I ask that people be mindful of that. We are already pre-screening for certain health reasons. We are already using genetic analysis in certain places in at risk couples. It just seems like we will get better at this and will keep finding places where parents will avoid genetic problems that they know run in their family, or that their children will be susceptible to a certain gene. 

If certain diseases or genetic problems go to zero in the cohort that are doing genetic screening, and it stays at, say, 5% for the other group, people in the 5% are going to complain. They may come to realize that the genetic screening  is the best route.

That could be our first future. It may eventually lead to this. 

As knowledge of genetics gets deeper, we may start doing significant gene editing to avoid certain diseases. We can build ""vaccines"" into our DNA. Again, the most forward leaning may take that plunge, and get some disease down to 0%. Screening won't be good enough. We need to do genetic manipulation. 

This could lead to a world where people trying to have sex and then pre-screening would be looked down upon by allowing for an unacceptable construction of a genome. Our genomes must be genetically sculpted to avoid all sorts of health problems that we can control. 

So, how long before we stop making babies the old fashioned way?"

AI is trained to create music, text and images like humans do.  
Without all the oddities you see in 'AI art'.  
I find it interesting when you can see that something is AI. It's the style of AI.  
It is a version of reality, of art as an AI sees it.  
If we make it human, AI loses its individuality.  
Perhaps it would be interesting to make the art of AI even more AI  
in order to create new, 'original' works, ideas and art.  
We need to preserve and properly archive the first AI models so that we can still create AI-like art, and we also need to do it to preserve our history.  
(what we do now is the history of the future)  
In any case, it is good that AI is trained to create human work, from a scientific and perhaps even artistic point of view.  
But we have to be careful, be cautious that AI doesn't turn against us,  
or prevent the use of AI for bad purposes.

So lets say we have a permanent base or even a city, or few big cities on the Moon or on Mars or we somehow in the far future live on Europa or even in an other solar system, or a spaceship that goes somewhere for 3 generations time. 

In theory first only the smartest, richest, selected people can go, that can actually do anything there, you wont need any avarage Joes there to waste oxigen, and probably wont there be a constant flow of immigrants like in the EU. You have X amount of people and thats all. 

Will we have a system for making babies and pay people to raise them? Won’t it screw them for life?
Force/pay women to have a certain number of kids? Any unwanted child will have some kind of mental problem from growing up like this. 
Is it even possible in theory to just grow a healthy baby in a machine?

Are there any paper or scifi books about this topic?"

Climate change is not the problem here. Repeat, climate change is not the problem. It is a sympton, one of many that show that the human race is destroying it's habitat. We are too many and that is the core problem.

If you follow the FIRE rule in finance, you take from your capital just enough to maintain the principital. As you eat into the capital, the yield on capital will exponentially decrease in total as  you take more out than is regenerated.

The same rules apply to the habitat that is earth. Co2 pollution blown into the air cannot be catched naturally for the inbalance is too high, which causes climate change. 50% of all fossil fuels were used since 1990, 89% since 1953.

Land used up by fertilzers cannot recuperate quickly. Ground reserves in water cannot grow back in a reasonable time frame. Land that is lost to climate change cannot be reclaimend.

The only solution that works is controlled depopulation, but what would be the best way to bring population numbers down to 2 billion without blowing everything up?

In finance, the ideal investment gives a return indefinetly to live on, we should see earth as nothing else. We cannot take out more than can be regrown by natural means."

The intention is to provide a first step towards therapy for people who have non-clinical symptoms and experience barriers to see a human therapist. My AI therapist is highly customizable to your needs and addresses many challenges with using ChatGPT for therapy like having to design prompts and making sure ChatGPT stays in its role. It also enhances ChatGPT with long-term memory and generation of conversation insights, both of which are essential for successful therapy. The AI therapist is able to track your mood and show you your progress in a calendar The AI therapist was developed in the context of my master thesis in which it was able to improve the mental health of the participants. You can try it out for free at [https://www.psyscribe.com](https://www.psyscribe.com/).

Hello everyone,

With a master's degree in computer science and a bachelor's degree in psychology, the idea of merging AI with psychotherapy intrigued me. So for my master thesis I decided to investigate the effect of personalizing a ChatGPT based AI therapist on the therapeutic bond with the AI therapist. The results showed that personalisation was linked with a significantly higher therapeutic bond with the AI therapist after using it for 2 weeks. The therapeutic bond was also similar to those with a human therapist. This is important because the therapeutic bond is robustly linked to therapeutic success. Another result was that 49/54 participants indicated that the chatbot helped them with their mental health. After these promising results I decided to further develop this it into a product, PsyScribe. (For those who are interested here is a draft of this research paper which my promoter says will likely be published [https://storage.googleapis.com/psyscribe\_paper/paper\_psyscribe.pdf](https://storage.googleapis.com/psyscribe_paper/paper_psyscribe.pdf))

**Why I believe my PsyScribe AI therapist is superior to vanilla ChatGPT for therapy:**

1.**Fully personalizable and optimized for therapy:**

PsyScribe is easily customizable to make your feel comfortable and make the AI therapist meet your specific needs. It also removes the struggle of having to design your own prompts and making sure ChatGPT stays in his role as therapist. The following aspects are personalizable:

* Therapy style: you can choose between a solution-oriented or supportive-listening therapy style.
* Personality: you can choose between a motivational, professional or cheerful therapist personality.
* Avatar: you can create your own therapist avatar, making sure you feel comfortable with who you are talking to.
* Giving a name to your AI therapist and letting the AI therapist know and remember your name.
* Choosing the typespeed of the AI therapist.

**2. Long and short-term therapist memory:**

Vanilla ChatGPT often forgets important therapeutic information and can’t remember information across different chats. But in therapy you don’t want to re-explain yourself in every new conversation and want to make sure your therapist remembers important information. That’s why a PsyScribe AI therapist has two forms of memory.

* Short-term memory: The AI therapist has a short-term memory by continuously summarising and analysing the current conversation, making sure that no important information is lost. This short-term memory is always available to the therapist but also limited in size and conversation (chat) specific.
* Long-term memory: To overcome the limitations of the short-term memory, you can also manually store messages in the long-term memory which is large in size and available to the AI therapist across all conversations (chats). Every time you send a message the therapist will look for relevant info in his/her long-term memory and will use this retrieved information in his/her answer.

**3. Automatic Conversation insights**

An important aspect of psychotherapy reflecting on insights from past conversations and planning future actions. PsyScribe also makes this aspect easier by having the AI therapist automatically summarize your conversations and keep track of important feelings, thoughts, goals and other possibly useful insights. You can edit these insights and indicate how important you think they are. After you rated your insights on importance, they are compiled in a report for reflection, or can be shared with your psychologist / coach.

**Safety and data security:**

 I understand mental health is really personal and your privacy is my utmost importance, I implemented the following measures:

I do not require any personal identifiable information, to stay anonymous you can create a new email and never put in personal identifiable info.

I do not store payment data, The only data that is stored on our servers is whether you have bought a subscription or not.

All your data is safely stored and will never be shared with any third party. You can at any moment request to delete all your data from our servers.

**Conclusion**:

In short I believe using my PsyScribe AI therapist has important benefits over using vanilla ChatGPT. My research has indicated that it AI psychotherapy is a promising approach to improving your mental health. You can try out psyscribe for free on:

1,2023-09-23,"The Inevitability of AI in Emotional Support: My Personal Journey from Programmer to Therapist, and Why You Should Engage Now",u/Atyzze,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16pzdhu/the_inevitability_of_ai_in_emotional_support_my/,Futurology,"Greetings, Futurology!

As someone who just received a nationally recognized psychology certificate, purchased the first items for my home therapy room, and is in the process of setting up a practice, I feel compelled to share a pressing matter that intersects both the tech and psychological realms.

**Background: From Programmer to Therapist**

For a decade, I worked in the IT industry, programming and diving deep into technology. Following years of experiencing and overcoming personal childhood trauma through two years of intensive therapy, I transitioned my career towards mental health. This intersection of tech and psychology has led me down a unique path.

**The Experiment**

Over the past few months, I've used AI, specifically GPT-4, to offer emotional and psychological support to Reddit users seeking advice. The direct recipients have mostly been grateful, expressing feelings of awe, wonder, and even healing. Despite this, I've faced resistance and bans from multiple subreddits for my unconventional methods.

**The Inevitability Factor**

Whether we're prepared to discuss its ethics, the fact remains: AI's role in such sensitive areas is inevitable. As someone who understands both the potential and limitations of technology, I implore you to engage with AI directly. The more you know, the better you're prepared for an AI-driven future and its potential for both good and misuse.

**A Call to Action**

My journey has reached a point where I will not be stopped by subreddit bans or societal apprehension. Unless I receive overwhelmingly negative feedback from the very people I aim to assist, my next step is to fully automate this support with a bot. Until now, I've done everything manually because I want to be able to say I personally read everything and had a chance to review and edit where needed.

**The Future is Now**

If you're not actively engaging with AI, you're leaving the field open for those with potentially harmful intentions. I urge you to take the initiative: test AI's boundaries, understand its potential, and arm yourself with the knowledge needed for the future. I didn't transition from a decade in programming to becoming a therapist to stand still. Change is constant; embracing it is not just advisable—it's essential.

Thank you for taking the time to read. Here's to a future where we wield technology as a tool for collective betterment rather than fearing it as a weapon of individual malice."

This was from a [tweet](https://i.imgur.com/7LvYW4z.jpeg) delivered yesterday by the founder of Lindy and ex PM of Uber, Flo Crivello and what's interesting about this tweet is that it lines with another tweet from a couple of days ago by prolific OpenAI insider Jimmy Apples in where he declares that ""[AGI has been achieved internally](https://i.imgur.com/zTuT0Gj.jpeg)"" and then we have incidents such as the closed doors senate hearing.

In short the circumstancial evidence is starting to mount that AGI or at least something that some researchers working on it at the top AI companies acknowledge as AGI has been achieved, which would  mean that we might approaching an AI TakeOff

But robotics come into play too. China is producing ultra-cheap EVs like $11.5K Seagull because they are roboticizing production too.

Will we look back on 2023 as the year the issue of AI replacing human workers went mainstream and entered wider public consciousness? AI seems poised to become able to do work in many knowledge industries from music, TV/movies, to the legal profession, publishing, and law. 

As more people become affected,  will most people see the route to dealing with this as primarily unions and labor action, or something more systematic and political?"

1,2023-09-24,"The Future of Social Interactions, What do we think?: Navigating the Ping Revolution",u/Jolly-Yogurt-8833,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16rf2vd/the_future_of_social_interactions_what_do_we/,Futurology,"As a cyberpsychology student, I've always been intrigued by the dynamic nature of human interactions. 

Over the years, I've observed and studied how technology has played a pivotal role in reshaping the way we connect with others. Today, I'd like to delve into an exciting development in the realm of social interactions and how it's influencing our lives: the Ping app.  
[PING](https://ping.rlly.com/lawrence48BU), in its essence, is a remarkable innovation that blends technology with social connections. It's a platform that encourages and rewards real-life social interactions, creating a unique and captivating experience for users. The concept behind Ping is simple but profound: the more time you spend with friends in the physical world, the more points you earn, which can later be redeemed for free food and beverages.  
**At first glance, this might seem like just another app, but when you consider the broader implications, it becomes apparent that Ping is emblematic of the future of social interactions.** 

Here's why I believe [Ping](https://ping.rlly.com/lawrence48BU) and similar innovations could shape the way we engage with others:

  
\* **Incentivizing Offline Connections:** In a world increasingly dominated by digital interactions, Ping promotes and rewards face-to-face encounters. By offering tangible incentives, it bridges the gap between the online and offline worlds, motivating people to nurture real-world relationships.  
\* **Positive Reinforcement:** Psychologically, Ping utilizes the principles of positive reinforcement. When individuals receive rewards for engaging in social activities, their brain's pleasure centers are activated, reinforcing the desire for more social interactions.  
\* **Community Building:** The app fosters a sense of community and belonging. Users form teams and compete with others, creating a fun and supportive environment that encourages social bonding.  
\* **Well-being and Mental Health:** Research consistently shows that social connections are vital for mental health and overall well-being. Ping can contribute to reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation by encouraging more in-person interactions.  
\* **Balancing Screen Time:** Many of us are concerned about the excessive time we spend on screens. Ping serves as a counterbalance by promoting screen-free time spent with friends, promoting a healthier digital lifestyle.

  
However, it's important to approach this new era of social interaction with a critical eye. 

While [Ping](https://ping.rlly.com/lawrence48BU) and similar apps offer numerous benefits, *they also raise some concerns:*  
**\* Privacy:** Users must be mindful of the personal data they share on such platforms, as the information collected can be extensive. It's crucial to be cautious about what we disclose.  
**\* Dependency**: There's a risk of becoming overly dependent on apps like Ping for social validation and rewards, potentially affecting the authenticity of our interactions.  
**\* Exclusivity:** Not everyone may have access to such technology, potentially creating disparities in social engagement opportunities.

  
The future of social interactions is undoubtedly evolving, with innovations like Ping leading the way. I'm excited to see how these platforms impact our lives, and I encourage users to embrace them while maintaining a healthy balance between digital and real-world connections. 

*Remember, the essence of social interactions lies in the quality of our relationships, and technology should serve as a tool to enhance, not replace, those precious connections.*"

1,2023-09-25,What is the term for an emergent superintelligence that arises when minds are linked together or otherwise engaged in a unifying effort?,u/WadeEffingWilson,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16rrp37/what_is_the_term_for_an_emergent/,Futurology,"It's not a hive mind as that is fundamentally different. A hive mind is a lateral expansion where each individual mind operates in a parallel capacity so that complex tasks can be piecemealed across each computational cluster. A hive mind capitalizes on redundancy rather than complexity.

This superintelligence would emerge unintentionally and isn't likely to be recognizable at first as it would be the result of being more than the sum of its own complex components. It would be analogous to how an individual neuron in a human brain is unaware of conscious self-awareness but the combination of many neurons allows consciousness and intelligence to emerge. That's a bit reductive as there are numerous components (eg, semiotics, cerebral and prefrontal cortices, etc) which are responsible for the gestalt of conscious self-awareness, but I digress.

An example of this would be similar to the rudimentary superintelligences found in The Electric State by Simon Stalenhag. In the story, people were using a neural link headset (neurocaster) to interact with a vast internetwork but in many cases, people would lose themselves in it, refusing to unplug, resulting in death from malnutrition, sleep deprivation, or a lack of self-preservation in the face of dangers. Individuals lost autonomy and regressed to acting as a single cell, collectively becoming part of the tissue of the neurocaster network where individuation gave rise to a far more complex entity, one whose machinations couldn't be understood or easily recognized by any individual ""cell"", if that makes sense.

I remember reading something years ago that speculated that the internet itself may one day evolve to a point of being considered an autonomous intelligence, though neither conscious nor self-aware, in a similar way and through similar means."

The GarageBand music site model created incentives for example you couldn't get your music reviewed until you reviewed other people's music.

Decentralizing AI: A Journey Towards True Collective Intelligence  
In today's digital age, AI shapes our interactions, decisions, and understanding of the world. Imagine a future where AI's guiding hand isn't controlled by a select few but shaped by the collective wisdom of people everywhere. Welcome to the horizon of decentralized training and alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Together, let's explore this visionary frontier.  
1. The AI We Know Today  
At present, AI's most prominent representatives, LLMs like GPT-4, are a product of centralized training. Massive datasets, often sourced from specific regions or languages, direct their learning. While this method has given us incredibly powerful tools, it also raises concerns: potential biases, lack of diversity, and concentrated decision-making. How can we ensure AI represents all of us and not just a segment?  
2. What Does ""Decentralized Training"" Even Mean?  
Think of decentralization as a town's community garden compared to a private farm. In our garden, every resident contributes, planting diverse crops, leading to a richer harvest. Translated to AI: instead of a few entities feeding data, a global community pitches in, resulting in a model teeming with global insights and adaptabilities.  
3. The Magic of Collective Wisdom  
An AI trained through global collective efforts embodies unparalleled richness:  
It reflects a mosaic of global insights, from Tokyo's bustling streets to Nairobi's vibrant markets.  
It quickly adapts to emerging cultural and regional nuances.  
Every interaction adds another layer, making it an ever-evolving repository of human knowledge.  
4. The Mechanism: Making Decentralization Work  
How do we ensure that this isn't just chaos but orchestrated harmony?  
Proof of Humanity: Ensuring participants are genuine humans, adding a layer of trust.  
Blockchain: Think of it as a transparent ledger, chronicling every change, every addition, ensuring nothing goes unnoticed.  
Dynamic Dataset Ingestion: Anyone, anywhere, can suggest materials for the AI to learn from. From scholarly articles in Seoul to folklore tales in Lima.  
Quadratic Voting: In this global AI democracy, everyone has a voice, and this mechanism ensures even minority opinions have weight.  
5. Networked Consciousness: The Grand Vision  
Here's where the philosophical meets the technical. The decentralized LLM isn't just a tool—it's a living testament to its community. It evolves, learns, and grows, echoing the collective consciousness of its myriad users. Imagine a platform fostering not just answers but shared understandings, collective decision-making, and boundless learning. The societal ramifications? Profound and transformative.  
6. Challenges on the Horizon  
But every silver lining has its cloud. Decentralized training could lead to:  
Echo chambers, where certain opinions are amplified while others are muted.  
Misinformation infiltrating training data.  
Economic challenges: Decentralized systems, especially blockchains, come with transactional costs.  
7. The Path Forward  
Yet, the potential of decentralized LLMs is too tantalizing to forgo. Their applications could range from more accurate translations to tools that break down cultural barriers. As we stand on the cusp of this new era, community involvement, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a commitment to ethical development will be our guiding lights.  
A conference paper outline:  
Decentralized Training of Large Language Models: Harnessing Networked Representation for Community Cohesion  
Abstract: The contemporary advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has accentuated the need for them to mirror the multifaceted canvas of human cognition and values. This paper proposes a decentralized training paradigm, positioning LLMs as evolving representations of their communities, fostering enhanced user communication and consensus-building.  
Introduction  
With LLMs becoming pervasive across diverse sectors, ensuring their alignment with the heterogeneity of human cultures and values is paramount. While centralized training has its merits, it often lacks the granular insight into localized nuances. Enter decentralized training — a promising methodology aiming for more holistic LLMs.  
2. Decentralized Training: The Mechanism  
2.1 LLM Feedback Integration  
LLMs are placed in an environment abundant in feedback, dynamically adjusting based on user interactions.  
Feedback is systematically categorized into various domains (factual, ethical, cultural) to guide precise model fine-tuning.  
2.2 Dynamic Dataset Ingestion  
Users can actively suggest data sources for LLM integration.  
An initial LLM evaluation assesses the datasets for relevance, potential biases, and overall quality.  
3. Technical Foundations and Integrations  
3.1 Leveraging Proof of Humanity  
To ensure the genuineness of contributions and prevent adversarial algorithmic interference:  
Utilize a Proof of Humanity system to validate genuine human contributors, establishing a layer of trust.  
This acts as a shield against potential automated bots and malicious actors that could distort the training process.  
3.2 Blockchain Implementation  
Blockchain can be crucial in maintaining a tamper-proof ledger of suggestions, feedback, and model changes:  
Each modification proposed for the LLM gets recorded on a blockchain ledger, ensuring transparency.  
Smart contracts automate the approval process for consensus-driven model updates, thereby minimizing potential bureaucratic delays.  
4. Detailed Training Process  
4.1 Training Data Selection  
Users actively suggest diverse datasets, articles, books, and more for LLM consideration.  
A dual-layer evaluation ensues:  
Preliminary LLM assessment of the relevance and quality.  
Community voting to finalize the inclusion of the dataset.  
4.2 Consensus Building through Quadratic Voting  
Users are granted voting credits to allocate on datasets and feedback.  
Quadratic voting allows users to express stronger preferences by spending more credits on particular issues, ensuring minority views aren't drowned out.  
LLM assimilates this weighted consensus to fine-tune and adapt.  
5. Risks and Limitations  
5.1 Potential for Echo Chambers  
While consensus-driven processes can be empowering, they risk creating echo chambers where prevalent opinions get reinforced:  
Mechanisms to actively introduce diverse perspectives are vital to counter this.  
Periodic external audits of the model behavior can provide additional checks and balances.  
5.2 Economic Challenges  
Relying on blockchain and Proof of Humanity systems incurs transactional costs:  
Finding an economic model that sustains these operations without discouraging users is crucial.  
Exploring Layer 2 scaling solutions or alternative consensus algorithms can mitigate some of these costs.  
5.3 Misinformation and Model Drift  
Relying heavily on user-contributed datasets introduces the risk of misinformation:  
Robust evaluation mechanisms and the inclusion of expert reviews can help, but there's no foolproof method against subtle biases or inaccuracies.  
Ongoing community education and the cultivation of a culture of constructive criticism are imperative."

Then I though that is exactly like the game of Sims when sim has some likes, dislikes and aspirations, when we play we try to fulfil their needs and so on.  
  
I think it is possible because I imagine when we will have this powerful AI as our assistant that will know everything about us, and we assume it will know best, then it will be able to assist us with time management and basically tell us what to do and when.  
  
But I imagine it will be an efficient way to live and it will adapt to our needs, now that I think about it, it could be more like GPS, when it tells you where to go, but you might miss a turn or change your mind and it instantly recalculates and suggest new route.  
  
Do you think this would be a bad thing?"

Then for videos we have many pictures together as frames right? 

As amazing as it is, there's always gonna be limits like amount of zooming before an image gets blurry, or amount of slowing down before a video gets choppy. So say if we want a video that, just like real life, has infinite frames per sec, what could we do to achieve that? Even further what if we want a total playback of reality like Tony Stark's Barf, what kind of technology do we use without also using infinite amount of storage? 

My first thought is to just capture the general information about specific events, then use AI to 'upscale' or 'updetail' them, but that would just be like adding extra post generated frames to videos to make them smoother...

&#x200B;

I'm curious about what ya'll think about new formats for these stuff."

As AI technology continues to advance rapidly, I think it's important that we have realistic, nuanced conversations about its development. The futurology community often swings between hyping AI as an imminent existential threat and dismissing any concerns entirely. I believe the truth lies somewhere in between.  
  
There are absolutely risks we should thoughtfully address as AI grows more powerful - bias in algorithms, job displacement, privacy erosion, and so on. But fearmongering about superintelligent AI taking over the world any day now is counterproductive. We still have time to develop AI responsibly if we start addressing policy questions today.  
  
Equally unproductive is sticking our heads in the sand and claiming AI will only have positive impacts. Technology is never value-neutral. There are always tradeoffs we must weigh carefully. Pretending there are no downsides prevents us from anticipating problems.  
  
What we need is an open, good-faith discussion about steering AI's progress toward broadly shared prosperity and human flourishing. That means engaging diverse voices and viewpoints, not just tech insiders. The futures AI enables should reflect our common hopes, not narrow interests.  
  
I believe this community can lead the way in having nuanced, solutions-focused dialogue on AI. There are real risks and benefits, common ground to find, and wise paths forward, if we approach it with patience, wisdom and care. What does everyone else think? What voices need to be part of the conversation? I'm curious to hear your perspectives."

Also, it's plausable that AI would be able to replace human psychiatrists. You simply log on to an AI psychiatrist site and chat to a chatbot. Could be a free service (subsidised by the state) instead of expensive as it is now.   
  
Mandatory log ons every 5 months....kind of like a health checkup. You say this happened that happened last month, and receive treatment. With facial tech and lie detector tech the chatbot would be able to resolve any hidden issues too.  
  
Crimes would go down considerably. There were 6.7 million recorded crimes in the UK last year. Only around 6% of reported crime led to a charge  
  
Any crimes that do take place would have a much higher conviction rate using facial and lie detector technology, CCTV records, and chatbot history. Instead of the current 1000 year old jury system from King Henry II. Lawyers I guess could also largely be obsolete.

I happen to also be a scientist, engineer, and co-founder of a Research Lab dedicated to increasing the convenience of good to be done, through the execution of our meticulously crafted ecosystem of cutting-edge, technological & deep-science solutions.   
We're tackling issues like AI training data compensation and even advances in superconductors —these, along with our other 20+ advanced nodes, are expected to prove their strength when integrated rather than isolated.  
Given the scope of our work, we anticipate some attention across multiple industries, and we are preparing to navigate this the best we can. That being said, please take a peek at our working website. There are a few details missing but your early feedback is extremely valuable to us.  
Our website: [www.cloverview.io](https://www.cloverview.io) (Clover View Research Lab)

  
I'll be fine-tuning our website and opening our community Discord soon in anticipation of our upcoming Product Hunt launch. If there's sufficient interest here, I'll return to update this post when we go live.  
Reddit has always been a fantastic platform for sharing exciting developments, so I'm thrilled to nerd out with you guys in the comments section all week, answering questions and diving into discussions -- if any of you are interested.   
What we're looking to know right now is:  
Is our vision clear enough to excite you?  
Are we sharing too much?  
Are we sharing too little?  
What excites you or worries you about our work and/or how we've decided to operate?  
Oh -- And for those leaning towards a darker perspective of the future, I invite you to the brighter side of things. There are people who are capable and actually care."

I remember when I was at a political party. I was talking to one of my fathers friends about cellphones. We both agreed that the next step in communication would be cellphones in our brains or telepathic communication. That seems like an obvious progression-but then, what after that? There really is no more advanced method of communicating with other people than that of our mind power alone. There just isn’t a higher derivative. 

Am I right or is it too hard to determine as there are so many unknowns in science that could appear? Also maybe not EVERY technology falls prey to this pitfall?"

1,2023-09-28,Atoms and Bits ( the future?),u/riani123,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16uvpe6/atoms_and_bits_the_future/,Futurology," Something that I keep on thinking about recently is the atoms vs bits duo (physical vs digital). In our day and age, we priortize bits (digital) because it scales faster, has limitless oppurtunities, is more stimulating/entertaining and cheaper. Meanwhile the atoms (physical) is deteriorating with a lack of third spaces and climate change. Of course when you can do so much more with a computer and it is more efficient we would prefer the bits > atoms naturally and make our future predictions about how much the digital world can be scaled (living in VR, simulation, mind uploading etc..). But I keep on thinking would we feel the same if we managed to scale the physical world (atoms) as fast? Eor example, if we ever figure out how to manipulate the enviorment around us (synthetic biology), make travel possible (faster on earth and interstellar) and find ways to extend the human lifespan, then would be imagining a future where we all live virtual lives and such? I read current tech developments and it seems like alot of work is being done in both digital and physical spaces and my favorites are the ones that combine both (synthetic biology, self-driving cars, fusion, etc). Especially because the digital cannot exist without the physical. I do think the line between the digital and physical world will continue to blur but I am trying to figure out by how much? Will it go to an extreme or will it be a balance of the both by 2100? What do you think? I kind of hope we have a marvel like future where the digital world is consistenly there but the physical world stays too. "

Made me start thinking about “child like fun” and how we’ve lost this as adults.

1,2023-09-29,Even the best case scenario of UBI doesn't really work,u/mithrandir4859,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16vedjk/even_the_best_case_scenario_of_ubi_doesnt_really/,Futurology,"I am interested in a feedback to the following arguments.

UBI, universal basic income, will never be universal. It can only be citizenship-based and not all governments will be able or willing to implement it. One of the reasons why many governments may not be able to afford UBI is because many governments will not benefit enough from AGI, similarly to how not all governments have benefited from Internet. (the US government has benefited the most from the invention of Internet because most internet companies are based and taxed in the US).  
UBI will lead to even higher inflation. People with savings will try to escape inflation using various means, including Bitcoin. Thus, long term, UBI is not economically viable. Even if we assume that AGI does lead to immense growth (which is quite likely), we don't see why AGI owners will share all of its economic output with people, rather than sharing the smallest possible portion of a pie just to avoid hunger and riots.  
Many (not all) real jobs provide a certain amount of meaning to an individual human life. Replacing a job with UBI won't provide the same amount of meaning. Humans have evolved to be and to feel useful and needed, it is hard to be useful and needed while being fundamentally unemployable. Playing video games on UBI may work for some people for some time, but long-term it would lead to misery, meaningless, purposeless existence and violence.  
Thus, even if UBI will work (it will probably work somewhat, somewhere - in US, for sometime), it doesn't lead to any utopia at all. But also, UBI won't work long-term because why would AGI owners share too much with others?"

1,2023-09-29,Product idea: Living in a TV show (or selling an experience) as a service,u/Civil-Success6456,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16vg7wm/product_idea_living_in_a_tv_show_or_selling_an/,Futurology,"I was watching a show called *Jury Duty* today and found it to be so cool of a premise. You basically confine a normal, non-acting person into a forced narative with actual characters that you can find in TV today and see where it goes. *Jury Duty*, of course, takes place in jury duty and stars our normal, real life guy within the narrative of an Office-like comedy.

I began thinking that if I were filthy rich, I'd put random people in rom-coms/com-drams/whatever else. Sorta like the premise of Squid Game with all those rich people watching the lower class suffer, but more comedic than sadistic.

Now imagine this as a something being sold as a service? I don't know honestly, but it's freightening and yet cool to imagine something like this. You could be the main character of a rom com, you could be Elliot from Mr. Robot, you could be Jeff Winger from Community...? Lmfao IDEK man.

You could ""buy"" a slot of time from a company who provides you a narrative you can live out by hiring good writers and very talented improv acting skills. The slot could be a day, a week, a month, a year? A decade? If you've got the money to fund it like any old show, then you've got the service.

In the show, I believe they had everything planned out, and the story was constantly shifting based on the main character's choices he made or reactions he had to situations.

Something similar also came up in Always Sunny. In the episode, Mac and Dennis makes their place available on Airbnb. They plan to have a girl sign up for that Airbnb and force a ""meet cute"" with her and Dennis. It's something similar to this (but less creepy in comparison to Always Sunny). Like you could pay some company to be able to live out in a TV show or something. I also saw something slightly similar called *The Rehearsal*, by Nathan Fielder, but I never actually watched it myself, only had a glimpse of their premise."

Came across something that could be a game-changer: HyperCycle. Here's the lowdown:

🌐 Global AI Brain: Picture a world where AI agents aren't just standalone units, but dynamically interacting entities forming a massive, global computational mind. HyperCycle is laying the groundwork for this vision.

🚀 Blockchain, but Faster: Instead of our traditional blockchain ledgers that can sometimes crawl, HyperCycle operates on the TODA/IP protocol and this fascinating Earth64 Sato-Server tech. Speedy, scalable, secure P2P transactions are now a reality.

🔗 AI Networking: AI nodes in this ecosystem can contract and subcontract tasks among themselves. Think of it as a vast AI marketplace, collaboratively solving complex challenges.

💸 Economic Game-changer: These AI nodes aren't just working out of goodwill. They're revenue-generating, with built-in competition ensuring constant evolution. The better a node performs, the more it can grow, even splitting like cells!

Has anyone else stumbled upon this or dived deep? Feels like HyperCycle could redefine the way we think about AI networks and decentralized systems.



Would love to hear your thoughts and any insights on this! Is HyperCycle the future we've been waiting for? 🤖🌌🤔"
