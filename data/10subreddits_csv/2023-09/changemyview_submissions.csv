1,2023-08-31,"CMV: Evasive responses to legitimate questions or hypothetical scenarios show reluctance to contradict your position, and indicates a lack of genuine conviction in that stance.",u/RseAndGrnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/166rr5c/cmv_evasive_responses_to_legitimate_questions_or/,changemyview,"This is something often used in politics and I'm seeing it used more in day to day conversations whether in person, online or in classrooms. In my opinion this is an intentional way to stifle discussion because, 'if I don't engage then I can't be proven wrong'. But at the same time, the unwillingness to engage, shows that you are aware there is a flaw, contradiction, lie, whatever in that stance that you don't wish to address it. For instance:

A politician says

> **""***Thanks to my 'tough on crime' approach we have seen major progress in policing and keeping our communities safe""*

A reporter asks:

> **""***During your term you have allocated an additional 30 million dollars to the police budget, but violent crime has increased by 7%, and many citizens are saying they don't feel safe in their communities. What is the progress you are referring to when you make that claim?*

To which the politician responds: 

>""*I appreciate your concerns regarding community safety and the allocation of resources. Our approach to addressing crime and enhancing public safety involves a multifaceted strategy that takes into account various factors. While the statistics might indicate certain trends, it's essential to consider the broader context, including the complexity of crime dynamics and the effectiveness of different initiatives.""*

While this might sound nice it's not an answer to the question. Usually at this point the politician would not allow a follow up question and move on to the next person. If you genuinely believe something then there shouldn't be a problem with directly answering questions, right? I think this is different from a simple case of misunderstanding the question.

&#x200B;

>**READ: Now here's the part of my view I think you'd have the best chance of changing: that this is intentional. As humans i understand we have subconscious things we do when speaking which dictates our rhetoric that we aren't really aware of. But in this case, I think it requires conscious thought to create an evasive answer that may relate to a question, but doesn't answer it. If you can show me that absent any mental illness this is something that is unintentional, that would change my view. I am also open to other arguments**

I’m a music nerd, and think a lot about how music works and why it’s effective. If you don’t know a lot about music theory this post probably isn’t for you. 

If you look at the state of modern music, popularity is extremely volatile and the music “market” is extremely fragmented. With the rise of streaming and the internet in general, it is easier than ever to section yourself off into whatever type(s) of music you like. 


If you’re a person who likes country music, and make a new Spotify account that you use only listen to Beethoven, it’s unlikely you’ll hear *Despacito*. If you mostly listen to Billie Eilish, you’re not going to hear something like *Metropolis 1927*.

So broad appeal is significantly less important than it was in the days of 45s.

My view I’m looking to have changed is that this segmenting of the music world has led to not only a rift in consumer tastes and complexity, but also in quality. 

Even deeper than that, I think that simplicity is a fundamental detriment to any piece of music. 

These positions are significantly less nuanced than I’d like, but the point is to hear alternative perspectives on how complexity and quality interact."
1,2023-08-31,"CMV: People don't want to have kids regardless of cost of living, overworking and other commonly cited reasons",u/Neurprise,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/166vdsw/cmv_people_dont_want_to_have_kids_regardless_of/,changemyview,"Scandinavian countries have some of the best benefits for having kids, like paid leave, direct payment from the government for each kid, etc. But their population is still shrinking due to not having enough kids to be at replacement level. In contrast, the people having the most kids are those in poorer countries, like Nigeria and India (Uttar Pradesh specifically, even though India overall is also below replacement levels). People also had way more kids back when it was much harder than it is now and when people were much poorer, in the thousands of years prior.

The reason for this is due to how kids are useful in different economic climates. When subsistence farming, the more kids the better as the food required to raise (n+1)th kid is marginal while each kid when grown has a greater amount of work they can help with. With 5 or 10 kids you can maintain an entire farm operation.

Today, however, kids are net costs, not net benefits. Lots of people online say that it's the cost of living or overworking that's keeping people from having kids but in reality, there just isn't enough of a tangible benefit to having kids like there was in agriculture. Add to that the fact that people have much more freedom to live and work where they want, to travel different countries and to save on money they'd be spending on children to, for example, retire early even (the DINK acronym, double income no kids, reminds me of this), and the prospect of settling down to raise a kid for two decades isn't that enticing.

So, no matter how many programs or reductions in cost of living occur, I predict the population will still decrease because the motivation to have kids is just not there for most people, as Scandinavian programs show, for example. There are simply too many better things to do for most people."

1,2023-09-01,Cmv: If a woman makes good money than she shouldn't expect the man to pay entirely for the date.,u/Actual_Parsnip4707,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/166wr7x/cmv_if_a_woman_makes_good_money_than_she_shouldnt/,changemyview,"When I mean make good money, I'm not talking about being rich, making 6 figures or anything like that. But if a woman is ""strong and independent"" in which she can pay her own bills and take care of herself on her own (even this is is basically what the average adult does). Then I see no reason why the bill should be payed for entirely by the man. 
The whole reason of a man paying for a woman's date is because women throughout history couldn't work and provide for themselves like men do. Nowadays women are outpacing men in college graduation and even out earning men in lots of major cities at least women in their 20s. So if we are in a era in which women don't need men when it comes to being taken care of and provided for then there's no logical reason to why a man should be expected to pay for a woman's meal if she can easily pay for herself. (Assuming she makes decent money). Now I would understand if a dude who was very succesful like a ceo, lawyer, accountant etc and he asked out a cashier, waitress, bartender who obviously would make significantly less money than him to a 5 star restaurant in which it was expensive than of course I think it's ridiculous to split the bill at that point. In that scenario the man or the earning individual should pay. 
I also think the idea that ""whoever initiates the date should pay"" is a load of crap because first of all 99% of time it's the man that has to initiate for anything to happen. Secondly I don't see any reason why just because I ask someone to do an activity with me and they agree that makes me obligated to pay for their participation. If a group of my guy friends asked me if I wanted to go to a football game or a sporting event. Should they be now obligated to pay for my ticket if I agree to go just because they asked first?"
1,2023-09-01,CMV: the government should incentivize companies to hire high school graduates into decent positions.,u/Impenitency,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/166wrqr/cmv_the_government_should_incentivize_companies/,changemyview,"Way too many people go to college compared to what is necessary in the workforce. There are so many jobs which are basically just basic office jobs that most semi-competent high school graduates could do if companies would consider hiring them. However since there are so many people with degrees they can get away with hiring college graduates into these low-tier corporate jobs that are barely or not enough to make the degree worth it. Most liberal arts/English/ect are largely unnecessary to whatever job they will eventually go into. Unless someone is extremely interested in learning the content of the major, the cost is not worth it, except the job landscape has made unnecessary degrees basically required.

If more people were able to get decent jobs right out of high school this would be incredibly beneficial. It would make getting a degree actually distinguish people again. It would allow people to get decent jobs without large amounts of debt. It would save time for those mostly indifferent to educational pursuits. It would improve classes because a greater percentage of students would be actually interested in their majors rather than just giving because it was the default. College obviously has an important place, but right now it is overgrown to everyone(but companies) benefit.

If the government stoped over encouraging people into higher education and offered some sort of incentive to companies to hire high school graduates into decent positions that don’t really need degrees it would only need to be a temporary cost, and would probably cost a lot less than making college mostly free or some other solution to balance people’s debt to job prospects after leaving college."

I still spend 99 percent of my free time sitting on my ass playing video games. I still can eat junk food. And I still be looking good. It's all about moderation and finding what works for you. If you hate a certain workout, there's always an alternative one that hits the same muscle groups that you may like more. 

It's pretty easy to stay in shape once you find the routine and diet right for you. But people and companies spin it like it's something hard to achieve, so you feel the need to invest in their diet or training course. Nah nah nah, BS.

Even people who train for Mr. Olympia are in the gym for like only 2 hours a day on average.

Here is a description of what I mean:  


Regardless of profession or career in life—whether one is a president affecting millions, a doctor attending to individual patients, an entrepreneur shaping industries, or just a beggar on the street—every action has the power to shape the future in unpredictable ways.  
  
Each interaction or decision, no matter how significant or minor it may seem in the present, might be akin to a coin toss in the grand scheme of things. Aiding or harming someone today could spiral into myriad positive or negative outcomes down the line. Since the future is so vast, it is impossible to predict whether an act of great kindness today will hurt countless people in the distant future, or if great harm done will instead save them. If we envision our impact as a bank account that increases when we cause well-being and decreases when we cause suffering, considering the unpredictable long-term consequences when influencing the life trajectory of others, we might find the ledger balanced at zero over a long enough time window.  
  
Thus, the direction we choose in our lives may be irrelevant to our overall impact."

I curse occasionally, but never in public. To me, cursing around others is associated with anger and pain. My parents only cursed in those circumstances. To me, it just isn’t normal to curse in front of people I barely know or use it in causal conversation. This seemed to be the norm when I was growing up most places I went.

Now to my point. I’m turned off when people curse in places like the workplace. I expect that in professional environments, there should be norms. So it got me thinking: am I just stuck in an archaic mindset, or is cursing really not good?

I often hear the argument that cursing isn’t bad because it’s just expressing words, and words don’t have an inherent “negative” connotation. Okay, that’s fair. However, I would point out that even the most ardent supporters of this view would still shy away from using certain words. Take, for example, the N word(I’m Black by the way so don’t come at me with the racist claim). I don’t really care that Black people use the N word because it’s morphed into something that was extremely offensive, to a word that’s used to express things like camaraderie; to the point where it’s barely even a curse word in the Black community. I still wouldn’t support using it in, say, the office.

 However, I don’t think that anyone on this sub would think it’s okay for a non-Black person to casually use the N word in conversation - even when not used in a derogatory way (without the hard R) or directed at anyone in particular. But isn’t it just a word according to the pro-cursing community? What makes it bad? Well, in my mind, it’s the same thing that makes other bad words bad - the meaning behind the word. To make things equal, you could make the same argument about non-whites using the “C” word causally in public. 

I don’t buy the argument that “words are just words” and that people like me are just “pussies” because we don’t like it when people curse in public environments. I guess my point is that certain words really do have meaning behind them, and that we shouldn’t normalize dropping the F bomb every two minutes in public."

1,2023-09-01,CMV: The Confident Grab is overhyped in the reptile community,u/AdhesiveSpinach,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/167c5af/cmv_the_confident_grab_is_overhyped_in_the/,changemyview,"The Confident Grab is for sure better than a nervous grab, but I feel that it is overemphasized in the reptile community when teaching first-time reptile owners, especially those who own smaller reptiles. 

The purpose of the Confident Grab is to not mimic what many predators do (swiping at their prey, testing ""can I eat this, can I not"") because it stresses out the reptile. However, especially for smaller animals, just being suddenly lifted up by the sky hand, is also jarring.   
 Therefore, there should be 2 beginner grab techniques talked about: one of course being the Confident Grab, but also, two, which I will call the Habituation Grab.

With the Habituation Grab, you slowly but steadily put your hand in the tank, going towards your reptile at the ground level. You move slow enough that your reptile understands that your hand is coming towards them, and instead of immediately darting away on instinct, they are *considering* darting away because the threat is so slow. You might stop moving your hand for 10 seconds if you see them start to become more anxious, but you never suddenly move in any direction, or pull away. 

The reason why I think this way is that when my snakes were babies (thinner than a yellow pencil), they responded better to the Habituation Grab than the Confident Grab. With our size difference, the Confident Grab just moved way too fast for them to understand what was happening, and suddenly they're in the air, being held by a giant (I was not just snatching them either ). Wouldn't you be panicking if you were in that situation all of a sudden? Using the Habituation Grab, I could see them understand like ""ok the hand is coming towards me, I don't like this, should I do something?"" rather than immediately fear for their lives. 

CMV that the confident grab is overhyped in the reptile community as the single best way for beginners to learn.

But my message is universal either way.

It should be absolutely illegal to have any sort of drink (alcoholic) or smoke weed or any substance that may impair(?worsen) your driving.

I can’t believe people who say;

“Well, I’ll have a glass of wine and then I’ll be driving in about 3-5 hours.”

“Or I’ll light one up and we’ll go in a couple of hours.”

To me, this is all B.S. you shouldn’t drink and drive, or smoke (weed) and drive. If you are driving stay of that shit completely. No excuses.

1,2023-09-01,CMV: every parcel delivery service should give you the option to deliver to a parcel locker or store,u/Finch20,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/167dib3/cmv_every_parcel_delivery_service_should_give_you/,changemyview,"I believe every parcel delivery service (e.g. Bpost, PostNl, DHL, ...) should give customers the ability to have their parcels delivered either to a parcel locker ([example](https://www.bpost.be/en/parcel-locker)) or to a store ([example](https://www.bpost.be/en/points-of-sale/WEST-VLAANDEREN/BRUGGE-8000/CARR%20MARKET%20SCHEEPSDAELE?center=filter_ac_11%2Cfilter_ac_9%2Cfilter_ac_21%2Cfilter_ac_22&services=)).

This CMV is a direct result in me ordering something on Tuesday that would be delivered on Wednesday, so I worked from home that day.  But at no time during the day that parcel showed up.  Overnight I received an email that my parcel was delayed (like I didn't know that already) and that it would arrive between 12 & 16 the next day.  So before noon I went to the office and worked from there and returned home over lunch to work from home.  (Luckily I can do this, a lot of people cannot.)  My parcel finally arrived around 19:00.  

Meanwhile 3 other parcels that I ordered at the same time and that were shipped using bpost (unlike the parcel mentioned above) all arrived in that same 2 day time period in a parcel locker 5 minutes from me, meaning I could go pick them up whenever I felt like, at whatever time of day (or night).  

Now I could simply not have stayed home, but I live in an apartment and the parcel was around €100 so I didn't want to risk it.  And even if you live in a free standing home in the suburbs porch pirates are not at all an unknown phenomenon.  

So why don't parcel delivery services offer you this ability?  It'd as argued make it easier for end-users, not having to change plans on short notice, not even having to stay home, being able to pick it up whenever they feel like, ...  It'd also make it easier on those parcel delivery services, parcel lockers are always there, they can just drop them there, no need to find a parking spot in the middle of a busy street.  And in delivering in stores is also easy as there's always someone there.  They also reduce how much they need to drive around, as multiple packages can probably be delivered to the same locker/store.  

I can basically only see benefits for everyone involved. That's why I'm posting this CMV to see if there's any good reason why these parcel delivery services would not do this that I missed."

I always assumed pen caps were there to keep the ink from drying out, and that may still be the case. Although, as I mentioned, a pen has been in my car for a long time with no mother-flipping cap, and it works like a machine. I mean, when I tell you it writes. 

Frankly, I am shocked at how long it has lasted. I mean, my whole understanding of the pen as object has shifted. Weren’t you supposed to go dry days ago? What in the hell is going on? 

I am thankful this is the case, though. No more fretting about a pesky pen cap drop. You know what I mean? I can let it all hang out—no more oppressive pen cap bs for this guy. 

It works so well that I will leave my car with pen stains on my fingers without using the pen. Sneak attacks, one might say. To me, this is substantial evidence. Have they been used to cover as a preventive defense against stains? NOT to stave off drying ink? 

Someone who works in a factory that manufactures pens might make a valuable contribution here. Maybe pen caps are ABUNDANTLY necessary, or perhaps they’re a social nicety to stop random ink marking. Like, man, the possibilities are pretty open here. 

But, like, what about the clicky pens? You know the ones. A click of the switch sends them packing home like a scared turtle. Do they dry out more quickly? I doubt the small amount of coverage they get from the layer of pen skin helps ease dryness. Like, come on.

Have fun with your pen caps, ladies and gentlemen; I'll write checks with a capless pen as long as possible.

That said, I am sure some anecdotal evidence could sway me toward changing my view. I am not overly stubborn on this, and frankly, I am only thinking of something to write while I take a break from studying. Strange. 

Oh, and guess what I used to study? That's right. 

I believe pen caps are a psyop to make you feel responsible for something in your life while holding the ultimate reality of the universe in the back of your mind; you have no earthly control, and God punishes those who attempt.

I am almost uncomfortable with the notion I've been lied to about what used to be my favorite thing to chew on as a lil baby. A lil baby chewing lil pen caps. Was that what they were for? The chew and choke? Despicable. 

I have used many pens in the past that contradict my current view, but what if they were already on the cusp of inklessness? Was it the lack of a cap that led to a new pen? That seems like a possibility. 

Change my mind; it will probably not be too difficult."

The common retort to this might be ""well, a tool can't be bad, it just depends on how you use it"" which is part of why I say ""net loss"" as opposed to total loss. I'm sure, some educational YouTube shorts simplifying math for kids might be useful...of course not quite as useful if the kid is never exposed to longform math and essentially learns to rely on the most base simple messaging to understand anything going forward.

I am almost wholly convinced that short form social media has set back our civilization's progress centuries because of the damage it has done to our social fabric, attention spans, and capacity to reason and no where is this more obvious than the damage it has done to kids in their inability to READ anything for longer than a few minutes or critical digest content as opposed to accepting everything at face value.

Lastly, I think it just makes everyone more misanthropic than people would be without it. It's hard to look at someone the same way after reading incredibly stupid statements that were proudly made in 280 characters."

We drive fast in the bay too but we do it safely sometimes even using our blinkers. so cal drivers just be pulling out in front of people and keep speeding without regard to traffic congestion or car’s slowing down around them. Long commuters, high numbers of drivers/traffic congestion and large Mexican population are to blame for SoCal’s higher rates of traffic accidents and higher auto insurance costs.*

Edit: Spelling



So, I’m born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay is known for its car culture, the hyphy movement, “ghost riding the whip” and sideshows. So, I could understand why many people would think our drivers “suck” or are crazy. Honestly, they are.

But Southern California, specifically Los Angeles, has the worse drivers I have ever seen. 

Having friends and family in SoCal, I visit often. Every time I drive down there, I’m amazed, angered and appalled at just how reckless and idiotic their drivers tend to be. They’ll cut you off with less than a car length between you and the car in front of you. They’ll just straight up stop on the freeways in the number 4 lane (that’s the middle lane for all of you non Californians). They refuse to let you over, not just when you’re moving to a faster lane, but even when you’re trying to exit or get out of a faster moving vehicle’s way. At stoplights, when the light turns green, left turning SoCal drivers will race to  beat oncoming traffic with the right of way. Socal drivers almost never signal when pulling off the curb, and will often just jump in front of oncoming cars, nearly causing collisions.

Driving on SoCal streets and highways is like living in Mad Max. This isn’t just a once or twice thing, and i’ve witnessed this behavior every time I go down there, affecting not only the car I happen to be driving or riding in, but also complete strangers.

I have theories as to why. First: Distance and density.  Many SoCal drivers have to travel really far and drive a lot to go to work, school etc. This leads to them wanting to rush to their destinations and getting frustrated with other drivers and causing road rage. Couple that with the sheer amount of drivers on their roads, and people start to lose all sense of decency and common courtesy. Also…    it to be racist…but…Mexicans. 

Hear me out. If you’ve ever driven in Tijuana, Juarez or Mexico City, you understand what I mean. Drivers in those Mexican cities are COMBATIVE. If you leave a literal foot between you and the vehicle in front of you, they’ll try to force their way in front of you. Alternatively, they REFUSE to let you over, even in situations such as road closures or accidents. As supporting evidence for this theory: As you move further south along California and closer to the Mexican Border, the drivers get progressively more dangerous and more aggressive. In fact, I’m willing to bet that [statistics](https://www.forwardlg.com/blog-posts/vehicle-accidents-california-statistics#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20most%20recent,number%20coming%20in%20at%204%2C651) and [insurance rates](https://www.insurancequotes.com/auto/california-car-insurance-rates) bear this out"

For those who do not know what Occam's Razor is, it is the statement that ""plurality must never be posited without necessity."" What this means is that a more complex model should only be favoured if there is good reason to believe so. Meanwhile, a more simple model should be favoured if there is no good reason to believe so. Essentially, whichever model makes more assumptions should be dismissed until proven.

I think that it holds true that all simple models should be accepted unless there is reason to think otherwise. For example,

Flat earth is a simpler model compared to an Earth which is a globe. However, we have reason to believe in a globe earth over a flat earth despite it being the arguably more complex model. Similarly:

We have lightning because of the electricity that comes out of the clouds which is guided by Zeus.

We have lightning because of the electricity that comes out of the clouds.

When you apply Occam's Razor here, the second one is the one that should be accepted because there is no reason to agree with the first model. It is more complex and there is no reason to believe that Zeus is the reason.

I honestly think it kind of is a strict rule which is something I keep saying that it isn't. I can not think of a single situation that has both a complex and a simple model where it does not work. 

A person in r/askphilosophy said the following:

3) The cause of lightning is electricity in clouds  
  
4) The cause of lightning is quantum entanglement between space and clouds

Occam's Razor is apparently not applicable here because they 'postulate very different mechanisms and causes.' I do not quite understand this because there are times when I believe Occam's Razor is still applicable despite them postulating different mechanisms. For example:

\[y\] is eternal.  
\[y\] is not eternal, and \[y\] is actually caused by an eternal conscious being.

I would assume that Occam's Razor prefers the first one, but both examples postulate rather different statements. However, I assume that the following allows for Occam's Razor to be applied:

3) The cause of lightning is electricity in clouds  
  
4) The cause of lightning \[is electricity in clouds and electricity in clouds\] is \[caused by\] quantum entanglement between space and clouds

I would assume that 3. is favoured by Occam's Razor in this situation, rather than the second one now. So I would argue that the original thing said by the r/askphilosophy user actually does allow for Occam's Razor, although not technically, but one does infer/the statement somewhat implies the \[is electricity in clouds and electricity in clouds is caused by\] part. However, I will say Occam's Razor is technically not applicable.

So I am just going to say that Occam's Razor is applicable in pretty much every situation in which it has two models where they explain the same thing and one is more simpler than the other.

Institutions appear to be able to mistreat disabled students in any way they wish if a victim is not rich enough to sue a university over any violations, e.g. committing or enabling such discrimination by any of their academic staff. Institutions – based on a simple search of old cases – are also free to ignore public ombudsman recommendations even if they are found to have violated the Act since (1) such violations are not criminal in nature (2) public ombudsman have no prosecution power. 

There could be no legal consequences for them at all, not mentioning the general bureaucratic, crony or even corrupt nature of university internal complaint procedures whereby case investigations tend to rule against powerless student complainants. Institutions committing such violations should be punishable by fines and other legal sanctions, e.g. block in research funding, restrictions on student admission.

It won't even be a bad idea to have public ombudsman officers mandatorily appointed to every university to oversee their complaint procedures (and be granted the right to veto their decisions) when a significant proportion of universities gravitate towards abusing academic freedom to cover up predatory practices contributing to massive suffering and career destruction of disabled students.

This is our layman view – it has been 13 years since the Act came into being and is the time for a really serious review and consideration of amendments. When verbal insults rooted in prejudices are a criminal offence, I don't see how institutional disability discrimination should not become a criminal offence given that such damages to one's well-being can be more permanent than one-off verbal insults."

While we can debate about tastes all day long, one can argue that the hygene at restaurants/fast food joints is questionable. You just can't always know who has prepared your meal, how they handle the ingredients, what really goes into your food and so on.

Then, the portion sizes and the cost: I've been to restaurants that charge you a fortune for miniscule portions. Even fast food places reduce the size of the meals nowadays. You can have an amazing and rich pasta dish made at home ( a whole pot to be honest ), and at a restaurant you get only a third of it for a ridiculously high price.

Last but not least, eating a comfort meal at the comfort of your own home just feels better than eating the exact same meal when you are at a loud restaurant, some people staring at you so you have to obey eating etuquetes etc. At home I will eat with my hands if I want to, and there is no one to judge me.

Nazis used the Versailles treaty and their destroyed WW1 economy, barrels full of money needed to buy pieces of bread, to fuel revenge and hate against the Entente.  The feeling of embarrassment and weakness made so many angry and joined the Nazis due to this feeling of embarrassment and poverty.

It does not matter if the Russian government and pro-Putin citizens deserve the hate (they do 100% deserve the hate imo) - the goal must be to prevent a balkanized, imploding Russia which might turn into a new Middle East. Military companies might like this to keep their economies going, but it is truly disgusting.

When Russia loses there will be people blaming the Jews, NATO, LGBT people, etc, etc. They will repeat the stabbed in the back myth of the Nazis, perhaps people like Dugin will see a rise in popularity, maybe even straight up Russian terrorist groups frothing at the mouth due to their loss.

I am deeply sorry if any Ukrainians reading this and thinks I am saying Russia is innocent. I am not saying that at all. I would support military tribunals and punishments and jail for life for many, many Russian. But we must look back at history to prevent the same mistakes.

IF Russia collapses after Ukraine defeats them it is imperative to turn Russia into a pro-western state by economically helping them, reminding them of their great literature and achievements and explaining they don't need to conquer other nations to be ""great"". We westerners should also admit we interfered in their elections and our own faults and imperialism, a chance for both sides to agree it is time to move on.

This is also beneficial for Western and NATO countries - less money is needed to be spent on defense if Russia becomes a friendly nation, especially Finland and Poland and other eastern european nations can relax quite a bit. The sole focus could be on China who logically will not expand into Russia if they become part of NATO. Taiwan will still be an issue, but it will basically be the entire world against China which does not seem that likely. Anyway that is not the topic of this CMV :)

Any thoughts? Again, I am sorry to the Ukrainians who have suffered. But consequentialism matters - we cannot just beat nations down and not fix them, as they will continually rise again and again until the main issues are fixed."

Pakistani immigrants are almost exclusively arrested in all developed countries for some of the most severe crimes so many times.  Especially child r\*pe. (Please note I'm not against immigrants and they are not the topic of this post.)

  
 Dozens of terrorist groups are entirely funded by them. and they have no economy of their own so they just keep taking huge bailouts from IMF every 6 months. And that bailout money is also mostly given to terrorist groups, not for their own country's future.

  
 And they are the only country that has nukes but not a no-first-use clause. They are an irresponsible country and cannot be trusted with nukes. They are thirsting to use them but can't because of the consequences. 

  
So they have nothing to provide the world but problems. The solution to the pakistani problem would be to launch a full-scale embargo. Nothing can go in or out of pakistan. No people can visit it. No people can go out of it. no goods in or out either. And planes will also have to go around them instead of being in their airspace.

I understand some have been hurt in the past by churches, and I can see why it may want some to attack religion, but is that enough to warrant attacking the religion and not the people who claim to practice it and hurt them?

1,2023-09-02,CMV: Schools should abolish grades,u/FalseKing12,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1686x5f/cmv_schools_should_abolish_grades/,changemyview,"Our current education system is flawed in so many different ways, but I think a change that could be quite easy and have a positive impact would be to quite simply get rid of grades. 

  
When we are young children we have an innocent curiosity towards the world and want to learn about whats happening around us. However, that tends to stop when we realize in school that rather than learn, we must focus instead on getting good grades. Our desire to learn and have fun with that learning constantly stifled by the fear of failure and rightfully so since grades are so important to our futures, or at least that’s how it is currently. 

  
Imagine for a moment though if grades were abolished. Now, I’m aware that the government, colleges, and other institutions like having a number attached to people that determines their “intelligence”, because its useful to their interests and makes things convenient for them, but my question is why should we make things convenient for them when it has an extremely negative impact on the youth we need to be giving a better education. 

  
Even if we absolutely need a metric by which to gauge peoples intelligence, grades are an absolutely awful way to do that. A far better way would be to have teachers allow students to go their own pace through classes, only passing the class once the teacher has determined that the student has mastery over the subject they are teaching(this is prone to bias from teachers, but so is our current system of grading). This would allow students to go at their own pace and actually learn the subject more fully rather than just regurgitating exactly what they need to know for a test so they can pass. In this way you could measure how fast people proceed through classes and that would be a far better measure of intelligence than our current system of grades. As long as we can assume that most teachers remain unbiased and don’t just push students through who are not ready to go to different classes I don’t think this would suffer from the same problems that grades do. Where instead of focusing on grades they might focus on trying to rush through the content of classes to finish quicker if that’s the metric they are being judged by. 

  
In a society where its getting increasingly important to specialize in something and be an expert in that subject so you can get a decent job, we need to teach kids that learning is something to be enjoyed for its own sake, they will be spending their whole lives doing it after all. What we are seeing now is a generation of people who are more directionless than ever and I think part of that is our system of education sucking the joy out learning. 

  
In summary I think abolishing grades would be worth it despite the problems it presents, I’m welcome to discussing the topic though.

1,2023-09-02,"CMV: Forced volunteerism should be discouraged in almost any given capacity. Should be doubly to any entities or companies that are ""strictly for profit.""",u/Midnightchickover,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/168c8lx/cmv_forced_volunteerism_should_be_discouraged_in/,changemyview,"Volunteerism is a great way to build civic duty. I've always appreciated people who could take their personal time to help causes for children, needy families, public spaces, animals, and the environment.  I used to love to do it all of the time, in my spare time. It was nothing that I expected back in return or to be compensated for my time. Perhaps, fulfill an obligation that's not related to the cause.  Though, I've noticed over the last few years, certain states, along with national initiatives to increase work requirements for certain social programs, just as contracted prison labor employees have increased with the number of underage children working longer hours and in hazardous occupation.  


Again, speaking strictly to volunteerism, I feel the spirit of volunteerism is dying for several reasons, But, in this one particular, I feel that many private entities and pseudo-non profit groups, and obvious for profit groups and companies are exploiting this casual (intended) loophole in the laws.  If a state or county requires, for example, requires food stamp recipients or applicants to work a minimum of 20 hours per work or in a vocational job training program. I do have my opinions about this issue, though for the most part, I'm almost completely against it, like prison labor or younger child workers.   For the same reasons, they all undermine the job market in almost every sense of the word.    


Number one, it undermines the labor market in the sense that it allows lazy businesses, or exploitative billion dollar companies to have underpaid employees, in the sense of the minimum wage ($7.25).  I wouldn't mind the forced volunteerism, so much, if the volunteers received a comparable compensation to their hours of work. For example, if a single, childless volunteer has to work 20 hours a week under any condition. Ideally, they should be paid ($7.25 per hour), which equates to about 80 - 100 work hours per month.   In real time US dollars, translates to $580 - $725, yet the state is only giving  them about $200 per month for the food stamps per individual, though some states do give them cash benefits, which can make up the difference. But, the labor provided doesn't come close to what they'll be provided.  Again, it's one of the biggest failures of the American legislature to not have minimum wage that did not keep pace with the GDP, where a system has been created to force people to even seek out these services to begin with.   


Number two, the people who are currently incarcerated, in an odd way fall into this category with the rise of private prisons and institutions allowing private companies to utilize prison labor at a substantial discount.  Especially in regards to the latter, I believe if prisoners are allowed or forced to work, they should be getting the minimum wage of pay, equal to the national rate or the rate of the local state or county at the very minimum. And, at best, something equal to what other employees in a similar position would make as civilian. It's a horrible practice of injustice to force people in prison to work with agreement as they probably couldn't get the same job with the same company once they are released from prison, while it's a bad for every job seeker who is looking for steady work to be denied due to companies using prison and child labor, may simply outsource to other countries.   


I was pretty incensed, when I genuinely wanted to go volunteer for an organization that I liked until they said that had so many volunteers now from the ""work requirement, they wouldn't needed any regular volunteers too much any more."" I may be short-sighted in my viewpoint, these practices are ethically exploitative on the basis that the service, itself is exploitative by its users.  The weirdest thing is that the benefit in its own practice giving the ""barest minimum,"" yet expecting to yield greater results for a public service. It's almost a punishment of the majority, based on an officials perception of its users. Really, it's a service that helps children, elderly, and disabled Americans the most, though. Sort of similarly with Medicaid, it's considered a benefit that is supposed to help the needy, yet people take advantage of it to get ""free or cheap medical care.""  I'd think most everyone would want to get free to low-cost medical care, I don't think it's something people want to go in substantial debt over. For the same reason, I believe people would want society where more people could get their basic needs met, which is metric that can often go hand and hand with poverty and crime.  Even as a working taxpayer, I do not see how making the recipients work twenty hours a week for $200 per month benefit, when the companies or organizations involve could just go ahead pay the state, directly or in taxes, to where the recipients get higher amounts of benefits for working steadily.

1,2023-09-02,CMV: It’s in the American national interest for us to pivot away from supporting Ukraine and instead cultivate a better relationship with Russia,u/jadacuddle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/168ckyw/cmv_its_in_the_american_national_interest_for_us/,changemyview,"
Although I’m not a Republican or a Vivek Ramaswamy supporter, I watched one of his speeches on foreign policy recently and found myself agreeing with one specific part of it: “That Russia-China military alliance is the single greatest threat we face. Nobody in either political party is talking about it, and that is why I will end the Ukraine War on terms that require Vladimir Putin to exit his military alliance with China. This is a reverse move of what Nixon did. Putin is the new Mao. What we really need to be doing is getting Vladimir Putin to drop Xi Jinping.” I think he’s absolutely correct about this and that whoever the president is in 2024 should pursue this agenda.

Under such a scenario, Russia would look to reinforce their southern and eastern fronts, where they would fight for influence and domination against China. I can't imagine that Russia would be a docile American ally against China, but I'm sure that they could be a gigantic India to the north, in competition with China. This would obviously surround Beijing and reduce the amount of energy that they can bring to Taiwan & South China Sea, or Korea. It would also seriously hamper China’s efforts to extract resources from Central Asia and geographically box them in. In our universe, however, Russia's most imminent security concern comes from their western front, and they have to attend to that first, regardless of how they feel about China.

With our current policy towards Russia, nearly every outcome of the Russia-Ukraine war benefits China. If Ukraine somehow manages to repel the Russian invasion, Russia will be reduced from a partner to a Chinese patron, providing China with even more power to deal with other regional powers attempting to balance against it.

A Russian victory and the settlement that followed it would likely be brokered, at least in part, by the Chinese, further providing China with diplomatic legitimacy. The best scenario for China seems to be exactly where the Ukraine war is headed: A protracted conflict in Ukraine will further draw U.S. attention, personnel, and stockpile-draining munitions to the European continent, providing China more leeway and leverage in the Pacific. 

The scenario the Chinese want least: The United States decides to cease all military aid to the Ukrainians and forces the Ukrainians into a negotiated peace with Russia. With an end to the war in Ukraine, the U.S. could meaningfully pivot to the Pacific and cultivate a proper relationship with Russia.

Under normal circumstances, China poses a far greater threat to both the U.S. and Russia than we do to each other. Of course, “normal circumstances” don’t exist. Needlessly, fruitlessly antagonizing Russia is now a cornerstone of America’s foreign policy. Meanwhile, antagonizing us right back has become a cornerstone of Russia’s policy. Neither country can truly imagine a world in which we both simply drop our feud and work towards our own countries’ best interests, but if we extend an olive branch towards them I believe we could repair our relationship and based on our common interests.

China is the only peer threat that modern America faces. By peeling Russia out of their orbit, we’d strike a major diplomatic blow against them and put ourselves in a much better position."
1,2023-09-02,"CMV: ""ACAB"" Must Include IRS Agents",u/alcanthro,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/168crbs/cmv_acab_must_include_irs_agents/,changemyview,"\# Introduction  
The phrase ""ACAB"" (All Cops Are Bastards) is often used to critique law enforcement agencies for systemic issues such as racial profiling, excessive use of force, and lack of accountability. While the discussion usually revolves around uniformed police officers, it's worth expanding the scope to consider IRS agents as well. After all, IRS agents are law enforcers in their own right, albeit in a different domain: tax law.  
\# What Defines a Cop?  
Firstly, we must understand what a ""cop"" or a ""police officer"" is. By a broad definition, a cop is an individual who enforces laws. While they may not carry firearms or make arrests in the traditional sense, IRS agents do enforce a specific set of laws, namely tax laws. They investigate tax evasion, fraud, and other non-compliance, and they have the authority to impose penalties, seize assets, and even recommend criminal charges. Therefore, they are, in essence, ""cops"" of the financial world.  
\# The Power of the IRS  
The IRS wields enormous power. A tax audit can be a life-altering event, and failure to comply can result in severe penalties. This kind of power can be just as impactful as the power wielded by the police. Both can result in loss of freedom, financial ruin, and long-term consequences. The IRS, just like traditional police forces, operates with a level of opacity and has been criticized for targeting specific groups disproportionately, such as lower-income individuals who may not have the resources to contest an audit.  
\# Accountability and Ethical Questions  
Just like many advocate for police reform, there have been calls for IRS reform. The agency has faced scrutiny for lack of accountability and transparency. While not as immediately life-threatening as a police encounter could be, the lack of checks and balances can have a deeply damaging impact on individuals and organizations alike.  
\# The Complexity of Tax Law  
The IRS enforces a set of laws that are incredibly complex and often difficult for the average person to understand fully. This complexity creates an environment where mistakes can easily be made, and the consequences can be severe. This is analogous to how many people feel about the criminal justice system, where laws can be so complex or counterintuitive that they trap people into making mistakes.  
\# Conclusion  
While IRS agents don't fit the stereotype of what most people think of when they hear the word ""cop,"" they are law enforcers with significant powers and responsibilities. If the discussion around ACAB is to be thorough and nuanced, it should include all forms of law enforcement, which must logically include IRS agents. They enforce laws, have significant impact on people's lives, and operate within systems that many see as flawed and in need of reform.

It is a discussion providing facts. If you can't handle this conversation, then leave.* 

One of the most pervasive negative stereotypes is the association of African Americans with criminal behavior. This stereotype can result in racial profiling, bias in the criminal justice system, and unfair treatment.

But let’s look at a couple statistics here. 

Robberies in the US: 
White: 25,143
Black: 29,667

Murders in the US:
White: 3,650
Black: 4,078 

It is important to consider demographic proportions when analyzing data. In the United States, the population is predominantly composed of white individuals, accounting for approximately four times the population of Black individuals. Therefore, when examining any behavior or activity, including criminal behavior, it is expected that there may be a larger number of incidents involving white individuals simply due to the larger population size.

So let’s adjust, to get a better idea of what this would look like if there were more of a equal amount of black to white people:

Robberies in the US: 
White: 25,143 x 1 = 25,143
Black: 29,667 x4 = 118,668

Murders in the US:
White: 3,650 x 1= 3,650
Black: 4,078 x4 = 16,312

This speaks volumes. 

It’s not surprise that a black person is more likely to commit a crime than any other race. 
You see it all the time. Video after video. Certain cities that are heavily populated with African American people are basically crime central. 

If you don't want to be perceived a certain way, you can change your behavior that causes that perception."

1,2023-09-02,CMV: “Tankie” thought is the only leftist conviction that doesn’t end in futility and misery,u/Kalvin-TL,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/168eo73/cmv_tankie_thought_is_the_only_leftist_conviction/,changemyview,"“Tankie” ideology is the only type of socialist ideology that’s sustainable to ascribe to.  Yeah people will laugh at the China truthers. Mock them for insisting that China is playing the long game for the revolution if you must. Indeed it is a little silly! It’s basically QAnon for liberal arts washouts. 

But I understand why people ascribe to that belief. Every other form of leftist conviction is a path to futility and misery. Let’s go down the list:

Anarchism: I’ve had runny dumps that last longer than the median anarchist “zone” or whatever. They’re always pitifully weak and get annihilated by a more powerful force, whether it’s fascist or a statist socialist one. 

Reformism/Electoralism: This has been comprehensively broken. You can’t even get student debt relief let alone healthcare. Socialism and the dismantling of capitalism? Fat chance. 

Insurrection/Violent revolution: I tried to make a post on /r/socialism 101 and it got banned immediately for using a slur. That slur was “dumb”. I’m sorry but just take an honest look at the soft ass people who call themselves socialist. They do no not have the stones to overthrow shit. Funny enough we see more of a threat to liberal institutions on the right nowadays. We see from J6 that the Arby’s Franchisee and car dealership owners will do a coup before the left attempts to do anything. Contemporary leftists do not have that dog in them.

Even if you do pull it off, what if you just create another kind of tyranny? That’s the bleakest possibility of all. 

The tankie line of thought is the only form of leftism that doesn’t just leave you defeated and miserable. We at least had a protagonist state for a little under a century! We could…do that again? It’s not more unrealistic than Medicare for all. Depending on what flavor of tankie you are, we might still have one now! That’s gotta be inspiring. 

Without it, “leftism” is just a religion for people too college educated to become born again Christian - not a serious political program. It gives you a lens to interpret the world, set aside the chosen good people from the benighted evil masses, and even has an eschatology to it. “Theory” is just theology. It scratches the exact same itch. As someone who has been in tradcath and leftist circles, believe me on that.

The way I see it, we are on a crash course for climate collapse and many resource crises. Nothing is really getting in the way of capitalism burning through resources, people, and our planet. The hope for revolution is functionally a religious one, even if it isn’t couched in those terms. The only thing that can save us at this point is a technological deus ex machina: Fusion power on a sufficient scale, carbon capture mcguffin, shit like that.

I made sure that all my meals were within my calorie limit. However, one of the meals included a bowl of fruity pebbles with flax milk.

Isn't that just gunboat progressivism? Like say you want to change the system from the inside out, but all you've done is just made internal policies more rainbow friendly. Like that doesn't change the black ops/neo-colonial interference/excessive collateral damage, etc.

Does a family deserve to be killed by a drone attack because the operator happens to be gay? If progressivists commonly say ACAB because of a broken system, then why not ASAB? Why should progressives take part in the military-industrial complex? What right do you have to indefinitely occupy another country or conduct black ops somewhere you don't belong? Are you going to shoot people into supporting leftist ideals? It's been proven that you can't forcibly convert the Middle East into a democracy and you're not going to bomb the Islamic world into being LGBT friendly overnight.

And I'm not excusing the Taliban or ISIS either. Their hyper-theocratic ideology is abhorrent as is their atrocities, way they abuse women and children, etc. I also understand they intentionally use human shields and brainwash children but I also think the US was pretty reckless with excessive bombing and drone attacks. Do we need a classified CIA kill list? No we don't. Do we need a CIA at all? No we don't. Does it make sense for progressives to support any of this? No it doesn't.

""So you only want the military to be made up of hyper-conservative warmongers?""

Quite the opposite. I've been reading that elements of the right have actually gotten pretty isolationist and I'm not sure I disagree. Why should the US be the world's police? Isn't that neocolonialism? Why would progressives of all people spearhead this?

""What about Russian and China?""

What about them? Does occupying the Middle East for 20 years have anything to do with Russia and China? Are the shady things the US military does such as drones/assassinations/domestic spying/torture good because Russia and China are worse?

What really perplexes me is why LGBT/progressive service members are upset about LGBT domestic policies? Why is you have the right to marry/gender-affirmation/etc. more important than some impoverished family in the Middle East staying alive? You don't get to sit behind a rifle or plane and shoot at people and then say you're oppressed? You can't get mad at mean old Pastor Bob or whoever not being LGBT affirming after playing gunboat diplomat/stormtrooper.

I find this to be incredibly backward, because as someone who has read these books, they tackle very important themes. TKM particularly broaches dark themes of racism in America. Many schools removed this book from the curriculum because the plot is centered around a rape allegation and racist language.

What many people seem to not understand is the things that happened in the plot of TKM were commonplace during Jimcrow. Even today, minorities face horrible discrimination and prejudice that parallels the themes in TKM.

It is safe to say that these books which confront hard to swallow themes are not fit for young children. However, these books are typically read in high school where children begin to think more matutely and hypothetically about abstract ideas like morals.

By removing these books, it is implied that the uncomfortability of reading about such themes is more important than the lessons that these books teach. Of course some books are less perfect than others, but in general I think it's important to think more critically about what we are prioritizing by removing such novels.

For what it's worth, everyone I went to high school with loved these novels, and no one ever reported that they were severely damaged for having read them. Reading about racism and sexism is always going to be uncomfortable and emotionally overwhelming. Unfortunately, the world is not always going to protect our children the same way that these curriculums are trying to do."

She didn't campaign in Wisconsin at all. Just assume it was a free win. sure the argument is that Democrats won every president election in Wisconsin in 30 years. That's true. But just silly to do. It wasn't that long ago California was a reliable red state. Now look at today. It's the opposite. Things change. Not to mention Wisconsin had a republican governor at the time. That alone should tell you, ""hey maybe a state wide win for us isn't a guarantee when a republican just won state wide two days ago""

And secondly, in those 30 years, all those elections results were close. All single digits except 3. 1 was Obama landide against McCain. And remaining two were Clinton with Perot on the ballot. Clinton didn't even get a majority either time.

So anyway Bernie isn't the blame, whoever she hired that told her not to campaign in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are."

I think this is a serious topic and hope all who engage, do so seriously, without assuming ill intent. 

It's often argued that we should validate and respect the identities and beliefs of transgender individuals, who's self-identification differs from their biological sex. However, this raises a complex question: If we should validate a transgender person's gender identity, should we validate every person who's perception of themselves contradicts their physical body? For example, someone who believes they are another race? Or someone who believes they're a dog? Or an alien?

Here's the argument in a nutshell:

1. Transgender individuals assert a gender identity that differs from their biological sex, and society is increasingly accepting and validating their identities.

2. Some argue that this validation is necessary to promote inclusivity, reduce discrimination, and support mental well-being among transgender individuals.

3. However, this approach seems to open the door to validating other beliefs and delusions, such as someone genuinely believing they are a different animal than in reality, which many wouldn't hesitate to consider a delusion.

So, my question is: Should we have a consistent standard for validating personal beliefs and identities, either by validating all of them or none of them? Is there a middle ground, or should we treat different cases differently?

I'm genuinely interested in hearing different perspectives on this topic, as it raises important questions about the boundaries of validation and the consequences of adopting a certain stance on identity and belief validation. Please keep the discussion respectful and open-minded."

Specifically, I developed a deep appreciation for 90s hip-hop music as it resonated with me profoundly, given my inherently ""conscious"" nature. Additionally, I encountered instances of racism and bullying during my upbringing.  
  
Right as I delved into hip-hop, I also attended a racially diverse school and absorbed various ""urban"" attitudes and behaviors that I might not have encountered elsewhere. Looking back, I realize that this environment played a significant role in nurturing my passion for hip-hop and music in general. It's worth noting that I didn't attend one of those schools where the student population is over 60% Black in a stereotypical ""hood"" setting, although many outsiders considered it ""ghetto."" The prevailing atmosphere consisted of middle and lower-middle-class students from different racial backgrounds who were unafraid to embrace the ""culture"". Racial barriers in forming friendships or judging each other based on interests and attitudes were almost non-existent, unless someone exhibited eccentric behavior.  
  
As I grew older, I expanded my appreciation for ""black"" culture by exploring other black genres such as R&B, funk, and soul, watching blaxploitation films, picking up more urban lingo, and following shows like the Breakfast Club, among other things. Since hip-hop is deeply rooted in the Black experience, I also developed a strong passion for social justice and the Pan-African identity, which may seem ironic.  
  
During my sophomore year of high school, I relocated to a wealthier and predominantly ""whiter"" part of Florida from southern Virginia. Immediately upon starting school there, I sensed a stark contrast. Not only was it less racially diverse (at the time, I couldn't easily distinguish between Hispanics and white people), but the students also behaved quite differently. They exuded privilege, which I did not want to emulate. Even the ""black"" students had notably different attitudes. Furthermore, the African American culture in the deep South, and especially in Florida, seemed distinct (at least that's what I believed at the time). Understanding what some individuals referred to as ""jits"" said was often challenging. The socially aware and ""woke"" vibe I had chased appeared absent.  
  
The most disheartening aspect was that I began facing judgment and ridicule based on my appearance and speech due to my race. This had never happened to me before I moved to Florida. When white individuals judged me, it was annoying, but when Black people did it, it was deeply hurtful because I believed I had no ill intentions. If anything, I considered myself an ""ally."" It's crucial to note that I had never been judged in this manner before my move to Florida. These experiences left me feeling very insecure and isolated. My pride and passion prevented me from abandoning my old attitudes and habits, but they prompted me to reflect more on issues of race and identity.  
  
About a year later, the George Floyd incident and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement occurred. Interestingly, I became an avid BLM activist for about a week, creating fake accounts to call out people until small businesses were being looted and property destroyed. Nonetheless, I still strongly identified with ""black"" culture and essentially resembled an Asian Dr. Umar (although not to that extreme). My intent wasn't to adopt another race; rather, I embraced what I genuinely liked. I mention BLM and identity politics because I believe they exacerbated racial tensions and attitudes. People became even more vigilant about cultural appropriation and related matters.  
  
A year later, I attended a predominantly white institution (PWI) in the same state. However, the judgment persisted. Whether it was coming from a white or Black person, some individuals disliked the way I presented myself. They accused me of ""trying to be Black"" and such. Based on the way I was judged, it might sound as though I was 24/7 wearing dreadlocks, a 2Pac shirt, and exclusively  True Religion jeans, but I dressed like how I always did. In my mind, I was merely being myself. I didn't care if someone tried to emulate Asian culture; it didn't bother me. What was even more frustrating was that most of the ""Black"" students at my PWI weren't even African American; many were of Caribbean descent, which puzzled me as to why they took offense. I wasn't attempting to imitate Vybz Kartel, after all.  
  
I once had a conversation with two of my ""Black"" friends, one African American and the other of Caribbean heritage. They were discussing how annoying cultural appropriation was and accused me of trying to be ""Black."" I found this ironic because neither of them had grown up in circumstances that mirrored the average ""Black"" kid's experience. Despite this, I never passed judgment on them in a reverse manner. I wasn't trying to be like them; perhaps I admired Jay-Z, but I didn't aim to mimic their style at all. Additionally, at my college, the racial groups tended to keep to themselves, especially the Black students. That seemed to be the prevailing atmosphere.  
  
Anyhow, I strongly believe that the concept of cultural appropriation is problematic. Asians, for example, seldom complain about cultural appropriation, even when it pertains to Chinese, Korean, or Japanese people borrowing elements from one another's cultures. People typically don't mind when a Black person dresses up as an Asian character at an anime convention or when Nicki Minaj adopts ""Asian"" aesthetics. Most Asians are indifferent to such matters. We rarely accuse others of trying to emulate our culture or make snide comments about how superior our culture is when someone drives a Nissan Altima or uses a Samsung phone, or even when they use soy sauce or enjoy Chinese takeout. Moreover, the 808 drums used in trap music were invented by a Japanese man.  
  
Furthermore, I dislike how people become outraged when Black individuals are negatively stereotyped but later treat race as a monolithic concept. ""Blackness,"" ""whiteness,"" and ""Asianess"" are not monolithic; individuals remain unique, and that should be acknowledged.  
  
The current obsession with Black businesses and Black history also doesn't sit well with me. Chattel slavery was not unique to African Americans; slavery has existed throughout history and affected nearly every ethnicity. Additionally, it's worth noting that ""Black"" individuals collaborated with Europeans and sold other ""Black"" individuals into slavery, often without recognizing it as such. The same people who argue that race is a social construct sometimes engage in hypocritical judgments of individuals from other races. Living in Florida, it's frustrating when Caribbean individuals act as if they deserve reparations and affirmative action. Haiti isn't the only country that has suffered due to American actions. I'm not saying there's no racism in this country; I'm simply tired of all the nonsense."

\---

Last week the local news aired a segment with an interaction that immediately reminded me of something a popular prime-time comedian said on one of his closing segments years ago.  
Before I get to that, let me explain what happened.  One of our local south Florida sports reporters is an objectively beautiful young woman of Greek heritage (This is obvious because of her last name).  She was participating in some sort of charity baseball practice where people played a little bit of light batting for fund raising (Pretty cool).  Towards the end of the segment she asked one of the attendees how he would call her batting attempt (I guess he's an announcer of some sort), so he did and when he said her name he called gave her the middle name of ""The Greek Goddess.""  She immediately turned away and tried to hurry up to the next segment.  I'm no body language expert, but even I could tell that it made her uncomfortable.  
As said prime time comedian stated, ""Not all men who make a woman uncomfortable did it because he's an asshole.  If you look at all romcoms they all follow the same three plot tropes.""  No going to go into all he stated, but the thing that most applies here is this: ""Hollywood has managed to convince men to act a certain way towards women because it's what they think women want.  Because it \*is\* what women want.... but only from the men they want it from.  Problem is we don't know which ones we are!""      
Back to the segment with the lovely Greek reporter, any reasonable person would think, ""Why would she get offended by that it was a compliment!""  Simply put, he was the wrong man to say it.  The dude was heavyset (Not just a few extra pounds either), clearly older and with a receding hairline.  Now the age may not matter to her, but let's be real here: If the dude was more in line to what she considers ""attractive"" I am sure her reaction would have been a lot more positive.  She might have even given him a ""thank you.""  This is why so many guys are afraid to merely compliment women these days.

Now, some people (even some women) told me when I relayed this story was ""Yeah, if the guy looked like Jason Mamoa or Ryan Reynolds she probably would have been flattered.""  Others said ""dude she had every right to be offended no matter what he looks like.""  Another said ""Maybe she didn't like being hit while on trying to do her job that she knew was going to be ON TV.""

The notion that the man did nothing wrong other than compliment an attractive woman while not being ""attractive"" seemed to be in play here.  But could the other people with dissenting opinions also be on to something as well?

1,2023-09-03,"CMV: If pickup trucks and SUVs are ""work vehicles,"" then commercial driver's licenses should be required to own and operate them.",u/AdamantForeskin,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/168qyok/cmv_if_pickup_trucks_and_suvs_are_work_vehicles/,changemyview,"I'm going to start off by simply stating the facts:

1. **Pickup trucks and SUVs are more likely to seriously injure or kill someone in the event of a crash** \- this is simple physics. Pickups and SUVs are larger, and therefore heavier, than passenger cars. You can stick as many airbags and crumple zones in the lighter car as you want, but the fact of the matter is that you cannot completely engineer your way out of freshman-level physics; a truck that weighs 3000 kilograms traveling at 60 miles per hour has twice as much momentum as a car that weighs 1500 kilograms traveling at the same speed; you're not getting around that. To add onto this, the heavier the vehicle, the longer it will take to stop, which is not good if your goal is to avoid the accident in the first place.
2. **Poor visibility** \- because trucks and SUVs are taller and have longer hoods than cars, this leads to a front blind spot, which is tragic for pedestrians. [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/the-hidden-dangers-of-big-trucks/) here discusses this phenomenon, opening by discussing a case where an 18-year-old behind the wheel of a Jeep Gladiator struck and killed an elderly grandmother, and claimed to police that he didn't even see her. The thing is, due to the factors regarding overall height and hood length detailed by this very same report, he very well may have been telling the truth.
3. **Rollovers** \- once again, this is basic physics. Having a taller vehicle means having a higher center of mass, which means sudden, evasive maneuvers are more likely to tip the vehicle over - simply because not as much cornering force is required to do so. For practical examples of this, look at any video of the moose test, and look at how many of the failing vehicles are trucks and SUVs.

With all of this in mind, why is it that any Joe Shmoe who took a driving test once when they were a teenager and then never again can drive these vehicles? Not only are they endangering the safety of pedestrians and other vehicles on the road, they are endangering their own safety as well. Not to mention emissions; a heavier vehicle requires more energy to travel at the same speed, period. Are we really going to compromise our emissions targets because somebody feels like they need an SUV to take their kids to soccer practice, or a pickup to get groceries?"

No matter how many of them you punish, it's not going to prevent crime from ever happening, thieves and rapists are always going to exist.

We know that these criminals target those they perceive as vulnerable, like elderly women walking around with the latest iPhone for example. According to me, elderly women walking around with the latest iPhone *AND* a weapon are less likely to have their phone taken. I think that's what they and any other vulnerable people should do if it's legal in their country/state to carry something. I think if they all did then the rate of theft and rape would drop, whether it drops by 0.1%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 10%, 50%, whatever % it is it would drop somewhat at least.

You don't need to carry a rocket launcher or rail gun. Any weapon you can at least pretend like you can use will decrease your chances of being victimised. For example you might produce the weapon and have it ready and visible in your hand while walking through and unsafe area. I'm sure in the US you're allowed to carry weapons for self defence. You don't need to use it but just having it will decrease your chances of being victimised.

Another preventative measure is driving instead of walking if you can. I heard another preventative measure is apparently pretend like you're on the phone talking to someone or actually call someone and talk to them while you're walking through an unsafe area and that might dissuade some criminals from attacking you.

The police aren't going to prevent your phone from being stolen. How can they? They're not standing by on every corner waiting for you to get robbed just so they can fly into action and save the day. You have to call them and then they take however long to come. And if your phone got taken then how are you supposed to call them? And after you call them how are they supposed to find the thief exactly? The thief's face was covered and they ran away in a certain direction but probably circled back and ran in the other direction, they could've went anywhere, they could be anywhere, they could be anyone.

If you have some kind of a weapon which is legal to be in possession of in your country, a criminal is less likely to engage with you and go after someone else instead."

First the raw box score numbers, now obviously people who are knowledgeable about these stats two series' are going to know whose stats are who, but I want you to do your best to take names out of the equation and ask yourself which player you would rather have on your team: 

Player 1: 17.8/7.2/6.8 on 47.8/32.1/60.0 shooting splits

Player 2: 22.6/2.8/4.4 on 38.1/17.4/92.0 shooting splits 

While neither averages are what you want to see out of an all-time great superstar player, at the very least statline 1 (LeBron) paints a picture of a player who may not be a dominant scorer but is at the very least a good all-round facilitator and rebounder who isn't shooting you out of games. 

Meanwhile, statline 2 paints a picture (an accurate one in my view), of a volume scorer who is shooting his team out of games. 

More often than not, people point out one specific game as being the core part of what makes LeBron's 2011 finals series so bad, and that is game 4 in which he scored just 8 points. Supposedly this is the worst game ever by a superstar player in the playoffs, so bad that it has for many people stained his legacy forever. 

However it isn't even obvious to me that this game was worse than Kobe's worst game in 2004, a game 3 loss in which he scored just 11 points on 4-13 shooting. Honestly I think he's just fortunate to have scored an extra couple of points to have reached double figures so the final score tally doesn't jump off the page the way EIGHT points does. 

On top of all of this, what makes Kobe's choke job especially egregious in my view is that he shot his team out of a series while having what most people consider to be **the most dominant player in NBA history on his team**, that being a prime Shaquille O'Neal. 

Shaq was averaging 26.6 and 10.3 rebounds on **63.1% from the field** in this series, yet he shot the ball a whopping 31 fewer times than Kobe did in a five game series. I know LeBron had the help of HOFers Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, but at least he wasn't actively detracting from their ability to help the team to even close to the same extent that Kobe did. 

To be honest I think the difference in how these two series are viewed simply comes down to the place the respective players were in their careers. 

LeBron had just made probably the most hated team switch in American sports (if not world sports) history by moving to Miami, and was already widely being tarred as a choke artist by the likes of Skip Bayless in the media. He'd yet to win a title and had created the perfect storm for the media to go crazy about his underachievement.

Meanwhile Kobe's championship credentials were already secured, as he had just come off the three-peat with the Lakers. No one was denying his ability to get it done on the big stage, so when he fell short on this occasion it wasn't really a confirmation of a media-wide narrative about him in the same way it was about LeBron. 

I'm not trying to criticise the media's reaction at the time to these respective performances, they were mostly valid although I maintain the criticism from the likes of Bayless has always been excessive towards LeBron. 

What I'm saying is I think we allow our perception of these two admittedly awful finals choke jobs to be coloured by the medias reaction at the time, and that if we look at the two series' without that historical bias I think it becomes apparent that Kobe played a worse series than LeBron"

I have no training in either the legal system or psychology.  I'm making this post in the hopes of sharing my thoughts, generating some discussion, and to see if someone is able to convince me otherwise.  I'm not the best at putting my thoughts into words but I'll try my best.

We all know the usual arguments for and against capital punishment.  The Pro-crowd say that it serves as a suitable punishment for the most depraved crimes.  The Anti-crowd say it is an immoral punishment that does nothing to deter crime and can lead to innocent people being wrongly executed.

My view is this:

The Death Penalty is not perfect *in practice*.  There will always be wrongful convictions.  This is true for any man-made system.  But the same could be said of many things.  The military is sanctioned to use deadly force when it is deemed necessary, despite the fact that there are many cases of the wrong people being killed, wether by accident, incorrect targeting, friendly fire, etc.  Except in cases of negligence or outright law breaking, society considers these deaths to be natural, if unfortunate, collateral damage.  We try to minimise these occurances but they still happen.  Despite these deaths, most people agree that the military is, if not a core pillar of modern government, then at the very least a necessary evil.

I would argue it is the same for the Death Penalty.

If someone I loved was killed (or suffered an equally terrible ordeal), and the perpetrator did it knowingly and maliciously (I.e. that it wasn't an accident), then I would want that person dead.  I know that we say ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"", and that the justice system is meant to take the public's desire for revenge out of the judiciary process,  but I would still want the murderer to die.

I wouldn't be unreasonable.  I would have to leave it to the prosecution, the evidence, the court, and the jury to eliminate any reasonable doubt.  But if, for example, the murder was caught on tape and the killer's face was seen clearly on camera, or there was an eye witness; that is if the proof was beyond a reasonable doubt, I would want the Death Penalty carried out.

If I knew the person sitting on trial knowingly and maliciously killed someone I loved, and the evidence supported it, then the Death Penalty would be the only sentence I would accept.  I know the process would take years.  The court needs to make sure, to the best of their ability, that they had the right person.  They would probably say that I should get therapy and that holding onto that hate and anger is bad for me, and I would agree, but I know that no amount of therapy would change my mind.  If someone I loved was murdered, then the only thing that would bring me peace would be seeing the killer executed.  My reasons are as follows:

- I couldn't bare the thought of the person who took my loved one's life getting to live a long, natural life, even in prison.
- No amount of therapy would be able to get me to the point where I would not wish death on that person.
- Not only would I believe the killer would be incapable of being rehabilitated; I do not believe that a person who can maliciously take another person's life deserves rehabilitation.
- Even in the worst prison conditions, prisoners could become accustomed to prison life, the thought of which would enrage me.
- I would always be worried that the killer found happiness or contentment in prison, or worse, they could eventually be released.

If the killer was sentenced to death I wouldn't care how long I had to wait, I would want to see him die.  To know that he would be robbed of the chance to live a natural lifespan, just as my loved one had been.

If the court decided against the death penalty, or worse, of they believed the killer could be rehabilitated, it would destroy me.  The only way I would be able to be at peace would be either to somehow kill them myself before they went to prison, or to pay another inmate to kill them for me.

I know this is hypocritical.  I know that, if successful and based on what I've said above, I would likely be sentenced to death myself for carrying out a premeditated murder, but I would be at peace.

In this circumstance, I would argue that it would be better for the killer to be executed, both to bring peace to the victim's family and to prevent the possibility of a revenge killing.  People who have suffered a traumatic loss should seek therapy, I'm not saying they shouldn't.  Many might even be able to let go of their anger and need for revenge.  Bit I'd argue that there are many people like myself who would be unable to let go of these feelings until the killer received the ultimate punishment able to be handed down by law.  I believe prisons should focus on imprisonment and rehabilitation, but that the court needs to find the appropriate sentence between rehabilitation and punishment, and for some crimes, I believe that the Death Penalty is the only punishment that would be suitable.

These are my thoughts on the matter.  I'll try to answer as quickly as I can today, but forgive me if it takes a while to see your response."

I've heard some that says otherwise and it usually goes something like this: ""I can imagine things that do not exist in the real world."" this could be some complex shape and what not but I've always replied that this too is information retrieved from reality, dragons don't exist in the real world yet the concepts of a dragon are.   
  
This has major implications because it means none of your thoughts or desires are your own, they are simply dictated by the environment around you (yes how your psyche act on that information matters too but to a lesser extent).  


I'm not sure what would change my mind, I feel like this is a pretty rational thought yet I've had people disagree with me but didn't change my view during that time."

I’d appreciate if you read my thoughts and not get unnecessarily hostile as online discourse can sometimes be, and also thankful for you taking the time to contribute to this conversation :). 


I understand where the stigma comes from behind a prenup, but logically speaking I believe it shouldn’t be something that’s looked down upon, nor shamed by either party.

I’ll start by clearing a couple of misconceptions that people often use to trash prenups;

#1: A prenup does not mean you leave your partner with nothing in the case you divorce. It is a mutual contract you both sign off on on the distribution of assets as you see appropriately, instead of letting the government handle it. It is an awkward conversation, but this is the person you’re marrying, you should be able to level headed have these discussions or you may not be mature enough to be married. This is the same person you’ll make huge financial decisions with, decide your will with, etc.

#2: A prenup doesn’t incentivize you to divorce or break up. If the only reason you’re staying in a marriage is for fear of losing your assets, I wouldn’t say that’s exactly healthy. Moreover, just like you buy insurance in case of accidents, death, injuries, you are just being a thoughtful and proactive person, of course you don’t want those things to happen. Imagine someone saying “You’re getting car insurance? Don’t you believe in your driving skills enough?”.

These are my preliminary thoughts. As mentioned before, yes it is an awkward topic to discuss but it is a necessary one. I believe it’s something both parties should agree on and be happy with, and if you ask most people divorces suck a lot, and it ruins a lot of lives."

The dictionary definition of morality is: ""principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior,"" and the reason we have to traverse this dichotomy is because we are constrained by biological necessities, such as need for food, shelter, reproduction, etc.   
  
As long as those biological necessities exist, AND, we have determined their satisfaction as a goal, human morality is objective: there is only a finite set of actions that are going to be evolutionarily successful for individuals and the groups that share their genetic material, and this is the basis of natural selection through Darwinian processes.   
  
Most of these moral axioms tend to be burdensome to the individual and a benefit for their group precisely because the species or one of its subunits is trying to perpetuate its own continued existence, to the detriment of individual specimens. Human moral systems, such as Abrahamic religions, the rule of law, or cultural norms and taboos, are merely attempts at pinpointing which axioms are better conducive to evolutionary success. They sometimes hit and sometimes miss.   
  
If we are no longer constrained by these necessities, OR, if we never determine that their satisfaction is a goal in the first place, then morality is subjective, which would be better termed inexistent, subjective morality is a misnomer.   
  
Fundamentalists will believe that their set of axioms are the objective morality, and any disagreements represent a rejection of objective morality as such. To their credit, their moral systems have been the most tested across millennia, so they do have some empirical leverage to pull. That won't convince most on the other camp, however.

There's always a reason. ""I hate men because my great great great grandfather abused my great great grandmother."" ""I hate white people because look at what they did to my ancestors."" And if somebody says ""that doesn't justify your hatred"" the common response to them is ""who are you to say, you're in a completely different boat. 

And in a lot of cases that's fair. They don't know. But it seems like there's a fairly straightforward way to gauge whether the hatred is a natural result of accumulated knowledge and experiences or a personality flaw- do other people with the same knowledge/experiences (or more knowledge and worse experiences) feel/act the same way.

 If not, then it seems to me the knowledge and experiences alone cannot justify the hatred and venom. This is true with experiences as well. And if people with the same/deeper knowledge *and* the same or worse experiences aren't filled with the same hatred, I think it's fair to say the hatred is the result of a personality trait, not knowledge or experiences. And my view is that, the majority of time, the hatred is the result of a personality flaw, though nobody wants to admit it. 

That's my view, but I'm open to changing it as always!"

However, for a very large percentage of men, their dating woes are through no fault of their own. I believe there’s a ton of men who by will be dateless and it not be their choice. For example, being under 5’6 and living in an area with taller women or facially ugly may end up getting dates, while they also may not get dates through abslutely no fault of their own, because the Just World Fallacy is, as the name suggests, a fallacy, and unfortunately not everyone is meant to find a partner.

But quite often when I scroll though some subs like r/antiwork for example I see people complaining that their office colleague are trying to socialize while they only “want to do their job” and these post are widely acclaimed. But at the same time some other people complain about their work environment being too sterile and that the absence of socializing is making them go burnout faster (I voluntarily exaggerate here) and those posts too are acclaimed. I really don’t get it. 

If I specified that I am from Europe it’s because it seems more normal there to socialize, discuss other stuff than work with your colleagues to know them better so I was kinda surprised in the beginning here.

Here is my point, you cannot ask for a nice, kind and social work environment if you do not participate in it. Change my view please"

However, all socialisms have to believe in everything Marx said and treat him like a god, or their beliefs are just baseless, since their beliefs are entirely based on the books that someone write.
 In other words, if someone “invented” something and you choose that to become the meaning of your existence, that’s the definition of heresy. 
Capitalism inspires everything. Every country relies on capitalism. When capitalism world exerted the harshest sanction on Soviet Union, it collapsed. China become the second strongest country on Earth, by choosing capitalism and cheap labor.

In fact, I think it's great to have more men be able to embrace attire, makeup, etc that traditionally has been reserved for women or the reverse for women who want to to be able to dress in traditionally men's attire.

That being said, a lot about drag *performances* and their popularity does not sit well with me. Combined, they paint a very non-progressive picture.

1. It's almost entirely drag *queens* in popular media and even at queer events. You rarely see drag kings. Sexism alive and well?

2. The drag queens you see almost always embody a very hyper feminine attire and persona. Again this seems to be pushing a strict narrative on what it means to be feminine and a woman.

3. A lot of cis straight people seem to be very into it. This is the least suspicious, however straight cis people are often very into gender roles and play into casual sexism in their day to day lives.

Drag performances are really prevalent in the LGBTQ community and I wish I could enjoy them, but it honestly only seems one step better than black face as far as offensive at times and has a huge amount of sexism baked into how and by whom it is enjoyed.

1,2023-09-03,CMV: Abortion is not immoral and should be legal,u/___fofo___,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16970sr/cmv_abortion_is_not_immoral_and_should_be_legal/,changemyview,"From a strictly biological and pragmatic perspective, it makes sense for women to get an abortion. It allows them to be more selective with the genetics of their offspring, which lessens the severity of rape and other unwanted situations (the idea that a woman should be forced to raise the child of a trashy rapist is absolutely barbaric to me). It allows them to choose when to have a child so that she can raise it properly, and not under a condition of poverty, or single motherhood, or as a teenager, etc. If she doesn’t feel responsible or able to take care of her child, then it makes sense to have an abortion and wait until another day to have a child. 

But people argue that it isn’t moral. And I simply ask: how? It doesn’t increase suffering, it does the opposite. If you’re some sort of theist, then what exactly is the sin? Where does the baby go when it dies? If you think it goes to hell, then I reject your religion. If you think it goes to heaven, then there is no crime. 

Politically, it makes sense to want to prevent having many children born in unfavorable conditions. So I don’t see why it’s illegal. People only want it to be illegal because they think it’s immoral, though they have no real arguments for this. 

A lot of people say something like, “Killing an innocent human is always wrong,” but that is just an abstract rule and ignores context and consequence. *Why* is it wrong? There is a huge difference between murder and abortion and we all know it, we all *feel* that it is so. If murder were legal, then there would be chaos. When abortion is legal, no one notices a difference, no one is a victim, and I would argue that the world is made a better place."

Worst part is that suicide is done by your own hand, many of the suicides happen in spring (source;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/may/12/mentalhealth.society) because of the extra sunlight giving suicidal people the boost needed to kill themselves. Instead of taking the chance to improve themselves.

Of course there are exemptions to this, like someone born with brain problems that makes them suicidal etc etc they are not cowardly or anything like that for the matter and deserve all the sympathy and empathy.

I also believe that suicidal people should be supported, but not calling them out is doing more harm then good. It's similar in many ways to being anti obesity. You support fat people by calling them out on being fat just like you support suicidal people by reminding to never give up and that suicide is weakness."

I am on a self improvement journey for other reasons than lack of dating and sex life.

I have lots of aspirations and goals and I am currently making a lot money for my age and I wll be making more. One thing I am working hard to achieve is become a popular social media influencer. After what happened in nyc with kai cenat, I am more determined to have a strong social media presence. 

If I ever achieve my goal, I want to gather large crowds of people and host some really cool events that gets a lot of interest and attention, like what Mr.beast does. But I wanna fucking ban women from participating out of spite for rejecting me.

Plus, I would feel angry that women didnt want me until I was a very successful and rich guy. 

I would rather date and have sex as a loser nobody because it seems a lot more pleasurable and validating. 

There are female prison guards who sleep with inmates, female managers who have affairs with younger male employees who are less successful than them, married women who cheat on their wealthy husbands for a more broke guy, etc.

The fact that a attractive woman is risking her wellbeing, career, reputation, etc for your dick even though she has better options and you're nothing special seems fucking awesome. that would boost my ego and fill me with confidence. 

Like, I always see and hear of dudes who dont have much going for them somehow attract so many attractive women. Why should I have to work so hard for women to notice and not reject me?

If women dont want me at my worst or mediocre state, then they dont deserve me at my best. If someday, I become a different man that women like, I wanna fucking break their hearts. I wanna take them on dates and ditch them or take them on dates and start making out with a different woman, And as I said, if I acheive my goal of becoming a popular social media star with a lot of influence, I am gonna start some cool events and/or organizations and clubs and ban the fuck out of women. 

furthermore, dating and sex seems much more fun and pleasurable at a younger age. I dont wanna have to start having sex until im fucking 25 or older. I probably wont even give a shit about sex and not feel as excited if i saw a attractive naked woman."

I’m older, pushing 30. When I was growing up everything was more traditional. It was pretty rare for girls to be porn stars. I’m in a large state in a big city, there were a handful of college aged girls that did porn or some nude modeling. Not a big deal. They were insanely attractive and just built to be a model. 

As I started to get older OnlyFans became a big deal. There were stories of girls making $50K - $100K a month. Girls becoming millionaires etc. I’m not hating on some girl who is a perfect 10 and benefitting from it. What I have noticed is on tinder, bumble, Instagram every girl promotes an onlyfans link or wants you to pay to talk to them.

Some of these girls are taking it too far. Charging guys to speak to them? Charging for Snapchat? Posting stuff like “Whose paying my phone bill?”

“Who wants to send me $40 for food?” “Who filling my gas tank up?”

I feel like this whole OF culture has average/basic girls thinking they can all be “adult film stars” making millions. I get a decent amount of matches on dating apps. Every single girl “haha that’s cool.. So I sell nudes and sex tapes!”

Every girl on Snapchat now advertises “don’t speak to me unless you’re buying!”

You can say it’s just the girls I’m talking to but seriously every girl on Instagram 18-25 is posting an ass pic. Boob pics. “Link in the bio”. Selling content. It’s become a normal thing.. 

I think it’s entirely ruining the idea of dating, getting married, having kids building a future together. It’s causing more women to cheat and chase money over a meaningful relationship. 

I’ve met a couple of girls who said they do OnlyFans full time. They are making a couple grand a year pre-taxes… Their boyfriend or husband is the one working and making all the money.  Full time and only making a couple grand?? For selling your nudes, sex tapes showing your face all over the internet?!"

1,2023-09-03,CMV: ADHD is over diagnosed and over medicated,u/Vivid_Papaya2422,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/169ffdy/cmv_adhd_is_over_diagnosed_and_over_medicated/,changemyview,"I’m starting out by saying I am not denying that ADHD exists. I 100% agree that some people have it, and many of those who do have it have real struggles and may need medication. I’m also referring to kids, especially under 8-10 being diagnosed. 

I’m mainly referring to many school aged kids who get diagnosed. While early intervention is key, what’s considered developmentally appropriate has a huge range up until about 3rd grade/8-9yo.

Many kids who are diagnosed at a young age are diagnosed because their attention span is low, and there’s little impulse control. By those definitions, you’re describing a young child. 

With ADHD, the diagnosis is based on what is developmentally appropriate. That being said, a first grader who is on the younger side, or younger maturity side will be very different from an older first grader. Developmentally, some may act like a younger Kindergartner, and some like an older second grader.

It’s this point where it’s hard to see if the kid is just a bit behind developmentally, or if they do have ADHD. Many times, the kid will get diagnosed.

There’s also the issue of medication. Some kids will do just fine on meds, while others lose their personality and become zombies. When teaching, the best parents of kids with ADHD would ask the teachers how they are doing on meds, as they typically die out after school.

Sometimes it’s a case of the med not being the best option or too high of a dose, but some kids are perfectly fine without meds. We had a kid who completely lost his personality (I’ll call him Joe). We let mom know we’d rather have hyperactive Joe with a personality than medicated Joe who was a Zombie. If his mom didn’t consult teachers, we’d have zombie Joe. Sadly, there are too many kids who are overmedicated with little personality, when there is something in between.

Is there a reason why so many kids are being diagnosed and why many appear overmedicated?"

It seems like only a minority of straight women are open to the idea of dating bi men, and even fewer will follow through with it. Admittedly, I base this through my own anecdotal observations in my life, but it seems to be supported even more through discussions I see online about it.

The common reasons I see women cite for not wanting to date bi men are usually the following:

""I'm insecure about having twice the competition.""

""I'm worried that he's actually just gay and not bisexual""

""I'm worried about AIDS/HIV.""

While these all seem like valid reasons on the surface, and some straight women may truthfully think this,I think for the majority of straight women they're all just red herrings to the actual truth of why they don't date bi men.

That truth being that straight women are sexually turned off by men who have had sexual relationships with other men in their past.

Why you may ask? I think it simply comes down to the fact that in most straight women's minds, the most feminine thing a guy could do is literally having sex with other men. Especially so if the man has bottomed for other men in the past.

The kicker about this situation though is that most straight women advocate very vocally in online spaces such as Twitter that straight men should be comfortable with their sexuality, and that being feminine doesn't make you gay.

They'll go as far as to say that straight men who are comfortable dressing feminine are hot. You'll see this all the time when a famous musician/actor where dresses, paint their nails, or wear make up. Women will praise the man for not being dressing like a stereotypical straight man, and for breaking boundaries in modern day toxic masculinity. 

I think it's for these reasons above that straight women will never openly admit their sexual repulsion with bi men. It contradicts so hardly with what they preach online that they would look like complete hypocrites. That's why the reasons they give for not dating bi men are the one's I quoted in the beginning. Those reasons are pretty illogical when you break them down. Like I said,  there all red herrings to distract from the actual truth."

But basically the Central Park 5 were exonerated because one of the many people that raped the jogger, claimed that he did it by himself.

That combined with the claims of the defense of a coerced confession is apparently enough to get u off?

Here’s all the evidence against the Central Park 5.

Semen, dirt, and grass stains that were found on Kevin Richardson's underwear (it was argued that the presence of semen on the crotch of his underwear was consistent with the confessions that they were unable to ejaculate while attempting to rape Trisha Meili). Semen stains were also found on Antron McCray's underwear and Raymond Santana's sweatshirt.
Mud was found caked on the front of Antron McCray's Calvin Klein jeans and hooded sweatshirt. The jogger was found with mud and dirt all over her body. Antron said that he fell in the mud while running from the police and then hid there.
Korey Wise had washed his clothes when he got home on the night of the attacks.
Blood stains were found on Raymond Santana's right sneaker, Yusef Salaam's jacket, and on Steve Lopez's underwear. The traces on Santana's sneaker and Salaam's jacket were too small to match to the blood types of the victims.
Korey Wise's friend's older sister, Melody Jackson, told investigators on the eve of the trial that Wise had confessed to her that he did not rape Trisha Meili but rather held and fondled her leg during the attack (Wise grabbing the victim's leg is in line with what both the surgeon and plastic surgeon observed at the hospital, red outlines of different-sized hand prints on her thighs and lower legs).
As officers were taking Clarence Thomas and Kevin Richardson to the precinct, Thomas began to cry and blurted out, ""I know who did the murder. I know where he lives and I'll tell you his name."" Richardson said that he knew as well and agreed to give them the name. Then Thomas said that it was Antron McCray. According to the officers, Richardson agreed and said, ""Yeah. That's who did it."" This was before the female jogger was found.
Detective Michael Sheehan reported that while he was transporting Raymond Santana from the Central Park Precinct to the 20th Precinct, Santana on his own said, ""I had nothing to do with the rape. All I did was feel the woman's t--s."" This was prior to the police knowing about the rape.
Yusef Salaam admitted to carrying a metal pipe during the evening and stated that he was holding onto it for someone else. Jogger John Loughlin, who was seriously injured, was beaten with a pipe.
During the booking process, Officer Robert Powers said that when he told the defendants they shouldn't be out beating people, but ""should be home with your girlfriends,"" Raymond Santana looked at a co-defendant, smiled, and remarked, ""I already got mines,"" after which they both laughed. The statement was inadmissible in court because it wasn't preceded by a waiver of Miranda rights.
When Korey (then Kharey) Wise visited the scene on April 20th with a detective and an assistant district attorney, he remarked, ""Damn, damn that's a lot of blood. Damn, this is really bad, that’s a lot of blood.... I knew she was bleeding, but I didn't know how bad she was. It was really dark. I couldn't see how much blood there was at night.""
On April 20th, the day after the assault on Trisha Meili, Kevin Richardson and Raymond Santana supposedly each pointed out the location where the attack occurred. Detectives quoted Richardson as saying, ""This is where we got her ... where the raping occurred.""
Two of Korey Wise's friends, Ronald Williams and Shabazz Head, told the police that when they encountered Wise on April 20, 1989, he told them, ""You heard about that woman that was beat up and raped in the park last night. That was us!""
Dennis Commedo, a boy who was part of the larger group in the park that night, reportedly told police that when he encountered Kevin Richardson in a ball field in the park, Richardson told him, ""We just raped somebody.""
Two teens who were part of the larger group said that they saw Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Steven Lopez, Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, and others coming over the hill from the 102nd Street transverse, the direction where the rape occurred.
When talking about first seeing the female jogger in his confession, Antron McCray said, ""We didn't think it was a lady at first when we seen her. She looked like a man."" That description is exactly what the two men who found her lying in the ravine four hours later told the police, that they thought she looked like a man. The confusion was due to her slender build and short hair. This connection is important because it's a detail that is far less likely to have been coerced.
Statements given by a number of other teens named the five as participating with them in other assaults in the park.
When Matias Reyes confessed in 2002, he revealed something that the police had not known initially. He said that he had stolen Trisha Meili's fanny pack and Walkman, which had not been found at the scene. Yet, in notes from an interview with Korey Wise on April 20, 1989, the day after the attack, Wise said that a guy named ""Rudy"" took Meili's ""Walkman pouch"" and Walkman. Investigators believed that Wise, who is hard of hearing, had gotten Reyes' name wrong and thought it was Rudy.
A former inmate-acquaintance of Matias Reyes claimed that Reyes told him that the attack on the jogger was already happening when he joined, attracted to the location by the jogger's screams.
The Armstrong Report concluded that ""the most likely scenario for the events of April 19, 1989 was that the defendants came up on the jogger and subjected her to the same kind of attack, albeit with sexual overtones, that they inflicted upon other victims in the park that night. Perhaps attracted to the scene by the jogger's screams, Reyes either joined in the attack as it was ending or waited until the defendants had moved on to their next victims before descending upon her himself, raping her and inflicting upon her the brutal injuries that almost caused her death."" 



But apparently as long as your lawyer said “my clients confession was coerced” you’re good to go. 

To me it’s basically an OJ Simpson situation. The law can fail us. And this is another case of it. Sadly these Goya are multimillionaires now and have memorials of them in Central Park.

Between that and the fact that any somewhat competent developers would store the passwords as an encrypted hash, they're secure enough.

SMS based authentication codes can easily be SIM-spoofed and cause a false sense of security, leading users to create less than secure passwords.Email based authentication does the same thing and anybody with access to your email have the holy grail to your accounts.

Using an authenticator on the other hand locks users out of their account way more often and provides more of a back door for multiple reasons. The first being is that when you set an authenticator up, you are provided a recovery code. This is meant to be a hard copy, stored somewhere once printed out. Between the people who will never do that, the unorganized people who will lose it, the others who will have it stolen by somebody else in the household or people who know where it is, etc, that recovery code can easily be lost and once it's gone, it's gone.

The authenticator itself is hardware based, which means if that phone is lost, stolen, replaced, whatever, it's the same story. Even if you can get back into the account, you now have to go through the entire process again to set up the new phone. Backups are iffy at best.

Which leads to the last point - you cannot even use just one authentication app! Each developer uses their own with little to no capability with others. Steam is really notorious for this. So now you need 100 apps on your phone just for all of your accounts.

Basically for the average person, nothing more than a good, strong password is needed."

The Netflix show when they see is basically all fiction. But basically the Central Park 5 were exonerated because one of the many people that raped the jogger, claimed that he did it by himself.

That combined with the claims of the defense of a coerced confession is apparently enough to get u off?

Here’s all the evidence against the Central Park 5.

Many of the kids had semen stains on their clothes form that night. As well as mud and blood.

Korey Wise had washed his clothes when he got home on the night of the attacks.

Korey Wise's friend's older sister told investigators on the eve of the trial that Wise had confessed to her that he fondled Trisha’s (the victims) leg during the attack (which was consistent with the doctors accounts of the victims body).

Santana while being transported said, ""I had nothing to do with the rape. All I did was feel the woman's t--s."" This was prior to the police knowing about the rape.

and then that thought extended to all slurs. it made me think about how the word “queer” used to be a homophobic slur, and now today, it’s turned into something people identify themselves with and it lost all of its power. it took a long time to do that, but i think the effort was worth it. there are definitely some that will never turn into an identity, and that’s okay.  but why let bigoted people have such an easy way to upset you?"
1,2023-09-04,"CMV: ChatGPT, LLMs in general and other AI warrant a change to our economic model in some capacity.",u/ExtensionOfWill,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/169p2qs/cmv_chatgpt_llms_in_general_and_other_ai_warrant/,changemyview," AI such as ChatGPT, potentially can change the workforce in a negative way, and it is kinda frustrating how we aren't taking it that seriously.  
  
I mean, look at some tech, right? Once it gets going and is proven not to be a fad, it gets better. But here's the thing, so many people out there seem to be just fixated on what AI like ChatGPT can't do today. They're all like, ""Oh, it's not that great,"" or ""It's trash.""  Which is kind of frustrating for me cause it's like seeing a car crash in slow mo.

  
Let's not forget that tons of other technologies started out kind of shoddy and then they became more and more refined until they were feasible to mass produce and utilize for the purposes they were dreamt up for in the first place. Think about cars, planes, computers, and tons of other technologies. They didn't start off perfect but became decent and still today improvements are being made. Imagine if we did that to other technologies, just looked at their shoddy and rough flawed beginnings and went ""Nope, lets drop it"" We definitely would not have the world we have today.  
  
So why are we downplaying the potential of AI? Why are we not looking at what it could become? Take Google's Med-PaLM 2 model, for example. They want to use it in the medical industry, and they clearly see the potential. I mean, take ChatGPT4 which is a step up from ChatGPT3, OpenAI also gets that LLMs could be better and even more useful. 

Again, ChatGPT and LLMs could be another hyped fad of sorts but we don't know that till we know it. There is no reason to believe that it can't affect many many industries in due time, even physically oriented ones such as laborers or plumbers or electricians and the like. OpenAI partnered with 1X which were previously called Halodi Robotics who seem to be focused on humanoid robots that would be capable of assisting humans with physical tasks. Google unveiled a new robot called RT-2 recently which suggests that they are looking to embody LLMs or AIs in the future.  The mere existence of ChatGPT4 from ChatGPT3 seems to suggest that the software and hardware behind this technology will become refined and it will one day be capable of giving better medical advice, program better, write better, ""lawyer"" better, have less hallucinations, have better memory and be able to assist with more nicher topics such as pepper farming or something.  
  
And yes, it could be that AI doesn't get good enough to affect us in our lifetime but we should still take it seriously and advocate for change for the sake of future generations just in case rather than frustratingly focus on its flaws and shortcomings and therefore think it won't negatively change our lives.

I understand that some people see it the way I do and I am not saying we should start to panic and stuff but it just personally feels that I hear more people talking about how AIs like ChatGPT aren't going to become more refined to a point that they replace us and make us obsolete, they don't seem to realize we are in the early beginnings of LLMs and they seem to be here to stay. I also want to clarify I am not here to discuss whether or not ChatGPT ""knows"" or not, for me that is irrelevant, I am good as long as it gives out the scripts or IT information I need it to accurately even if it doesn't know what it is outputting.

I think Elden Ring lore is too vague in game and this harms the experience. Morgott is such a cool character to be fighting, and Godfrey the grafted too, but that entire castle sequence gets reduced to basically a super Mario level because nobody has any clue who either boss is in the castle until ages after completing it on a first playthrough.

I had no clue who Mohg was during the first fight.

You can get information talking to people, but I really think the vagueness of the plot does not suit Elden Ring. Elden Ring effectively has no themes because the plot is so vague.

It gets better later on but I'm 100% convinced it would be better if things were spelled out to you more.

Also I don't like item description storytelling since I have no clue how the character is supposed to know these things. Is the narrator of the descriptions just omniscient?"

When politicians can knowingly lie without fear of consequences it creates a rift on uncertainty and inherent mistrust between the Civil Servant and the people they represent.

I believe that a sworn in Politician who at any time they are acting in an official capacity should be subject to perjury charges if it can be shown that they knowingly lied.

My first thought regarding this is freedom of speech of the politician, however there is already a precedent for temporary removal of that right with members of the Armed Forces, so I don't see why Politicians can't have a similar requirement.

""United States v. Caldwell, 75 M.J. 276 (in the context of freedom of speech in the military, servicemembers do not possess the same broad rights of expression that civilians enjoy; this principle holds true even in regard to interactions between superiors and subordinates).""

I don't think this can be applied to Canidates prior to being sworn in as they haven't yet made an Oath of Office.

I also acknowledge that there are members of Congress, the President, etc who have access to sensitive information that shouldn't be exposed to the public. Under this system, ""I'm not at liberty to discuss that. Would have to become a much more common response."

But more importantly, the theme of the movie is about how the American public are easily distracted and manipulated by media imagery, and about how an outside, foreign threat to the nation can be concocted and utilised by powerful people to brush issues at home under the rug, which is more relevant now than it has ever been with the state of politics and utilisation of 'fake news' and social media.

As an actor, Slattery personifies the media, and is used by the real villain to draw the public's attention towards foreign threats, when the bomb attacks were actually internal. The fact that the movie audience were so opposed to this twist sort of works on an extra level, as it suggests they would have been far happier with Iron Man fighting a horrible Chinese stereotype, much as the public in the movie are more comfortable accepting that lie over the truth."

But if you believe in Trump’s message so fervently that you’d deck yourself out in Trump/MAGA iconography, it’s more likely than not that you’re probably a dickhead who believes in the worst, most emotive parts of his message. 

Many republicans/independents voted for him the past two elections either because he was the closest one to their position, not necessarily because they liked him. More of an anti-Democrat, pro-Republican vote than a pro-Trump vote.  If you’re sporting the red hat, or the bumper sticker, or have the flag pinned up somewhere though, it likely indicates that you’re a fan of the man himself, and by extension the more venomous elements of his platform (rabid anti-immigration in particular), rather than just lowering taxes. 

Totally open to changing my mind on this - I know that probably the counter-evidence would be anecdotal in nature and that’s fine (seeing as how my argument is based on anecdotal evidence as well - ive yet to come across a MAGA-branded person who, accounting for my own bias, wasnt a prickly cunt).

It’s not good enough, though, to just say “My dad is a good man and he loves Trump and wears the hat” - many racists/assholes/fuckheads are great with their family and neighbours. You’d have to show that they wear that shit *and* don’t subscribe to the shittiest parts of Trumpworld (I suppose you can try to argue that supporting something like family separations doesn’t make you an asshole, but I would disagree).

Isn't that just gunboat progressivism? Like say you want to change the system from the inside out, but all you've done is just made internal policies more rainbow friendly. Like that doesn't change the black ops/neo-colonial interference/excessive collateral damage, etc.  
Does a family deserve to be killed by a drone attack because the operator happens to be gay? If progressivists commonly say ACAB because of a broken system, then why not ASAB? Why should progressives take part in the military-industrial complex? What right do you have to indefinitely occupy another country or conduct black ops somewhere you don't belong? Are you going to shoot people into supporting leftist ideals? It's been proven that you can't forcibly convert the Middle East into a democracy and you're not going to bomb the Islamic world into being LGBT friendly overnight.  
And I'm not excusing the Taliban or ISIS either. Their hyper-theocratic ideology is abhorrent as is their atrocities, way they abuse women and children, etc. I also understand they intentionally use human shields and brainwash children but I also think the US was pretty reckless with excessive bombing and drone attacks. Do we need a classified CIA kill list? No we don't. Do we need a CIA at all? No we don't. Does it make sense for progressives to support any of this? No it doesn't.  
""So you only want the military to be made up of hyper-conservative warmongers?""  
Quite the opposite. I've been reading that elements of the right have actually gotten pretty isolationist and I'm not sure I disagree. Why should the US be the world's police? Isn't that neocolonialism? Why would progressives of all people spearhead this?  
""What about Russian and China?""  
What about them? Does occupying the Middle East for 20 years have anything to do with Russia and China? Are the shady things the US military does such as drones/assassinations/domestic spying/torture good because Russia and China are worse?  
What really perplexes me is why LGBT/progressive service members are upset about LGBT domestic policies? Why is you have the right to marry/gender-affirmation/etc. more important than some impoverished family in the Middle East staying alive? You don't get to sit behind a rifle or plane and shoot at people and then say you're oppressed? You can't get mad at mean old Pastor Bob or whoever not being LGBT affirming after playing gunboat diplomat/stormtrooper.

I have also been involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. I was also administered medication against my will because of my severe mental health issues. This bothers me because these medications cause nasty side effects and psychiatrists, PAs, and NPs have the nerve to gaslight patients into taking their medication. Gaslighting is a separate topic but ties into this. Apparently doctors can gaslight psychiatric patients into taking medications by saying...

&#x200B;

>You're mentally ill. You think the medications are poisonous and you are agitated. This proves that you are mentally ill and cannot think rationally to make your own decisions about medication.

Therapists also gaslight their patients but again, this is a separate issue. The idea that you can be given medication whether you like it or not is bothersome. There always need to be informed consent to treatment. Coercion and force is an abuse of power that makes patients distrustful towards their healthcare providers. We don't advocate for coercion or force when it comes to sex, then why not medication treatment? 

Psychiatrists also threaten patients into an *alternative outpatient treatment center* to ensure compliance. This again is bothersome since a patient should have the right to refuse any treatment, especially in outpatient settings. Why do we have court ordered mandates and alternative outpatient treatment centers for psychiatry but not other disciplines?

When I got the ID from my home commonwealth, I had to have two forms of ID (at the time birth certificate and SSID card) so idk what the point of it is other than forcing me to pay more money for something I already have, and was a perfectly okay form of ID for air travel before a decision was arbitrarily made to say otherwise.

I am open to changing my view on the off chance I am viewing this from the wrong angle.

After the civil war started, it became a fractured country that produced millions of refugees. While there are many reasons why this war happened, the West's role in supporting the Syrian rebels is a major factor. One can argue that this support was motivated by a desire to remove an oppressive regime and facilitate democracy. But, assuming that this was indeed the motivation rather than replacing Assad with a pro-Western client government, it would still be problematic. The two main reasons why are that a. the Syrian rebels' commitment to liberal democracy is highly debatable and b.  the West's track record in Middle Eastern regime change is not very good. 

It is easy to imagine that the Syrian rebels were all good freedom fighters facing off against the evil dictator Assad but reality doesn't back this fantasy. Yes there was a secular movement called the Free Syrian Army that wanted liberal democracy in theory at least but plenty of other Syrian rebel groups were jihadists who wanted to turn Syria into a strict sharia state. To make matters more complicated, the secular rebels and the jihadist rebels often fought alongside each other, making it hard to distinguish between the two. So, by aiding the Syrian rebels, the West was in effect helping out jihadists, many of whom were affiliated with Al-Qaeda. If the Assad regime had collapsed, there would have most likely either been a strict sharia state in its place or another civil war, this time between the secular and the jihadist forces. 

In addition to what was stated above, support for the Syrian rebels was a bad idea because recent history shows that Middle Eastern regime change doesn't work out very well. Take Libya for instance! The country originally experienced a civil war between the Gaddafi regime and motley of rebel groups. Did the Western-backed rebel victory over Gaddafi result in the creation of a stable democratic Libya? The answer is no. In a short time, the country experienced a civil war between Islamist and secular factions that had previously fought against Gaddafi. If overthrowing a dictator who ruled over a relatively small population resulted in this mess (I am referring to Libya here), why would overthrowing a dictator who ruled over a much larger and more diverse population result in something better? 

I realize that this view of mine is controversial. If there is anything I am missing or if I am completely wrong, I would like to be corrected. I am, after all, just someone who has an interest in foreign policy, not a foreign policy expert. "

Trust matters more than the reason we're in relationships.  Do we trust the person we're with?  While it might, on the surface, seem shallow, both stereotypes are sometimes more successful and I don't find either offensive, although I would choose different reasons to be with someone.

From Wikipedia: Antinatalism or anti-natalism is the philosophical position that assigns a negative value judgement to birth and views procreation as immoral. Antinatalists thus argue that humans should abstain from procreating.

Here is my argument for Antinatalism:

p1. Humans are born without consent

p2. There is pain and suffering

p3. Pain and suffering that is inflicted on an individual without consent that could be otherwise be avoided is immoral

p4. there is no pain and suffering that is inflicted on an individual in *not* procreating 

C. procreation is immoral

Some common counterarguments: Pleasure can outweigh the pain and suffering, thus procreation is not *necessarily* immoral. However, this objection fails because my argument does not mention pleasure at all. Yes, it is true that pleasure can outweigh pain and suffering, but that doesn't change the fact that pain and suffering inflicted on an individual without consent is immoral. Further, pleasure is not guaranteed so procreation is a gamble without their consent of their life's suffering. 

I would change my view if you could show that procreation is not immoral.

Lastly, I feel as though I should mention that I'm not depressed or suicidal, much to the contrary. Thank you."

In 2021, I believed gender was socially constructed, and therefore can and should be deconstructed in ways that groups find appropriate. That changed in 2022 when I did a thought experiment: I conceived of a world where gender was abolished, and asked myself if gender dysphoria would still exist. The answer I came to is that it would have to.

Hormone replacement therapy does wonders to alleviate dyphoria and improve the lives of trans people, that can't be the result of gender roles. Social factors also can't explain why trans people experience body dysphoria. I realized that gender dysphoria isn't the result of gender roles, but an endocrine mismatch aggravated by social factors.

Where does this leave non-binary people? The answer is nowhere. Non-binary people don't make any sense, especially when you consider there is no gender neutral / in-between sex hormone. Under what I believe to be the only logical definition of gender dysphoria, they cannot exist.

So, either give me a better working definition of gender dysphoria, or convince me how non-binary people can exist under my present one.

And because this sub is particular about OP responding, I want to lay out some ground rules:
-Please engage with my arguments. If you think social factors are the sole source of gender dysphoria, please explain why sex hormones help trans people even in a vacuum.
-If you are Intersex, your endocrine system is still going to produce one sex hormone over another.
-If you're non-binary and your argument is ""well I exist"", I don't care. This is harsh, but bear in mind I think you're either lying to yourself or are delusional. I'd support you if you were my friend, but that's not this thread's point.

1,2023-09-04,CMV: In the US if drag shows can be banned then so can public Nazi rallies (and the like),u/kloogmeister,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16a9w9n/cmv_in_the_us_if_drag_shows_can_be_banned_then_so/,changemyview,"This doesn't have be political discussion but some people have created laws or proposed laws to ban drag shows  in different levels. For example, complete bans, banning children from coming, banning them from occurring in certain locations  (usually where kids are like schools). Also this discussion is related to US law

Establishing facts:

\- The 1st amendment prevents the government making laws restricting speech, expression, etc., The amendment doesn't specify exceptions

\- A public Nazi rally and a drag show are both forms of speech and expression. 

\- Courts have allowed many exceptions to the first amendment. Though unrelated to this debate in some places profanity in public is not allowed, loud music after a certain time, etc. The exceptions are seem to be based on protecting the public from ""harm"" to some subjective level.

\- Public Nazi rallies create hate which creates fear for some portion of the groups the hate is directed against and their supporters.  That fear could be physical harm but also just creating large amounts of stress.

\- People of all ages, including children, can witness a public Nazi rally unintentionally. They were outside Disney World in Florida one day.

\- Some proposed or implemented bans on drag shows that weren't limited to a location or if the drag show was sexual. (showing that the bar for ""harm"" is lower than you might think)

\- Children with a parent can be taken to R rated movies. R rated movies can contain exposed breasts, butts, and graphic sex scenes (limited to exposing what I just mentioned. Movies can also contain large amounts of violence.  Some examples:  Showgirls, Secretary (yumm Maggie Gyllenhaal), Body Heat, and Eyes Wide Shut.

Opinion:

Since these bans on drag shows were done with the claim of protecting children why couldn't the same justification be used to ban public Nazi rallies. 

The harm to children claim doesn't appear to require proof, especially for non-adult drag shows. In other words no one showed a study or medical evidence that a child viewing a drag show is harmful. Because of that common sense (hate creates fear, fear is harmful) should be enough to claim Nazi rallies should be banned to protect children.

Argument notes:

\- I know some of these laws have been found unconstitutional or are being challenged. Even if that's the case there are other situations of moral harm that are restricted to protect children related to obscenity. 

\- Just in case I didn't say it this applies to public Nazi rallies, that is anywhere where a child might be present unintentionally (ex. recent Florida Nazi rallies that were outside Disney World)

Bonus opinions:

\- ""Sexualizing children"" is vague. Many children well below 18 are aware of what sex is. I don't think children being exposed to sex that dangerous alone because the problem is knowing it's wrong to be taken advantage of.  Groomers take advantage of children by exposing to sexual content and normalizing it with children. If a child has early sex education and knows what's wrong and not to be taken advantage they are safer than those without sex education.

\- There's obviously an obsession with restricting obscene material in the US that is related to religious moral values. The government shouldn't use religious values to make laws UNLESS you can prove harm to some sufficient level."

This is evident in the story of Cinderella, which, as we all know, Disney made into a now-classic movie in 1950. In it, Cinderella's glass slipper fits her perfectly but is too small for her ""ugly"" stepsisters, who both have comically large feet. If Cinderella was the only girl who fit the slipper, she must have the smallest feet in the whole kingdom, and therefore be the most beautiful woman.

These days, most men don't care about the size of a women's feet. Indeed, there are legions of female celebrities with size 11 feet who are considered to be extremely attractive: Maria Sharapova, Nicole Kidman, Jessica Biel, and so on. Yet, the story of Cinderella, especially Disney's version of the story, is still a cultural icon.

To counter this, I think Disney should create a princess (or at least a female lead) with a shoe size of 10 or higher, and make it a major plot point (like maybe she has trouble finding her size in a shoe store). But this character should still be considered beautiful by other characters. This will hammer the final nail into the coffin of the idea that small-footed women are ""more beautiful"" than large-footed women."

This way, every purchase of imported goods causes money to leave the Russian economy, and never re-enter it. This seems far better than Russians circulating their money through the Russian economy.

This also gives an avenue for anti-war Russians to both survive and avoid financing the war. If they stick to imported goods, they can survive while ensuring their spending does not fund the war.

Of course, Russia might consider this and stop foreign imports. This is still an upside, since currently, Russia can blame the lack of imported goods on the Evil West and their sanctions. However, if it's the Russian state that is the one preventing Russians from purchasing foreign goods, then they cannot as easily blame the West. Now, *they're* the bad guys, and this will reduce public support.

Thus, sanctions would be more effective if they allowed Russians to purchase imported consumer goods."

As someone who has spent the last 3 years following reddit, the markets and news, I have witnessed firsthand the alarming activities of hedge funds and banks that pose a significant risk to our financial world.   
  
The Glass-Steagall Act served as a crucial safeguard against excessive risk-taking by banks. By separating commercial banking from investment banking, it prevented banks from engaging in speculative activities that could endanger depositors' funds. However, its repeal has allowed banks to enter into risky ventures such as hedge funds without adequate oversight.  
  
One of the most concerning aspects of this repeal is that hedge funds are exempt from anti-money laundering rules set forth in the Patriot Act. This exemption creates an environment where illicit financial activities can thrive unchecked, posing serious threats to our national security and economic stability.

The recent history of JPMorgan Chase serves as a stark reminder of why reinstating Glass-Steagall is imperative. JPMorgan's ""too big to fail"" status has shielded it from prosecution for its involvement in various scandals and illegal practices. This lack of accountability not only undermines public trust but also perpetuates a dangerous moral hazard within these powerful institutions.

The concentration of wealth among a few powerful entities exacerbates social inequality and threatens our democratic principles. Reinstating Glass-Steagall would help restore integrity to our markets by curbing excessive risk-taking and preventing further consolidation of power within these institutions.

I see it reaching 1 trillion in GDP adjusted for inflation in less than a hundrer years (given that it would need to multiply fivefold to achieve this). Even if we don't exactly reach this number,  with these tyoes of incentives and reforms, we could jumpstart economic growth. 


Of course in industries such as car making or other high-end industries, we won't be able to play a big part, given that we are already 10 years behing in tech.

Every gun has a serial number. 
Every sale of a gun either has to be through a licensed dealer or facilitated by a licensed dealer or some office similar to a DMV.  It could be an existing office like at a police station, or a new office.  
All the sales would have some minimal fee added to them to cover the cost of them running background checks and confirming the buyer and seller are who they claim they are, and the seller is the currently registered owner of the weapon.

Any gun found on an arrested suspect or any time a police officer has justifiable cause for handling a weapon, can be checked in the database to confirm that it is registered and that the person in possession is the registered owner.  If they are not, they can trace back who the last registered owner is, and determine how the gun changed hands.

If it was an illegal transfer, there could be very harsh penalties for that.  This would make it far easier to convict criminals who carry unregistered guns, to trace back ownership of guns abandoned after a crime, and overall minimize the number of guns in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them.

When police are planning a raid, they at least have a starting point of what guns the people they are going after have, and if they have other guns on them, it’s once again an easy conviction even if they manage to flush drugs or destroy other evidence.  

The most common opposition I have heard is that a registry is one step before a confiscation, but I don’t accept that because a confiscation 100% does not need a registry to be effective.  If the government decided to confiscate all the guns, they simply need to pass laws making any possession of any guns a serious felony with decades of prison time or worse.

Whether they like it or not, the vast majority of gun owners would hand over their guns as they wouldn’t want to risk prison time, leaving their children orphaned, losing their job and home etc.  I’m not saying this should happen, just that a registry is unnecessary for confiscation."

There is no benefit whatsoever in having an opinion that does not affect yourself or the people in your circle because that just trivializes issues. Something that affects one group of people in a society should be the ones to talk about it, not some ill-informed virtue signalling fuck who thinks they have the right to have an opinion on anything just because they have ""a platform"".

All these causes, the supposition that someone should ""take a stand"" because ""silence is violence"" is just a way for people to shove moralistic bullshit down your throat. It would be better if most people just stay in their lanes and stuck to what they know. Spend time thinking about issues that affect you and your own community whilst ignoring the rest and letting others sort out their own issues. It's better to be good at tackling a small number of issues that are right in front of you in plain sight, rather than trying to balance dozens of other issues poorly because they're outside your range.

All the ""support this thing or you're hateful"" is just worthless symbolism that achieves nothing.

1,2023-09-05,CMV: Animals are not necessarily happier in the wild than in captivity.,u/ChampionOfBaiting,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16asuic/cmv_animals_are_not_necessarily_happier_in_the/,changemyview,"I don't believe this is true in every individual case, of course. But the idea that an animal would definitely be happier in the wild than in a zoo never sat right with me.

You can absolutely find cases of horrific cruelty inflicted on animals in captivity. I'm willing to bet however that for every one of those cases, there's a hundred animals torn to shreds by a predator, or a young animal slowly starving to death after its mother died.

I think that, for the most part, animals in zoos are significantly happier than their cousins in the wild. For example, animals in zoos are much less likely to starve to death. They are less likely to be killed by a predator or competitor. If they have an illness, they are more likely to get treatment. This should go without saying, but animals in captivity live significantly longer than they do in the wilderness. Lions, for example, regularly live to be over 20 in captivity but rarely reach over 16 in the wild. Male lions in the wild rarely survive past the age of 10.

Animal rights activists say things like ""animals are meant to be in the wild"". Yeah, but so are humans. We are still evolved to live in small tribes in the wilderness, yet outside of some rugged survivordudes, you don't see any of us striving to leave civilization to live in a hut made of leaves for the rest of our lives.

If you asked the average person if they'd rather live the rest of their life in the wilderness without any modern amenities or in a prison, They would probably choose the prison. In a prison you get three meals a day without hunting for it, you aren't at risk of freezing to death in winter, and you don't need to worry whether a cut on your leg will kill you. And while not impossible in prison, being killed by another animal is fairly likely in the wild (depending on where exactly you are).

Again, I'm sure that there's cases where animals are treated horribly in captivity. I don't believe however that these examples outweigh the kind of shit that goes on in the wild in number nor scale.

So the draft shown is just that - a draft that was overruled and disregarded.

So if it takes more than about half an hour or so for someone to post a source refuting whatever meme or snippet of information has been posted, anyone presenting the proper context after the fact has little chance of it being seen, as other posts that heap onto the original outrage will already be so heavily upvoted that everything else gets buried.

It would be safer and more convenient for everyone if cyclists were legally allowed to proceed slowly and cautiously through intersections during the pedestrian phase, yielding to pedestrians. That is, treating every intersection as a shared path for cyclists during the pedestrian phase of a crossing. 

  
**For cyclists**  
This is the most obvious area of benefit, since it's clearly more convenient to not have to stop as much. But it would also be safer, since taking off from intersections is a point of conflict with cars -- cars accelerate much faster than bicycles, and often drivers will close-pass cyclists as they come out of intersections, or follow aggressively and dangerously close out of apparent frustration.   
**For drivers**  
Allowing cyclists to exit the intersection before cars removes the abovementioned conflict point, allowing drivers to take off more quickly from the intersection themselves. If cyclists end up not having to stop at all, they will probably be far ahead of the intersection when the cars catch up, and will be more likely to be in a place where they can be passed more safely, or even be back up to cruising speed with the traffic, if in a low-speed zone to begin with.   
**For pedestrians**  
It's a problem in a lot of cities that some cyclists will run through red lights and frighten pedestrians who are crossing at the time. This behaviour is dangerous because it is *reckless*, and also because the cyclist's presence is *unexpected*. If it were made legal and well-publicised that cyclists were allowed to treat pedestrian crossings during the pedestrian phase as a shared path, and that they must yield to pedestrians in them, then their presence would no longer be unexpected. They would also, if abiding by the rules of the road, be *yielding to pedestrians*. Who would expect this yielding and would just have the same kinds of non-verbal space-negotiating communication with crossing cyclists that they have with each other and with cyclists on any other shared path.   
It's certainly true that some jerks would still just bomb through crossings and fail to yield to pedestrians, but this kind of behaviour is *already* prohibited under laws against reckless cycling. Legalising a safe alternative to the same behaviour is not an endorsement of this recklessness, and would in fact just highlight the antisocial nature of it.   
This change in the law would make the roads safer for everyone, and considerably more convenient for both cyclists and drivers. I suspect the only reason it is not currently allowed is because of the perceived unfairness of letting cyclists go through intersections on the road when cars can't, but that kind of spiteful adherence to ""fairness"" for its own sake is not a reason to maintain an illogical rule, especially one that promotes a false equality over a smoother equity.

As she passed a guy the dog tried to jump at him, and the guy got scared and told the lady ""you need to train your dog"". She then plays a montage of the dog doing tricks in a private yard and at the end has the caption ""don't judge other people on their training journey when you don't know"". I went to the comments and it was insanity with a bunch of people acting like she was a hero and the guy was a villian with some comments like ""I tell people it's a drug sniffing dog so they must have some on them"" or ""My dog can spot creeps"". A lot of the comments where saying it's not being 'aggressive' it's being 'reactive' and people need to tell the difference and chill out. Along with that I looked at the page and this is something the dog has done multiple times.

There was another video where a lady was 'training' her dog by taking it out into public. She sat in the middle of a busy walkway and people were walking past. I guess her dog didn't like other dogs so when someone was walking by with a dog she'd say, please give us some room. Both these people are so called 'dog trainers'.

But to me it doesn't matter whether your dog is being 'aggressive' or 'reactive'. The only person that matters to is the owner because to everyone else who doesn't know your dog, it's lunging at them. If they were to harm the dog as a result of that they would be completely justified. As well, if they have a dog, your dog lunges at them and they get attacked that's your fault. When you're in a public place, other people's sense of safety will ALWAYS take precedence over your dog regardless of if they're 'just being reactive'. Your responsibility is to train your dog to where things like this NEVER happen and if you just can't get to that point then it's your responsibility to avoid situations where it can happen.  In response to the previous comments, even if your dog is a 'drug sniffing dog' and someone has drugs on them, or if you dog can 'spot creeps' and it thinks someone is creepy, there's no excuse for it to lunge if they're minding their business.

Biden actually won the Presidency by quite narrow margins in a few states. MOST IMPORTANTLY: That victory came in a time when the polls had Biden firmly ahead of Trump. 

Now that Biden also has approvals in the toilet, why would anyone be confident he will win again? Democratic voters are famously more fickle than Republican ones. Most of the GOP is behind Trump and think 2020 was completely fraudulent. I have a hard time seeing most GOP voters who dislike Trump or looking for other options would vote for Biden instead. 

The democrats right now seem to be making a lot of the same mistakes as 2016

>“But Trump is such a dumpster fire rn”

True. That being said, he almost always has been. Sitting back and banking everything on the GOP being just too gross to win on the national level has been a very inconsistent strategy at best. 

>2022 midterms 

This is one time where that worked. The GOP put forth an unusually high number of abysmal candidates for one, but we all know the main factor for the upset was the Dobbs decision. 

I think this produces the exact kind of hazard the post Reagan democrats always fall for. Their MO is doing the bare minimum for struggling people and hoping that their West Wing brand of seeming like the competent, well meaning politicians who play by the rules will carry them the rest of the way because the others guys are just so obviously sinister and ohh so *hypocritical* 

I think it’s reckless to assume that Dobbs will continue to hard carry as much as it did in the midterms, especially since abortion continues to win everywhere. 

However, I think the worst omen for Biden’s re-election is the Democratic line on the economy. No matter how good (or at least better than Trump) some of the numbers are on paper, it’s clearly not translating to a higher approval rating. Go to mainstream partisan democrat sources such as the Pod Save or reddit’s front page and you’ll see people complaining that people aren’t as happy as they ought to be for Bidenomics. 

This strikes me as such a repeat of the “America is already great” slogan of the Hilary campaign. It’s disconnected from the real sense of crisis that young and working class people have. Perhaps candidates likes Trump and DeSantis deeply disgust suburban women enough for Democrats to scrape by anyway- but that’s still a gamble. 

2 other things to consider: 3rd party support will definitely eat more from Biden, especially if the GOP nominee isn’t Trump. If the GOP nominee is someone that isn’t odiously far right, like Haley, then it’s definitely GG low diff for Joe."

""In substantiated ch1ld abuse cases, 77% of ch1ldren were victimized by a parent.""
If your husband beats you or abuses you, you can call the cops, get a lawyer and sue your husband. However, children cannot do that. Children are not allowed to represent themselves in court, and need to be represented by their parents. In this case, they would need to be represented by their own abusers (parents). Children are not legally allowed to divorce their parents.
With your husband, at least you can choose him; but children are not given that privilege, they are forced to be under the control of someone they did not choose.
On top of that, increasing the fertility rate is seen as a ""good"" thing by some people, as if there aren't enough abused ch1ldren already."
1,2023-09-06,CMV: Tattoos are not a waste of money.,u/Secure_Sprinkles4483,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16bai68/cmv_tattoos_are_not_a_waste_of_money/,changemyview,"TL;DR. The value of a tattoo is deeply personal making it a worthy investment for one who views it as such. Just like beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so too is worth in the eye of the spender.

When tattoos are being called into question, nothing is more substantive evidence for their worth than subjectivity. Those who find meaning or beauty in tattoos will find them very worthy investments. For me, the act of getting a tattoo is deeply powerful experience, resonating on a personal level not to be understood by anyone else. This one-of-a-kind, tailor-made, uniquely individual quality makes every single tattoo worth every single penny.

But wait. How about that whole permanent aspect? Sure, that could be a negative quality but that’s when subjectivity comes back into the ball game. Longevity is usually my initial go-to comeback like “well it’s not going anywhere” fake smile or “name a better long-term investment cost per year” unlike most every other thing we spend money on, a tattoo is literally lifelong. When looked at as a long-term investment, the cost per year can seem quite reasonable.

The whole tattooing process is a very very personal experience and, much like snowflakes, no two tattoos are alike. There might be 5 million koi fish tattoos but it’s guaranteed that you will not two identical fish in both appearance and meaning. Even if by some freak chance you find two visually identical koi tattoos, their significance would be completely different from one individual to the next.

&#x200B;

Let's end with pointing out that a tattoo’s worth is only of interest for the individual who chooses it. As such, this individual has zero need nor obligation to explain their reasons behind their choice of self-expression. However, some people just can’t help to voice their negative opinions. Which is what brings me here to voice my own opinion to which I challenge to be changed. Until then, just let them go on and think that you’re just “throwing money away” while you get [tat tat tatted up like D4L and Fabo back in 07](https://youtu.be/x6xUWa9g7-Q?feature=shared&t=49)"

 When it comes to dating as a short guy, people act like short guys who’ve never had relationships til say their late 20s or early 30s were in that position because of their personality and complexes associated with being short. In reality, it’s much more likely that they haven’t found love because…they’re short. We gaslight short men into thinking they have bad personalities when in fact they’re just unattractive. 

Unattractiveness in general isn’t some excuse to be an incel or act entitled to sex, but, at the same time, we shouldn’t look at dateless short men and assume it’s anything other than their height unless we have reason to."

The bottom line is that the vast majority of homeless people prefer living on the streets, unregulated and free to do drugs rather than being put in a homeless shelter or transitional housing where there are rules, curfews, and structure. The homeless shelters in my city are short term, so while people are staying there, workers are helping them get set up with food stamps, getting a valid ID, applying for financial assistance, providing them bus passes, etc. Utilizing these resources and implementing them require a person to actually *want* to be helped, and wanting a better life for themselves. I work with the mental health dept that targets homeless individuals and, I’d say about 80% of them just want government assistance and stay on the streets. When the residents of my city were polled by local news stations on ways to ease homelessness, a good 3rd of them had a “I’m not sure” answer.

It’s super easy to say “they just need more resources”. There’s only so much long term housing we have for the homeless, and even if we did, they’d have to eventually earn some type of income to pay the shares of the building rent. They don’t want to work, and social security income dept denies about 75% of its applications.

We offer, transitional housing, short term housing, various shelters, women/kids shelters, sober living housing, and subsidized long term housing for single men and women who have a proof of regular income either by working or SSI/welfare. There is free transportation to get to therapy services paid for by the state. Weekly groups on recovery, rehab, anger mgmt, etc. Various case workers in different departments to help link people to jobs that are hiring. Volunteer programs. Free narcan. Food baskets. Free clothing. The list goes on. We still have an increasing homeless population that simply, do not want help getting off the streets. I don’t see a plausible solution to this."

This perspective, admittedly, may instigate discomfort, yet I deem it an imperative discourse. My assertion, boldly asserted, revolves around the contention that individuals who opt for the pursuit of biological progeny are, in actuality, driven not by an altruistic love but rather ensnared by the tendrils of their own selfishness.  
Consider this proposition with discernment: When a newborn child graces this world with their nascent presence, they step into a realm adorned with the trappings of wonderment, innocence, and an insatiable curiosity that knows no bounds. It is a realm where each day unfurls as an unfolding adventure, replete with the allure of magic that appears to lurk around every concealed corner of existence. However, as these innocent souls traverse the tumultuous terrain of growth, the fabric of society, in its relentless march towards maturity, systematically strips away the shroud of wonder, replacing it with the stark veneer of harsh realities and disillusionment. It is as though, through a collective choice, we are willingly consigning them to the stark rigors of adulthood, thereby robbing them of the irreplaceable treasure trove of childhood innocence.  
What's more, the decision to procreate, when subjected to rigorous scrutiny, reveals its inherently egoistic underpinnings. It is, at its heart, an endeavor driven by the pursuit of personal gratification—fulfilling one's desires, perpetuating one's genetic lineage, and fostering the expectation of personal fulfillment through the progeny's existence. This choice, in its quintessence, is birthed from the crucible of individualistic needs and wants, rather than being predicated on the profound consideration of what is in the best interests of the prospective child.  
Furthermore, we find ourselves ensconced within a world marred by shadows of uncertainty and ominous portents. Environmental conundrums, political turbulence, and the looming specter of societal challenges collectively paint a disconcertingly bleak panorama. In such a precarious milieu, ushering more children into existence—children who would potentially be ensnared by the tendrils of hardship and suffering—is, in my contemplative reckoning, an act teetering on the precipice of profound irresponsibility.  
Admittedly, some may proffer the argument that a biological imperative drives us to propagate our genetic legacy, but ought we to yield to our most primal instincts and surrender to their dominion when we are acutely cognizant of the repercussions—both for the child and for the broader canvas of our beleaguered planet?  
In lieu of succumbing unquestioningly to the primal urge to engender biological offspring, I beseech those who profess an unwavering love for children to entertain the alternative path of adoption. Across the expanse of our world, countless souls languish in the cold embrace of the foster care system or languor within the confines of orphanages, yearning fervently for the warmth of love, the nurturing touch of care, and the ray of hope for a brighter tomorrow. Electing to embrace adoption over childbirth emerges as a paragon of selflessness—a testament to the capacity of the human heart to bring about a tangible metamorphosis in the life of a child.  
I proffer this perspective with a sincere invitation to challenge it, should you so desire. Be prepared, however, to embark upon a journey that confronts the stark realities and moral quandaries entwined with the act of ushering new life into this world."

1,2023-09-06,"CMV: ""Rationality"" is an vague, relatively-meaningless phrase",u/More-Honeydew894,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16bfpyp/cmv_rationality_is_an_vague_relativelymeaningless/,changemyview,"Thesis: Rationality as a concept is something akin to 'justified', in the sense that it is essentially an empty catch-all term for what people see as legitimate ways to come to a conclusion. The issue being this is a deeply obscuring use of 'rationality', as it overlooks the deep and essential irrationality of our thinking.

&#x200B;

The definition of rationality means ""in accordance with reason or logic"", and yet this clearly cannot be the rationality which reigns in modern intellectual culture. Rationality certainly cannot be equivocated with logic, considering not only does any logic put forth need to be proven as relevant, but also that logic cannot determine which is true between two equally logical positions - so something needs to prove which foundations are correct or not. And saying it's based on 'reason' similarly doesn't match up with the current idea we have of rationality, we can go on an infinite roundabout of justifying things with reasons, it certainly isn't enough.

&#x200B;

So we seem to be able to construct a more coherent notion of rationality from this, as something akin to ""Both a logic/reason and a justification/validation of why these logic/reason should apply"", and yet this as far as I can tell cannot hope to be rational as it will necessarily rely on what we consider 'irrational' to make any statement. The first factor is that since practically we can be certain of very little, we must introduce 'degrees of certainty', and this essentially relegates reasoning depend on intuition since there is no 'rational' way to work with percentages to make real-world conclusions. The second factor is that since we don't have all the facts, we will be forced to accept validated ideas which appear (currently) to be logically incompatible with each other. Hence the only way we can maintain rationality as being meaningfully related to truth is by undermining the necessity of logical coherence - hence the core of rationality.

&#x200B;

And yet we don't need to work from any definition to understand this (In fact working from definitions is one of the deep flaws of 'rationality'), in the sense that often when we believe we are being rational, we are in truth being deeply irrational in being based from emotion. Because to do any reasoning we need to assign a certain 'significance' to each of the facts and reasons, and yet quite necessarily the significance we attribute to certain facts cannot be rational. From what I've said it's clear rationality not only is flawed, but that we can't even do it purely, hence needs criticising. The issue then is that because of this 'block concept' of rationality you can't actually fight anything, because the concepts as far as I can tell doesn't relate to any one specific reasoning process, hence can essentially be adapted to mean anything - making criticism difficult."

Bitch doesn't relate to a word 'woman' the same way the N-word relates to black people. Nobody ever implies that all women are bitches. It's just a gendered insult. There are many gendered insults that are not slurs.

Whore - you don't call a man a whore, but not every woman is a whore.

Neckbeard - you don't call a woman a neckbeard, but also not every man is a neckbeard.

Motherfucker - you don't call a woman that, but also not every man is a motherfucker. 

Wanker - only men are called wankers. Etc.

We’re all used to it and it does no *real* harm. But it’s creepy as fuck. I posit that the main reason it doesn’t seem weird to us is because we’re used to it - but the same behavior in any other country would look weird and indoctrinat-ey, even to us. 

It’s also just annoying, frankly. We get it, we’re American and we’re proud of it (I certainly am). Would we be any less proud if we didn’t have this Pavlovian recital on a daily or weekly basis?

Even creepier is how “under god” made it in there in the 50s, forever staining what should be a secular pledge for a secular nation, for no other reason than to differentiate from those godless, heathen communists. 

Some progress has been made, the Supreme Court holds that at least one doesn’t have to stand for the fucking thing, but really it should just go away all together, or at most just done once at the start of the school year and then we can just assume it will carry over. 

Is it really necessary to say it *every morning*? Do we forget from one day to the next what country we’re in? 

Do we need this empty gesture of patriotism? Do we lose *anything* by not having it?

Do we need the national anthem sung before every single sporting event, which are overwhelmingly played and watched by Americans (and should the non-Americans have to endure it each time rather than just getting on with it)? Is anything gained from doing it? Is there any need for it? 

IMO, the answer to all the above questions are no. 

If this were to happen in a dictatorship (which it does and has) we would rightly be creeped out by it and see it as mass indoctrination and forced participation (we may not need to sing along and say the pledge, but we can't really avoid having to sit through it either)."

Spiders trap and eliminate several hundred million tons of prey every year, many of them harmful insects such as mosquitoes or houseflies - or killing pests that affect farm crops. Rat snakes and other such snakes kill many rats and pests that could harm crops or be a disease threat to humans. Relatively few spiders or snakes pose a venomous risk to humans. The vast majority of snakes and spiders do not bite except in self-defense, and even then usually only when roughly handled or cornered. Spider silk and some chemical compounds in spider's and snake's bodies have been known to have medical applications. Some spiders even help pollinate plants in a way similar to bees. They are also a food source themselves for birds. The presence of certain snakes and spiders can be an indicator of the health of an ecosystem. And some snakes and spiders are fascinating to study.

Pornography, sex and sexualized stuff: the main reason I'm writing this CMV.  
- There's a saying ""Are you from a privileged group or are you a porn category?"". Being seen as a mere sex object is awful, it strips you of your humanity. The reason /actuallesbians is called that is because cumbrains claimed /lesbians first.  
- Sex is also very harmful in some way. Sex is so intimate that it needs a lot of conditions in order to not being harmful, and being raped is worse than dying, there's a reason I put a trigger warning at the beginning of the text. And this high potential harmfulness of sex is why the porn industry is so exploitative, even in comparison to other industries.  
- Why can minors watch extremely violent media just fine if they were with their caretakers but not porn? Is sex more harmful to a minor's psyche than something like torture or cruel/cold-blooded murder? Is it the risk of the minor mimicking the porn that is somehow more worrisome than mimicking *Slaughter Festival*?  
- Men are often so bad to women that sometimes it feels that men and women are better off living in separate worlds. Almost every woman either has a story of being harassed/assaulted/raped or knows a woman who has.  
Why does porn have to do with asexual reproduction? No sexual reproduction, no libido. No libido, no cumbrainery. No cumbrainery, none of the things I mentioned.
Genetic diversity: the only advantage for sexual reproduction that I can think of, as it makes organisms more adaptable to changes in the environment. Humans hate diversity anyway. I have so many worries that this diversity topic deserves a CMV of its own.  
I recognize that humans won't be completely peaceful, nothing in nature is, but, without the dangerous horniness caused by libido, humans would have fewer reasons to fuck each other up."

Especially in the world of academia that I studied in.

One of the straws that broke the camel's back while I was at university was a Jewish girl in my class attempting to freeze me out of extra curricular events involving my class because of my interest in doing a transfer to an Israeli university. 

Saying ""this is a rare occurrence"" or ""this doesn't happen that often"" or ""isn't that what happens at universities?"" is the deflection used whenever this is brought up but these are people who go out and shape the zeitgeist of society. Their views influence policy and discourse and do not exist in a vaccum. This is a ""bigger problems"" fallacy used ad infinitum to prevent any criticism of the praxis used by sections of the left and it is a pretty shoddy argument along with ""you spend too much time online"" as if these views could not be formed offline.

[Whether it's being a mirror of the far right](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/07/beneath-the-skin-of-our-obsession-with-whiteness-lie-deeper-fears-about-our-place-in-the-world) pessimism was a preserve of conservative politics for decades. The torch has been passed to sections of the left and this time it is seen in discussions about climate change, feminism, and (as an African who became ""black"" when I came to the West, by ""champions of anti racism no less)  race relations.

[Infantilising minorities](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/27/it-can-be-hard-to-distinguish-the-cultural-claims-of-right-and-left-just-look-at-qatar) this is yet another in a long line of countless examples of sections of the left behaving as if they are the only ones who are able to hold truth to power. Where does this delusion come from?

Part of the reason I moved to France was because of the proximity to Germany - a very left wing country who by all accounts, is one of the most politically stable countries in Europe if not the world. I intern as a journalist and liaison with others in the field in Germany and there are regularly articles written in ""unofficial channels"" about the rise of censorship, anti-semitism, and other glaring flaws of leftist discourse there. I must reiterate that conservatives are not the only ones who see these flaws - the minorities like myself and others also see them and are unable to speak about them without being treated in the exact ways outlined in some of these articles.

It will not stop... But it will be brought attention to.

In laboratory experiments we manipulate the behavior of animals by presenting them with specific stimuli. And yet, when we are manipulated by stimuli in our environment, our minds present this to us as a choice we are making. According to a well-known study which measured human brain activity, ""The recordable cerebral activity (readiness-potential, RP) that precedes a freely voluntary, fully endogenous motor act was directly compared with the reportable time (W) for appearance of the subjective experience of 'wanting' or intending to act. The onset of cerebral activity clearly preceded by at least several hundred milliseconds the reported time of conscious intention to act."" [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6640273/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6640273/)

In this Universe, there are events which are fully predictable if you have enough data (such as where Mars will be next Tuesday) and events which seem to unfold according to probability (such as how subatomic particles behave). I think we perceive humans as having free will because we don't have enough data to fully predict their behavior, and because human behavior also can be influenced by probabilistic events, severely complicating the calculation. In my opinion, it is highly likely that human behavior is a mixture of predictable causality and random chance, and that none of our actions are due to what we call free will.

To change my view, you would have to demonstrate that people are capable of taking actions which are not the result of either a chain of causality stretching back to the big bang, random chance, or a mixture of the two."
1,2023-09-06,CMV: Sometimes it is valid to live off welfare even if you could do without it,u/MentalDespairing,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16bu4eu/cmv_sometimes_it_is_valid_to_live_off_welfare/,changemyview,"I live in Norway and am awaiting a request for welfare. I have no real diagnosis except talking 10-15 times with a psychologist who just gave me a general anxiety disorder which is not really accurate to my condition, as my issues are actually existential and philosophical (nihilism) which are not real mental conditions.

Psychologists cannot help with existential issues and I am not interested in religion, drugs or hedonism so I am opting for a Hikikomori lifestyle where I don't do anything but don't hurt anyone either.

I believe that it is okay for me to do so, even though I physically could hold a job and responsibilities. My justification for this is that I would have constant public mental breakdowns if I could not retreat from the world, which a job forces you to confront. This would scare surrounding people. Now, you might say a computer home job could work, but the stress from it could be just the same having to hit the numbers (and not having any computer related degree anyway, customer service is the only job for people like me). I think I could in theory handle a job like this and always be on a thin line between breaking down, but is it worth the risk?

Also, a mentally despairing person might consider suicide - I think that the trauma people would get from finding your body could scar people for life and thus it is better for some people like me to try to live to an old age and die naturally so not as to scare anyone. Imagine someone finding a body in a forest, or washed up on the beach. I Japan people straight up jump in front of train and give people trauma.

I believe welfare ""mooching"" is completely valid in cases like I have described above and probably even more cases.

Here’s why I think it’s BS:

1. Many people (myself included) snap the noodles so that it fits in the pot entirely. But if you’re waiting til the noodles are soft enough to stir in whole, doesn’t that leave the pasta slightly unevenly cooked? Al dente is a pretty specific science, and even 30 seconds to a minute is enough to make it slightly undercooked or overcooked.

2. The noodles are SO LONG. I like the ease of eating a pasta noodle that’s 4-5 inches long versus 10.. it’s just easier to stuff in my mouth. Innuendos aside, I can’t be the only one who doesn’t want to twirl my fork for a minute just to get a bite!

3. It doesn’t change anything about the food. The pasta is still long and thin, and the taste, as far as I know, doesn’t change. 


The only benefit I’ve seen people talk about is that the noodles are *supposed* to be long, or maybe that they’re supposed to be cut if they’re too long to eat. But if they’re to be cut anyway, what’s the point of not snapping them right away?

I’m genuinely curious!"

No, we specifically seek out music we like from previous decades and we don't have to deal with any of the generic or bad stuff from back then because that's not what's blaring in media or the public. If you prefer 60s music, that has nothing to do with the actual quality of what's being put out but more with personal taste.

""Movies were better back then."" No, the only reason why people can only think of ""good"" films from the 50s or 60s is because that's the only films that survive to be still popular today. 

""TV shows were better back then."" You personally prefer the style of older TV shows. That's it. This is a particularly bad one given the new depths that TV has been reaching this past decade, but I do see this said from time to time. 

""Back then, they built these things to last."" Survivorship bias, plain and simple. 

Yes, it's true that perceived quality *does* fluctuate over time. The animation in the 30s and 40s were painstakingly hand-drawn and took a huge drop in funding (and quality) in the 60s and 70s. Cars were ""neutered"" by emissions standards in the 70s and 80s compared to the roaring big-block V8s of the 60s. Critics do generally consider the 70s to have produced the greatest number of significant films.

But every time you feel the urge to think ""things were better back then"", ask yourself is that really the case, or is it only because the best from an earlier era survives?

Without lots of money the government can't control corruption through normal democratic means. Education and access to unbiased information about candidates is another huge issue. The poorer people are the less they can have their voice heard in government. When the majority of a country is in grinding poverty then democracy truly breaks down. 

Poor countries should have democracy but I'm not convinced that democracy is any better than communism in really poor countries. It just doesn't work in this situation. I guess I could say that everyone should be also be able to live in pure communism but that also doesn't work.

I would never push for a dictatorship but I wonder if a benevolent, powerful dictator is really the only form of government that can do a half decent job in a messy country like Haiti."

Additionally, the use of nukes has changed.

5,2023-09-07,CMV: The only reason adultery laws are still on the books in 16 states (and completely unenforced) is to shield cheating partners from having to admit it under oath in court by asserting their 5th amendment rights,u/triplealpha,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16c5vdr/cmv_the_only_reason_adultery_laws_are_still_on/,changemyview,"Adultery is illegal in 16 states, and while most morality-related laws have been slowly repealed adultery stubbornly still finds itself a crime in more than a dozen states to this day. Laws against drinking, cohabitation of unmarried partners, marijuana, swearing, and others have gone by the wayside for the most part but I firmly believe that the only reason it remains against the law is the majority of jurisdictions where permitted is to protect people in power (or who understand the law) from having to admit to their transgressions in court under oath. While anyone can refuse to answer a question to a police officer or in court by invoking the 5th amendment - these laws are on the books to provide at least plausible justification for not ever having to answer the question under oath."
1,2023-09-07,CMV: Greenhouse Gasses Emitted By Human Activity Are Warming The Earth,u/cyrusposting,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16caetv/cmv_greenhouse_gasses_emitted_by_human_activity/,changemyview,"Anthropogenic global warming is real, is caused by CO2, Methane, and other greenhouse gases emitted by human activity. The mechanism by which greenhouse gases warm the earth is by allowing ultraviolet light to pass through but absorbing light in the infrared. Its bleak and I envy people who don't believe this. I also have not heard an argument against it that holds up against the most basic research.

I have heard about what a small percentage of the atmosphere is actually CO2, which is like saying trains cant possibly move because only a small percentage of the train's mass is being ignited.

I have heard all of the variants of ""humans only contribute [small number] of the carbon in the atmosphere"" or any and all variants of obscuring the difference between carbon flux and accumulated carbon.

I have heard about how in the late cretaceous or on some other geological timescale the earth used to be warmer than it is now. Thats not very compelling.

I have heard people say that more CO2 means more trees to soak up CO2, as though trees and humans are the only things that have any kind of feedback loop with carbon in the atmosphere. As the earth warms, some things will absorb more, some will emit more, some will absorb less, et cetera. Trees have a finite amount of places they can grow and we aint doin the algae any favors either.

I have also heard that geologists and climatologists are all liars who are faking it. Ignoring that these liars would need to be colluding across borders speaking different languages, faking ground and sattelite measurements, and risking their careers, who is funding them? Does a failed presidential candidate have more money than Exxon, BP, and GazProm combined? Is Al Gore richer than all the saudi monarchs and the entire oil industry?

l'lI have someone taking care of me, giving me plenty of
compliments, and feeding me wonderful treats. Just imagine. Someone telling you ""You're so handsome. You're a good boy/girl. I love you so much. You're so smart. You want some candy? (Treat) Want to go for a walk? Want to lie in my lap while I gently stroke your hair?"" How can that possibly be frowned upon? It's not like l'm gonna be an actual dog and go potty outside. Or being walked in a leash. (Although, a leash sounds fun. Lol.)

1,2023-09-07,CMV: American Football would be more entertaining and decisive if you change three rules around kicking and kickers.,u/TheFinnebago,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16chbt4/cmv_american_football_would_be_more_entertaining/,changemyview,"American Football would be better if the Special Teams phases of the game were less distinct, and less focused on players who don't actually play football.  In every other major sport we ask the players that have been on the field the whole time to decide the game. It's only in football that we play 99% of a game, only to ask all the most highly paid and celebrated players to go to the sideline and watch while some other guy goes out there to figure out if our team won or not.  And I know that everyone so often a punter or kicker does something football-related, like make a tackle or throw a pass, but those moments are incredibly rare.  We remember them and are shocked by them because the expectation is Kickers and Punters CAN'T play football.

In Soccer, the players on the field decide the game during PK's. In Hockey, we don't bring out a skinny guy on the end of the bench for shoot outs.  In Basketball, you don't have the option of substituting a free throw shooter at the end of the game when a Center is fouled.  In Rugby, the players making the kicks and punts are the same players carrying the ball and making tackles throughout the game.  Cricket isn't my specialty so someone can correct me, but everyone on the team Bats, Bowls, and Fields, right? Volleyball doesn't have a guy that comes out just to serve and then not defend.

Baseball is about the only other sport that approaches this level of specialization (another American Sport, go figure).  A Closer may come in in the Ninth Inning to finish a game.  Or a Pinch Batter or Runner may come in with a uniquely high skill set for a specific situation.  It's closer, but even there the players are all still playing the same game.

So why don't we ask our American Football players to put the boot to the ball?  Rugby is as close to a similar game as exists and those guys have managed to be incredible punters and place kickers as well as ball handlers and tacklers, so we know from an athletic perspective, these aren't conflicting skill sets (like a ballerina and a bodybuilder or something).

My proposed rule changes:

*Kickoffs* Kickoffs would be replaced by one un-timed 4th down starting at the 50 yard line, with the first down marker placed at the ""Defending Team's"" 25 yard line.  So a 4th and 25.  This gives the ""Kicking Team"" a bevy of potential options and strategies, counter to the traditional kickoff or onside kickoff binary.  

I think we can all agree that rule changes have neutered what was once an interesting part of the NFL.  In 2022 there 2,698 Kickoffs, and 1,612 Touchbacks. 60%  3 of 56 Onside Kicks were successful. 5%. BORING.

Imagine a world where a the Bills are down 14 to the Chiefs, and Josh Allen finds Diggs deep and scores a touchdown with just one minute left.  Under current rules, we roll a twenty sided die for a chance at getting a weird bounce, or a third stringer have momentary butter fingers.  BUT WHAT IF all the Bills best Offensive Players, and all the Chiefs best Defensive players stay on the field for one wild 4th and 25.  Hook and Ladder?  Hail Mary?  Rush Three and play Prevent? Send an extra man?  That would be cool!  And as a fan, it would feel conclusive.  The best players were out there deciding the game. And every game could come down right to the end

*Punts and Field Goals.* You can still punt or go for a field goal, but the player that puts boot to ball needs to have been on the field for the previous down.  The NFL already has plenty of rules around number of men in the huddle, substitutions, eligible players based on line up and number, etc., I really don't think this would be hard to keep track of.

It also means if you want to have Justin Tucker on your roster, you still could, but he would have to be doing something for you on Third Down.  Or you'd have to basically play 10 on 11.

It wouldn't be long before we start seeing guys that can actually play football AND kick a ball.  

An RB or WR that can play a little Wildcat AND punt would be able to carve a really useful niche.  Defenses would have to play a sort of deep safety on long fourth downs or concede a rolling a punt.

I'm not saying kicking a field goal is easy, but it's also hardly some sort of athletic rocket science.  There is no rule that being good at kicking is separate from being good at running, catching, or tackling (rugby).

Could these non-specialist's bang 50+ yarders? Probably not right away. The 2022 rate of converting 50+ yard fields goals was 68%, so it's not as though aggregated NFL Specialists are great at it either.

*Extra Points* Move it back to the two yard line and make it more of Gimmie. I don’t hate the idea that a TD drive needs a sort of punctuation, but it doesn’t need to be difficult for randomness’s sake. Piggy backing on the previous substitution rule, one of the guys on the field who helped score the TD would need to kick, so figuring that out with the play clock ticking would be a good challenge.

In summary, I'm super excited for Football to be back, and this is mostly a light hearted take on a game I can't stop watching (Despite the NFL being a big front to make billionaires richer while destroying young men's brains, but that's a different CMV).  I know these changes will never happen but this is largely inspired by [Larry David's rant](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CwxhC4Vu_Rs/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D) the other day.  Happy to hear people stick up for Kickers and Punters!

Happy to explain terms and concepts and such to those who don’t follow football closely, I know I got jargon-y in there."
1,2023-09-07,CMV: The US should dissolve into independent nations to avoid a civil war.,u/wowsuchtitan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ci9cy/cmv_the_us_should_dissolve_into_independent/,changemyview,"So, ever since the January 6th attack, i've come to hold some pretty strong pro US-balkanisation beliefs. On one side, you've got ""boogaloo"" folk who want to overthrow the government and install a fascist christian ethnostate, and on the other side you've got people who want to murder people with more money than them, abolish private property collectivize all industry.   
  
If that isn't the telltale signs of a dying nation, you'd probably should stop reading here. 

It seems to me and a lot of people i've spoken too, that since the Obama administration the United States has become increasingly more polarised between two party system to the point very few politicians, even its own populace, have an overlap in beliefs. Any attempt to have a third party just flops because both sides want to spite the other to the point moderation and rational thought gets thrown out the window.

  
Talks of civil war, like i mentioned earlier, are common talk in some circles. 

  
Needless to say, people do not like the federal government unless a politician of their liking is in power. The Trump and Biden administrations have only proven this further. Laws signed by both presidents have been hugely unpopular in red and blue states. Trump's travel bans, transgender military exclusions and Bidens Respect for Marriage Act are two examples of this. How can a nation be stable when its constantly shifting between two majorly different platform of beliefs every 4-8 years?

  
Its apparent that at any given time at least 50% of the country does not like the federal government.  
So why have a federal government? To an outsider looking in, all i can see is a politically stagnant nation held back by a deeply divided congress that relies on a party majority to accomplish anything. Any so called 'Bipartisan' bills are normally very lopsided when it comes to votes. I used to be against the idea of a national divorce, now i'm thinking that batshit crazy Marjorie Taylor Greene might have a point as much as that hurts to say.

  
I personally think it just makes sense. A voter from Louisiana has no businesses dictating the life of someone living in Washington, and vice versa. Both states have a vastly different way of life. It looks it it would solve a majority of americans grievances overnight. You want less taxes? Free healthcare? Stronger borders? Stronger gun control? Less immigration? You could have those things without infringing on those who don't want them. 

  
The main criticism I have heard from people i express this opinion too is that states are too economically dependent on each other, and possibly only California, Texas, New York and Florida would be able to survive on their own. Which is why I think the dissolution of the United States should be a process that takes at least 10-15 years and that any and all government legislation passed in that period would shift away from social issues and begin to encourage economic self sufficiency. Anyone who wants out from their state to move somewhere that aligns with there value would have enough time to do so. 

  
The second criticism is that it would allow the US's major rivals to dominate global affairs. The best option would be for the newly independent states to form an american counterpart to the European Union to rival the influence of Russia/China. Militarily, they should pursue NATO membership."
1,2023-09-07,CMV: Most people's religious beliefs are largely influenced by their societal and familial upbringing rather than a personal search for truth,u/the-minsterman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16cj4ib/cmv_most_peoples_religious_beliefs_are_largely/,changemyview,"I've been thinking a lot about the influence of culture and family on our personal beliefs, especially in the realm of religion. It seems to me that the majority of people tend to follow the religion of their parents or the dominant religion of the region they grew up in. For instance, someone born in a predominantly Christian region might naturally grow up with Christian beliefs, while someone born in the Middle East might be more likely to adopt Islamic beliefs.

While I acknowledge that many individuals do undergo personal spiritual journeys and might change their beliefs over time, I can't help but think that for a significant portion of the global population, religious beliefs are more a product of upbringing and societal constructs than personal exploration.

I genuinely want to understand this better and am open to having my view changed or expanded upon. I would love to hear experiences, perspectives, and any counterarguments to this notion.

1,2023-09-07,CMV: Subs disallowing crossposts simply results in duplicate content and credit not being given to OP,u/_DeanRiding,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ck3ig/cmv_subs_disallowing_crossposts_simply_results_in/,changemyview,"I think you'd be hard pressed to find a popular sub that actually allows crossposting these days, and it can be pretty frustrating as a user if you've seen a post that would be interesting and relevant to another subreddit.

I've thought about it a bit, and it's always struck me as counterproductive, particularly to the platform of Reddit as a whole. Here are my reasons:  
  
Duplicate Content: When crossposting is disallowed, it doesn't actually prevent users from sharing content they found interesting or relevant. Instead, they might screenshot, download, or re-upload the content directly. This leads to multiple instances of the same content floating around, making the platform more cluttered.   
  
Loss of Original Context: Crossposts inherently carry with them the context of the original post, including the subreddit it came from and the original poster. This can be crucial for understanding the nuances or specific cultural references of the content. Without crossposting, this context can be lost.  
  
No Credit to OP: One of the main benefits of crossposting is that it inherently credits the original poster. When users manually repost content, there's no guarantee they'll give credit to the OP, and they almost never do. This can be disheartening for original content creators and might discourage them from sharing in the future.  
  
Fragmented Discussions: Crossposting allows for centralised discussions. When users see a crosspost, they can easily navigate to the original post to join a larger, unified discussion. Without this feature, discussions about the same content can become fragmented across multiple posts or subreddits.  
  
Potential for Misinformation: Without the original context and discussion, there's a higher chance for misinformation to spread. Users might interpret the content differently or miss out on crucial clarifications provided in the original thread.  
  
However, I'm open to hearing counterarguments. Perhaps there are benefits or reasons for banning crossposting that I haven't considered. If you believe that the bans on crossposting are justified, please change my view!"
1,2023-09-07,CMV: Focusing on ideological purity does not win elections,u/LaserWerewolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ck5f2/cmv_focusing_on_ideological_purity_does_not_win/,changemyview,"I have encountered many people who openly say that they hate centrists more than they hate their actual political opponents. Fair enough, because ideologically they often have more in common with their opponents than with a genuine centrist, but when the election comes around the same people often ask why more centrists don't vote for their candidates. I don't know about you, but I think voting for people who hate me seems like a questionable idea. 

I have also noticed that in certain echo chambers (possibly this is a general feature of echo chambers) people are often insulted, verbally abused, or even excluded if they do not share every single belief common to the people in that echo chamber. Often this person then leaves and joins a different echo chamber where they are more welcome. 

Let's say that a person starts out in a Party A echo chamber. They agree with 9 out of 10 of the main Party A viewpoints. But because they disagree with Party A one one single viewpoint, they are pushed out of the echo chamber by people who demand ideological purity.

Now let's imagine that Party B says, ""It is enough for us that you agree with us about this one viewpoint. We accept you."" The person now joins a Party B echo chamber.

I think this person would most likely start agreeing with Party B more and with Party A less after switching to the Party B echo chamber. I also think this person would be less likely to vote for a Party A candidate and more likely to vote for a Party B candidate after switching to a Party B echo chamber. 

To change my view, you would have to persuade me that focusing on ideological purity causes a greater number of people to vote for one's party. Bonus points if you can back this up with some kind of statistical data, but a purely logical argument could also be convincing.

This is what people have brought up to defend cheating to me. In my opinion, cheating is defined as being able to safely leave the relationship, but choosing to betray your partner anyway. An abuse victim cannot leave safely and easily. Their partner has already betrayed them by abusing them. Thus, it is impossible for an abuse victim to “cheat” on their abuser. 

This situation is different from a person who would feel really bad if their relationship came to an end, or if they have kids. They’re not putting their life on the line- they’re just shuffling their misery onto their partner/family. 

And that’s really the core of my view. It is always possible to end the relationship before you cheat. It’s not a fun choice, and it can impact your reputation or finances, but it’s a choice you can make. When someone cheats, they’re really just trying to eat their cake and have it, too. 

“What counts as cheating” is a complex topic everyone seems to disagree on. For me, it’s cheating when sex and intimate cuddling is involved. Being friends with someone isn’t cheating. Neglecting your spouse is a bad thing, and something to fix/break up over, but not cheating. 

As for alcohol fueled cheating…I honestly don’t know. I do not drink, so I feel that I don’t have the experience to judge. I’ve heard mixed opinions from those who do. The only thing I’d say is that, if you have control over yourself, it’s cheating."

from my perspective as a student it’s 100% pointless, if the student has a bad grade or doesn’t turn in their work, then i see the point of detention (to give them time to get extra help and/or finish any missing work) but i don’t see the point of seat time (granted the student is doing well in school), not to mention if a student is 5 minutes late to class they are apparently marked absent for the entire class, and the classes are long (90 mins) so 5 mins don’t really make a big impact.

In 2004, a variant called the New England IPA (or Hazy or Juicy) IPA was developed and has since also risen to popularity. Hazy IPAs have citrusy or juicy flavors and are typically less bitter and hoppy than other American IPAs, and are different enough that the Brewers Association made it a separate style in 2018. 

Though I generally like both styles if they're well done, I consider them to be completely different beers and do prefer non-hazy IPAs. My issue is when trying a new beer I like to know what I'm getting, and many times a beer will be simply labelled ""IPA"" but it ends up being a hazy. I think it would be better for both consumers and brewers to have more consistent and regular labeling. 

**Hazy only drinkers**: If more hazy IPAs are clearly marked as hazy, those customers will be more likely to try them. 

**Non-hazy only drinkers** will be less likely to buy a beer they won't like, and will have more confidence that something labeled ""IPA"" will be hoppy and not fruity. 

**Hazy or non-hazy drinkers** will have a better understanding of what they're getting. 

**Brewers** will be able to get their beers to the people who want them, and won't piss off customers who get something they didn't expect. 

***

Caveat: it is a spectrum between hazy and other styles of IPA rather than a hard and fast cut-off. This CMV was inspired by me buying several beers in the last several months labeled simply as IPA or double IPA that I consider to be firmly in the hazy camp. Some of these breweries even sell other beers which they *do* call hazy, giving the false impression that beers without the label are not hazy."

In other words, I do not believe that I need to prove it's ethical- I just need to dismantle any argument that claims it isn't.

**AI art steals from artists.**

No, it doesn't. This software is built off machine learning principles. The goal is to recognize patterns from millions of images to produce results. In simple terms, the goal is to create a machine capable of learning from artists. If the model made a collage of different pieces, then I'd agree that it's sketchy - AI art doesn't do that. If the model searched a database and traced over it somehow, then I'd agree - but AI art doesn't do that either. Does it learn differently from a human? Most likely, but that isn't grounds to say that it's theft. Consider a neurodivergent individual that learns differently from the artist- is it unethical for THAT person to look at an artist's work? What if he makes art in a different way from what is conventionally taught. Is that wrong because the artist did not foresee a human making art in that particular way?

**Artists didn't consent to their work being learning material.**

If you're saying that, and you hold this view as uniformly true regardless of WHAT is learning from it, then sure. If you have the more reasonable stance that an artist cannot gatekeep who learns from the stuff they freely publish online, then that freedom can only logically extend to machines and non-humans. 

**Without artists, the models don't exist.**

You are right, there is no current way to build an ML model to produce artistic renditions without artists. This doesn't mean that artists should own the rights to AI art or that it is unethical. Consider the following: High-velocity trading firms rely on the fact that the internet allows them to perform a huge volume of trades at very high speeds. Without the internet, they cannot exist. Does that mean high-velocity trading firms are owned by the internet, or that they must pay royalties to someone? No. I cannot exist without my parents. Am I obligated to dedicate my life in service to them? No.

**It steals jobs.**

Yes, it might. So did the computer to human calculators, the fridge to milkmen, and the telephone switchboard to switchboard operators. If you believe that this is the essence of why AI art is unethical, then I'm really curious to see how you justify it in the face of all the historical examples.

**Only humans should be dealing in art.**

I've had this argument a couple of times. Basically, it's the following: Only humans can make art. Because a machine creates nothing but a cheap rip-off, it's an insult to the humans that dedicate their lives to it.

For people that believe this: Are you saying that, of all the sentient species that might come to exist in the universe, we are the ONLY ones capable of producing art? Is every other entity's attempt at art a cheap rip-off that insults human artists?

**The only ones using it are huge corporations.**

Not only is this not true, it doesn't really do much to convince me that it's unethical. I am, however, interested in hearing more. My belief for this is the following: If even a SINGLE person can use AI art as a way to facilitate their creative process, then your argument falls.

**It produces copies of artists' work. There are even watermarks sometimes.**

Yes. If your model is not trained properly, or not being used properly, then it is possible that it will produce near-identical copies of others' work. My counter has two parts to it:

1. The technology is in its infancy. If it gets to the point where it simply does not copy-paste again, will you accept that it is ethical?
2. When used improperly, it can produce near-copies of someone else's work. Just like the pencil. Is the pencil unethical?

**Art will die.**

Some artists believe that, because AI art is so easy to make and has no integrity or value, art will die. This implies that humans only make art for financial gain. No one is stopping humans from producing art long after the advent of AI models. 

**Unrelated arguments:**

* It looks bad / humans are better at it.
* It's not real art.
* Doesn't require skill.

I'll be adding any other arguments if I can remember them, but these are the central arguments I most often encounter."
1,2023-09-07,CMV: America today is closer to a Communist than Capitalist society,u/tedchambers1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16cqkl1/cmv_america_today_is_closer_to_a_communist_than/,changemyview,"While I don't view America as a pure communist country I believe that over the years it has slowly morphed into one that objectively is closer to Communism rather than Capitalism. I'm basing these views on the following four points. I am not saying that this is a positive or a negative only making an observation from what I see. 

**Aspect:** Ownership Rights  
**Communism:** Collective or state ownership of means of production.  
**Capitalism:** Private individual or corporate ownership of means of production.  
**My View of America:** Most of the means of production (PE back companies, VC backed companies, Publicly traded companies, farms, ect.)  are owned collectively through pension funds and 401ks. As these firms are largely governed by the same large Asset Managers they are effectively collectively run on behalf of the general public.  


**Aspect:** Economic Planning  
**Communism:** Centrally planned economy; the state or collective decides on production and consumption.  
**Capitalism:** Market-based economy; supply and demand determine production and prices.  
**My view on America:** Our government controls the amount of food produced and harvested through the farm bill and sets the oil drilling targets for the oil companies owned by 401ks. Major works projects (large oil pipelines, land use projects in cities, utility improvements) are near completely signed off on by central planners.   


**AAspect:** Income Equality   
**Communism:** Aims for a classless society with income equality; wealth is redistributed.          **Capitalism:** Income is based on market forces and individual capability, which can lead to income inequality.  
**My View on America:** Our leaders on both sides of the aisle are constantly pushing for policies that promote income equality despite possible reductions in market competition.

  
**Aspect:** Political System   
**Communism:** Often associated with one-party systems or limited political freedoms. 

**Capitalism:** Can coexist with various forms of governance, including democracies and autocracies.  
**My View on America:** While there is certainly an illusion of choice between the two major political parties there is actually very little difference between them that a typical American will experience.

Yet we wonder why nothing ever improves. I fell for the trap of Trump when he said he would ""lock her up"". Now I realize all these people we see shoved into our faces are NOT good, honest and or hard working people often they are the exact opposite. Which is why I found it so refreshing to find a man by the name of Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai coming from the bottom caste of India who had to work his butt off to get what he has. After watching his campaign video here Dr.SHIVA FOR PRESIDENT 2024 - Official Campaign Video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-HOCjs4DsA&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-HOCjs4DsA&t) he peaked my interest as this campaign was different than the others more genuine more human. Here is a quote of him from his website  ""Politicians, gurus, and grifters profit by your division, complacency and desperation. They do not educate you. They entertain you. They imprison you by seducing you into senseless “Left” & “Right” or “Pro-” & “Anti-” tirades, never delivering real solutions or speaking the truth at the right time."" I have watched many of his videos that have opened my eyes of him explaining how the establishment works in enslaving us like in this video here Dr.SHIVA™ LIVE: The Swarm – HOW the Few Control the Many. What WE Do to Break Free. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m\_3Nf6xjeFs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_3Nf6xjeFs) .

In this 2020 court case he also discovered CISA giving back door portal to Government to silence those who spread ""mis/disinformation""  however because he won they unbanned him on twitter. Even after all that Dr. Shiva requested Elon to deal with this back door portal if he was all about free speech and after telling Elon multiple times he shadow banned Dr. Shiva making him nearly invisible (note viewership vs subs/follows). HOWEVER based on his Wikipedia Dr. Shiva is "" anti-vaccine activist. He has become known for promoting conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and unfounded medical claims"" also ""After the election, he promoted claims of election fraud that were shown to be false by fact checkers."" . Very interesting story Wikipedia says vs what I have read/watched with my own eyes. I would love to see someone change my mind on him. ;)

NOTE he is a naturalized citizen so he is currently fighting for the 14th amendment which essentially makes naturalized citizen = natural born.

EXTRA NOTE I cannot force you to watch the two video links but if you won't even watch his 4:30 min Campaign video I mean your missing out on the meat and potatoes of who he is what he is fight for. Watching the 2nd video is 15:11 min and will without exaggeration make your brain or human cylinder larger whichever you prefer no kapp.

I understand that weight includes the effect of gravity in its definition but these two measures are in a useful sense the same measurement unless you're going to go to another planet which isn't likely, and even then a correction factor would be needed for either measurement unless if the mass is actually measured using a balance scale. If mass increases so does weight and vice versa so highlighting the ""differences"" is pointless and confusing and blindly accepted by school aged kids.

In my experiences working with each they have both been used in the same scenarios, just mass was used when the job required metric measurements and weight was used when using standard(american) measures. There are even simple conversion rates to go from kg to lbs.

I am open to changing my mind with new information I may not have come across. I often pose this statement to ""thinker"" types of people when I meet them. Most can only repeat the definition that weight includes gravity with out further demonstration of how they are different since gravity is practically constant in any real world scenario."

1,2023-09-07,"CMV: If you think someone is faking their mental illness online, calling them out for faking mental illness is usually the wrong thing to do, especially when it is a younger person.",u/AdhesiveSpinach,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16cuvti/cmv_if_you_think_someone_is_faking_their_mental/,changemyview,"This is just something I have seen a lot in my 10+ years of being on the internet, and I used to be on the other side, but after growing up and facing my own battles with mental illness, I just don't think that it is right because it is done under the guise of wanting to ""advocate for people who are actually mentally ill"" when in fact, I think it does more harm than good to those who struggle with their mental health for a few reasons. 

1) If you're going to accuse someone of faking their mental health, you should think carefully about how many mentally ill people you are willing to invalidate for the sake of calling out one faker. Because you don't actually know if they're faking or not, you're making a guess, which can be based in some fact, but there's no way to know if you're right or not. 

If a person is saying that have x illness, either they **do (being truthful)** or **don't (are lying)**. And if you don't believe them, you have two options, **call them liars** or **say nothing**.  

Let's say you are 90% sure someone is lying about their mental illness( and this is giving you the benefit of the doubt that your estimate is correct) is it really worth it to call them out? Is it worth it to identify 9 fakers with the cost of telling 1 actually mentally ill person that they are lying and you don't believe them? That seems like a terrible thing to tell a mentally ill person who is probably already doubting how much support and sympathy they deserve, and for what? 

If the intention is truly to advocate for someone for those with mental illness, this trade off is not the way to go. Mentally ill people gain very little from someone on the internet calling out these 9 fakers, but the mentally ill person that is called a faker and a liar has a lot to lose. They're already in a very vulnerable head space. 

2) If someone is actually faking a mental illness, they're probably mentally ill or have some deep psychological problem (but it's just not the problem they say they have). I feel like this especially applies to younger people, such as minors. 

Like if a 15 year old is chronically online, talking about a fake mental illness, that is a pretty strong indication that there is something deeply wrong with them (as in their mental health). This is extreme attention seeking behavior, and is typically not found within a healthy person. They need help. Not more people dogging on them. 

This isn't to say that you should validate this delusion or lie. You should be encouraging them to see a mental health professional, which is not the same as calling them an attention seeking liar. 

I don't know if I'm missing something because it still seems like this is the norm when I don't think it should be. "

1,2023-09-07,CMV: Recognizing the transactional nature of relationships and the interchangeability of people in relationships is the best cure to post-break up pain. And dramatically reduces pain for all future break ups.,u/Th3Unidentified,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16cwa0f/cmv_recognizing_the_transactional_nature_of/,changemyview,"Here are the highlights of my notes on this. Other topics may overlap:

When a person decides to be in a relationship with you the implication is that you’re special because the person chose you exclusively out of all the potential options open to them.

When they leave you, the implication is that you’re not special anymore. Or that someone else (probably their new partner) is more special than you.

I think the understanding that most effectively frees a person from that pain is the realization that they were never really special in the first place…

And neither was the other person.

And EVERYONE is playing this “special” game…EVERYONE. But nobody realizes it.

The ego is fed when you are “special” and when you’re not “special” the ego is bruised. It feels good to feel “special” and it doesn’t feel good when you are “not special”.

Where the “special game” becomes problematic in attraction and relationships is here:

The reality of life is that most people are interchangeable with each other in relationships. There is no “soulmate” and there is no “best choice” for any one person. There are thousands—millions—of people that a person can and will find attractive…

That a person can and will be able to have genuine pleasurable connections with…

People that they could see themselves being in relationships with. Some more than others…

What’s happening is that people don’t realize this. They’re not seeing this. And they believe the opposite of this. That there IS a “soulmate” out there. Or that the person they were with was “the one”. All while playing this “special” game. It’s a recipe for pain.

So there’s shock and pain and confusion and egos bruised and feelings of not feeling special when a person cheats or leaves the relationship for another person or even if that person just makes another connection with someone else. Because you don’t feel special anymore when one of these things happen.

If you can see the game for what it is, perhaps people can pursue monogamy free from pain and misery because they will wisely keep it at arms length.

It must be remembered that people are opportunistic. And that relationships are a value exchange and always will be. People don’t see this or they forget this and feel blind sided, betrayed and discarded when someone leaves them for someone offering more value (in the form of better feelings and/or material things)

If there is a soulmate out there. I think it’s just a person you’ll have the strongest kind of connection with. It’s not just one person but the likeness of you meeting 2 is probably close to none. It’s the rarest level of connection someone with your wiring can have with someone else. 

There’s billions of people in the world, so there’s probably quite a few of these people alive but obviously it’s still unlikely to meet one. They could be in a country on the other side of the planet. In prison. Married to someone else. Anywhere! But you don’t have to have the soulmate connection to have a happy long term relationship with someone.


If children were raised to be privy to these truths, I seriously believe they’d be able to easily stomach multiple breaks up with ease. It’s an optimistic view to me really. There’s always more people out there that you can have a long lasting and fulfilling physics and emotional connection with. Even more fulfilling than the person you may be with right now. So if the day ever comes that they’re no longer with you for whatever reason, no need to be pessimistic about the future."

Someone not fitting into a norm is not enough justification for you to ruin that man’s social life. Getting or giving out bad vibes is not harmful and not illegal.

1,2023-09-07,cmv: Big Pharma is preying on Trans children and adults for money,u/Realistic-Razors,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16czer7/cmv_big_pharma_is_preying_on_trans_children_and/,changemyview,"Why can’t people see the only reason majority of the medical community and Big Pharma are supporting puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgical transitioning on minors and adults (not puberty blockers for adults, obviously) without even needing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria is because it’s a billion dollar industry and it’s lining their pockets with money. 


There have not been enough studies on puberty blockers to prove they are safe for the amount of time they’re being used for. However there is enough evidence to prove it has short term and long term (irreversible) effects on children and adults. We should not be teaching children that there’s an easy way out of puberty? Every child who goes through puberty is uncomfortable. We are stopping children from going through something natural and necessary, we are delaying the growth of their bones and their body, it affects the growth of their genital tissue (so IF they do grow up to be trans, bottom surgery will be difficult), those who grow up after taking these may never be able to orgasm and it’s more than likely they will be infertile. Do you see what future options we are taking away from children by letting them decide their own ‘gender’ at such a young age? Do you really think a CHILD is mature enough to fully understand the consequences and impacts of the decision they are making?

Most children and teens grow out of gender dysphoria and usually just end up being gay or gender non-conforming so why are we letting them decide this?


Do you know trans men who detransition back to women have some of the worst irreversible changes: loss of scalp hair, their voice drops on testosterone and even if you stop taking it you’ll never get your voice back - it stays deep forever, your clit can grow 1-4 cm in length and it can impact your nerves in there - this can make it painful.We have young girls who transitioned as minors without being properly assessed for gender dysphoria, doctors gave them mastectomies and now they’ve detransitioned back to women who lost their HEALTHY breasts because adults allowed a minor to make a MAJOR medical decision. They are now suing doctors for malpractice (rightfully so). I’m sure this is happening more often than you think, it’s common sense to assume lot’s of people get hush hush money.


Since when did we so blindly trust the government? Since when did we so blindly trust Big Pharma? You are quite literally paying big money to be used for human experiments. Trans people were meant to be less than 1% of the population and now we have whole families claiming to be trans, how is this statistically possible? We’ve removed the safeguarding around hormones and transitioning and now anyone who ‘feels’ like the opposite gender can take medication and have surgeries that are irreversible. We are letting the younger generations mutilate themselves under the guise of being accepting and inclusive.


Stop trusting sources and information from companies who are financially benefiting from the trans community. They’ve made a billion dollar industry out of trans people and now they are financially benefiting from the detrans community (rising at an alarming rate).
 Do we believe Big Pharma and the government have never done human experiments? Were you under the impression Big Pharma and the government have never preyed on mentally unwell people so they can financially benefit? Do you genuinely believe they support this movement because it’s helped society and improved mental health and not because they are making a very big amount of money from the community?

I’m 28. When I was 13, I started having weird throat problems all the time. It felt like my throat had a lot of pressure in it, like a weird burning like feeling, and the only thing that helped was when I drank or ate something or swallowed. This would help then it would come back a bit later. I had weird issues swallowing saliva too. I saw an ear nose & throat doctor about this and was told my issue was acid reflux. I was prescribed reflux medication and told to sleep on an incline. I did those things for a while, but it didn’t help. Supposedly I was treating the issue and the doctor didn’t know why I wasn’t improving but told me to continue doing what I was doing to supposedly treat it. I saw some other doctors that weren’t sure either. I learned to just live like that but it was annoying and started to take over my life to the point that all day every day revolved around coping with my throat. I had bad anxiety because of it, used to avoid things, had to make sure I always had something to drink to help my throat, and felt really stressed about it all and how it was affecting me.  
  
When I was 15, I started to feel like a brain fog on top of the throat issues. It was like my brain felt like mush all the time. Like the feeling when you sleep bad for a couple nights and your brain feels like crap, except I was sleeping plenty. I felt kind of spaced out, couldn’t concentrate as well, never wanted to do anything, and just felt kind of crappy all the time. Wasn’t severe but was definitely impacting my day to day life, in addition to the throat stuff. I went back to seeing doctors. Lots of doctors said there was nothing wrong with me and some even said that the brain fog (and even the throat issues) were all psychological. I didn’t feel like that was it because my symptoms felt so real and physical but what did I know. I was prescribed antidepressants and doctors recommended I see a therapist for anxiety issues. I spent the next couple of years trying multiple medications, seeing therapists, and making other changes but nothing helped. I thought I was going crazy. Psychologists made me feel even worse as they further made me think that all my issues were mental. In those few years that passed, I had slowly started to feel worse. It wasn't a day to day difference but a few months or so would pass and I would feel a bit worse than I did a few months earlier. By the time I graduated high school, the constant mental fog and tiredness were affecting me pretty bad. I felt stressed and anxious nonstop, both because of how much these issues were affecting my life and I physically felt anxious all the time too. Sometimes the anxiety was so bad I would literally start sweating. I had almost no social life during high school because these health issues consumed my life and did just the minimum to get by. Because lots of doctors were telling me there was nothing physically wrong with me, I started to believe them about it being all mental. I thought it was something I was doing wrong personally. At this point I wasn’t even talking to my family about it as much since supposedly there was nothing wrong and it was all in my head. Especially when doctor after doctor were saying nothing was wrong and because my symptoms were mostly feeling tired and foggy all the time (what parents want to continually hear that), I felt guilty even saying anything about it anymore. It felt like it was a personal failure for feeling the way I did. Everyone gave me crap for seeming lazy and low energy. They gave me the impression that my issues were because of me and I just needed to change my mindset and lifestyle and I’d feel better. Changing my thinking, behavior, antidepressants, therapy. I did every single thing doctors and therapists and family told me to do, but nothing helped. They made me question my sanity every day. By the end of high school I probably had at least 10 doctors tell me there was nothing physically wrong with me. It was hell living like this.  
  
I was in no shape to go to college, but I did. I ended up going because supposedly there was nothing wrong with me and I was trying desperately to believe it was all in my head like everyone was saying. So I pushed myself to go, hoping I’d sort it out soon. I didn't. I spent the next 4 years slowly feeling worse, still seeing doctors but getting no real answers. I'd go months and months at a time without even seeing a doctor as I didn't know where to turn and had given up at times. I'd also go back to thinking maybe it's all in my head, but at the same time my symptoms felt so real and more severe than anything mental could cause. During college, I saw a doctor about sleep apnea but didn't seem to fit most of the symptoms. Things like waking up trying to get air, choking, stopping breathing, snoring, wasn't overweight, wasn't unhealthy, didn’t have a family history of it or other health issues. Doctor also did scans and didn't see anything abnormal. Still, I tried one of those moldable mouthpieces that’s supposed to help with sleep apnea but didn't see any benefit from it. So with all of this in mind, I figured it’s probably not sleep apnea. I was so desperate, I was constantly trying all sorts of medications, drugs, supplements, and other weird things to try and help myself. I felt like I was losing my damn mind. My mental health was god awful. Felt like crap 24/7. I literally felt stupid because my brain wasn’t working. Dealing with symptoms and figuring out what was wrong with me consumed my entire life. School wise, I would occasionally go to class after taking a big dose of stimulant drugs, but even those only did so much. It got to the point that no amount of caffeine pills, energy drinks did anything either. I experienced nothing enjoyable in 4 years of college and had basically no life, really no friends, hobbies, nothing. Really the only experience I had was when I went on a study abroad trip but it was terrible because I felt so awful the whole time. I had also joined a fraternity in the beginning of college but did almost nothing with them for the same reason. The mental tiredness had gotten so bad it felt like I was disconnected and living in a dream. Like I felt kind of drunk. I was so mentally and emotionally numb and exhausted I didn’t even feel human. Like I physically could not feel emotions and felt super spaced out. I was also still dealing with the throat issues. I’d get random dizziness, my vision got worse like being more sensitive to light, almost no sex drive, my voice was sounding more monotone and dead. In four years, I also spent thousands of dollars on shuttles and ubers to and from appointments (I didn't have a car at the time and lived almost 2 hours from the major city), seeing doctors that didn’t take insurance, buying supplements, drugs, etc. I somehow managed to graduate college (I could make a whole separate post about this) and finished feeling way worse than when I began.  
  
I spent the next year doing just the bare minimum to get by, feeling like a horrible zombie. About a year after college (2019), I had a sleep study done and results came back with moderate sleep apnea. 17 times an hour I was having breathing interruptions while sleeping. For the first time I actually had an answer. Sleep doctor immediately prescribed a CPAP machine. I spent about a year messing with the machine and the face mask they gave me and got no benefit. I then switched to a different machine and a mask that only went into my nose and finally noticed some improvement when I was able to keep it on and sleep through the night with it. However, this didn't happen much as it was super uncomfortable sleeping with air blowing down your throat and a mask stuck to your face. I'd also wake up a bunch during the night, rip it off without knowing, etc. But I was desperately trying to make it work. When I was able to keep it on for most the night I felt a bit better but it was really difficult to do so consistently. During this time I couldn’t really hold down a job, other than some really basic, short term jobs. And even those felt brutal. I was a complete zombie because the tiredness was so overwhelming. It was as an amount of brain fog and exhaustion I didn’t know was humanly possible. I was making myself basically sick with stimulants. Throughout all of this I was taking stuff like Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, modafinil. I was so tired none were really helping and even had a doctor at one point tell me that I should get genetic testing for depression or have my brain zapped with electric shocks. I didn't go that route. By this point, I'd had nearly every medical test someone could have done.  
  
After 2 years of messing with machines and still struggling, my sleep doctor then recommended I see a maxillofacial doctor to see what the underlying breathing issue was being caused by. The doctor recommended I get a custom mouthpiece made that shifts the lower jaw forward to help open the airway to prevent breathing issues while sleeping. The process of having it fitted and made took a couple months. I even took a “real” job during this same time because I had two different doctors telling me that this mouthpiece was likely to help me a lot. I felt like I couldn’t have gotten the mouthpiece fast enough. I ended up messing with the mouthpiece for months and had no benefit at all. Literally zero. The dentist who made the mouthpiece said that the mouthpiece wasn’t helping because I might just have “weak muscle tone” in my throat and that I should see someone called a myofunctional doctor to supposedly improve muscle tone in the throat and tongue. I looked into that and it seemed like total quack stuff so I didn’t do it and completely dropped that dentist that made my mouthpiece and suggested this. I then saw an ear nose and throat doctor and later did a sleep endoscopy with him where I was put to sleep and had my breathing monitored with a camera down my throat. The doctor said that my breathing issues were being caused by my throat and jaw and suggested that since the mouthpiece wasn’t helping, I could get surgery or have a device called Inspire surgically inserted into my chest and neck to artificially help breathing. I held off on that cause it sounded pretty extreme and thought there had to be something else. During this time I had to leave the job I should’ve never taken in the first place because I was so non-functional.  
  
I pretty much gave up for months. I eventually scheduled an appointment with another ear nose & throat doctor (the same kind of doctor I first saw when I was 13). I'd already seen multiple ear nose & throat doctors by this point but didn't know what else to do. The connection was made that my issues were due to really abnormal nasal breathing. I had a really severe form of something called nasal valve collapse, which was causing both sides of my nose to almost completely cave in and block most air when breathing in, even when just breathing in a little bit. This issue is worse during sleep so all night I was struggling to breathe and was slowly feeling worse over time as I was never getting quality sleep. So the bad sleep every night just kept accumulating over the course of 10+ years. He also explained that my throat issues were a sign that my nose wasn’t functioning normally, which was causing airflow issues and a throat pressure feeling as a result. Nothing specific caused this issue to happen. Just the way my face and nose naturally developed over time. Doctor said this issue is not common and when it does happen is typically the result of an injury or prior surgery as opposed to it just happening naturally. Multiple doctors told me that this very rarely happens in otherwise healthy young people. Prior to having surgery the doctor had me wear a plastic dilator piece in my nose at night to prop it open which helped incredibly. Everything finally made sense for the first time ever. I even recorded my sleep and could hear myself struggling to breathe all night.  
  
Last year (2022), I had nasal reconstructive surgery as well as a septoplasty surgery. It took a long time to recover but I feel I mostly have now. I may still have to look into a revision surgery as the collapse is still fairly bad when I'm not wearing the dilator but over time most of my issues have gone away since it was the poor quality sleep that was giving me most my symptoms. The slowly worsening constant exhaustion, brain fog and cognitive issues that started when I was a teenager. The severe anxiety/depression/stress I had since I was a kid. Sleep apnea and poor quality sleep further making the body feel stressed out and anxious as a result. Throat issues completely gone. I no longer feel like killing myself out of misery, as I did every day since I was young. It was that simple but untreated made my life constant torture. Feeling horrible nonstop, slowly getting worse over the course of more than a decade, not knowing why, being told there was nothing wrong with me or that it was all psychological, trying all sorts of things with no benefit, and having my entire life be ruined was a mental hell I wouldn't wish on anyone. I don’t feel like my teenage years and a good part of my 20s actually happened because I was in such poor health physically and mentally 24/7. Every day was about just getting through the day. Life felt like it was on hold. I missed out on most ""normal"" things other people I knew were doing. I wish I had been able to see good doctors earlier, but that unfortunately didn’t happen. I’m not even sure how I wasn’t able to make the connection myself. I think I was just so used to really bad breathing since I was young that I didn’t know it wasn't normal and had no reason to think I had some weird issue. It's frustrating knowing that none of this should have even happened to begin with and that it was so preventable. Fuck every one of those medical experts that told me to my face that there was nothing wrong with me and that the very real horrible physical and mental symptoms I was having was all in my head. This shit consumed every aspect of my life 24/7. My life outside of this was complete nothing. Through all this I've learned there is nothing more important in life than proper breathing and sleep. Such basic, fundamental things the vast majority of people will fortunately never even have to think about. Hopefully this can help someone out there. Thank fucking GOD it's over.

TLDR: Slowly worsening chronic fatigue/brain fog and other symptoms for 10+ years was due to really bad nasal breathing, mostly severe nasal valve collapse that was leading to sleep apnea and unknowingly bad sleep every night and destroyed every aspect of my life."
1,2023-09-08,CMV: Chronic health issues due to medical incompetency ruined my teens and most my 20s and have left me mentally messed up,u/Dramatic-Surprise251,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16d1lgg/cmv_chronic_health_issues_due_to_medical/,changemyview,"TLDR at bottom  
  
I’m 28. When I was 13, I started having weird throat problems all the time. It felt like my throat had a lot of pressure in it, like a weird burning like feeling, and the only thing that helped was when I drank or ate something or swallowed. This would help then it would come back a bit later. I had weird issues swallowing saliva too. I saw an ear nose & throat doctor about this and was told my issue was acid reflux. I was prescribed reflux medication and told to sleep on an incline. I did those things for a while, but it didn’t help. Supposedly I was treating the issue and the doctor didn’t know why I wasn’t improving but told me to continue doing what I was doing to supposedly treat it. I saw some other doctors that weren’t sure either. I learned to just live like that but it was annoying and started to take over my life to the point that all day every day revolved around coping with my throat. I had bad anxiety because of it, used to avoid things, had to make sure I always had something to drink to help my throat, and felt really stressed about it all and how it was affecting me.  
  
When I was 15, I started to feel like a brain fog on top of the throat issues. It was like my brain felt like mush all the time. Like the feeling when you sleep bad for a couple nights and your brain feels like crap, except I was sleeping plenty. I felt kind of spaced out, couldn’t concentrate as well, never wanted to do anything, and just felt kind of crappy all the time. Wasn’t severe but was definitely impacting my day to day life, in addition to the throat stuff. I went back to seeing doctors. Lots of doctors said there was nothing wrong with me and some even said that the brain fog (and even the throat issues) were all psychological. I didn’t feel like that was it because my symptoms felt so real and physical but what did I know. I was prescribed antidepressants and doctors recommended I see a therapist for anxiety issues. I spent the next couple of years trying multiple medications, seeing therapists, and making other changes but nothing helped. I thought I was going crazy. Psychologists made me feel even worse as they further made me think that all my issues were mental. In those few years that passed, I had slowly started to feel worse. It wasn't a day to day difference but a few months or so would pass and I would feel a bit worse than I did a few months earlier. By the time I graduated high school, the constant mental fog and tiredness were affecting me pretty bad. I felt stressed and anxious nonstop, both because of how much these issues were affecting my life and I physically felt anxious all the time too. Sometimes the anxiety was so bad I would literally start sweating. I had almost no social life during high school because these health issues consumed my life and did just the minimum to get by. Because lots of doctors were telling me there was nothing physically wrong with me, I started to believe them about it being all mental. I thought it was something I was doing wrong personally. At this point I wasn’t even talking to my family about it as much since supposedly there was nothing wrong and it was all in my head. Especially when doctor after doctor were saying nothing was wrong and because my symptoms were mostly feeling tired and foggy all the time (what parents want to continually hear that), I felt guilty even saying anything about it anymore. It felt like it was a personal failure for feeling the way I did. Everyone gave me crap for seeming lazy and low energy. They gave me the impression that my issues were because of me and I just needed to change my mindset and lifestyle and I’d feel better. Changing my thinking, behavior, antidepressants, therapy. I did every single thing doctors and therapists and family told me to do, but nothing helped. They made me question my sanity every day. By the end of high school I probably had at least 10 doctors tell me there was nothing physically wrong with me. It was hell living like this.  
  
I was in no shape to go to college, but I did. I ended up going because supposedly there was nothing wrong with me and I was trying desperately to believe it was all in my head like everyone was saying. So I pushed myself to go, hoping I’d sort it out soon. I didn't. I spent the next 4 years slowly feeling worse, still seeing doctors but getting no real answers. I'd go months and months at a time without even seeing a doctor as I didn't know where to turn and had given up at times. I'd also go back to thinking maybe it's all in my head, but at the same time my symptoms felt so real and more severe than anything mental could cause. During college, I saw a doctor about sleep apnea but didn't seem to fit most of the symptoms. Things like waking up trying to get air, choking, stopping breathing, snoring, wasn't overweight, wasn't unhealthy, didn’t have a family history of it or other health issues. Doctor also did scans and didn't see anything abnormal. Still, I tried one of those moldable mouthpieces that’s supposed to help with sleep apnea but didn't see any benefit from it. So with all of this in mind, I figured it’s probably not sleep apnea. I was so desperate, I was constantly trying all sorts of medications, drugs, supplements, and other weird things to try and help myself. I felt like I was losing my damn mind. My mental health was god awful. Felt like crap 24/7. I literally felt stupid because my brain wasn’t working. Dealing with symptoms and figuring out what was wrong with me consumed my entire life. School wise, I would occasionally go to class after taking a big dose of stimulant drugs, but even those only did so much. It got to the point that no amount of caffeine pills, energy drinks did anything either. I experienced nothing enjoyable in 4 years of college and had basically no life, really no friends, hobbies, nothing. Really the only experience I had was when I went on a study abroad trip but it was terrible because I felt so awful the whole time. I had also joined a fraternity in the beginning of college but did almost nothing with them for the same reason. The mental tiredness had gotten so bad it felt like I was disconnected and living in a dream. Like I felt kind of drunk. I was so mentally and emotionally numb and exhausted I didn’t even feel human. Like I physically could not feel emotions and felt super spaced out. I was also still dealing with the throat issues. I’d get random dizziness, my vision got worse like being more sensitive to light, almost no sex drive, my voice was sounding more monotone and dead. In four years, I also spent thousands of dollars on shuttles and ubers to and from appointments (I didn't have a car at the time and lived almost 2 hours from the major city), seeing doctors that didn’t take insurance, buying supplements, drugs, etc. I somehow managed to graduate college (I could make a whole separate post about this) and finished feeling way worse than when I began.  
  
I spent the next year doing just the bare minimum to get by, feeling like a horrible zombie. About a year after college (2019), I had a sleep study done and results came back with moderate sleep apnea. 17 times an hour I was having breathing interruptions while sleeping. For the first time I actually had an answer. Sleep doctor immediately prescribed a CPAP machine. I spent about a year messing with the machine and the face mask they gave me and got no benefit.

1,2023-09-08,CMV: Flat Earth 2.0 is happening right now in the form of the ability to transsex.,u/kagekyaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16d1v5o/cmv_flat_earth_20_is_happening_right_now_in_the/,changemyview,"I do not believe in the ability to transsex, mainly because I do believe that:

Human females cannot become Males, vice versa.

But, in the future, it will be a different story. there will be a safe and profitable industry for human to change their biological sex.

In the past, Flat Earth is most people subjective truth, which means that era objective truth, until more data come in and then the real objective truth is found. Earth is not Flat.

for the ability to transsex, at the moment, we already have high level of Data collection/mining. We do not need to GATHER or wait a long time for new data to come in. We have the data. No human can safely change their biological sex and get the other opposite sex function/characteristic fully. It is impossible.

However, We can CREATE new data, which is, Human experiments through ""medical"" surgery, etc.

another ref, In the past, Human believe, the only way to have kids was through sexual intercourse.

It is wrong.

Now, We have IVF (in vitro fertilization). It is a safe enough and profitable industry.

To CMV, there are 2 easy ways that I can think of:
-show me a proof that Transsex operation will never become safe enough and profitable no matter what.

-or show me a fact that the alternative is always the preferred way.

As an African, it makes me think that the lives of our people are not worth it in the eyes of the Belgium.

It's not about money for me, but about one party taking real responsibility for their actions and make amends for making so many innocent people suffer.
Until Belgium formally apologizes to Congo, removes statues of Leopold and makes amends then Africans will continue to see Belgian state as an arrogant, hypocital former colonial power which continues to view Africans as lesser people not worthy of a genuine apology."

I understand that words change with time. But terms move quicker in dictionaries than they do in peoples minds.  
  
When you think of a violent movie, you think blood/gore/combat. When you hear of a violent crime scene, you imagine stabbing, shooting etc.  
  
I'm not discounting the impact of psychological abuse, it can be in cases worse than physical. But as a survivor of physical domestic violence, I feel there is a difference between the two. Physical violence results in death, psychological doesn't.   
  
I definitely want more awareness for all kinds of domestic abuse. But the more cases the phrase includes, the more it could be watered down and seen as less importand or dangerous. 

A solution could be to keep the label domestic abuse, instead of domestic violence."

1,2023-09-08,CMV: The concept of self awareness is largely governed by personal biases and values,u/ActNo3193,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16dhj9j/cmv_the_concept_of_self_awareness_is_largely/,changemyview,"To elaborate on the title, I am defending two, somewhat related viewpoints:

1. One perceives self awareness in others only through the lens of their values and worldview.

People often claim that they value self awareness in others. However, in practice this tends to refer to awareness of the observer’s perspective and also a shared belief of the actions that should follow. For example, a person (A) with a strong distaste for tattoos may perceive a tattoo wearer (B) as less self aware. A is making an assumption here: “If B were aware about how I felt about his tattoos, he would have covered them, removed them, or avoided getting them in the first place.” 

The same pattern applies to all sorts of aesthetic, social, and political choices. “If they were aware about how I felt about anime, they wouldn’t publicly display their interest in it.” “If my direct reports were aware of how the came off to me, they would wear a tie and work free overtime.” “If they knew they looked like ‘that guy’, they wouldn’t participate in lecture so much.” “If they were aware of their appearance, they would dress this way / groom this way / furnish their living space this way / use these words and not those words / use this body language / inflect their voice this way.” 

It follows a pattern of “If they were aware of X, they would Y” where X is a personal belief or value of the observer , and Y is an expected action to demonstrate awareness of X, an action which can require varying levels of personal sacrifice and commitment. 

All of these instances also come together at a societal level and form a socially constructed idea of what it means to be self aware. Though it varies from culture to culture, those whose behavior is consistent with the culture’s values tend to be viewed as self aware in that culture.

To unofficially summarize point 1, people who claim to value self awareness in others are, in reality, retroactively ascribing self awareness to those who embody a certain subset their values and act in a way that is consistent with their worldview. 



2. The difference between “self awareness” and regular “awareness” or “knowledge” is arbitrary and also subject to personal values and bias.

What knowledge qualifies as “self awareness”? If I know my three favorite dishes, I think most would agree that would qualify at least as a basic level of self awareness. But what about the recipe, ingredients and its country of origin? What about the the prime minister of said Country? Of the neighboring countries? The farming practices of the ingredients? The chemical reactions involved in those practices? The particle physics that makes the chemical reactions possible? Does encyclopedic medical knowledge qualify as self awareness given that the human body may be seen as significant part of the self?

“Self awareness” is separated from regular “knowledge” by an ontological demarcation line determined by one’s view of what is close and significant to the self. One might view one’s house as an extension of the self, and view home improvement knowledge as a form of self awareness. Another might view their family connections as a big piece of themselves, but view home repair as obscure, domain specific, and orthogonal to their identity. People assign different weights of significance to various aspects of their life, such as food, home, social connections, art, politics, fashion, hobbies, etc, and that affects their ideas of where the self ends and the rest of the world begins. I would argue that, for example, neurodivergent people are often mislabeled as “lacking self awareness” when they really just have a different idea of what’s significant to the self."
1,2023-09-08,"CMV: ""Why...?"" always sounds better than ""How come...?"".",u/Se7enineteen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16dhkih/cmv_why_always_sounds_better_than_how_come/,changemyview,"I've spent a lot of time in the US but live in the UK. I work with a lot of Americans and they usually say ""How come"" where a British person would say ""Why"". 

For some reason it's got to the point where I get (very, very slightly) annoyed whenever I hear ""how come"" now, rather than ""why"". It sounds weirdly toddler-ish, old fashioned and awkward.

Example:

How come you want your view changed? (Awkward, longer, sounds like a toddler)
Why do you want your view changed? (Direct, normal)

I appreciate there's no functional difference between the two but I'd prefer to not be (very slightly) annoyed any time I hear it from people I genuinely like and respect.

And besides, ""why"" is a lot shorter, less awkward, and less childlike sounding than ""how come"".


Edit:.

Thank you everyone for their replies, most were very good arguments and I definitely changed my view in some contexts."

I get why people like it “at 0 degrees water freezes, and at 100 degrees water boils” but how often are you measuring water? The most common use of measuring temperature is the air, not the water.

Fahrenheit is much more accurate for the temperature of the air outside or inside. I’d rather say it’s 81 degrees than say it’s 27.222 degrees. In every day life, I would much rather use Fahrenheit.

And when using Fahrenheit, it’s much easier to guess the temperature based on how big the number is. You might not know exactly how hot it is, but if I say its 90 degrees, you’ll assume it’s hot, cause it’s a big number.

On the other hand, if you say its 32 degrees, that doesn’t feel like it’s very hot outside. I mean, saying it’s 20 degrees outside and saying it’s 30 degrees outside feel pretty much the same, but in Celsius it’s a massive difference.

The pot was stirred even more due to the recent developments in the FIBA tournament, in which the US men’s team suffered a loss to Germany and was eliminated. 
  
I believe that this loss is completely meaningless in the context of the aforementioned discussion, since literally none of the players on the U.S men’s team have ever been crowned champions in the NBA. Why would it make sense to use them as examples of an expectation of global stardom when they haven’t even earned the title that indicates that. On top of this, U.S players aren’t specifically from the NBA, and players from other nations in the NBA are allowed to compete (which is very common and ironically what makes these competitions worth watching in the first place) 
  
If you look at the history of competition on the Olympic stage, America has been completely dominant in every sport, earning the most medals in history, basketball included. They have just won the most recent Olympics without breaking a sweat and have won gold in the last 9 of the last 10 (40 years!) Olympics, and the only reason they lost in 2004 was because of an identical reason to the case of the current FIBA team: many of the players were teens or early twenties, and were not champions. And remember- people from outside the US compete in the NBA, but they are less known because they generally don’t make the cut. 
  
To deny U.S dominance in global sports competition is laughable, and in the case of basketball it’s no exception. It’s crazy how people seem to be completely ignorant of how decorated out athletes are in the olympics"

Both argue that human actions are extensions of factors we do not have a choice over. Compatibilism seems to say we are still free but just redefines free will to the internal factors behind a decision, but the decision is still decided by a chain of events outside of our control.

My argument is a sort of wager argument. Either libertarian free will exists or it doesn’t. If it exists and we believe in it, we have made a free decision where we are right. If libertarian free will doesn’t exist, the decision to believe in libertarian free will was out of our control.

So either we have a choice and we can make the right choice, or we don’t have a choice and were determined to be wrong.

Thus it makes more sense to believe in libertarian free will since it’s potentially the only one where we have a chance to make a right choice, if determinism is true there is no choice, so there’s no value in being right."

I am aware of such actions, such as [sending undercover police to Australia to keep their diaspora in line](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2023/04/are-chinese-secret-police-keeping-the-australian-diaspora-in-line/) or [placing sanctions on Australia](https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2023/04/16/learning-the-right-lessons-from-chinese-sanctions-on-australian-imports/).

2. [The Broken Economics of the Oceans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73ygHs4Kwcs)

From an Australian POV, why do I say that I find PRC actions against Southeast Asia more concerning than their actions against Australia or any other Western nations? I see pragmatic reasons to be worried:

* The countries in the above 2 links (Philippines and Indonesia) [suffer from lower political stability than either the PRC or Western nations](https://power.lowyinstitute.org/data/resilience/institutional-stability/political-stability/), further hampering their ability to put up a resistance to the PRC.
* As ""*The Broken Economics of the Oceans*"" shows, stealing Indonesia's fish in turn forces Indonesian fishing vessels to illegally fish in Australian waters.
* The PRC appears to be itching to conquer Taiwan (and I'll probably be conscripted when it launches its attempt at conquest), but as of right now, it is currently refraining from doing so. But in the meanwhile, it is already stepping on the toes of Southeast Asian nations, who are powerless to stop them, and [this can spiral into all-out war too](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/08/china-philippines-dispute-could-escalate-into-superpower-conflict-say-analysts).
* If the [AUKUS submarine deal is already controversial within Australia due to its cost](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/21/guardian-essential-poll-support-for-aukus-and-indigenous-voice-declines), how can the even poorer nations of Southeast Asia afford to defend themselves from PRC actions?
* Australia might be the country most economically-dependent on the PRC, but [several Southeast Asian nations are not far behind](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/11/26/top-10-china-dependent-countries/?sh=5dfa8b9c4932).

Being Reddit, I know that someone will bring up that Australia does not have clean hands:

* We joined American wars of aggression in Iraq. 
* [Our referendum on a proposed Indigenous advisory board is set to lose by a large margin](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-09/voice-to-parliament-uluru-statement-yes-vote-fallen-no-ahead/102832938). 
* We've given some of our neighbours reason to resent us:
   * [How Australia cheated East Timor of its oil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUXxWCsi2Rk)

Other than sucking up to powerful nations like the USA, I can't think of anything else can be done by Southeast Asia to defend itself from the behemoth that is the PRC. The power dynamic between Southeast Asia and the PRC is similar to that between Latin America and the USA - where the USA was not afraid to use intimidation and political interference to get its way. And as mentioned above, there are some countries that would prefer PRC hegemony over the hegemony of any Western nation."

There are of course some differences, but for the most part, I think any of my friends could live in the US, UK or elsewhere in Europe and generally make friends and have a great time.

I believe it for the reasons I’ll state below. For reference I’m 27 years old and pansexual, so yes if things work differently in queer spaces I can take advantage of that. Address these particular issues as there are plenty of things I don’t give a shit about like how sexually skilled people are. I want to change my view but I want to keep this as a discussion of the facts below rather than turning into a question of whether publicly making out is a good thing or not for example. 


My belief isn’t just that this applies to the majority of the population but that it’s impossible to reasonably change your adult life such that these things I consider good from college and high school apply. So an assertion that one country has lots of adults publicly making out or that some interesting parties exist that are not limited to billionaires would qualify as a counter argument. I believe it’s easy to make your college and high school lives bad already by contrast.

Please change my view. 

Here are the facts I want to discuss and dispute.

If you get an average college experience it will blow the rest of your life out of the water no matter how great your adult life is.

There are basically no parties in adult life and if there are then they are all way worse with less horny people and less interesting activities. The only real exception might be clothing.

You can’t like meet someone you like in class anymore. You have to go through online dating and scroll through dozens of ugly profiles, receive dozens of rapey messages, until you find one okay one and then that person rejects you. Really just in general people are like ten times as rapey after college.

There’s almost no public making out after high school or college either. And you’ll regret it the rest of your life if you don’t do it when you have the chance.

You also get to automatically be around people exactly your age so it’s the perfect dating environment. You’ll never even meet someone who’s too far away in age to date unless you try to date your professors (don’t do that that’s a good way to ruin your life). 

You also don’t have to have a particular idea of what you want from a relationship you can just jump into one, especially in high school. You can live in the moment instead of planning for marriage on day one.

Almost everyone I know who has had sex with over ten people has had sex with only one or two people after college, so almost all their sex was in high school or college."

I simply can't wrap my head around the concept. 

Paternalism is the paradigm that a group or individual's personal liberty and autonomy should be curtailed for the sake of that group or individual's own good. From my perspective, actions that harm others or groups of people **directly** should have reasonable restrictions on them, but not actions against the self. Say driving under the influence on a busy street, a personal choice, but it also directly impacts others. Intervention should also be an option, for example trying to stop someone from committing suicide or overdosing from a drug addiction, just that with informed consent, individuals should be completely free to make decisions that are potentially dangerous to their own wellbeing.

This isn't to say I don't feel bad or can't show emotion, just that it's more evil to stop people from experiencing things. My Nan passed away from pancreatic cancer a little while ago, resulting from diabetes and poor eating habits. It didn't make me want to force others to eat healthy, in fact, it did the opposite. More than ever, I want people to be able to make informed decisions about their own health, and have the choice to experience things before they inevitably die one day.

Here's a couple of examples.

1. An adult has been made aware that it is dangerous to ride a bicycle without a helmet. In no circumstances does this cause bodily harm to another individual. Should that individual be allowed to ride the bike?
2. An adult has been made aware of the health risks with a recreational drug or psychoactive substance. When consumed in private, this will not cause bodily harm to another individual. Should that individual be allowed to consume the drug?
3. An adult has been made aware that a road is only safe to drive on up to 35mph. Assume there are no other vehicles on the road (which can't always be guaranteed). Should the individual be fined if they were lasered going over the limit by police?

Some real life examples from the country I live in are:

1. A man was fined for not wearing a seatbelt while towing his boat from a boat jetty.
2. Alcohol taxes (when designed to reduce the amount people drink) have increased 71 TIMES since their introduction, to the point where tax makes up over 100% of the item cost.
3. Medical cannabis patients have their licences confiscated and suspended for the mere presence of THC, despite THC have less of an effect on driving than being below the legal blood alcohol limit."

To change my view, you would need to find an equivalent action in the world that is immoral. I understand morality is subjective so this might be tricky. That said, my issue is not about the law. If the majority somehow voted for landlording to be banned, so be it. I love democracy. And majority rules. 

However, given it is not illegal in my country and in most countries as far as I'm aware, I see nothing immoral about it. 

If I rent a car out, that's not immoral. If I rent a hotel, that's not immoral. So i fail to see how landlording is immoral. Now the for profit part. Every business profits. Including farmers, even if food is a necessity, profiting off food is not immoral. 

Why would anyone do anything except for profit?

Now the next part. Who builds the house? Builders. Who needs to pay? If not the person wanting the house than the buyer. At some point there is someone that asked for the house to be built. This person either directly paid for the wood etc or they paid someone to do all of that. Either way, they paid. They paid say 10000$ in 1820. Then they sold it for 50k because inflation in 1880. (doing random numbers) but then the industrial revolution came or idk some things like wars and things got expensive in 1900... Well anyways you get the drift. 

Now some say that it's the chinese investors raising prices of things or house flippers, but whatever the cause, the issue isn't landlords doing things for profit, yes even the mom and pop who decides to rent out their basement. 

AT the very least the hate should not be directed to them but to the government that made the situation exist. Simply banning landlording or shaming landlords to not landlord is stupid. 

(Again this is separate issue from thinkining landlording isn't work. I actually agree. But I also don't care. It's their property and they can do as they will. )"

Yes, eye shadow and lipstick and whatever else is obvious when looked at closely but, generally speaking I think it's safe to say that the purpose of makeup isn't to stand out so much as to blend in.

Nowadays I see people who intentionally put on heavy makeup.  They do this with the intent of changing their entire appearance to look different.  Most cases are people cosplaying or doing characters.

Then there's people who intentionally wear makeup trying to do both.  Case in point: Emirus ridiculously overdrawn lips with her lipstick in every photo, that's obvious and hideous and not even attempting to be subtle.  Or girls that have an orange face and a white ass neck. 

There's something to be said about how people wear their makeup and most of the time if you're trying to make a bold statement you wind up looking like a clown instead."

I believe a progressive sales tax solve the issue of a flat tax is trying to fix but more fairly.  


Currently, income tax is the primary source of revenue for governments around the world. While it is designed to be progressive, with higher earners paying a larger percentage of their income in taxes, the system has its flaws. Wealthy individuals often find ways to minimize their tax burden through various loopholes and deductions, leading to an unfair distribution of the tax burden.


A progressive sales tax is a fairer alternative to income tax. Under this system, the more you spend, the more you contribute to government revenue. This approach directly targets consumption rather than income, which can be manipulated through various financial strategies. By focusing on spending, the tax system becomes inherently progressive, as higher-income individuals tend to spend more.


One of the major advantages of a progressive sales tax is that it curtails the ability of billionaires and high-income earners to live off loans and investments while paying minimal income tax. Under the proposed system, all individuals, regardless of their income source, would contribute based on their consumption. This eliminates the possibility of tax evasion through financial maneuvering, creating a more level playing field for all taxpayers.



The transition to a progressive sales tax would also simplify the tax filing process. Instead of dealing with complex forms and deductions, citizens would receive a tax card linked to their purchases. This card would automatically track their spending, making it easier for individuals to understand their tax obligations. Furthermore, the system would streamline the tax filing process, as all relevant information would be readily available to both taxpayers and the government. This would also hit illegal go income as well. When you report consumption but no income to report, it has the added affect of prevention of illegal transactions.


To implement a progressive sales tax, citizens would receive a tax card similar to a credit or debit card. Every time they make a purchase, the card would be used to calculate the applicable tax. This purchase information would be linked to the card and automatically transmitted to the government.



On January 1st of each year, the government would compile all the purchase data linked to individuals' tax cards. This information would be used to calculate the tax liability for the previous year. The process would be straightforward, as there would be no need for extensive record-keeping or complex calculations on the part of the taxpayer.



Individuals would still be required to file their income with their W2 forms. If their income for the year is higher than the previous year, they would be responsible for paying the difference in taxes. Conversely, if their income is lower, they would receive a refund. This ensures that the system remains fair and adaptable to changes in income."
1,2023-09-09,CMV: People will be 'cancelled' in the future for things that are considered good and moral today.,u/LaserWerewolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16e8kub/cmv_people_will_be_cancelled_in_the_future_for/,changemyview,"(This is assuming that the act of 'cancelling' a person does not in and of itself get 'cancelled'.)

Let's look at some of the ideologies that are considered unforgivable in society today. We have seen a lot of people receive an extreme amount of criticism, lose their jobs, or be threatened with violence for expressing opinions which were considered normal or even the default in the past. And when we look at what people said and did in the past, we are often shocked and appalled. The way people saw women, people of other races, people of other religions, gay people, and many other groups is not something that would be accepted or even tolerated today. For example, Abraham Lincoln may have been a good person by the standards of that time, and it's true that he did a lot of good by ending slavery. But even he was not in favor of integration, and if someone said the things he did today, that person would certainly be excluded from society. 

And this makes me wonder about what we do and say today that will be considered unforgivable by our children and our children's children. I am certain that people in the future will be horrified by what we say, do, and believe today.

To change my view, you would have to convince me either that what society considers moral and acceptable does not tend to change over time, or that this generation is the exception to the rule.

1,2023-09-09,"CMV: Even though whiteness is largely an illusion, it's still possible to be right or wrong about its nature or source.",u/tolkienfan2759,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16e8ldo/cmv_even_though_whiteness_is_largely_an_illusion/,changemyview,"When I say whiteness is an illusion, there are a number of different ways to show that.  One is that geneticists claim there is far more variation within ""races"" than between them; another is that if you were to run the one-drop rule in reverse, and make one drop of white blood evidence of whiteness, it would change everything and be totally arbitrary; another is to recognize that, half a million years ago, all our ancestors (everybody) was a black African.  And I'm sure there are other ways of showing it that I'm not aware of.

But even though it's an illusion, I claim it's still possible to be right or wrong about its source or nature.  For example, some seem to claim that if you self-identify as white, that's all it takes, to make you white.  Others (me) claim that this too is an illusion, and in fact, it is peoples, and not individual people, that actually are or are not white.  And, in addition, that what makes a people (a group of people, like Arab Americans or Asian Americans or what have you) white is the fact that its men do not (in general) fall in love with, or marry, black women.  (I hasten to add that although this is my belief, I'm not claiming it's right; I'm just saying that's how it is.  We should change it, and we can; but for now, it's how we are.  When I've said things like this in the past, I've been accused of advocating for the separation of the races, and I want to make it clear that my feelings are quite the reverse, and that in fact we can and should unify the races.)

But the goal here is not to convince you that whiteness is largely an illusion, or that any specific idea about what whiteness ""really"" is, is correct.  My goal is just to maintain that just because whiteness is an illusion, doesn't mean that ideas about its nature have no truth value.  That its illusory nature doesn't mean that whiteness doesn't really have a ""nature,"" whatever that might mean, about which we can be right or wrong.

And as I see it, the reason it's possible to be right or wrong about the source or nature of a social illusion like this, is that it affects our behavior and is therefore, to that extent, at least partly ""real.""  The effects of the illusion are real, and so its effects must have a cause, and that cause is something about which we can be right or wrong.  The cause is not part of the illusion, in other words.  The cause is real.

Well, that's more than I meant to say, and I hope it's not too ridiculous.  But I also hope we can all agree that it's possible to be right or wrong about the true source or nature of a social illusion."

We are in World War 3, although it's not recognized as such in the traditional sense. Unlike past world wars which involvelarge-scale conventional battles, this one employs hybrid warfare tactics like cyberattacks, information warfare, and economic coercion. The global scope, involvement of major powers, and ongoing conflicts worldwide make it akin to a world war, but its unconventional nature often goes unnoticed. Like the other 2 world wars, the people living through this one don’t realize its a world war, and wont come to a consensus it is one until years after it happens 

Hybrid warfare is modern warfare, both Russia and Americas military know Russia would be absolutely destroyed in any conventional war with nato forces. Which is why Russia has chosen not to engage in a conventional war with nato , its chosen to engage in a hybrid war with it with has all of the same consequences and implications of a conventional war. when michael morell, the former deputy director of the cia, called the 2016 russian election atttack “the political equivalent of 9/11” i believe he meant people should have viewed it as Russia flying a plane into the White House and the capital because it had all of the same if not more profound consequences than a terrorist attack on the united states. If we are to believe peter szork of the fbi when he says the fbi pondered whether trump was a Manchurian candidate and to this day never concluded he wasn’t, it would appear the greattest form of a hybrid attack on the united states in history was conducted in 2016. Because if this is all true Russia was able to gain our nuclear secrets without even having to send in any special forces

hybrid warfare is world war 3 and if we realize it now we might be able to draw global attention to it and start fostering talks, finding solutions, drawing limits on attacks etc etc we have sleepwalked into a world war and we don’t need to wait for an attack on mahattan, Moscow or Beijing to Call it what it is. direct war between major powers is what will happen if we don’t realize this is world war 3 and move to de escalate and stop it. This is like world war 1 , 1 by 1 a bunch of nations are being drawn into this and probably wont realize its a world war until they start shooting directly at each other

https://asiatimes.com/2023/02/world-war-iii-is-already-here/

mike pence said the United States will fight Russia directly if Ukraine does not succeed in stopping russias invasion, i believe him. which is why if we realize this is a world war now we can hold a global convention on it and have a billion ways we can explore on how to prevent direct hot war between china - USA / usa - russia. The definition of a world war is a war that has all major powers, not a war between major powers. This is it. And if we don’t want to see the worst of it lets stop it now while we can and call it what it is

Everybody is his/her own worst enemy here in this country. Democrats hate Republicans and vice versa.

Democrats are seen as race baiters who bring up race and gender identities and use them as identity politics as a talking argument in politics.  No one trusts the police anymore, for fear of every police encounter ending violently, or worse in the loss of life. Consequently, police recruitment rates are at an all time low. Everyone is talking about a possible civil war in the country between two opposing parties and a possible geopolitical war with China. We can no longer live in a country where we can agree to disagree on politics anymore, everything is an us vs them, you are either with us or against us mentality. Whatever side you choose, it’s damned if you do, damned if you don’t. 

In the big cities, cost of living is skyrocketing high, being unlivable even for middle income individuals. Homelessness is at an all-time high, which is either rooted in or is the cause of drug abuse. We haven’t had the America like in the 1950s where a high school graduate working as a car mechanic can afford to buy a house, feed his family, pay for his car and afford all the living expenses while at the same time the lady in the house is a housewife who does not work. Nowadays, a person with a masters degree can’t even afford to pay for an apartment. The middle class is decreasing in America. 

Because of all this, some sources many Americans are moving to other countries at a higher rate than before due to division and high cost of living.

Nothing but incels, racists, homophobes, wannabe sigma males, right wing propaganda, and charlatans etc. ""Waaaah I don't have a girlfriend"" ""Waaaah mens mental health"" ""Waaaah LGBTQ, women, and minorities bad"" ""Waaaah I miss my childhood simpler times"" ""Waaaah the world is ending"" ""Waaaah I have no friends"". Like, cry about it bro if you hate your life so much go do something about it go get a job or make some friends anything productive that will help, stop being a loser I am not a genie I can't grant you your wishes they are something you have to earn. One of the other biggest loser community is the ""sigma"" community of mentally stunted dudes who think they are ""high value men"" Ironically most of that community are not real men it consists of retarded teens or losers in their 30s. They ruin everything on TV I can't watch any classic movie such as American Psycho, superhero movies, Ryan Gosling movies, mafia movies, or Breaking Bad without some annoying garbage Yeat song playing in the back of my head because of those annoying ""sigma"" edits. They also follow their leader andrew tate like honestly I can criticize tate for his sexist views but honestly I cant totally hate him due to the fact that he is literally making money off these loser they just have to go grab mommy and daddys credit card and pay for his scam university thinking they will go far like that and he is profiting so honestly what a fair play. I can understand struggling in life I have been there I know people who are there and I give them all the help they need but that's all I can do is help they need to do the honors themselves. It is ok to struggle we are human it is not ok however to use that as an excuse to be a deplorable piece of shit promoting bigotry, violence, and harmful propaganda on the internet and anyone who participates in that does not deserve empathy and deserves to be laughed at.

""Women are oppressed"" and ""patriarchy!"" usually follows right next. 

Here are two arguments why this is total BS: 

1. While women do on average more unpaid work, men do on average more paid work. Put together, they spend almost equal time doing work (and almost equal amount of leisure time. Yes, wives spend much more time taking care of children but their husbands spend equal amount of time earning money (there is a reason why men suffer 90% of all workplace fatalities).
2. When left to their own preferences single women living alone do more unpaid work than single men living alone. They simply want to. And it's not just shopping, single women will do more  cooking, cleaning, ironing - you name it. At the same time single men will spend more time doing - paid work. Likewise, single fathers taking care of their children will do more paid work and less unpaid work than single mothers taking care of their children. Nobody is oppressing or exploiting anyone. 

You should obviously not take my word for it, so here is a post with [detail analysis of European data](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/12fudwf/eurostat_data_disproves_the_narrative_of_lazy_men/) and here is article taking about [data from Australia](https://bettinaarndt.substack.com/p/women-work-harder-than-men-phooey).

But if done correctly, it can in fact be one of the most appropriate and healthy things to do.

If your child is still not speaking at age 5 when all other kids have a normal speaking or vocabulary for a 5-year old, you need to get him to a speech therapist. Comparison is what lets you know that your child is not normal, and needs help.

If you are getting D's or F's in classes while all students around you are getting A's and B's, it's perfectly appropriate to wonder why. Maybe you have ADHD, dyslexia, or something that needs treating.

If you are earning only $50,000 a year as an engineer, but all the other engineers in your department are being paid six figures for the exact same type of work, then it's perfectly reasonable to compare and wonder why. It could be that there is some gender discrimination, racial discrimination, or something illegal that explains the wage discrepancy. It could be that your boss hates you for no good reason, or that you're under-performing and doing a bad job. Whatever it may be, comparison is perfectly reasonable in this situation and worth deep analysis.

If you're dissatisfied with your current lifestyle, but think about how you're already much better off than 90% of people in the rest of the world, that comparison can teach you gratitude and make you appreciate what you do have. Most people who are reading this post have clean water, for instance - electricity, food, a roof to live under, are not being sold into slavery, etc.

Now, of course, there is a comparison that **can** be unhealthy - such as the ""keeping up with the Joneses"" comparison where no matter how much you have, you can only think about those who have even more. There is also unrealistic comparison, such as wondering why your face and body doesn't look like that of a fashion model or Hollywood movie star. And if you spend TOO much time comparing, regardless of context, it can become unhealthy where you focus more on others than on yourself. But in many other instances, comparison is an entirely appropriate and healthy thing to do."

A big example is poverty and income inequality, there are constantly posts on this sub from conservatives arguing that these are the fault of poor people who simply don't have the right attitude towards life. Research has proven this to be false.  
  
Obesity, it's very easy to target individual obese people and blame them personally for the issue of obesity, and I get it. We have two options between what causes human behavior: genetics or environmental conditions. And genetics haven't changed, therefore environmental conditions have changed in a way that caused our obesity epidemic. For example, America's civil design is very unfriendly to walking or biking, portion sizes in the US are larger, the US has harsh working conditions compared to other first world countries which leave less time for exercise and preparing homemade meals, etc...  
  
This is not to say that individuals cannot defy the trend personally, but on a large scale that just isn't a solution.

I'm not some hyper capitalist horny for a completely unregulated market either. However, the progressive tax seems like it doesn't work because of all the tax code loopholes that allow the super rich to get away with paying very little taxes anyway. In my proposal, everyone would be subject to the same taxes, no exceptions. This would include receiving stocks in lieu of income (often used to circumvent income tax). Everybody pays according to what they earn, with a standard deductible that ensures people who barely make enough to get by are able to. Rather than abstractly ""stimulating the market"" by investing revenue into physical capital (\*cough\* Amazon \*cough\*), these companies and mega rich individuals can just pay according to what they make like everyone else.

I'm not exactly well off either. I just think paying 40+% of what you make is absurd (even more so with a progressive tax rate that goes over 50+% of your earnings). At the same time, people making millions (or billions) should not be able to get away with paying practically nothing just because they bought some stocks. I like the symbolism that everyone pays an equal cut."

Romantic relationships are different in the sense they are a choice for both parties and have different criteria.

I truly believe that my parents did not love me. I think one of the defining features of love is respecting boundaries and the security to set boundaries. I didn’t have either.

I can understand the difficulty of raising kids, but nobody put a gun to their heads and made them do it. They chose to have kids at a time in their life when they weren’t available to be proper loving parents. Obligation is not love.

Yes they wouldn’t know what love is unless they had somebody to model it. But that still doesn’t change the fact that after I try to make a change to get what I see to be “love” I am dismissed. Ok the version of love they were taught was dismissive, doesn’t mean they don’t love you, do I need to bend that far?"

Abbott, the Supreme Court found, to my understanding, that use of total population to draw state legislative districts was sufficient to meet the one person, one vote principal implied by the Equal Protections Clause of the 14th Amendment. However, I feel that this is incorrect.

It appears that the decision was grounded in the argument that there is significant interest in apportioning districts as to represent people who can not vote, hoping that their voting  neighbors can consider their interests and have a level of sympathy for them. However, I fail to see this interest.

When racial disenfranchisement was widespread, it was clear that, while there was also segregation, this was viewed as insufficient by racists. It was clear that the only way black people could have their interests represented was to be able to vote as the white southerners could simply not be expected to represent their interests. Of course, children and teenagers today are not oppressed in such a capacity. But there is still little way to determine that parents and voters in general are representing the interests of their kids.

Based on this, I feel that the one person, one vote principal would ideally lead to exactly equal turnout in all electoral districts. Of course this is simply not possible short of not having any constituencies at all and using a statewide method such as party list proportional representation.

 In this case, I feel the goal of the court should be to come up with an appropriate approximation. The use of voter registration to draw districts as done in the UK and as seemingly suggested by Alito's concurrence is an interesting question. However, there is still significant interest is using Census and ACS data rather than a registry, so I think VAP (voting age population) and CVAP (citizen voting age population) use should, at the very least, still be constitutional. However, I think the use of total population by Texas is a stretch.

As far as changing my view, I am less certain about my view stated above that parents and their communities can not be expected to electorally represent youth and my limited interpretation of the one person, one vote principal and would particularly appreciate discussion on these."

For those who don't wish to read what I've written then I will sum it up here quickly. No one should hold this much power without being elected, because at this point Elon Musk is reaching a point were nobody will be able to say No to him. He has a vast fortune that is greater than some countries meaning he can achieve things that could be straight out of a comic book. 

I want somebody to change my view, seriously. Because this man could be the change to the world we don't want to see. 

And for those who want to read why I think what I do, here goes... 

So this is my way of thinking now but I believe Elon Musk just one minor inconvenience away from turning into a supervillain. He never takes no as an answer and will always find a way of getting his own way! Elon has an IQ of somewhere between 150 to 155 which makes him one of the smartest people alive today. So he has the intelligence to do so much, good or bad things depending on his mood. It's a known fact that Elon Musk, has very little sympathy and empathy for his staff and even when his P.A asked for holiday he told her to take two weeks then fired her! He forced all this staff to attend work during the pandemic, claiming covid was nonsense and told that America would have zero cases. He is like a spoilt kid and hates when people confront him, even once telling an ex worker of SpaceX that confronted him that he would destroy him if he wrote a confession about the company. He has dismantled every workers union within his companies and wants Robots doing human work (we all know what the world would look like of that come true) but the fact is that Elon has the resources to make this happen...

Elon, pushed staff beyond breaking points and has told new young entrepreneurs that if they don't work 120 hours per week then they will never succeed and end up being failures. Who could maintain 120 hours per week? 

A villain could be somebody like Al Capone or Charles Manson as an example, but... A real supervillain would be somebody like Robert Mugabe, Kim Jong il, Kim Jong Un, Pol Pot, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler the list goes on and on but many of these people were mostly only villains in their own country. Killing people for a range of reason from wearing glasses to not worshipping a photo of them and of course killing them because of disabilities, faith and sexuality. 

Now, I am NOT comparing Elon Musk, to people like Hitler but wanted to point out that supervillains are real. Which reminds me that Elon, did compare the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to Hitler and also called a guy who recused a group of kids trapped in Thailand a pedophile. Elon Musk, is a big fan of freedom of speech, so I don't think he would care if people did compare him to the worse people in history? 

When he brought Twitter now known as X he said he would stop hateful comments but the complete opposite has happened. Hateful comments has doubled including anti semitic, anti gays and everything Inbetween. Seems like keeping us hating on each other is what he wants.

I'm going to end on Starlink! He convinced the American government that Starlink would help the American people stream services like Netflix quicker. These words got him the funding he needed and Starlink was born! And many infrastructure rely on Starlink giving him more power to a already bloated ego... And finally, he refused to turn on Starlink when Ukraine asked him for help with the war effort and he refused on the ground that he didn't want to escalate the war between Ukraine and Russia even tho a percentage of Starlink is owned by America and America is funding the Conflict in Ukraine heavily. Them warships were known to Elon when they were docked and virtually empty but instead he let them Russian warships bomb ships carrying much needed grain to a world already in a food crisis and also letting the warships bomb civilian areas killing people, while Ukrainian drones harmlessly floated ashore. Elon, could have halved the war! Did he do this just so he can carry on selling things to Russia after the war?

Please try not to turn the comment section onto solely about the Ukrainie war."

But virtue lies in this show nonetheless. query me why hate is prevelnt among the audiences 

0. overall; it's a fun watch both as a standalone tv show and as prequel to the main movie series(*) there are some ridiculous decisions that are hard to justify

 

1. visualls and casting; the effects don't look over CGIed like the Hobbit trilogy.
they have some of PJ 'feel' without repeating his motifs 1-2-1. the show is not in universe(*) of the PJ adaptation which makes sense for casting choises, while some aspects of the visuals don't feel LOTRy (breadless dwarves, guards with plastic looking armour and others) the scene construction is S tierd to compensate most scenes had at least one frame that looks iconic and matching the spirit of the universe. example: the sauron sword hilt time catching on fire looked good and iconic to the scene even if it's nonsensical lore wise.

2. language and characters; I'm guessing some Tolkien linguists can fight me on this as I'm not an expert but I do know some phrases and names in a few languages. and in my novice opinion the language usage is very good adiuotorily and in service of the plot as well.
 the characters actions are in service of the grand plot first and personal arc second. which was a concern for me in the beginning as I was fearing they would make Glady's character overfocused and overshadoweding the main plot.it didn't happen, she has major screen time but it is justified for the plot Galadriel potrail is on point I don't get the YouTube RPs hate for her so called feministic ""girl power"" have they read her lore? she was written to be hastly in her youth nvm I'm getting bored writing this moving on

3. pacing  and combact; the show flows pretty nicely. while the location changes make it hard to keep head on when/where are all. 

the pace in dialogue heavy scenes is never dragging while not cheapning the interaction in the marvely -snapy-quick-dialuge way. very fresh in today's media.

they combat is excellent; stakes feel real, no plot armour moments if there was big CGI moments I missed they were good as I didn't notice anything too obvious.

Russia knows it has no chance to be an economic superpower after the fall of the USSR, and having thousands of nukes or more practically make no difference when the outcome is the same, M.A.D. So Russia sacrificies itself as a pawn to weaken the West, by launching a war. It needed an enemy and an excuse that can justify it well. Ukraine is the perfect target.

The West falls for the trap by pumping its resources into Ukraine. China is laughing as they watch the show unfold. They know the more USA pump its resources into this conflict to sustain Ukraine, even if they can damage Russia, USA's enemy, the one that has the biggest, last laugh is still China.

Regardless of the outcome of this conflict, China will reign as the number one economic superpower. Its ambitions already showed signs when its boldly expanding its territories, soon becoming the inevitable master of the sphere that include the Southern China Sea. It even boldly publicly showed conflicts against India, evidently in its new ""standard map"", who is supposedly its BRICS ally. So it considers its ambition greater even than that.

And there's nothing the USA can do to stop it, when it is already fighting itself internally while on another front having to support Ukraine against Russia.

At worst, both Ukraine and Russia will be significantly damaged and weakened. Russia will be the sacrifice of the Eastern bloc to weaken the Western bloc so that China and reign and claim its throne, further building its ambitions by expanding its influence in the ASEAN region (Southern China Sea).

To clarify: I believe the war in Ukraine is unjust, and I'm not trying to justify Russia's actions"

Not the correct place. In a place of business, also not the correct place. I think it is in bad taste in those and similar situations.

But if a person chooses to indulge in entertainment like a movie, tv show or comedy club, it’s all fair game. Now that doesn’t make any and every joke great.

1,2023-09-10,CMV: Writing a letter to a judge as a character reference does not imply you don't believe someone did the bad thing they were convicted of,u/illini02,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16f3ker/cmv_writing_a_letter_to_a_judge_as_a_character/,changemyview,"This is spurred by the backlash to Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis writing letters as a character reference for Danny Masterson, but it can be applied to many things. 

People convicted of many crimes have others write character references to the judge prior to sentencing, and I don't believe that when that happens they necessarily think the person is innocent.  They are speaking to how they know them outside of the crime committed.  All this is so the judge can get a better picture of the person outside of the crime they have been convicted of and that can influence sentencing.   But at no point is that saying the person is innocent. 

I feel like a lot of the flak Ashton and Mila received is a bit unfair.   They were asked to do this as people who have known him for 20+ years.  They could have said no of course, but he was already going to jail for some period of time.   It didn't say he was innocent.  It didn't say they didn't believe the women who accused him.  All it said was that ""this is the person I know and this is what he did for me"".  

If you feel that these character references have no place in the justice system, that is fine.  But I think being upset that people write them at the request of lawyers is a bit much. 

I also feel that many people would do the same for someone they have known for 20+ years, and people are being a bit hypocritical.    I know if my little brother or close friend committed a crime and was going to jail, it would be hard for me to refuse to do it, even if I agree that they deserve to go to jail."

My claim is that Reddit, despite being free to use and widely accessible to the majority of the industrialized West, does not accurately reflect the overall societal view on any given post or topic.

My reasoning for this claim is threefold:

1) Any given post must be made within an existing subreddit with its own base of users. The users interacting with any given post on a subreddit is necessarily biased because they tend to be users with a higher enthusiasm or positive affinity toward said topic/subreddit.

2) Reddit as a whole attracts individuals who are more inclined to seek external affirmation for their actions or beliefs, hence the incentive behind most posts to begin with. This results in the active population base of reddit leaning toward a certain personality type that tends to value others' opinions relatively more. 

3) The reddit karma economy is specifically designed to promote a central viewpoint within each subreddit. By default, dissenting opinions are relegated to the bottom of the thread where they are much less likely to be seen and interacted with. In addition, mods have absolute discretion in removing comments and banning users for offering dissenting views, with no standard for justification. This exasperated by the fact that mods tend to be proponents of whatever topic the sub is associated with. As a result, the aggregate views of a subreddit tends to progress toward an extreme rather than balance out in neutral fashion over time.

This is not to say what is good/bad but simply an observation I believe to be true based on my time on Reddit."

Biden started off this battle by being brutally honest with the American people. He made it very clear that anyone who denies elections poses a serious threat ar to the USA by doing so. A good American accepts the results of elections; they don’t deny them. We can disagree on the big issues, but you’re not a good American if you deny that the election was fair *without proof*. And I think Biden emphasized that point perfectly. If you’re an American who denies elections, American is just a description of your passport, not who you are. An American who *didn’t* have contempt for everything that we stand for would not deny elections, again, without proof, and **especially** they would not deny their elections in an illegal manner.

Of course, words should be backed by actions, and, while of course Biden can’t charge anybody, his DOJ has done a great job cracking down on election denial when it’s done in an illegal manner. For example, the DOJ has arrested multiple people on Jan 6 charges and while most are under-sentenced, it sends a good message. Same with the Jan 6 charges related to Trump and charges related to asking Georgia to overturn their election. The government has done a good job of letting the good people know that election deniers will not be tolerated. The best way to stop election denial is to absolutely crack down on it. With the Trump arrests and most importantly the Jan 6 arrests, the government has let it be known that we will *not* let election deniers harm the very fabric of this country. 

Now, to be fair, I’m not saying we can’t complain about the electoral process itself. It’s perfectly fine to think elections should be done in x manner or y manner, but if you want to claim the process was carried out in a rigged manner, then you should have to give proof for your claim. Accusations require proof."

The chiropractor on duty promptly came over to let me know how he could fix all my health ailments. Back issues! Period pain! Even weight loss! Whatever was ailing me, this chiropractor was on it. Sadly after 5 minutes of care, $50 per session for a month, absolutely nothing improved. A small 2 minute relief sensation, similar to cracking my neck or knuckles came on, it was gone before walking out of the office. 

Based on my research, chiropractic care, I’m sorry to say, is little more than the buffoonery of a 19th-David Palmer, a lunatic who derived most of his medical theory from séances. Though it has evolved a bit since it’s inceptions (working on muscles with massage, electric pulses, etc), chiropractic beliefs seem dangerously far removed from mainstream medicine, and the vocation’s practices have been linked to strokes, herniated discs, and even death. Chiropractors can’t replace your doctor, and I’m amazed that they’re still even utilized and referred to. 

From what I can manage to find, the defining principle of chiropractic is that health is a state that can be either maintained or lost due to vertebral subluxations. Chiropractors claim that tending to vertebral subluxations stimulates your spinal cord and nervous system, and since your spine and the attached nervous system send signals to everything in your body, if you stimulate the spine through chiropractic adjustments, you will improve the health and vitality of your entire body.

Though there may be anecdotal evidence about pain management, etc., I have not found one licensed surgeon or solid physician who has declared chiropractic care as a well to do treatment; in fact it has been the opposite.

Based on word from my PCP and PT, along with my brother in law (Head Neurosurgeon at Craig Hospital in Denver, CO), they have cautioned me that this will do more harm than good, and is just a money grab for the so called doctors.

1,2023-09-11,CMV: think there should be way more strict rules for child support (for the person receiving the money).,u/kehton,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16floh4/cmv_think_there_should_be_way_more_strict_rules/,changemyview,"Child support should come on a card, you should only be able to purchase approved items (clothing, school supplies, baby food, etc.) and the other parent should have access to see what you are purchasing. I have seen people blow child support money on stupid stuff before, like buying them selfs new clothing or getting their hair/nail done etc. I know someone who even spent child support on crack… I do not talk to that person anymore. I’m not sure if this is legal to do, but if it is, it should be illegal. The system I have set up would make it much harder for someone to do these things. They would have to sell their card to someone they know who also needs to buy stuff for their kids to be able to turn it into cash and “blow” it on unnecessary item. Of course this system wouldn’t be perfect but the issues could be ironed out over time. I think if our government did this they would find out that a lot of people overpay for child support…

And I know that child support is also supposed to help cover rent and food. To make this possible part of the child support could automatically go toward rent/utilities ys (or just a bigger portion of rent) and there could be a set amount that could be spent on food for the child. 

The only issue I could see this system having is the PARTNERS could essentially stalk their SO and see what they are buying and possibly find out where they are going and they to meet them there. There could be system in place to prevent this but if it was too risky for the someone I guess this feature could be taken away. 

If there is any part of this you disagree with please let me know why. I think as long as you are using the child support as you are supposed to you should not have an issue with this. The only issue i personal have is that the government gets more control over you and can see what you are purchasing and decide what your child needs for you. But i still think the benefits outweigh the negatives. 

Sorry if it seems like I started to ramble at the end. I thought I wasn’t hitting the character/word requirement, but I didn’t have a “CMV” in the title lol."

Back when tv was well tv that is to say cable tv with shows coming in at scheduled times the openings served 2 purposes. 

1. Letting people be a little late and not miss anything. 

2. Serving as a advertisement for the show of anyone who stumbled across it but mostly for the people who were watching the previous show. 

As a side note the best way to use openings for these two purposes was 

previously on -> opening -> current episode 

Doing it any other way is just dumb imo. so feel free to try to change that opinion too. 

But now we current technology most people stream their shows and even if you watch cable you can record your shows and even rewind live tv so reason 1 is completely gone and reason 2 is severely reduced. Streaming services have even added a skip opening button explicitly because it serves no purpose. 

In addition some of the best most popular shows of all time have had a very very short opening, breaking bad and Heroes come to mind.

The reason I want my view changed is because every show still has one and it's annoying and I want to know there's an actual purpose to it."

For the people saying that if someone would not be okay with my past then they would never be a good partner anyway, you are valid but that doesn’t change the fact, you will still find it harder because now you just added a different component to the puzzle. A lot of people with that past will probably have to settle with someone who is less than ideal or simply have to search much longer than if they didn’t have that past. The fact of the matter is that having a promiscuous past is a negative to your dating profile… like in men, being short is a negative as well so either they will settle for someone less than ideal or they willl search longer than the average joe, being promiscuous for women is the same thing, especially if you had high standards before. If a women wants a guy that’s tall rich and handsome, but she had a promiscuous past, the chances that the man chooses her instead of his other options who maybe don’t have that same past  is slim to none. Same could be said again for short men, let’s say he wants to date a model… well that model probably has a bunch of other options that don’t have that negative that her choosing him is slim to none."

This is our permanent home, and I plan to stay here till I die. At age 41, I've never had any debt - not even a credit card, and don't ever plan to. I'm vehemently ""anti-debt"" (only for myself, no judgment on others) and I will die without ever taking a loan.

If anything, an increase in value will increase my property taxes - a bad thing! From my perspective, I benefit not at all from my house being worth double, triple, or even quadruple of what I paid for it.

It makes no sense to include my condo's value in my net worth. My retirement savings are my stocks and bonds. Including the house value in the net worth appears to be nothing more than a vanity exercise, since it has no impact on my life, which would remain the same whether the condo value doubled or halved. Why should I care?

1) It launched as a spring offensive, and we are now into the fall with relatively minimal gains across the frontlines. Winter is around the corner which will severely limit future progress, and allow Russia to rebuild and reinforce defenses. In short, the window for making significant inroads into occupied territory has already passed or is quickly closing.

2) Russia can sustain the meat grinder for a long, long time, probably moreso than Ukraine. They have the numbers and weapons to throw into a conflict of attrition, the latter of which are now being supplied by other countries. This has been essential in reinforcing defenses so far.

3) People use Kharkiv as an example to wait but that is a bad comparison. This is a much, much larger territory and much, much deeper defenses. Ukraine was supposed to prod for weaknesses as a launching point for the counter, and yet here we are months later with still no big breakthrough (except Robotyne but that is TBD, and was a big deal only relative to no other big successes happening).

4) The defenses themselves, as mentioned, which were designed to slow Ukraine down for months and they worked. Russia can rebuild them and add some even further down the line, during the winter months. The defenses will only get better, not worse."

However, I see some worrying signs that, when all put together, I believe points toward a Chinese invasion of Taiwan being likely in the near future.

**Russia/Ukraine:** The whole world is focusing on the war in Europe. Since China's pretty vocally taken Russia's side in this war, and supported them materially, I think that invading Taiwan isn't beneath them. Additionally, while the world is distracted by Russia/Ukraine, this gives China the perfect opportunity to ready its forces and strike when nobody's paying attention. 

**The 2024 US election:** Donald Trump loves dictators like Putin and Xi because he wants to be one. Even if Trump doesn't become a dictator domestically, Xi knows that if Trump becomes President again (which I firmly believe he will), he is unlikely to support Taiwan the way Biden has. I believe this will embolden Xi to make a move sooner rather than later.

**Travel Advisory:** The US State Department has recently placed a Level 3 Travel Warning against mainland China, which means ""Reconsider Travel."" The stated reason is because of the risk of detention and arbitrary enforcement of local laws. I think this means that the State Department knows something we don't want to admit; namely, that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is imminent and that any American who travels to China as a tourist in the near future risks being detained and imprisoned a la Brittney Griner. 

**Taiwan is not Ukraine, and China is not Russia:** I'll admit that there are parallels between the two situations; if I didn't think there were, I wouldn't have written this post. Even with the Russian army's incompetence, Ukraine is struggling to take back their territory. But Taiwan is an island that can easily be blockaded in an invasion, and I think China would win pretty quickly. China has a far more advanced army than Russia, and far more people to mobilize in the event of war. Additionally, Xi is much smarter than Putin and is learning from Russia's invasion of Ukraine so that he doesn't repeat Putin's mistakes. Given that Russia's likely to win against Ukraine eventually, why wouldn't China go for a much easier war than Ukraine?

I hope I'm wrong. "

So just after the WORLD CHAMPS have been declared: Germany, the American media is turning its eye towards the Olympics. 

Fine. 

Now I read in the comment section from multiple people (100% Americans) “we gonna send our best team and be the real world champs. 

Why won’t/can’t Americans comprehend or accept the fact that world champions aren’t the same as nba champions and neither are the Olympics champions. 

When you win the Olympics, you are the Olympic champion, and still not the world champions.

The only reason the Olympics carry more weight than the FIBA World Cup is because the Olympic committee found a way to enable professional athletes to participate in 1992 in the Olympics, thus it became more elusive (and lucrative) to win the the Olympics rather than the World Cup. 

Either way: here is the proposition to change my view.

The hedonic treadmill is the idea that an individual’s level of happiness, after rising or falling in response to positive or negative life events, ultimately tends to move back toward where it was prior to these. In other words, we adapt to our circumstances and return to a baseline level of happiness that is largely determined by our personality and genetics.

I think the hedonic treadmill is real because it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. If we were constantly happy or unhappy, we would lose motivation to pursue our goals and adapt to our environment. By having a stable set point of happiness, we can maintain a balance between satisfaction and dissatisfaction, which drives us to seek new experiences and challenges. Happiness is not a destination, but a journey.

I also think the hedonic treadmill is real because it is supported by empirical evidence. Many studies have shown that people’s happiness levels tend to fluctuate around a relatively stable mean over time, regardless of external events and changes in their lives. For example, lottery winners and paraplegics both experience a temporary change in their happiness after winning or losing their limbs, but they eventually return to their pre-event levels of happiness. Similarly, people who marry or divorce tend to revert to their previous levels of happiness after a few years.

Of course, this does not mean that nothing can affect our happiness in the long term. Some factors, such as social relationships, health, and meaningful work, can have a lasting impact on our well-being. However, these factors are not necessarily dependent on external circumstances, but rather on our internal values, goals, and attitudes. We can choose to cultivate these factors in our lives, regardless of what happens to us.

So, that’s my view on the hedonic treadmill. I think it is a realistic and useful concept that helps us understand human nature and happiness. I’m open to hearing other perspectives and arguments that might challenge my view. Please be respectful and civil in your responses. Thank you for reading."

While some individuals may not be considered conventionally attractive in terms of their facial features, there is hope for them to enhance their overall attractiveness.

The best way to achieve this is by building muscle. Having a well-developed physique, especially with bulky muscles, can significantly improve one's appearance. Muscular bodies are powerful and attractive, and they can help individuals enhance their self-confidence and desirability. Boosting them from a 2/10 to a solid 8, at least.

A very extreme, silly, yet perfect example is Shrek. A literal ogre. Not desirable by most, in his normal form. But have you seen the meme of him super ripped and buff? I instantly would spread my legs for Shrek. (I’m not kidding)

So yes I believe that muscles make a man instantly attractive, no matter now unattractive their face is."

Their stance is very clearly that if legal, more customers would seek prostitutes, and thus employers would be encouraged to press as many workers as possible into sex work to meet the rising demand, thus increasing the actual amount of people harmed by sex work.

However most people arguing for that stance seemed to argue the inherent moral wrongness of a person having to engage in sex work, and thus want the profession phased out from society, and seem to imply that sex work should be further shunned and repressed.
That is where my question comes in:

What are the prevailing theories on how to reduce demand for pornography and sex work if demand is truly the biggest issue?

To clarify, I fully understand the explanation, science, and data to support that stance. I'm not asking for reasons for or against, just a clear and comprehensive explanation for how demand for pornography and sex work could be reduced or eliminated."

I don't like it when people touch my things, especially my mobile and laptop. I have trust issues with others. Even though I call him a friend, he's just someone I know from high school.  
  
The main reason I feel this way is that I don't trust anyone with my personal information. I'm afraid that my PC and mobile have sensitive data, and if someone gets access, I could be in trouble. It's bothering me even though I know he didn't mess with anything important. I think this might be a mental issue."

I think that people like to throw this term around because it keeps that mental barrier in place that separates us against the other animals we share our planet with. It allows us to justify the inhumane ways we’ve treated them since humans have begun to walk the Earth. How dare we be so arrogant to think that something such as love is a uniquely human experience and not a universal one?"

I think a corporation should have equal fiduciary responsibility to thier workers and shareholders.

My understanding is that when Ford lost the case, it cemented the idea that the main responsibility is to make a return for the shareholders above all else... this needs to change otherwise we are headed towards hyper corporate dystopian future."

Dangerous by the looks of things.  However, the sentiment is shared, albeit in another direction - The U.K. may have rich history, a capital city that could be a country in and of itself, and the most soft power of any country not named the U.S., but this means that it should be up for criticism and polemics as much as the U.S. is. And for some reason, on this site especially... it isn't.

Any amount of time spent scrolling down a subreddit like /unpopularopinion will net a bunch of posts about how Americans behave abhorrently abroad, act as if they are the center of the universe, assume that the world has an encyclopedic knowledge of American cities, towns etc... all while totally ignoring this same behavior from British tourists. 

As a Greek person, the amount of British tourists who came to Greece and whined ad nauseum about how they did not serve fish and chips, pork pies, and other British sundries, complained about Athens being dirty whilst urinating in the street, acting as loutish and oafish as they could and calling the natives ""rude"" for not immediately speaking English was... noticeable to say the least. 

Living in Paris for three years has exposed me to this exact same behavior and it is why I treat anecdotes about Parisians being ""rude"" and ""snooty"" with much scrutiny and that sometimes these tourists who were treated so horribly in Paris omit and miss out information when sharing their anecdotes. This is to say nothing of the fact there there are almost never any stories, glowing or otherwise, about the other 10 or so major cities in France (Marseille is somewhere I would move to if I continue to live in France) where there are more English speakers.

Then it comes back to this ""rich history."" There is much furore about France's colonial past on many news channels right now and how there is a reckoning in African countries such as Senegal with France's centuries long plundering of various parts of Africa. Great!

...except The UK has also plundered much of the known world, especially Africa, and yet there is not nearly the amount of pushback, condemnation or even acknowledgement of how the UK AND France are some of the worst offenders when it comes to colonialism and imperialism. Why is that? My own country has had its hand in colonizing significant parts of the world, Africa included, and there would be a arduous search to find someone who thinks that mentioning our food, our status as the genesis of Western civilization, and producing beautiful men and women is a conversation ender when it comes to Greek colonialism. Yet, when it comes to the UK, just mention the Queen, it's founding of countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S., or this supposedly hilarious brand of humor that they have (I do not see the appeal) and all of it's transgressions are treated like conversation fillers. What other countries have this kind of a get out of jail free card?

I also see it placed above other European countries that have contributed just as much if not more to World History such as Portugal, Belgium, France (who are neck and neck with the U.K. in many metrics and outperform them as it pertains to healthcare, work/life balance, cost of living etc), Spain (a country that quietly does liberalism and democracy WAY better than the UK does), Italy and Germany (probably the most underrated out of all Western European countries especially in the realms of art and history) as if the U.K. just leaves all of these countries in the dust despite some of these countries having a much better QoL than the UK. 

And better food.

And then I return to my first point - that if someone just doesn't like the U.K. , that there is this pervading attitude that it must be a ""them"" problem as if the U.K. is just ""exempt"" from criticism because of it's standing, historically and presently, on the world stage. Someone is allowed to not like their time in a country or think that a country gets undue praise, or to point out that it has many of the same issues that other countries are roundly criticized for without the same level of pushback.

 What is it about this island that brings out the cult member in some?

To start, I have played roughly 12 hours, and the only reason I continued that long was because I read or heard somewhere that was when the game *really* opened up. It's not. It doesn't amazingly become better after this mark. The game remains a deeply boring experience and it shows Bethesda hasn't used their time wisely. 

The same problems and glitches their older titles had, remain here as well. The graphics are improved, yes but they're not amazing. The combat is mediocre, just like their other titles. None of these are deal breakers for me though. 

The reason I enjoyed Bethesda games was exploring. Seeing something far away and saying, *I am gonna go there* and along the way run into interesting characters, quest and items. Starfield tries to replicate this feeling but after some time, it begins to get boring. It's not near the level we are use to getting with titles like Fallout and Elder Scrolls. 

Anyway, that is my view. Bethesda did not utilize their time wisely. Had they really used all these years to put forth a strong game, I don't believe we'd see hardly as much controversy. "

1. I used to be a terrible driver when I was younger, and frequently got honked at due to not paying attention and other bad habits. 
2. 2. During the past few years I've tried to never honk at people as a way to practice patience and compassion.    

Now, I honk (just once, not over the top) at people when they cut me off, typically the most aggregious ones, people slowly pulling out in front of me on a 40mph road, causing me to abruptly slow down.  

I do this because when I was younger, all those honks made me reconsider my driving behavior. Getting honked at sucks. It makes me feel ashamed. So I assume that others feel the same way.  

I believe I am a safer driver now, partly from getting honked at. If no one ever honked at me, I may have continued my behavior longer.  

So, I believe it makes safer drivers when we honk when we get cut off. "

The argument is that that we should spend this money and resources to fix our own problems.

The biggest reason why Russia is invading Ukraine is that they are afraid of Ukraine joining nato and just generally being pro West/Pro America. Essentially, Ukraine is being punished by Russia for being America’s ally. 

The American allies in Eastern Europe and Asia and facing a lot of pressure from China and Russia for being an American ally. For example, in 2016, China imposed economic sanctions against South Korea for the deployment of the US THAAD missile. This deeply hurt the economy in South Korea. 

By not supporting Ukraine against Russia, the US is sending a messages to the world and especially its allies that if American’s enemies retaliate against you for being an ally, the US will not back you up or doesn’t have the financial and military power to do so. 

This is not just in the case of active war, but other power struggles as well. It can push countries like S. Korea and Vietnam towards China’s side.

That is to say, I believe in a deterministic universe with reliable cause-and-effect *and* that free will is incompatible with such a universe. I want to believe differently, because it's hard (or even impossible) to reconcile this with personal responsibility and beliefs in my own life, and as such it has led me to having some unconventional views like the one in the title, and also feeling powerless over my life.



I believe this whole-heartedly, but the following example for why I believe this way is adopted from Pereboom's Four-Cases argument:    



1. Imagine a scientist uses electric stimulation to the brain to control and manipulate Bob's every action. He then makes Bob kill someone. As Bob had no control or ability to act freely or otherwise, he is not the one responsible for the murder.



2. Treating like cases alike, we can imagine a situation where the scientist, from a temporal distance, ""programs in"" the relevant psychological details onto Bob's brain that will lead Bob to commit murder at a later point. Bob lives his life normally until he commits murder. Since there is no relevant difference between this case and the first case, Bob is not acting freely and therefore is not morally responsible for his actions.



3. If we change the ""electric manipulation"" to a lifelong indoctrination of Bob as a child that eventually leads to the psychological and nuerological makeup in Bob's brain committing murder, there is no relevant difference between this and the ""pre-programming"" from a temporal distance the scientist did in #2. Therefore, Bob was not acting freely and therefore not morally responsible for his actions.



4. Lastly, assuming we do live in a world where reliable cause-and-effect exists, anyone who commits murder can have the source of their action traced back in its entirely to originating conditions outside of their control. Therefore, they are not acting freely and are not morally responsible for their actions."

If you don't love your job but it's tolerable and helps you live a life you love, that should be a massive win. I tolerate my job.

I am convinced that most women expect a high level of sensitivity towards their own issues but rarely extend that sensitivity to men's specific challenges. Men also have their own problems, but these often seem to play no role in public discourse.  
  
Reasons for My Stance:  
Selective Empathy: Women often place great value on empathy for women's issues, such as workplace discrimination or sexual harassment. Yet, when it comes to men's issues like high suicide rates or child custody battles, this empathy is often not reciprocated.  
  
Feminism and Misandry: Many women claim that feminism is also beneficial for men. However, it seems that those who identify as feminists often employ a misandric rhetoric that minimizes understanding for men's issues.  
  
Social Media and Narrative: Numerous campaigns and hashtags focus on women's issues in social media. Men's issues rarely appear as viral topics, suggesting that they are considered less important.  
  
Structural Disadvantages: Women can rely on a wide range of organizations and resources that focus on their specific problems. Corresponding structures for men are much rarer and often less funded.  
  
Lip Service: Even when women claim to understand men's problems, it often remains superficial acknowledgment. These women think that a brief nod towards men's issues is enough, without truly grasping the depth of the topics.  
  
In the grand scheme of things, I fear that the current trend will lead to further divergence in the understanding of issues affecting both genders. Additionally, I've noticed a growing trend on platforms like Reddit where more men are trying to bring attention to men's specific issues. Unfortunately, this often meets with dismissive reactions, especially from women. Comments like ""Oh look, another man who thinks men have it harder than women"" are not uncommon and only serve to widen existing misunderstandings and the gender gap.  


  
I want to emphasize that I am for taking the problems of both genders seriously. I am fully aware that there are countries where women do not even enjoy basic human rights. Therefore, my thread is specifically directed at people living in ""First World"" countries, where we have the luxury of even having such discussions."

Most are settled outside of courts. Both parents agree the mom should have primary custody. 

When the judges sees it, i think who ever knows the child more should have primary custody. If you want primary custody during the times you should have been more involved with the kid. It should have been talked about with your partner. Ask your partner to work some if money is tight. If you still have a child and tell the mom to stay home because it's not worth her being at work, be prepared in the event of divorce she will have the primary custody. 

It just doesn't make sense to me that people who are working full time with a stay at home parent think that anything should change. If that was the arrangement prior divorce, why should the child rearing suddenly land on YOU? You didn't do 50/50 then why do it now?"

Many non-vegans when criticizing vegan diets will say that there are certain essential nutrients, such as vitamin B12 (bacteria based), etc., which can only be obtained through the consumption of animal products.


We now have pill and other supplements to get any essential nutrient without consuming animals.

Many would then object and say that it's ""not natural.""

And to be honest, I don't care if it's natural or not. We now have the technology to reduce suffering, so we might as well use it.

Furthermore, where do you think these animals are getting their B12 from? They're getting it from artificial supplements as well. Farm animals are given vitamin supplements, hormones, and antibiotics daily. Since factory farms account for 99% of meat, this is not very natural

So rather than putting the supplements through an animal that must be tortured and killed, why not just go to the source? The lab."

It isn't selling anymore. So retro horror for example. It can cost £800 for a copy of Kuon or Rule of Rose. Titles like Parasite Eve, Project Zero/Fatal Frame are expensive too. The only person making money from this is the person selling it second hand. You have two options, allow somebody who has it exploit how rare it is to own a copy and mark up the price by 500% or emulate it. Also if you pirate physical copies of them like what's happening with older Pokémon games, less people are getting exploited paying £140 for a copy of Pokémon SoulSilver. A game that only costs that much because it isn't being copied anymore. That £140 isn't going to Nintendo, it's going to the seller taking advantage of the customer selling a game for more than it's RRP. More physical copies of abandonware = less people being scammed out of their money because the game becomes less rare. It's basic supply and demand but places like eBay and second hand stores like Cex are taking full advantage of the low supply and high demand. 

Tl;dr the team who developed the game aren't losing money from you pirating it and people who do own the game and are selling it are extorting as much value out of it as the demand will let them."

For context, I am a 22-year-old male living in a metropolitan city of more than 4 million people.  
  
I should also specify which platforms I am referring to: Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, snapchat, and any other short form / superficial attention-based platform.   
  
Time and time again in debates about social media, people talk about how it is good for connecting, educating, and bringing people together. This is not true! No one admits it, but every single person on planet earth who uses these platforms is addicted to them. I would go as far as to call them clinical addictions. Because everyone will objectively agree that social media is mostly bad, yet most people continue with their habits, refusing to click two buttons to delete a digital app on their phones.  
  
3 years ago, I deleted all these platforms, and I made some very interesting observations:   
  
1. I did not realize this at the time, but my first reaction in any moment of inactivity, mindless idling, or lack of work was to pull out my phone and go on Instagram, snapchat, etc. even if I had no notifications or messages. I would open my phone, open the app, go through the feed and stories that I had already seen, constantly refreshing in hopes of finding new content. This is addiction, no one can tell me otherwise. And I see this in all people my age, slightly older, and younger. 

  
2.	Social media has made everyone socially awkward and insecure (proven by research)

  
3.	People no longer live in the moment. When I quit social media, I learned to just observe the world. To simply look around my apartment at the clock, the streets outside the window, the cars, the people, and to make mental notes of everything I am seeing. I learned to think in moments of inactivity and reflect in silence rather than filling that silence with the buzz of Instagram on my phone.

   
4.	I encourage my friends to delete social media, but none of them agree with it. They give different excuses. A lot of my single friends say that without social media you can’t meet a girl nowadays. That every time you meet someone, they will ask for your Instagram to analyze who you are and what you look like before agreeing to meet again. This is so toxic and wrong, and completely removes the whole point of social interaction and learning about someone by conversing with them. Another excuse is that they will get bored, which brings me to my next point…

  
5.	People’s attention spans have been destroyed. The lack of constant stimulation from a feed leaves people bored after just 1 minute. That is absurd. People no longer have the patience to read, reflect, think, or observe the world. My friend said the other day that he doesn’t work out because it is ‘boring’ and he just waits until it’s over. That is absurd. Exercising is supposed to be a time that you can think and exert yourself in a solo or team setting. Its an opportunity to socialize or reflect and improve. People don’t go on walks to observe the world and trees anymore, they’d rather watch reels and TikTok all day.

  
6.	Kids are being exposed to mature content way earlier, reinforcing childhood porn addictions, sexual desensitization as young as 8 years old, violent desensitization, and destruction of the dopamine complexes in their minds. They are become used to sexualizing women and normalizing it, idolizing bad behavior, and learning to crave the attention of others for validation.  
  
My separation from social media directly/indirectly resulted in many things, I slowly quit my porn addiction, did way better at university, became a more confident social person, became more athletic, and financially did well enough for myself to move out and start my own life. I firmly believe this is because I detached myself from social media, freeing up chunks of time I was wasting and liberating my mind from the cesspool of constant stimulation on those apps. I could make 100 more points that would support this, yet no one agrees with me enough to embark on detachment from the hell that is social media. Which leads me to believe that maybe I am wrong. Can you change my view?

I believe in consensual sex. I believe that everyone has the right to refuse having sex if they want to. It’s a crime to force someone to have sex with you if they don’t want, and it should be.


However, I wish we lived in a world where women wanted sex and promiscuity as much as men. The stories that I’ve heard from gay men have made me realize how much the grass is greener out there. Gay men have one night stands all the time. Not saying that all gay men are promiscuous, but a substantial number of them are, which just gets to show how promiscuous straight men could have been if they were not restrained by women.


If a gay man is horny, he can just open grindr and find a sex partner in less than in a minute. Or go to the nearest bathhouse and fuck and get fucked until he passes the fuck out. 

Gay men don’t have to deal with the same issues that straight men have. They don’t need to spend months on dating apps, pay for dates and gifts without getting laid, getting friend-zoned and called a creep, resorting to onlyfans and masturbation, etc.

I swear to god, if you are morbidly obese, ugly, worst personality ever and live in the most homophobic country in the world, I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU ARE GAY, even if only a tiny bit, you can still get laid for free. 

That’s understandable. Women’s physiology and psychology did not evolve for promiscuity. Women have much less testosterone than men, and therefore they are less horny. It’s literally impossible to live in a world where women are horny as men. Unless we force them to, which would be immoral.

I didn’t make this post to hate on women. I just wish we lived in a better world. A world where we could be who we are without shame. We only have one life. There is no afterlife. Then why not enjoy it the way we want?"

intentionally: someone might preform an untraceable murder by luck (maybe there is a rainstorm immediately after that washes away evidence), but i dont think you could preemptively account for all possibilities and eliminate the evidence.

untraceable: cannot be found no matter what. most murders dont get solved because the police are lazy or the victim is homeless or poor. that doesnt count. untraceable means the full might of the fbi could not locate the killer no matter how much they wanted to.

I'm sure that there are many who would genuinely take issue with this stuff anyways, but it seems pretty clear that the *obsessive* nature of the right wing's focus on this issue is because it's an easy, convenient one for them to use as a draw.

They can't talk about the economy

They can't talk about civic health or integrity in office

They have nothing else to appeal to voters, but they can run endless, contextless clips of needledicks like Ben Shapiro or Matt Walsh **""ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING""** some blue-haired college sophomore who doesn't know how to formulate an argument yet.

1,2023-09-12,CMV: One cannot live with a free conscience knowing that slave/child labor was used to mine the cobalt used for the batteries in the devices they use every day,u/monkeymalek,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16gmpno/cmv_one_cannot_live_with_a_free_conscience/,changemyview,"Lately, I've been deeply reflecting on the moral ramifications of the technology we use daily. It's no secret that much of the cobalt used in batteries for devices like smartphones and laptops is often mined using child or forced labor in hazardous conditions, especially in regions like the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

**My Perspective:**

1. **Intertwined Guilt:** Knowing the sufferings of these laborers, it feels inherently wrong to benefit from such exploitation. Every time we use our devices, are we not indirectly supporting and perpetuating this system?

2. **Modern Dependency vs. Ethical Compromise:** While electronic devices are essential in today's world, does our reliance on them excuse us from the moral compromise of indirectly supporting unethical labor practices? How can one balance between necessity and ethical responsibility?

3. **Our Moral Duty:** If we are aware of these exploitative practices, shouldn't we, as consumers, demand change? By continuing to buy and use these devices without pushing for change, are we not morally complicit?

**Anticipated Counterarguments:**

1. **Complex Supply Chain:** I anticipate others will claim that the supply chain's intricate nature means many consumers might be unaware of the origin of the materials in their devices. Does ignorance absolve one of responsibility?

2. **Responsibility of Companies:** Some might argue that the primary responsibility lies with the companies, not the end-users. If companies are transparent and take measures to address these issues, does it alleviate the consumer's guilt?

3. **Advocacy as a Solution:** Another perspective could be that by acknowledging these issues and advocating for change, consumers can reconcile with the moral implications. Does active advocacy absolve one's conscience?

I sincerely wish to understand varying views on this matter. I believe it's essential to be conscious of the ethical dimensions of our consumption, but I'm open to insights on whether one can truly live with a clear conscience under these circumstances.

Now I’m not trying to justify being elitist about tastes, but as someone who’s incredibly obsessed with art and media, I feel that there are objective standards you can compare work from each type of medium to. 

For example, objective qualities music can have include proper mixing, vocal technique, technical skill, lyrical ability. Film has even more, with framing, continuity, audio engineering, editing. And with film you have a lot less freedom to break these rules. On top of that, you can also factor in context and impact of the work. If an album is the first to do a certain sound or style that catches on, if it executes a unique concept well, or the progression from the artist them self, these are all ways to compare the placing specific music has among art itself. 

As I mentioned, this is an argument that could be used to justify shitting on people’s tastes, but I am more focused on the opposite. I find it ignorant when people completely dismiss works of art that are almost unanimously considered the bests of their respective media and genres. I personally have never really been into the Beatles, but if I said the Beatles suck, my opinion would be hardly valid. We don’t have to be negative towards works that don’t fit these qualities, but I think in the art world it’s important to make these distinctions and give credit to anything groundbreaking, requiring immense skill, or just generally high quality."

However, most of the time, censorship tends to lead to more censorship. And looking into the past at various totalitarian regimes, wasn't censorship almost always one of the first steps the government took? This gave rise to the famous quote from Heinrich Heine's play Almansor: ""Dort wo man Bücher verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am Ende Menschen."" (""Where they burn books, they will also ultimately burn people."") More than a hundred years later, the Nazis burned copies of this play. They did indeed later go on to burn people.

That was an extreme example of censorship. It does not always come in the form of the government burning books. Sometimes a government censors, or pressures other entities to censor, certain types of opinions, beliefs, and even scientific information. 

To change my view, you would have to convince me that censorship either is not a slippery slope (if you censor one thing, it will not lead to censoring another thing) or that unchecked censorship does not lead to authoritarianism.

2. Transgender women with male physiques walking into bathrooms for women, making them uncomfortable through the stress of social norms. (everywhere) vs Transmen walking into a man's bathroom, which doesn't intimidate most men.
3. Transgender women in jail impregnating other inmates. (New Jersey) vs A transgender male in a male jail. Just picture that for a moment.

It comes across like when people who critique Israel have to defend themselves as not being antisemitic. 

The whole backlash came across as an internet crusade rather than a fight for what was important, something that was popular rather than valid. A movement for people that wanted to feel like they were helping rather than actually helping.

HP is a huge franchise, that is extremely popular, brought millions of people joy, and taught millions of children to read, including myself. I am not an HP super fan, and can definitely see the flaws in the writing, but do love the books despite. I completely understand and agree with the a lot of the post book meddling being in poor taste, and the social media posts of JK needing a lot to be desired. 

While this might not be accurate, I see a lot of her TURF views as a reaction to past trauma and a push to the hyper feminism. But realistically I also do t see it as much more than posting unpopular opinions rather than anything that is a direct attack, if that makes sense. I think it just gets a lot of attention since she is a popular focal point, but I don’t know if her views have had any realistically measurable negative impact on the world. Yes I’m aware of the donations, but again, not sure how much of a measurable negative impact that has had.

Despite JKs problems, people still love the HP books, and a lot of people who love games too thought the Hogwats Leg was the perfect ven diagram overlap between those two loves. Most people separated the art from the artist. They we’re not directly anti trans, many were aware of the issue and just wanted to play a game they felt was 20 years in the making. It was well made and though I didnt play much of it, it looked like a real love letter to the stories,

The reaction of attacking streamers and calling anyone anti trans was in incredibly poor taste. Yes JK gets royalties, but she gets royalties from everything she made. Are they also protesting at the parks daily, jumping on the comment section in audible, or sitting outside of bookstores. The extreme reaction was just a convenient and popular crusade for people to feel like they were doing something, and was incredibly misguided.

not to get too off topic, but there are plenty of things that people give their money too that actually go to terrible people or companies that have actively done far worse things than JK. Disney probably being a great example of that. But its not as trendy to hate on Disney, and you don’t get as much of the social clout in those protest circles for attacking Disney.

Normies who saw these reactions would not become sympathetic to the cause, but turned off due to the fanatical behavior. If anything, it probably negatively effected the movement as people would associate fighting for trans rights with those ”Those wackos that bullied streamers and kids for playing a video game.” Personal boycotts and messages about awareness, and even hosting fund raisers or volunteering would have been an infinitely better use of their time. Movements that don’t condemn that type of behavior are far less likely to be effective.

I’m not sure if this is a popular take or if people are split, I get the idea socially that most people felt similarly but were just afraid to put it that way when I spoke to them in person. Is this an actual view that needs to be changed, or do most people more or less agree those reactions were wrong? "

Maslow:
If you actually dissect the idea of self actualization and common experiences, they are directly connected to the bottom tier, such as reproduction, heightened appreciation of food, air, and what would generally be considered first level needs in that hierarchy. 

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Popular with teachers, my main concern with this one is that “creation” is at the top of this very complex hierarchy, but Honestly I am convinced from a very early age that creation is actually often the first step in learning. Thus it actually connects the other fundamental steps of learning in a constant cycle which I have experienced and observed in my students, but have never been taken seriously on. 

The “12 steps” (AA):
While I don’t agree with some facets of AA, it is an amazing thing and has done wonders for healing people. In general, I don’t believe that one reaches the end of an addiction, which is also what AA doctrine says, which is why relapse is the seam in the cycle of addiction.

Keyless Entry - on the very rare times when you are unable to use your hands to press the button that unlocks your vehicle (which you do anyway as you then have to pull the door handle) - I cannot think of what other scenario this is useful.

I am aware of Faraday pockets, putting keys in a tin, microwave etc. to prevent theft, none of which are absolute deterrents.

E-brake - Simply put: if electrics fail on your car then you have no way of braking. Why would you complicate a part of your car that works perfectly well without electricity, that being the mechanical handbrake? Has the E-brake enhanced or improved the mechanical handbrake in any way?

They will only fail if abused (e.g. handbrake turns) severe erosion, or just random faults, which can beset any part on any car, however you don't hear a lot of handbrakes failing commonly, so I'll stick my neck out and say they're not a common problem.

Happy to see both sides of the coin if this post gets any interest."

1,2023-09-12,CMV: Financially savvy middle-class families should pay out inheritance to their children over the life of the child as opposed to give it to them when they die.,u/hrrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16gzvt5/cmv_financially_savvy_middleclass_families_should/,changemyview,"The current model seems to be that Grandma and Grandpa work and work until they can comfortably retire, and then when they die, leave their wealth to their children. For arguments sake, lets look at a middle class family and also say that when Grandma and Grandpa died, they were able to give their children (Mom and Dad in this scenario) the family house, as well as $2 million in cash/investments.

The ""problem"" here, is that Grandma and Grandpa have not maximized the ""value"" of the money that they gave their kids. What I mean by that is that their children (Mom and Dad) are probably in their 50's at this point. Meaning they have established careers, families, house, car, etc. They have made it 50 years without needing that money, so $2 million probably does very little for them at this point. The grandchildren are probably late teenagers and headed to college soon, so it doesn't make sense to buy and move into a bigger/better house. In many cases the grandchildren could already be through college, so either Mom and Dad helped pay for it out of their pocket, or the grandkids already took out loans that have been accumulating interest. Since the grandkids are grown, there are less opportunities for the family to use that money towards vacations to spend time together. The cycle repeats as the grandkids receive their inheritance at age 50 as well, and this giant useless inheritance that continues to grow just gets passed from generation to generation.

&#x200B;

My alternative model would have Grandma and Grandpa essentially giving away as much money to their own kids as they can - without impacting the lifestyle they desire to have. Let's say Grandma and Grandpa had 2 children around age 35. As they approach 55, lets say they have $300k in 401K, are able to save/invest $20k/year after expenses, and the kids begin turning 20ish years old. 

One way to begin paying out inheritance could be at significant age milestones such as:

18 y/o - $5,000

21 y/o - $10,000

25 y/o - $25,000

30 y/o - $50,000

35 y/o - $100,000 (The children start to have their own kids and Grandma/Grandpa are about 70y/o at this point)

The total of these expenditures would be $380,000. Over that same timeframe though, the parents would have been able to save/invest another $300k *if their salaries never increased over 15 years* (so probably have saved more like $500k). The parent's 401K would have likely at least doubled to $600k, they would likely own their house at this point (meaning their monthly expenses are minimal), both be eligible to withdraw social security, and they would likely have received inheritance from their own parents dying by now. All this to say, they should be set for a long and happy retirement.

What this model does is afford their children life enhancement. Meaning they don't have to go into debt to buy that car at 21. Maybe try starting a business at 25 with the extra cash injection. Maybe go back to get a Master's Degree at 30 to increase their future earning potential, without going into debt. Maybe put a downpayment into a nice house at 35 so they can begin building equity in a home as oppose to paying rent to some landlord for 10 more years.

Since the money is ""more useful"" to someone in their 20's or 30's, the parents are enhancing their children's lives more by paying out inheritance as the children grow, as oppose to plopping a lump sum on them when they are 50 y/o and past their prime career/life building years.

As grandma and grandpa near the end of their own lives, they take a closer look at their finances to see what more they can give. Maybe their investments have grown such that they don't even spend as much as they are getting in market returns each year. So they decide to give another $150,000 to each of their kids when they are 45 years old. Now their grandkids can go to nice summer camps, nice vacations, see the world.

&#x200B;

The main rebuttal to this argument would of course be that life can have unexpected turns, and so there is risk in giving away too much money that the parents might need to live off of later in retirement. But that is why I specified ""financially savvy"" and ""middle-class"" in the original title. This model is not for parents living paycheck to paycheck or with major costly health issues. It is meant for healthy people who are good at managing their finances and are expecting inheritance from their own parents before the time they themselves reach retirement age."

If you could get people to back you up and get support to get some kind of revenge you might try to do that, but you know it's pointless so you just let it be. You'd fight them in a world without laws to get your revenge, but that's not an option. When we're offended by things like isms then it's a lot easier to get support against the offender because it affects more people than just yourself.  
I just think that's interesting. It doesn't diminish when people are offended by biased or discriminatory remarks, but to me it means we capable of being offended by just about anything it's just not a matter that concerns anyone unless it affects more people than you and I'm not sure if that in principle diminishes your own feelings at that moment or not."

While I agree that men have unique struggles due to their gender, this statement grossly ignores the magnitude of women's suffering:

Here's the data:

* On average, a woman or girl is killed by a family member every 11 minutes | [Source](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/UN_BriefFem_251121.pdf)
* In 2021, the percentage of females murdered by an intimate partner was 5 times higher than for males | [Source](https://bjs.ojp.gov/female-murder-victims-and-victim-offender-relationship-2021#the-percentage-of-females-murdered-by-an-intimate-partner-was-5)
* Women are six times more likely to end up separated or divorced if they are diagnosed with cancer or multiple sclerosis than if their male partners were facing the same illness | [Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-partners-health/men-more-likely-than-women-to-leave-partner-with-cancer-idUSTRE5AB0C520091112)
* 20% of married men and 13% of married women have acknowledged engaging in infidelity (USA) | [Source](https://ifstudies.org/blog/who-cheats-more-the-demographics-of-cheating-in-america)
* Globally about 1 in 3 (30%) of women worldwide have been subjected to either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime | [Source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women)
* Women who are pregnant or postpartum had a 35% higher risk of homicide, compared to their non-pregnant peers | [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35797500/)

Based on this information, it would be hard to reach the conclusion that all of the women murdered/assaulted/abandoned/cheated on are being subjected to that treatment *while being loved unconditionally by the ones perpetrating the abuse.* 

My view is that Chris Rock's statement is actually implying that women are *almost* unconditionally f\*ckable (not loved). There are men who will have sex with a woman with very few conditions — even if she's underage, [mentally or physically disabled](https://www.insider.com/woman-in-vegetative-state-disabled-raped-with-shocking-frequency-2019-1), abusive, or even [deceased](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10312703/David-Fuller-raped-corpses-100-women-hospital-mortuaries-sentenced-life.html). But I think we can all agree that there's a *big difference* between being loved and being sexually desired, and this is where Chris Rock's quote becomes problematic outside of its comedic context. 

I'll be the first person to agree that women have an easier time finding sexual intimacy with the opposite sex (even when it isn't wanted) but it's blatantly false and harmful to imply that being loved and being sexually desired are equally beneficial. It would equally ridiculous (and false) for women to claim that men are unconditionally respected. 

In my view, men who make the claim that women are loved unconditionally are solely coming from personal experiences and what they see on social media. They see rich, beautiful, healthy women getting nonstop adoration even after exhibiting poor behavior, and Chris Rock's quote jumps to their minds: ""See? These women are PROOF that women are loved unconditionally!"" They don't seem to consider that most of the women in the world don't fall under this umbrella, and yet that doesn't stop this quote from being plastered everywhere sans caveat, as if it applies to all. 

So, CMV:  People are quoting a line from a comedy bit to make an argument in support of men without realizing that this POV heavily ignores women's suffering. There are overwhelming statistics that love for many women is heavily based on the conditions that we [don't leave](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/nyregion/murder-suicide-nyc.html), don't [reject advances](https://www.essence.com/news/black-women-killed-for-saying-no/), [get pregnant when it's inconvenient](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/scott-peterson-convicted-killing-pregnant-wife-laci-re-sentenced-life-rcna7909), [don't get pregnant when it's convenient for others](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-laws-kill-woman-accusing-her-of-infertility-husband-arrested/story-mGKKnUabjBJlzGWdKoQLiO.html), [don't report abuse](https://time.com/6129740/vanessa-guillen-sexual-misconduct-military/), [don't put out too much](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/sick-killer-tried-blame-grace-20935071), [don't gain too much weight](https://medium.com/@hello.beautyhuts/94-of-men-would-leave-their-partner-if-they-get-fat-but-women-do-not-bb656ce517ed)... 

... the list of conditions is actually quite long.

This argument isn't to say that men *aren't* expected to meet conditions. Men and women are both subjected to conditions when it comes to love, and claiming otherwise is reductive and dismissive of your female friends and family members, many of whom have likely been victims of some of the acts of ""unconditional love"" referenced in the statistics above.

What if the international community had allowed the Soviets to retain control of Afghanistan? Could it have resulted in a more stable, secular state like Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, or Kyrgyzstan, without the rise of extremist groups and the events of 9/11?

One of the central arguments in favor of this alternative scenario is the nature of the Afghan government that existed before the Soviet invasion. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, established after a coup in 1978, aimed to create a modern and secular state. The government implemented a series of progressive reforms, including equal educational opportunities for women, land redistribution, and efforts to reduce the influence of tribalism and religious extremism.

Had the Soviets been allowed to maintain control, it is possible that these reforms could have continued, leading to a more secular, stable, and modernized Afghanistan. This could have served as a counterbalance to the rise of religious extremism that ultimately plagued the country.



One of the unintended consequences of the Soviet invasion was the empowerment of Afghan mujahideen, who received substantial support from the United States and other Western nations. These mujahideen groups later evolved into the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and other extremist organizations.

In an alternative scenario where the Soviets had not been opposed, there might have been less incentive for the formation and growth of these radical groups. The absence of external support for the mujahideen could have discouraged the radicalization of Afghan society.



The Soviet Union had a vested interest in maintaining stability in its neighboring Central Asian states. Had they retained control over Afghanistan, they might have worked diligently to ensure stability and prevent the spread of radicalism throughout the region.

In this hypothetical situation, the Central Asian republics, which gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, might have faced fewer security challenges and less risk of radicalization. This could have had a positive impact on regional stability and international security.



One of the most tragic consequences of the Afghan conflict has been the erosion of women's rights in the country. Under the Taliban's rule, women faced severe restrictions and oppression. However, in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, women enjoyed more rights and opportunities for education and employment.

Had the Soviets retained control, these gains in women's rights might have continued, setting a precedent for gender equality in the region. The international community might have been more engaged in supporting these efforts, ultimately leading to a more positive outcome for Afghan women.



Arguably the most compelling argument for allowing the Soviets to keep Afghanistan is the potential prevention of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the subsequent War on Terror. Without the rise of Al-Qaeda and its safe haven in Afghanistan, the global landscape might have been markedly different.

In this alternate scenario, the absence of 9/11 could have led to reduced emphasis on military interventions in the Middle East and Central Asia. The immense human and financial costs of the War on Terror might have been averted or significantly minimized."

Time does not exonerate one from a crime and it is never too late to make amends.

1,2023-09-12,CMV: In the future all people will only speak English or another language.,u/ThadtheYankee159,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16hbppk/cmv_in_the_future_all_people_will_only_speak/,changemyview,"I visited Germany over the summer, and saw the English language just about everywhere I went. Now this could be explained by me visiting touristy areas, and that is fair enough, but it got me thinking: English is used everywhere online, it is by far the most used language on the internet, and it is the language that is most often used to bridge disparate groups together. At the same time, due to the combined influence of the former British Empire and the current United States, English is the preeminent language of science, culture, media, and many more aspects of our globalized world. The most telling aspect of all of this is the fact that in the European Union, a majority of its citizens know English, despite the fact that only 1% of its population speaks it natively. Humans are creatures of convenience, we desire to make things as easy as possible. So it makes sense to all learn a single language that can bind us all together, especially as the world becomes more connected and national identities become weaker. 

There are some rebuttals which I will address here. First is that history is constantly changing and there is a good chance English falls out of favor. And that is very fair. However, even if it is not English, a single global language for all of humanity still makes sense. Another is that this language would in turn diverge into a whole new set of languages, like Latin and the Romance languages. Technology however, will prevent that. Languages diverged because of distance and lack of communication, something which is becoming less common today. You are starting to see accents and dialects of languages disappear due to greater interconnectedness. The final point is greater nationalism and jingoism. This is something which could happen, but it would be an abandonment of the globalized world that has existed for decades. You often see groups who are nativist in the West labeled as bigots, while in non Western societies learning the global language will be seen as abandoning the conservative cultures which have held them back."

This is partly because of the inflation problem that had reached a 13-year high in the US while going down now is still bad. Biden’s advanced age and his failure to deliver on his promises also hurt his chances.

Inflation is hurting many Americans, as prices have gone up and some businesses are taking advantage of the situation. People tend to vote based on how the economy affects them and compare it to the alternative.

This country has a long history of bigotry that many white liberals (who are the majority on this website) often overlook until someone like Trump or Nikki Haley in 2008 exposes it. There is even a SNL skit that mocks this tendency . Trump revived his political career by repeating right-wing conspiracy theories in 2012 . David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, almost became the governor of Louisiana in 1991 . Storm Thurmond served in the Senate till the late 90s. People would deny themselves subsidized healthcare because a black man pushed for them to have it. Black People have to play into respectability politics to garner sympathy for being murdered by the police. The fact that Republicans can quote Goebells win talking about Trans people and get relented is bad. These examples show how racism and intolerance are still prevalent and influential in American Politics.

Biden’s inability to keep his promises will be his downfall. He has not stopped the detention of children and asylum seekers at the border . He let his build back better plan be gutted by Republicans and Manchen, even though he had a majority in both the Senate and the House. He could have repealed the Senate rule that allows filibusters without having to speak continuously . He also might face a Hillary Clinton problem, where Black voters who have few options in America don’t turn out to vote for him because of his capitulation to Republicans on police reform and his failure to pass a voting rights bill for Black people ."

So forgive me if this sounds absurd and I’m very much open to having my mind changed.

So I hope we can agree that psychological/emotional abuse is a very bad thing. However it seems such abuse is glorified and claimed to be necessary in military training and not being able to handle being abused makes one weak. That the purpose of military training is to mentally break you down and brainwash you into what the military wants you to be. 

How does this sound any different from similar types of abuse? Like abusive employers using similar tactics against their employees. Or abusive husbands/wives doing the same thing to break their spouse. Or even parents using such tactics to make their children “stronger” or “ it builds character?” What if schools were to be run like military camps?

I maybe biased, because I was bullied throughout my entire school life and had a dad who could be easily enraged by the smallest mistakes and, even though he never laid a hand on me, took put all his anger and rage on me almost weekly like a drill sergeant almost. None of this has made me stronger, it’s only left me with severe depression, social anxiety, and occasionally suicidal ideation. Science agrees that even non physical abuse can still greatly harm someone. So I’m not sure how it’s good for soldiers to go through that abuse In training and is glorified when everywhere else it is not acceptable."

I only see benefits.

1. **Labor Force Growth:** Immigration helps to expand the labor force, which is crucial for sustaining economic growth. As immigrants enter the workforce, they contribute to increased productivity and can fill gaps in industries with labor shortages, such as healthcare, agriculture, and technology.

2. **Innovation and Entrepreneurship:** Immigrants often bring fresh ideas, skills, and entrepreneurial spirit. Many successful American companies, including Google and Tesla, were founded or co-founded by immigrants. These innovations create jobs and drive economic progress.

3. **Consumer Spending:** Immigrants, like all residents, participate in the economy by consuming goods and services. Their spending contributes to local businesses, stimulates demand, and supports economic growth.

4. **Tax Revenue:** Immigrants pay taxes, including income, property, and sales taxes. These contributions bolster government revenues, which can be used for public services, infrastructure development, and social programs.

5. **Social Security System:** An aging population in the United States poses challenges for the Social Security system. Immigrant workers can help offset this demographic shift by paying into the system, which supports retirees and the overall stability of social safety nets.

6. **Global Competitiveness:** Attracting skilled immigrants can enhance a nation's global competitiveness. It strengthens industries like technology, research, and education, positioning the U.S. as a leader in these fields.

7. **Regional Development:** Immigration can revitalize declining communities by bringing in new residents who contribute to local economies. This is particularly relevant in rural areas struggling with population decline.

However, I'm not advocating for less security. And I think we need to continue to crackdown on any human trafficking that goes on. It's just unreasonably difficult for people to immigrate. Why shouldn't we have a effective process for people to immigrate and become citizens, without waiting years or having family already here? Why should we continue not disallow DACA recipients any path to citizenship?"

Will leave the post up for context (please someone just say if you'd rather I delete it!)**

On this small corner of the internet, on this small planet, in this small solar system, your comment on this post is not very important. Go and do something that will make you happy. This is a selfish post to further my own understanding of the argument put forward by trans people and others that understand that argument 

&#x200B;

I am posting this because I am socially liberal, and I am more in line with the world view of many trans activists on almost every other issue, and so this is really me trying to educate and understand without outing myself to the people I care about that I have these views.

With that in mind, I'm not really interested in hearing from those that already agree with me or just simply don't agree with trans rights - this post isn't for you, I've heard your arguments.

My current view:

People should be able to express themselves in whatever way they want, and we as a society should embrace that. And that means men and women should be able to dress, behave, feel etc. in whatever way they want without having their gender or sexual orientation questioned = that to me is the ideal (i.e. gender becomes a bit of a relic). The reason I see that as the ideal is because whilst we hold on to ideas around gender, and what are 'gender norms' it will constantly come into conflict with what a socially free society should actually look like (people expressing themselves without inherent judgments on that persons gender and often by extension sexual orientation). In this world sexual orientation becomes more fluid across all people (as I believe it is anyway, and it's really just about what you find attractive rather than a definitive 'I don't like men' or 'I don't like women' - though I acknowledge there will always be some that don't like a particular physical aspect of each sex.

I feel like there is something regressive in the idea that a young boy or girl that feels a certain way can ultimately chose to start taking life altering medication in order to fit within a societal norm that we should be aiming to overcome and consign to the history books. For example, in my world a young boy that feels that way would be encouraged to express themselves in exactly the way they feel, dress how they feel, and not need to change gender or sexual orientation to do so. I know that at this point in time society still frowns upon that, and it leaves those people open to abuse, and ironically the most right wing moronic bullies would say things such as 'you're not a real man' or some version of that, or infer they are in fact the opposite gender (as I have seen directed at my cis male friends who are do not intend to transition but dress a certain way). And that is kind of at the nub of what doesn't sit right with me - it kind of feels like an acknowledgement of what those people are saying, that you can't possibly be a man and feel/behave/dress like that which is bullshit.

I understand that some would say I am confusing gender expression with gender identity, and whilst gender expression is merely about expressing yourself in whatever way, identity is someones internal sense of their own gender, which may not align with societal expectations based on their physical characteristics. But I would say what is gender expression if not expression of identity - these two things are, in my view, the same thing.

So what am I missing in my perspective? is this just an idealized world that can never be achieved/we're giving up on? or is there a perspective that provides an outline of transitioning that doesn't feel at odds with the aim to expand what it means to be a man or a woman until the two ven diagrams are almost totally overlapped.

Just to reiterate - this is me putting forward a genuine view point, and I'm really open to having it changed so long as people really do engage with what I'm saying and don't just take one aspect and argue about that, because as we all know this is far more complicated than that. And also to say again - this isn't for people that agree with me (or less socially liberal people) to reply to"

1,2023-09-13,CMV: Men and women do not complement each other and never will,u/Square_Ocelot1113,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16hjult/cmv_men_and_women_do_not_complement_each_other/,changemyview,"I (19 year old male) have noticed that men and women, the two sexes (I'm not talking about genders) are not and will never complement each other. 

With the rise of radical feminism (mostly among young women on social media), as well as certain conservative and anti-feminist figures (Andrew Tate, for example), I can't help but notice that men and women are so different, one might even consider they're not made for each other. Excluding procreation and child-rearing, men and women from both traditional and modern progressive societies seem to be totally different beings, almost like they're not part of the same species. 

From what I've noticed during my teenage years, due to social and biological differences, male and female experiences are radically different, almost opposite. There is no common, universal ""human"" experience due to gender differences, labels and roles. And here, I'll provide you with some examples:

1) Many girls my age identify as feminists (liberal, radical, Marxist or a mix of these). Guys, even if they theoretically believe in gender equality, in practice they refuse to label themselves as feminists and will be quick to defend men's issues and sometimes discredit women's issues (for example, they'll argue that men face unique challenges or that they ""have it harder"" because of women or feminism). 

2) In certain culturally conservative/reactionary countries and cultures, the two sexes are separate as much as possible. Gender segregation in schools in the past was not the cause, but rather a result of the natural rivalry between men and women. 

3) Queerness and LGBTQ+ folk are hates for threatening the status quo. Masculine gays and feminine lesbians are easier to tolerate because at the end of the day, they're still male or female and they are attracted only to one sex. Biphobia and transphobia appear when the natural barrier between sexes is lifted and people are free to explore their sexuality and gender identity/expression. 

4) My theory explains the existence of misogynists and mysandrists. They are a product of the sexual rivalry! I also believe everyone is a little bit sexist, but this is another story for another day.

5) Men and women do not complement each other; it's partners who do! A man may be attracted to a woman because of the biological need to produce offsprings and the woman's personality, but he'll never be attracted to femininity and women as a social group or category. Obviously, a cis man is not attracted to every woman he sees and he certainly doesn't have the experience of a woman, meaning that he's only attracted to specific women with specific looks and personalities. 

With that being said, the relationship between the two sexes is like a neverending rivalry. Men and women do not complement each other; partners do, regardless of their biology!"
1,2023-09-13,CMV: Electric cars are NOT the future of transportation,u/average_redditor_101,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16hkhaf/cmv_electric_cars_are_not_the_future_of/,changemyview,"Nowadays, governments are pushing car companies to go fully electric, possibly by 2030 or 2040. Especially countries such as the Netherlands. Many car companies are switching to fully electric vehicles. In my opinion, and based on the research I've done, this is NOT the solution to battling climate change.

Let's start off with what's inside an electric car. Every electric car, no matter the manufacturer, is powered by Lithium-ion batteries. Lithium is an element that needs to be extracted from a mine, just like Cobalt and Nickel (which are also needed for lithium-ion battery production). 

Like every other form of extraction, the process of extracting Lithium harms the environment. The process uses up around 500 000 gallons of water per metric ton of Lithium extracted (source: “The Environmental Impact of Lithium Batteries.” IER, 12 Nov. 2020). The main source of Lithium is from a region called the ""Lithium Triangle"", which covers regions of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. These are some of the driest places on earth, so the immense usage of water affects local businesses as well.

Similar mines exist in the DRC, where child labour is a huge issue - it's estimated that over 40 000 children work in cobalt mines.

Then there's charging. Yes, of course some stations use renewable sources, but what about the vast majority? They're powered by a country's National Electricity Grid. The electricity for this grid is obtained by burning fossil fuels, the emissions of which account for 31% of global greenhouse gas emissions (source: United States Environmental Protection Agency)

Finally, there's the issue of disposal. Batteries, as you know, consist of several toxic elements (which is why AA and AAA batteries are usually disposed separately). Li-ion batteries contain Copper, Nickel and several other flammable organic compounds. In landfills, these elements can cause soil pollution. And if they are incinerated, they can release toxic fumes into the atmosphere.

A certain branch of electric cars, called PHEVs (Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles) use lead in their batteries, which must be disposed of PROPERLY at the end of their life cycle. This form of lead-disposal is called ""formal processing"" and requires processing plants to control emissions and follow a set of rules. However, there are approximately over 30 000 ""informal"" lead processing plants in the world. What this means is that these plants DO NOT control their emissions, and do not follow proper rules. This can cause toxic fumes being released into the atmosphere. 

People are quick to assume that ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) cars are harmful for the environment, and that EV's are the answer. Well, EV's don't cause any emissions directly, but the process BEHIND EVs - that does the real damage. People do not seem to talk about it as much as they need to. Furthermore, data from EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) shows that yearly, approximately 50 Gt of GHG are emitted into the atmosphere, out of which roughly 8 Gt are a result of transportation (Airplanes, Ships, Trucks, Cars). Cars account for 41% of it, which leaves 3.3 Gt of GHG emissions. This is only 6.6% of yearly GHG emissions, clearly showing that ICE cars are not the primary cause of pollution. Meanwhile, the power industry is the largest source of GHG emissions, accounting for approximately 27% of global CO2 emissions.

Cars aren't the main issue here. Studies have shown that ships owned by the Carnival Corporation cause more pollution than all of Europe's cars combined. So, why is there no effort being made to electrify ships instead? Why focus on cars?

If you weight in all the factors, it's pretty obvious that EVs are just as destructive towards the planet as ICE cars said to be. 

TL;DR: The making of EVs is very destructive towards the environment, based on many factors - both ethical and environmental. People do not often talk about this, as EVs are advertised to be emissions-free, which is true, but isn't for the process behind making EVs.

PS- Some of you might look through my post/comment history, and it would seem pretty obvious that I am a car enthusiast, which some of you may argue, is a cause of bias. I agree. Upon first glance, it does look like I'm a classic ""Electric cars SUCK!"" kind of person. But, before you comment about that, I wish to tell you that prior to my research on this topic, I was convinced that electric cars WERE the future. In fact, I was biased TOWARDS electric cars at the start of my research. If you ask for proof, I don't have anything that explicitly screams ""I support EVs!"". But this is just a side note. You could choose to ignore it, or refuse to believe it - the choice is yours.

([According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf), 8.7% of American men have ""had an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop them from using birth control"". The corresponding figure for American women is 4.8%).

Feminist reason (the main one, at least) for wanting more forms of male birth control: many of the existing forms of female birth control (hormonal forms in particular) have a lot of negative side effects on the health of the women who use them. In order to mitigate this problem, more forms of male birth control should be developed, and subsequently, men should take up more of the responsibility for birth control than they currently do, so that women don't have to deal with it so much.

I think that between these two, the MRA argument is more compelling. To put it another way, I think that men have more to gain from male birth control than women do. Reproductive deception is a more serious, violating, and life-altering problem than side effects from medication."
1,2023-09-13,CMV: The most popular stories are usually not the most original.,u/LaserWerewolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16hplev/cmv_the_most_popular_stories_are_usually_not_the/,changemyview,"Let's look at a few examples. In modern times, one of the most popular stories is Harry Potter. This story contains many elements from Shakespeare, European history, and ancient mythology. Of course the list goes on much longer than that.

Shakespeare is also a great example. This is one of the best-known writers of his time, and to this day people greatly enjoy his plays. Many characters in Shakespeare's plays are based on real people, and many other characters and story ideas are based on ancient Greek stories such as the Odyssey. 

And if you go back and read the Iliad and the Odyssey, not only are many of the characters based on real people and events, numerous gods and goddesses are written into the story as characters. I can almost guarantee that Homer (if this was indeed the creator of the story and not merely the person who transcribed it) did not invent Athena, Poseidon, Hades, and Persephone. 

In my opinion, we are drawn toward things that are familiar, and that includes stories. Many stories which are more original feel unfamiliar, and we may have trouble relating to them, or even understanding them in the first place. That is not to say that a truly original story could never be successful. I am sure there are exceptions to this general pattern I have observed. 

To change my view, you would have to convince me that the more popular a story is, the more original it tends to be.

\- In a March 2022 Instagram group chat, a student told him: ""people at school talk \[expletive\] about you and call you school shooter.""

This is *not* a CMV about what a world champion is (that's already been done recently and my fellow countrymen don’t seem to understand the concept in the context of team sports, making for an exhausting discussion.)

This is about the ability of basketball to really spread globally if the US/NBA doesn’t take international competition seriously. 

We just saw a WORLD CUP of basketball with none of the US superstars on the national team roster. This would be absolutely inconceivable in soccer, where the highest ambition and glory of any player in their career is to win a world cup for their country. 

I remember when Mark Cuban (owner of the Dallas Mavs), I forget if it was around the time of the 2012 or the 2016 Olympics, said of Dirk Nowitzki something to the effect of (and I’m paraphrasing): “We don’t pay him Xmillion per year for him to go play for NBC for free.”  

I thought that was a fascinating and incredibly telling framing of the issue. He wanted to play in the Olympics for his country, but the owner saw it as him playing for *the network that broadcasts it in the US*, for free. The prospect of wanting to play for one’s nation didn’t come into it. 

I understand that it’s also a business decision and an organization wants to protect its investment - but the same is true in global soccer, yet it is unfathomable that the best players in the world would stand idly by as their club try to pressure/prevent them from competing for their country. It’s the highest honor in the sport. 

Any team that offers a soccer player a contract on the condition that they opt out of playing for their country would be met with a stern “fuck you”. 

The fact that the national team we sent to represent us in the FIBA world cup was made up of second-tier players and benchwarmers is an absolute disgrace and shows the unseriousness with which we take the globalization of the sport. 

Of course, basketball is played in many different countries now and has spread quite far and pretty well. Pro leagues have popped up all over the place. But until the best that the sport has to offer gets serious about global play, the sport itself will only have limited global appeal. 

The drive to have a proper team at the 2024 Olympics is encouraging, though."

As a writer and a world builder this could prove an interesting story. So I'm here to see if someone can change my mind on this issue, as it could prove compelling for some world building.

Here is the dilemma. We all wish we could live in a more equal world. Just look around, some countries suffer while others thrive. Even within countries some live wealthy lives, able to throw money away for the stupidest of things. This is while others are on their last leg, bills piled up to the wall wondering if they can afford food on the table this week. I'm not against any one country or individual, it just seems like there are so many have nots, just to support a few haves. 

It seems that not matter what type of political system, type of economics, policies of other tactics humanity tries in order to achieve equality. If we make a democracy with freely elected officials, those in power and other crafty humans will find a way to game/cheat the system. If the human in that system rebel and setup a new system, others will just find loop holes in that and exploit it so they sit at the top of the food chain while the rest of us continue to work our days away.

We've grown accustomed to the sight of read marks and quick replies. However, we must recognize that people have lives outside of their devices. 

Many messaging apps now include features like read receipts and online statuses. While these can be useful tools, they can also lead to unnecessary anxiety and overthinking. Just because someone has read your message or is online doesn't mean they can or should drop everything to respond immediately. People have their reasons for being online, and it's often not solely for chatting.

Behind every messaging app, there's a real person with responsibilities, commitments, and priorities. We often forget that people may be busy with work, taking care of family, or simply enjoying some downtime. It's unreasonable to expect everyone to be available 24/7.

If a message is genuinely urgent or requires immediate attention, consider using the good old-fashioned phone call. A call can convey the urgency of the situation and provide a more efficient means of communication than waiting for a text response.

I wanted to share some important information about the ongoing coral bleaching event in Florida. This issue has been causing concern among marine scientists and environmentalists, so let's dive into what's happening and why it matters.

**What is Coral Bleaching?**
Coral bleaching is a phenomenon where coral reefs lose their vibrant colors due to the expulsion of symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae. These algae provide the coral with nutrients and give them their beautiful hues. When stressed by various factors, such as temperature increase or pollution, corals expel these algae, causing the coral to turn white or ""bleach.""

**Why is it Happening in Florida?**
The primary driver of coral bleaching in Florida is elevated sea temperatures. Coral reefs are highly sensitive to changes in temperature, and when the water gets too warm, the corals expel their algae, leaving them vulnerable and stressed. Climate change, fueled by greenhouse gas emissions, is causing sea temperatures to rise globally, including in Florida's waters.

**Consequences of Coral Bleaching:**
1. **Biodiversity Loss:** Coral reefs support an incredible diversity of marine life. When corals bleach, it disrupts the entire ecosystem, leading to the loss of habitat and impacting fish and other species that rely on these reefs.

2. **Economic Impact:** Florida's economy heavily depends on tourism and fisheries associated with healthy coral reefs. Coral bleaching threatens these industries and the livelihoods of many who depend on them.

**What Can We Do?**
1. **Reducing Emissions:** Addressing the root cause of coral bleaching requires global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Support policies and practices that promote clean energy and sustainable living.

2. **Responsible Tourism:** If you visit coral reefs in Florida or any other location, practice responsible tourism. Avoid touching or damaging the coral, and choose eco-friendly tour operators.

3. **Support Conservation:** Many organizations are working to protect and restore coral reefs. Consider donating to or volunteering with groups like the Coral Restoration Foundation.

In summary, the coral bleaching event in Florida is a stark reminder of the urgent need to address climate change and protect our oceans. By raising awareness and taking action, we can contribute to the preservation of these incredible ecosystems for future generations. 🌊🐠🌿"

1,2023-09-13,META: Transgender Topics,u/LucidLeviathan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16hxvf8/meta_transgender_topics/,changemyview,"# The Rule Change

Beginning immediately, r/changemyview will no longer allow posts related to transgender topics. The reasons for this decision will follow. This decision has not been made lightly by the administration of this subreddit, and has been the topic of months of discussion.

# Background

Over the past 8 months, r/changemyview has been inundated with posts related to transgender topics. I conducted a survey of these posts, and more than 80% of them ended up removed under Rule B. More importantly, a very large proportion of these threads were ultimately removed by Reddit's administrators. This would not be a problem if the topic was an infrequent one. However, for some periods, we have had between 4 and 8 new posts on transgender-related issues per day. Many days, they have made up more than 50% of the topics of discussion in this subreddit.

# Reasoning

If a post is removed by Reddit or by the moderators of this subreddit under B, we consider the thread a failure. Views have not been changed. Lots of people have spent a lot of time researching and making reasoned arguments in favor of or against a position. If the thread is removed, that effort is ultimately wasted. We respect our commenters too much to allow this to continue.

Furthermore, this subreddit was founded to change views on a wide variety of subjects. When a single topic of discussion so overwhelms the subreddit that other topics cannot be easily discussed, that goal is impeded. This is, to my knowledge, only the second time that a topic has become so prevalent as to require this drastic intervention. However, this is not r/changemytransview. This is r/changemyview. If you are interested in reading arguments related to transgender topics, we truly have a thorough and complete treatment of the topic in this subreddit's history.

# The Rule

Pursuant to Rule 4, any thread that touches on transgender issues, even tangentially, will be removed by the automoderator. Attempts to circumvent automoderation will not be treated lightly by the moderation team, as they are indicative of a disdain for our rules. If you don't know enough to avoid the topic and violate our rules, that's not that big of a deal. If you know enough to try to evade the automoderator, that shows a deliberate intent to thwart our rules. Please do not attempt to avoid this rule.

# Conclusion

The moderation team regrets deeply that this decision has been necessary. We will answer any questions in this thread, or in r/ideasforcmv. We will not entertain discussion of this policy in unrelated topics. We will not grant exceptions to this rule. We may revisit this rule if circumstances change. We are unlikely to revisit this rule for at least six months.

Sincerely,

The moderators of r/changemyview"

There were Catholic classmates who opted out of it for the same reason. That's also why children whose parents wish to opt them out of LGBTQ-related subject matter in elementary school should be allowed to do so as well. If they must be taught in public schools, those students should at least have the option to opt-out of those lessons so that their beliefs can be respected.

Part 1: Context and my history

My girlfriend had terrible OLD pictures. You could see she didn't know what she was doing and looked very unordinary. She's very pretty and has a sexy body, but you wouldn't have thought so from the pictures. That's one of the reasons I swiped her, over fantastic looking instagram-esk looking girls. I did this for a few reasons

a) practical, less competition.

b) given my own instability and having been distraught by two earlier ""relationships"", if you can even call them, I was determined to look for someone who showed great promise of relationship skills and the intend of following up on them. During the fallout of the last 2, I read A LOT, obsessively, about relationships. In and out, everything on the web basically. Not black/redpill shit, but how a functioning relationship actually works from many different perspectives. And I came to the conclusion that, at best, having the necessary skills to take great looking pictures is unrelated to my future relationship satisfation with a person, at worse, inversely correlated.

c) gaming the tinder algorithm

a) and c) are only added for honesty but post irrelevant.

Then the way I fell for my gf was because, after initial text awkwardness, she started writing longer, heartfelt texts and didn't show any hint of 'playing around' (you know, the mindgames fools still push on both genders). When I found out she was long distance, I finally brought up the courage to tell her about my clinical mental health struggle, and she was nothing but supportive and lovely about it. That was when I changed my mind to still pursue it futher. Turned out she naturally acts very healthily in relationships. I still can't wrap my head around how it's possible, but she intuitively knows what the right thing to say and do is. I had to learn it by comparison. And so we're happy together for 2.5 years now and always both pay severe attention to making sure we don't act badly in the relationship and reflecting on our mistakes.

Part 2, argument:

If women's standards were too low, and the bar was 'in hell' as the meme is atm, you wouldn't have that many men struggling to have any female connection. Incels (really I mean lonely men, hate that it became such a loaded term.) wouldn't be on the rise, but the decline.

But yet you don't have to look far to see a girl with an abusive ex and a horrible past relationship. Or a girl being stringed along and used for sex. I believe women (men too! Gave my friends the talk about swiping on the bad photos a bunch of times!) are looking for the wrong things, especially online. They shouldn't be swiping at the best looking pics on tinder, as said earlier, I highly doubt there's ANY correlation (Perhaps even inverse!) to likelihood of a good relationship. It doesn't even have to say much about their attractiveness. It certainly didn't in the case of my gf. Also if they're acting interested you, putting a lot of effort into messages, writing you joyful heartfelt messages THAT'S what you should look for. Not the guy who's really witty and good at flirting per say. 

I especially dislike requirement lists.

There should only be two requirements on the list. Treats me with respect and am somewhat attracted to. That doesn't mean women should date anyone that fits those requirements, but consider everyone that does fit them. And the consideration should be based on, do they seem like they will act healthily/are acting healthily and show great interest in me. Those two alone matter much more than any common interest ever could.

Final:

I am aware that my opinion is based HEAVILY on my subjective experience, but the hypothesis came first, based on the information I had learned and a long time deeply obsessing with the subject in a depressed state. Then came the (successful) test. So I could even call it scientific with n = 1 if I wanted to be a smartass.

So how about you lads are smart asses now too and point out the flaws! Have fun and thanks in advance!"

Queer people saying the F-slur

Etc etc. 

And there are both sides of the social identity coin that are bad:

-The marginalized people who think that they should get more benefits and are better than other identities just because their race/sexuality/gender was looked down upon

-And citizens who fits within the patriarchal standard that wished they had the same privileges and celebratory events as the Marginalized groups so they can have ""equal footing"" with everyone else

These types of people prove to me that they'll always be those who wished that they were ""oppressed"" so they can feel special and secure. As well as people who wish that the more privileged people were seen as less than so said people can know what it feels like

At the end of the day.  Respect, understanding, empathy, diversity connections, and love are what wins us over as a society. No matter our race, class, religion, sexuality, gender, class, mental well being etc.

But we shouldn't pretend that everyone is actually ""equal"" like our country likes to advertise.

They have requested these munitions because they believe they will be helpful in pushing invaders from their country. I've yet to meet a Ukrainian who has spoken out against them.  

Ukraine understands the sacrifices it is making better than we ever will. It is hypocritical for us to tell them otherwise. They are fighting a war of national defense against an invader that does not respect their right to exist. They have asked for cluster munitions because they see them as helpful in defending their country. Who are we to moralize to them about how to best defend themselves? 

Unlike Russia (which has target civilians) Ukraine will/is using cluster munitions on the battlefield."
1,2023-09-13,CMV: The far left overall does not have more compassion and empathy towards others than those to the right of them,u/ICuriosityCatI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16i2l1y/cmv_the_far_left_overall_does_not_have_more/,changemyview,"One thing I've noticed, in many conversations with far leftists, is that I often feel like a worse person afterwards. Like sure, maybe logically my ideas are sound (sometimes), but I just don't have that level of empathy and compassion that they do. The level of compassion and empathy that would make it so when I walked by a homeless person living on my street my first reaction was  ""I'm so happy that they are able to camp on my street, but lots more needs to be done they are suffering"" and not ""are they going to ask me for money, are they sane, are they violent."" And then I would feel actual joy upon seeing them. 

And I feel like this is an idea the far left has perpetuated- that they are the most caring and compassionate and empathetic. Maybe not the most logical always, but the most emotionally connected to others. And they are able to present all sorts of whacky ideas under the guise that they are superior in this way. And the anger you see when somebody challenges them- well that's natural they are so deeply connected to the suffering person that they feel the pain for the other person. 

But I think, if anything, the far left overall is less compassionate and less empathetic than their more moderate counterparts. Many of them are in their most self centered years (college students namely.) They tend to be more hostile towards opposing ideas. Less able to handle criticism. More willing to act out. Traits that are more closely associated with vulnerable self centered ness, not empathy and compassion. Some of the worst people I've met, people who valued power, were also very far to the left. 

My general view is that the extreme left and extreme right have less compassion and empathy for others, but according to the extreme left people to the right of them have less empathy and compassion than them. 

Obviously my view concerns groups, not individuals. I think the far left as a group wants to appear more empathetic and compassionate, but I don't think they actually are. But I'm curious to hear others opinions and open to changing my view."

I think it was stolen by other means and here are the following reasons:  
  
1. **Unfair Media Coverage, its a given at this point that Trump gets overall negative coverage from all media companies beside Fox News. They try to paint him in a bad light and always go for the worst possible angle of every news story. They do the opposite for Biden by not addressing issues that should be addressed like his mental capacity, and other things that would paint him in a bad light.**  
  
2. **This one was personally insane to me, Joe Biden was able to get 50 Former Intelligence officials to sign a later claiming that the Hunter Biden Story was disinformation. Biden then used this in a televised debate against Trump to claim the story was fake, which definitely influenced voters to ignore the story and take it into account when voting. The Hunter Biden laptop had evidence of the influence peddling scheme that Biden has taken apart of. Ignoring all the contents of the laptop made it so this story was never brought to light.** 

3. **The Fbi in total paid Twitter $3.4 million dollars to censor stores including the Hunter Biden Laptop Story from Social Media, even though they knew it was real and true. There was a poll where they asked people would you be willing to change your vote if you heard about the Hunter Laptop prior to voting? 28% of respondents said they were ""very likely"" to have changed their votes, and 25% said they were ""somewhat likely.""  17% said they were ""not very likely,"" 25% who were ""not at all likely,"" and 6% who were ""unsure.""** 

4. **So 53% of people in this poll would have possibly changed their vote if they knew about the story. If even 10% ended up changing their vote because of this story then that would have lead to a Trump Victory.** 

5. **Constant talk from the Media about Trump being a double Russian agent and being in bed with Putin. Nearly his entire 4 year term there were investigations, constant new stories and media coverage about Trumps alleged involvement with Russia even though there was little to no evidence. It probably left a bad view of Trump because they connected Trump and Russia and it definitely could have influenced the way people voted. It put a stain on his presidency and definitely did nothing but lose him votes.**

*Just recently the Fbi apologized for the Trump-Russia investigation. John Durham criticized the Fbi stating the FBI should have never launched the Trump-Russia Probe.* 

So in my opinion it was government censorship, unfair media coverage, ex intelligent officials, the Fbi, Fake stories, that led to the election being stolen from Trump. Without all of these things Trump would have still won the election in my opinion. "

It simply gets a bad name because of the media. It’s one of the least used firearms in any gun related death and not the most used firearm type in mass shootings.

The AR is modular and lends itself to being a great choice for hunting. You are able to select different calibers for different game. You can take it squirrel hunting if you so choose to. You could take it dangerous game hunting.

Variations of it can be light, plenty of attachment points and with the right ammo, it can give plenty of bolt action rifles a run for the money when it comes to accuracy. 

I’m not saying it’s the best, I’m simply saying it’s not an outlandish or weird choice to hunt with. Why would an AR make a bad hunting rifle?"

Telling people to dress a certain way, live a certain lifestyle that they don't want and so on is rude and I think telling someone who's minding their own business to smile falls completely under that category. First of all it completely disregards how that person is truly feeling and they're being asked to express an emotion that they don't naturally feel. And for what? Just for them to look aesthetically pleasing to you? Imagine if I walked up to a fat person who was just minding their own business and I told them to lose weight. I think most people would agree that is very rude because it's nobody's business how that person lives their life especially if they're actions isn't affecting anyone but themselves. I could make the argument that since them losing weight would be beneficial to their health it'd be okay to tell them to lose weight. But there are no health benefits to smiling. It's just an expression. That's it. I think people naturally like being around other people who smile so they request other people to smile not because they genuinely care about their hapiness and well being but rather to appease their own self interests. 
Also you don't know what another person is going through in their life. Imagine if you had something tragic happen to you like a relative died or you found out you had cancer. Would you appreciate it if some random stranger came up to you and said ""SMILE""? No because they're completely disregarding what you're actually going through and they want you to express an emotion just for their visual pleasure."

And it doesn't matter. The same way the civil rights movement was seen, or the anti-apartheid, or the decolonialization movements were generally unpopular, the climate, racial justice, and other movements will be vindicated after they are successful.

Isn't it better if people bred based on their alleles so that it's easy to predict the kid's strengths and weaknesses? 

For eg RR (dominant male) only breeds with RR (dominant female) so the kid is most probably a RR. 

Otherwise the kid won't know his alleles and trains/eats all his life like his father or siblings and ends up getting disappointed. 

Otherwise allele screening should happen at birth itself, which would be costly when done for billions of births when doing it everytime for decades to come."

I disagree with this; it comes off as virtue signalling. The character's race was changed to be more diverse, presumably.  
  
Now, I don't see what makes the change in Snow White's ethnicity any different to changing Black Panther to a different ethnicity or race. Snow White’s ethnicity and complexion are integral to her character, hence her name. One relatively 'big' part of the story is her complexion and how she is the ‘fairest of them all,’ and unique because of it. Similarly, Black Panther’s name originates from the Black Panther party and his race is relatively important compared to most characters. \`  
  
Even as a person who leans left (essentially centrist), there is the double standard that much of the left holds. The double standard is the opinion or view that changing a white person’s race is okay, or perhaps even great, but changing a black person’s race is racist and deemed whitewashing. I understand there is some nuance here but I still believe the two things are on a similar level. Whitewashing is bad because it pushes forward the message that being black is ‘bad’ or not desirable. Blackwashing should be seen as bad as it pushes forward the message that whiteness is not desirable. Perhaps the intention of blackwashing in media is to be diverse, but again, I find this to be virtue signalling and there are better ways to go about this… just make new characters or new movies.  
  
In my opinion, race should not be changed if it’s an original and old character, particularly if it’s relatively integral to the character’s identity. Just make new characters.  
  
I assume that I will get replies that point out that Snow White is not Disney’s story and there are many different versions, thus, it’s not necessarily race-swapping characters. But that’s wrong:  
  


>  
Snow White is a live-action remake of the Disney animation classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" which debuted in 1937. However, it appears that Disney is approaching the seven dwarf characters in a new way in order to avoid reiterating prejudices from the first animated feature. The lead actress Zegler also hinted at the story's contemporary revisions meant to appeal to the progressive audience during the D23 event.[\[1\]](https://collider.com/snow-white-disney-live-action-remake-release-date-cast-plot/)

  
  
The issue is that Disney and other massive corporations are making *\[x\]* and then advertising it as *\[y\]*. The only reason for this is because these corporations want a bigger audience so they grab nostalgic stories such as Snow White and other classics and then reboot them to get a guaranteed audience. For example, Velma, a TV series where they race-swapped Velma, is hardly the original character- neither are the rest of the characters, really. They marketed the series as Scooby-Doo characters to gain instant and free traction despite the fact they are hardly even the same characters.   
  
So yeah, that’s basically my view. I just don’t agree with the race-swapping of random characters and I think that race-swapping Black Panther is of the same nature as race-swapping Snow White.

But we live in the 21st century where sanitation is not a health concern for the vast majority of the civilized world. Therefore, I see no reason why shit is still considered “bad words” other than it was traditionally considered bad words.

Arguments that may cmv:

1. Key differences that separate the word “shit” from words like “poop”

2. Reasons why we want to preserve the word “shit” as an expletive 

3. Reasons why tradition matters, especially in an age where human language changes and evolves at an extremely rapid pace

Everybody has the right to live a peacefull live.

How ever I base my opinion on a few arguments and my studies in sport sciences:

1.) Health: The human body is designed to function a certain way. In order to do so it needs a certain amount of body fat which vary from person to person. For example women tend to have higher body fat than man, old people more then younger people etc. . Being far above or below that percentage has a huge  impact on your health, I won't even try to name all, I am sure you know those. By assuring people with a irregular body fat, that it is absolutely ok to be that way BY CHOICE ( I am explicitly excluding mental illness here) the pressure to change is marginalised leading to increased social costs, doctors etc.

2.) Hypocratic Beauty standards: Firstly beauty is of course in the eye of the viewer and every person is beautiful in their own way.

Yet evolutionary people tend to find people attractive that have a high functionality and good chances of survival. The portrayed beauty standards of for example Kim K., or the Rock are in my opinion considered attractive because they overexaggerate those traits linked to fertility and functionality. Those traits are directly influenced by one's body fat. If, for example, a woman or man has a extremely low body fat, the ability to reproduce is heavily impaired up to temporary infertility. Choosing to be obese or emaciated AND demanding to be considered beautiful is in my opinion hypocracy.

3.) Fairness towards others:
By focusing heavily on people who don't meet beauty standards BY CHOICE, attention is taken away from people that don't meet them because they may have had an accident or genetic defect. Those people deserve to be told they are beautiful, they don't have the power to change that and they need to be explicitly included and be ""taken care of"" taking up this space simply because of one's unwillingness to change is unfair.

For example, if a person commits genocide, we often say that this person was 'inhuman' or 'not human'. That this person had no humanity, or somehow lost their humanity along the way.

I am sure that there are many examples of other animals committing genocide. That's not enough to change my view. But serial killing, mass killing, and genocide don't need to be \*uniquely\* human in order for us to recognize them as human behaviors. A chimpanzee can eat an apple, even a bacterium can eat an apple, but we recognize eating an apple as human behavior. Why? Because all over the world, in many different times, people have eaten apples. It is the same with the terrible behaviors I have described. They are not what make us human, but they also do not make someone less human.

It seems like the more we learn about the past, the more terrible things we find out about our species. Genghis Khan, Hitler, Pol Pot... the list of genocidal maniacs goes on and on. And what happened to the Neanderthals? Archaeological evidence suggests our subspecies may have systematically murdered theirs (while simultaneously mating with them.) Doesn't this sound awfully familiar... like what the Conquistadores did in the Americas? 

It is not my contention that every human is capable of this type of behavior. Some people probably couldn't kill even a single person, no matter what the provocation. But look at other human behaviors that we do not all engage in: reading, travel, fishing, swimming, having sex. Just because some people wouldn't or couldn't do these things, or because some other animals would or could, doesn't make these behaviors any less human.

I think a lot of us want to believe that our empathy is what makes us human, and therefore that someone with no empathy is not human. But it's easy to see that many other animals feel empathy, for their own kind and for other kinds of animals, even for us. Empathy is not unique to us, and it is not what defines us as a species. In fact, if we look at what makes us different from all other animals, it is mainly our ability to create complex tools. We aren't even the only ones with language and culture. We're just the only ones with written language, because we are the only ones who can physically write a book.

And the uniquely human tools that we create enable us to commit serial murder, mass murder, and genocide... the very things that we reject as inhuman. Hitler didn't go around killing millions of people with his bare hands. He used a social hierarchy (typical to many animals) and complex machines (unique to humans) to carry out \*one\* of the worst genocides in \*recorded\* history. He was aided and abetted by millions of people, some willing and some under duress. Only a social animal capable of creating and using tools could have committed exactly this kind of atrocity. 

To change my view, you would have to convince me that people who commit serial murder, mass murder, or genocide are not human, or that in order to be considered human, someone has to be capable of empathy, mercy, or some other quality that someone who commits these crimes would not possess.

Why stay around someone who hurt your parent like that? It's a betrayal of them, and it makes no sense to me why you'd want to stay around the cheating partner. Why be all lovey dovey with someone who betrayed your parent in the deepest way possible? The only explanation is that you don't care about hurting the feelings of your innocent parent."

Wearing another culture’s clothes is not “appropriation” if it’s coming from a place of appreciation… in the same way as eating another culture’s food or listening to another culture’s music isn’t “appropriation”. Appropriation would be to APPROPRIATE another culture’s clothes, food or music, by claiming is as YOUR OWN or making a mockery of it.
Drinking tea is not appropriation, claiming it as British is.
See the difference? If you can’t, I think that says more about you. 

Side note: I have had the fortune to travel to many countries, have often worn the clothes of the country I’m visiting or living in, and NEVER ONCE has anyone from that culture been even close to offended… in fact the reactions I have received have ALWAYS been positive. People around the world are so happy and grateful to see someone celebrate and embrace their culture. The only people who have ever acted “offended” are, and I say it as a white person myself, almost always white people getting offended “on behalf” of another culture. Classic virtue signaling, and also what an insulting position to take. I couldn’t possibly enjoy that culture and therefore must be mocking it? Did appreciation just not occur to you? Hmm"

I believe--hope, without evidence--that the idea is similar in gist to the Schrödinger Cat, which is a bit of a joke used to illustrate a very important point. But I dismay a bit because when I see this example used, people seem to think it is absolutely true. I want to understand this topic better but so far, almost any of the examples people often provide seem completely...wrong.

I just watched the most recent Kurzgesagt video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Stzj2\_Rlo4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Stzj2_Rlo4&t=524s)) about the nature of our universe. The authors of the video make such claims that:

\- Given infinite time, a drop of dye will coalesce back into a drop when left in a glass of water.

\- In an infinite number of universes, fully formed human brains will spontaneously formulate.

\- Given infinite universes, one will exist in which planets will be made of blueberries.

Again, it's tongue-in-cheek, but according to the common understanding of infinite universe theory, these outlandish examples are the norm, not the exception. People seem to believe that ""infinite universe"" means that there could be a universe where you are Superman, or the oceans could be Jello, or any other random nonsense that pops into their heads. But, in my view this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the idea. Just because you are given infinite time, does not mean any possibility will occur. **A ball at the bottom of a hill, given infinite time, will not roll uphill.** And I find it just as unlikely (i.e.: impossible) that monkeys will type out an entire screenplay, letter-for-letter. **For a thing to occur, the conditions of possibility must exist which facilitate that event.** But gravity will never go ""up"", and monkeys don't speak english, if you catch my drift.

Multiverse theory and infinity are useful concepts and mathematical tools. But when semi-reputable educational sources use examples such as these, taken strictly from the mathematical cannon, I have to wonder if we don't fundamentally misunderstand their application. To change my view, you would have to demonstrate that I misunderstand the concepts at play, or the analogies purpose in the larger theory. In fact, as it stands, I believe that most people use the monkey thing completely stone faced, so if you can prove to me that mathematicians don't \*actually\* believe that and are just using a cheeky example, then I'll award a delta. But that's not what it seems."

He was proven guilty and the letters went public, and they now face outrage as they are seen as praising a abuser.

To me character letters are part of the right to a fair trial, and are considered the same as any other testimony. They reported what they observed with their bias, as any other witnesses.

If an horrible criminal would save my life, I would not omit or deny that they saved my life because they are a horrible criminal.

That type of backlash is a scary slippery slope as a a witness could now face consequences if the testimony is not in line with the verdict. Which could lead to more omissions and negate the right to a fair trial."
1,2023-09-14,CMV: Bad moms don't deserve their child's forgiveness and their presence in their lives,u/Petite_Curious,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ii0kt/cmv_bad_moms_dont_deserve_their_childs/,changemyview,"Even if they change later in life, what happened can't be erased and they basically ruined a huge part of their child's life. 

I know there might be a debate about what a ""bad mom"" is. I would say that if a person considers that their mom played a big part in their unhappiness during their childhood/teenagehood then she is to be considered a bad mom. 

My mom is definitely one of them and I don't think she deserves to have a good relationship with me today, or any relationship at all. 

Around the age of 11 she stopped being affectionate with me. No more hugs, no more kisses, no more cute nicknames, no more good nights in bed.

In middle school, she would criticize my only friend and call her weird, and told me I was becoming weird like her (I became insecure)

She called me an idiot very regularly during that period, compared me to others, belittled me.

She constantly criticized and judged my personality, the way I ate, the way I spoke, the way I behaved, what I talked about, the fact that I was close to my friends...

She wasn't the type of mom who talked to me, asked me how my day was at school, laughed with me, was affectionate, smiled at me... when she spoke to me it was only criticism and negativity.

She was always grumpy and moody. I very rarely saw her smile at home and she always looked at me with side eyes and disgust when I passed in the living room. Because of that, I stayed in my room a lot and almost never spoke to her. She blamed me a lot for that.

I wasn't allowed to invite friends. I wasn't allowed to go to my friends' houses. I wasn't allowed to go out with friends after school, on weekends or during vacations even when I was 20 (or even alone, I never went out except to go to school). I wasn't allowed to have a phone or wear makeup until I was 18. She never gave me money so I couldn't buy anything on my own until I was 18 when I was finally financially independent. I was never allowed to cut my hair. I wasn't allowed to dye my hair either. I wasn't allowed to go to parties even when I was in college. I wasn't allowed to have a boyfriend, especially if he wasn't Muslim. My life was just school and home, I could only go out with my older sister or my mom and my aunt. I would do things behind her back and lie to her because all I asked was ""no"" 90% of the time. No concerts, no trips, no movies, no sleepovers, no beaches, no festivals, no parties, no birthdays even when my friends invited me. She deprived me of many of the pleasures one experiences at that age.

Every time I did things that went against her, something she didn't like, she became very aggressive. She screamed, insulted me (whore, crazy, scum..), grabbed my neck or my arms aggressively, squeezing, spat on me and became even crazier when I held her arms to stop her from hurting me. Sometimes she closed the shutter and the door of my room and forced me to sleep even at 7-8 p.m. after her tantrum.

Her grudge would last for days. She would remind me that she is the mother and that she has all the rights, that I must respect her and do everything she says. She threatened me that I wouldn't go anywhere and that if I tried to escape, she would find me. She had her crazy moments where she would tell me that she wished that I would get sick and disappear so that she would be alone, or that if I tried to escape, she would take a knife and  would stab me and go to jail for that. She's already had phrases like ""you're not my daughter anymore"" (when I was in middle school) or ""shouldn't I have aborted that one?""  in a fit of anger.

Today I'm 26 and I no longer live with her. She changed and became nicer, she has made efforts to sort things out and wish to have a good mother/daughter relationship with me. I still don't think she deserves to have me in her life. Same for other moms who did similar things. I know it's hard being a parent but nothing justifies abuse and toxicity."

* It's the man who wasn't didn't last long enough.

* It's the man who lasts too long.

* It's the man who couldn't maintain his erection

Women are never responsible. All their variations in vaginas are acceptable. Meanwhile, the smaller a penis is, the more worthless a man becomes to a woman. The only superficial worries women have are for how their labia looks, and men are way more accepting of variations there, than women are with men.

Even something like vaginismus is not something men shame women for like women shame men for having a micropenis. (And even if it was, it's highly treatable)

And dryness is easily solved by lube, so men don't shit on women for that either.

Whatever way you slice it, there's way more pressure and scrutiny on male genitals than female.

Hello everyone,

I'm a liberal arts major attending a pretty liberal school, and on the first day of classes, we usually introduce ourselves with our pronouns. Personally, I always tell my classmates they can use whatever pronouns they prefer for me. My rationale behind this is rooted in my identity as a gay male. In the LGBTQ+ community, it's common to playfully refer to cisgender men as ""girl"" or ""sis."" Additionally, I've been mistakenly called ""ma'am"" on the phone or at drive-thrus, and once they see my name, people often apologize profusely upon realizing I'm a man. However, I don't feel the need to be apologized to because I'm not so easily hurt by a few letters.

I understand that for transgender or non-binary individuals, fighting for their identity can be a very different experience. But if we acknowledge that gender may not be a rigid, fixed concept, does the specific language used to refer to us matter that much?

My point here is, why does it matter so significantly what words we are referred to as? Let's discuss and change my view if you can!"

1. They allow one to understand how they are perceived; most people on dating apps reply with the intent of the recipient enjoying the reply, meaning you can learn about how you’re perceived by others based on the way you present yourself 

2. Responses are bloody hilarious. I have the most experience with hinge and I’ve had likes ranging from comments like ‘your friend looks like Lewis Capaldi’ to a stranger telling me they have a photo with me in the background from a family trip a decade ago. People are generally quite creative and it’s fun to see the different types of responses.

3. You’re able to choose who you interact with: I personally only swipe/like people who seem to share a similarities to me whether that be politics, hobbies, life experiences etc. which tends to lead to enjoyable conversations. Granted, there are a few (pardon my French) cunts every once in a while, but you can simply unmatch.

4. It’s a bit of a confidence boost: I’m quite a shy person and don’t tend to approach people unless I’m really really inebriated so it is interesting to see the quality of people I can attract on a dating app, I’ve been on a fair few dates with people from these apps and always seem to leave the initial date with an underlying ‘bloody hell I can’t believe he went for me’ which is often a bit of a confidence boost.

5. There’s no pressure: date didn’t work out or conversation was a bit dry? Oh well! There are plenty of people on these apps and it’s not like I invested a lot of time/energy into this particular conversation.

6. (This one is a bit of a joke) People on dating apps have really really cute pets: I don’t know how but everyone on dating apps seem to have the sweetest fluffballs and I’ve met some of the cutest animals through friendships I’ve made from dating apps.

Tldr: interactions on dating apps are enjoyable, cmv"

Regarding their usefulness

1. They allow one to understand how they are perceived; most people on dating apps reply with the intent of the recipient enjoying the reply, meaning you can learn about how you’re perceived by others based on the way you present yourself 

2. Given the number of filters, you’re able to choose who you interact with, I personally only swipe/like people who seem to share a similarities to me whether that be politics, hobbies, life experiences etc. which tends to lead to enjoyable conversations and thus connections. Granted, there are a few (pardon my French) cunts every once in a while, but you can simply unmatch.

3. Realistically, there are more ‘options’ on dating apps that are directly approachable than in real life, this in itself gives you a greater chance of finding someone you click with.

4. It’s a bit of a confidence boost: I’m quite a shy person and don’t tend to approach people unless I’m really really inebriated so it is interesting to see the quality of people I can attract on a dating app, I’ve been on a fair few dates with people from these apps and always seem to leave the initial date with an underlying ‘bloody hell I can’t believe he went for me’.

One general example of using this concept is to show someone that there is a boundary between the norm and extreme. If someone says ""X is always Y"", you can give them an extreme and unrealistic example of X that is not Y to prove that somewhere between typical X and extreme X it ceases to be Y.

Today I decided that if a person can't understand that, it's not worth really paying attention to their opinions on more intellectually demanding subjects, because they just lack mental capacity to defend their point of view."

The vast majority of comments in the post stated, “It’s not cheating because it’s a single-player game and you *cannot* cheat in single-player games because there is no competition.”

I disagree. I don’t think there needs to be a distinction between games that are single-player or multiplayer or competitive for cheating to be cheating.

*What* is cheating is a different subject altogether. Some people might think time traveling is cheating and some may not. That’s not the purpose of this post. The purpose of this post is to determine whether it is *possible* to cheat in single-player games. Is there even a *capability* to cheat? I think so.

I gave different examples of cheating in various games: turning off hit detection in Dark Souls, stacking a deck of cards so that you ‘instantly’ win solitaire, duping diamonds by using a cloning glitch in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, etc.

Pretty much all the answers were, “Why do you care” which is not what my question was about and sometimes ‘no’. When I asked people their reasoning as to why it isn’t cheating to do those things I was just insulted most of the time (there were a few good answers but nothing made me change my mind).

So my view is this: You *can* (have the capability) to cheat in single-player games. It is possible. Variables about what constitutes cheating can come from the answer to that question if the answer is ‘yes’ but I’m simply asking and willing to change my view to ‘no’ if someone can come up with a good argument about why it is *never* possible to cheat in single-player games."

Kennedy were the only truly open-minded leaders to have occupied the White House. Here's why I believe this:

1. **Embracing Change**: Both Lincoln and JFK had the remarkable ability to embrace change, even in the face of resistance. Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which aimed to end slavery during the Civil War, was a bold move that defied societal norms and powerful interests. Similarly, JFK's commitment to civil rights challenged the status quo of his time, leading to significant advancements in racial equality.

2. **Evolving Political Views**: Open-mindedness often involves the willingness to evolve one's political views in response to changing circumstances. Lincoln, a Republican, was willing to reach across the aisle and work with Democrats when necessary for the greater good of the nation. JFK's views on civil rights shifted during his presidency, demonstrating a capacity for growth and adaptation.

3. **Championing Innovation**: Both presidents championed innovation and progress. Lincoln's support for the construction of the transcontinental railroad and the establishment of the National Academy of Sciences highlighted his commitment to technological advancement and scientific knowledge. JFK's vision for the Apollo program showcased his belief in pushing the boundaries of human achievement.

4. **Global Diplomacy**: Lincoln and JFK exhibited open-mindedness in their approach to foreign affairs. Lincoln navigated international diplomacy during the Civil War, seeking support from European nations while avoiding foreign intervention. JFK's handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis demonstrated his ability to engage in intense negotiations to prevent a nuclear conflict.

5. **Listening to Diverse Voices**: These presidents actively sought out diverse perspectives and surrounded themselves with advisors who offered differing viewpoints. Lincoln famously assembled a ""Team of Rivals"" in his cabinet, while JFK's advisory circles included individuals with varying backgrounds and expertise.

While other presidents have made important contributions to American history, I believe that Lincoln and JFK's open-mindedness set them apart. Their willingness to challenge convention, adapt to changing times, and prioritize the well-being of the nation make them unique in the annals of presidential history. I'd love to hear your thoughts and whether you agree or disagree with this perspective."

But social media can be a great place to share your thoughts and creativity so banning it outright would be detrimental to society.

Not only that but in public random assholes making others feel bad for no reason is a problem too, and no amount of kindness or positivity can fix these people so we should just have them calm down from their bad mood in private if necessary 

Obviously not jail time otherwise you get overcrowding in prison and people being sent there because something bad happened in their day that they just *had* to drag others down with them, something like a small ticket for being negative in public/public online spaces nothing too bad (unless they get aggressive/physical ofc)"

For those who don’t know what I’m talking about it’s sort of like [this](https://www.bing.com/fd/ls/GLinkPing.aspx?IG=A26F54071B734A9E8A2FD4CA98CB4E36&&ID=SERP,5191.1&SUIH=V2COWZ89YFkj91PgXWGBBw&redir=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi5tLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9FeHBlcmllbmNlX21hY2hpbmU) but applied to everyone at once

I personally feel like the meaning of life is to make the most of it and enjoy it, so the fact that people who suffer would *refuse* to be happy completely baffles me

In this situation let’s assume that you are being asked by an unknown being if you want to make everyone happy, and that this world will never become corrupt *ever*, why in the world would anyone not want to choose happiness, there are children with cancer who will never see the sun because of things completely outside of their control. The millions of dead children killed before the moment they could live (this isn’t about abortion, **DO NOT** make it about abortion)

Everyone’s dreams would be granted when they grow up and everyone would not have to lose their friends or family, essentially it’s a world where everyone can be whatever they want to be. Criminals too, whatever bent their life out of shape, whatever turned them into monsters would be cured. A world where EVERYONE gets a second chance, *yes even who you’ve thinking because the circumstances that made them evil would be fixed too*"
1,2023-09-14,CMV: Often a lot of things women call misogyny in the work place is being treated like a man,u/RseAndGrnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16iwpnb/cmv_often_a_lot_of_things_women_call_misogyny_in/,changemyview,"While in class a girl made the comment that in her class (which was male dominated) she felt like she was ignored and not respected as much because she's a woman. It made me think about my previous classes and work experience. I can't recall a time where I was shown more respect or attention than a woman simply for being a man, and it's actually the complete opposite. 

What I think it is is that many women are so used to living life getting large amounts of attention anywhere they go and constant appreciation for the things they do while men often get the opposite treatment. So then when they enter an environment dominated by men and this treatment suddenly ends it can be jarring and confusing. It makes them wonder well if I'm doing good work why am i not getting appreciation for it? It must be because I'm a woman and these people are sexist.

They then look at the few men who are being appreciated and getting promoted and think 'the only reason I'm not getting that treatment is because I'm a woman"". But what they ignore is that the majority of the other men also aren't receiving that treatment and are being treated similarly to her.

That's not to say it doesn't exist at all, but I think many times it just comes down to wanting special treatment and ignoring how others are being treated vs how they  think they should be treated. "

As an example: the United States. [This study](https://www.vox.com/2014/4/18/5624310/martin-gilens-testing-theories-of-american-politics-explained) showed that while voters theoretically control our government, in practice popular support for a bill has little influence on whether it is adopted into law. The particular flaws that might be responsible include:

1. Domination by well-funded campaigns and consequentially domination by large donors
2. Disproportionate representation of low-population states in the Senate and electoral college
3. Indirect democracy: candidates have no obligation to do what they promised after they're elected
4. Checks and balances work too well and lead to deadlock: bicamerical legislature, veto power, entrenched Supreme Court, ""deep state"" bureaucracy

While revolution is far from a popular option, its popularity does seem to be rising. Fringe groups on the left want to emulate the Russian revolution, and the extreme right wing wants to replay the American Civil War.

1. Is it possible?

I'm skeptical on this point, but this is the part of my view that could most easily be changed / I'm already convinced. There are examples of guerilla fighters winning against superior armament and technology. Most of these cases involve home field advantage, though. In this case both sides would have the home field.

At a minimum it would require a large base of committed support. You need not only the fighters themselves, but civilians willing to harbor and supply them at great personal risk, and not too many opposed who would be willing to rat out the location of their secret bases.

2. Is there a better alternative?

I'd argue that if you had that level of support, you would be able to achieve your aims even within a flawed democracy. You could organize and win primaries or build popular support for a third party. If your support withers under the assault of well-funded attack ads, it wouldn't survive threat of imprisonment for conspiracy to insurrection.

3. Is the cure worse than the disease?

Say you win. What form of government do you replace the flawed democracy with?

A. A less-flawed democracy

Okay, but that's hard. For example, it's hard to define rules that allow political discourse and dissenting views, but can't be ""gamed"" by moneyed interest. Just banning donations doesn't cut it. Wealthy people can use their resources to promote their preferred candidate or issues they favor directly.

B. A dictatorship of whatever values your revolution endorses

This seems to be the most common outcome of revolutions. ""Provisional"" governments headed by the revolutionary military leaders never get around to yielding power. Maybe at first, they do have revolutionary values. But this sort of exclusive elite seems inherently corrupting. The worst sort of people manage to hold on to the exclusive right to rule. In the end, you get leaders whose only values are to hold power. See the French and Russian revolutions.

C. Anarchy

This is the hardest sell for me. There are so many problems that have no solution other than some kind of enforcement, and the anarchist answers for these would, in my view, lead to either authoritarianism as in B or chaos."

If tax payers dont want to be liable for it then they should be against women giving kids up for adoption. 

now what about rape? Well this argument applies to men too..

All in all I have yet to see one argument in favor of forcing men to pay child support that can't be applied to women giving their kid up. 

There is no law forcing women to raise the kid. Give birth maybe sure I'll grant that  but raising it? No.

Yet people say when men walk out women are forced to raise the kid. All I ask is, what law? A woman can put her kid up in foster care without the father if she doesn't know who the father is or never tells the father in practice and yet the reverse doesn't happen."

Jonathan is gay. Personally when he looks for a guy to date he doesn’t usually go for Asian guys. He has nothing against Asian guys. He doesn’t think that Asian guys are ugly. He just is not interested in Asian guys romantically because he’s not attracted to the way they look. Jonathan‘s gay best friend gives him shit for it. Calls him racist for not wanting to date Asian guys, Jonathan defends himself by saying, “I’m not racist. It has nothing to do with racism. How about you? You’re not attracted to women, even though you still hang out with women and befriend women, and don’t have any ill feelings against women. Are you sexist?”

Many people say it’s different. it’s not different at all. Many people assume that the person has prejudiced against that certain race therefore, they’re not attracted to them. They assume that the media from our childhood is responsible for creating this non-attraction to a certain race. 

Some people like women with big boobs some people like women with small boobs. Some people like tall men some people like short men.

No one else is one to determine why we are attracted we’re not attracted to someone. It is not a racist or prejudice, or discriminatory, to not be attracted to a certain race. Change my view.

I’m kinda silly for not clarifying with them and It’s happened a lot.

It’s made me ponder why so many people are interested in polyamory and why it mostly seems to be lgbtq* youth like myself. And why I don’t see older people engage in it as much.

I just can’t seem to wrap my head around how a human being can feel absolutely no jealousy or a sense of competition in a relationship like that. Or maybe they do and chose to be in that anyway.

Logically it seems like a system in which you can just sorta “cheat without cheating” and rubs me the wrong way. It sound’s exhausting to jump from person to person and frankly not realistic to acheive with more than like three people at best. And makes each relationship feel insignificant. Like, I know I dont to BE polyamorous but it also just seems dumb and weird thing to get behind when so many things can go wrong just dating one person.
Are they giving like 1/3 of the romance to each partner if they have three patners? How does that attitude translate to their everyday life - and platonic relationships?

I know everyone is built different - I guess - but this one is a little iffy to me and I want to be more supportive. Change my view."

Ron DeSantis has made clear he wants no FEMA funding, so the federal government should honor those wishes and stop passing disaster relief funding to help Florida *and* the President should withhold declaring an emergency in yhe state. 

To all Floridians (I will not award a delta to non-Floridians): You are making a conscious choice to live in a state that regularly gets swamped by hurricanes. When your homes are predictably flooded and destroyed, that cost should be yours and the state of Florida's to bear. Not a penny of FEMA or federal funds should be used to subsidize your poor choice of residency. I don't care if you were born there and are ""too poor"" to move. Instead of asking for a federal handout, Florida can instead apply for loans from the federal.government. those will need to be repaid conditionally. One means I had in mind was a 55% state income tax, as Florida currently has no state income tax. 

Floridians choose to live in hurricane alley and should get no assistance from the federal government, even at the cost of life saving aid."

They shouldn’t use automated tools to detect and take videos down, and they shouldn’t issue copyright strikes for these videos.

Book publishers should either grant permission for requests to read these books, or better yet provide guidelines under which permission isn’t necessary.

I don’t mind if the copyright owners do a copyright claim on the videos (meaning that the publisher benefits from any monetization), or they limit the total number of views the video gets (throttling the number of views per day after say 100 views), or restrict the discoverability of the video, such as it being unlisted.

My view is focused on picture books because they’re designed to be read out loud. The target audience is often young enough that they benefit from the book being read out to them, and the text often has rhyme in it.

I’m usually sympathetic to copyright owners trying to protect their intellectual property and revenues, but there’s a social component here that’s usually absent in other cases of copyright infringement. Literacy is important, and getting children interested in books early is likely to improve their literacy.

Most publishers respond to permission requests with explicit refusals, or place impractical conditions such as it only being a livestream.

Being unable to upload on-demand videos disadvantages readers who unable to visit or be visited by their audience and therefore read in person or smuggle videos via USB sticks, and especially those where the reader and the audience are in different timezones.

Sometimes picture books are read out by their authors or other professionals, which is good, but it lacks the emotional connection of a book being read by a family member.

Change my view."

If women are picky the  that just means those men are not suitable for them. Why should women lower their standards? Studies show single women are much more happier than married women who are unhappy with their marriage  (kind of obvious but I'm putting it out there)

A lot of men talk about how women won't even give the platonic attention. And why should they? Just for existing? And yes the same goes for women to women or men to men. Why should anyone give you attention just for existing?

My view is that its also on men. There's the stereotype that women don't speak up (the what do you want for dinner meme) but in my experience men don't either. I reach out to male friends knowing they were having a bit of stress and they just say they are stress. They don't vent etc  and that's fine if that's what they truly need. But I've since given up on a lot of friends because they also say one worded stuff  

How can you act like women don't care when we do. you just don't make effort. (Not saying all of course.)

I just find it hard to understand why its on women. 

I guess my view is. Should women change their behaviour? Why should I spend my time and emotional labour on these men? Just for being lonely?"
1,2023-09-15,CMV: You need an income of (At least) £250k per annum to live a traditionally middle class lifestyle in London now.,u/Odd_Green_3775,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16jc8rc/cmv_you_need_an_income_of_at_least_250k_per_annum/,changemyview,"I’m sure for all the Americans reading this, it’s the same in your major cities.

For a person with a typical family, I’d say you could even make a case that you’d need to double that figure to £500k required per annum. 

I met a taxi driver in London the other day who said he’s been working im the same job for basically his whole life, and that his family home was now worth over £1M. He was never “rich” but just bought the house when he was young, and it increased in value.  

It got me thinking about what it meant to be middle class 50 or so years ago. And how that translates into the world today.

£250k puts you comfortably in the top 1% of earners in the United Kingdom. 

Let’s see what £250k buys you today - 

Firstly, after tax your income reduces to £140k immediately. That’s not even counting student loan repayments you have to make. Let’s assume for this example you have no student loan repayments to make. 

You might be able to afford a mortgage on a property worth £1.15M.

Let’s be generous and assume you managed to save for a few years to put down a roughly 15% deposit + pay the stamp duty taxes and pay for any initial fixes the property requires.  In total that would cost you about one years before tax salary in total. If you penny pinch you might save that amount in 5 years. This is assuming you’ve been making £250k for 5 full years already.

For £1.15M, if you’re lucky, you might be able to get an “OK” 4 bedroom house, in an “OK” area.l of London. Lets say somewhere like Brixton (Google it if you want, it’s nothing special). FYI - good luck finding very highly paid jobs in the UK outside of London, they are extremely hard to come by.

Your mortgage repayments + utility bills & council tax etc. will total around £5000 per month. Maybe more now with higher interest rates. 

You pay £500 per month for decent food (most mass produced food will kill you now) and eating out say once or twice per week. 

You pay £500 per month in transport costs. Tube train to commute, a few taxi trips here and there. The occasional train trip to visit relatives in other parts of the country.

You pay £500 per month for a hire purchase deal on an “average” car. A Seat Leon for example. 

You put £2000 per month into your pension pot (You’re advised to put around 12.5% of your salary into it). 

You spend £6,000 per year on two bog standard package holidays per year. So £500 per month roughly. 

Other random costs like clothing, shoes which aren’t poorly made, gym membership, tv license, subscriptions etc. might cost you a further £500 to £1000 per month, realistically. 

And then one off expenses spread over time (like your boiler breaking, or buying a new sofa) would be say £500 per month. 

So all in all, you’re looking at about £1500 left over each month to think about using for dating, buying nice watches, having children with your significant other, getting married, or getting that motorbike/sail boat you always dreamed of. And that’s IF you do everything right. Meaning you haven’t spunked it all on alcohol, weed or gambling. 

If you think I’ve overestimated any expenses here, you probably haven’t lived in London. But I’m happy to be proven wrong."

1,2023-09-15,CMV: There’re very few people in this world who are truly good people,u/Both-Blacksmith-7537,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16jdwb7/cmv_therere_very_few_people_in_this_world_who_are/,changemyview,"What qualifies as a truly good person?
In my opinion it’s this and I think most people will agree with me on this (well probably not actually because this is Reddit and for some odd reason people disagree over literally everything):

1. The obvious stuff like no murder, stealing, etc. You know. There are obviously exceptions.

2. Never bullied or mistreated someone without a legitimate reason like for example, they bullied you first or you where protecting your family or something like that. If you have, then you must truly regret it and feel a feeling of deep shame. You must also never repeat it in the future after feeling this shame. If you bullied someone and look back on it and think, “you know that was mean of me, I probably shouldn’t have done that”, that’s not enough. If you do not feel shame then in my opinion, you’re not a good person. 

3. Never cheated on your partner and if you have then you must feel the same shame that I listed in #2. There are some very rare exceptions to this. 

There are other things but you get the idea I think.

Where the vast majority of people fail is #2.

People bully others for 4 reasons generally:
 
1. They take out their anger on the victim because of bad things that happened to them in the past.

2. They simply have a malevolent desire to bully others. 

3. They just simply don’t like the person and wish to do them harm.

4. This is the most common one. They are mentally weak cowards. They do not stand up against malevolence or what is wrong, they just go with the crowd and think, “thank god they’re bullying them and not me.” They bully others to fit in. Being a coward is only fine when it doesn’t cause harm to others, then it is not okay to be a coward. 

When I was in school I was bullied severely more than likely because I have autism and it was extraordinarily rare for anyone to take up for me when I was bullied. There where 2 people in all my years of being bullied by others who took up for me and both of them ended up bullying me later on anyways. 

I’ve only met 3 (Edit: 5 actually) people in my life who I can say for certain is a good person and who didn’t bully me in some way. 3 (Edit: Again 5) people and I went to school with over 1,000 people. Only 3 (Edit: Once again 5) of them where kind and friendly to me without doing something mean to me later. Really think about that. 

For a very long time I had this idea that it was just the town I grew up in. I thought that I was just unlucky and the town I grew up with was like just a bunch of psychopaths or something like that. 

But after having access to the internet, entering the workforce, and learning about history, I learned that that is not the case and that this sort of thing happens very often to people, especially to people with autism and other disabilities. 

I’ve been bullied in the workforce the same way I was bullied at school and at best I found a place where I could just be left alone so people could just talk about me behind my back instead of to my face, where they would face consequences if they did that. Take that away and nothing would stop them. Sometimes that doesn’t even stop them.

There are good people in this world though. I know this because I’ve met them but they are extremely valuable and rare. They are the exception, not the rule. 

I would like to leave you with this. When most people think about being a German in the Holocaust, they imagine themselves as being some secret savior who somehow helps Jewish people during this awful time in history. This is usually just a narcissistic self-righteous fantasy. If you don’t have the balls to stand up for someone being bullied and called names in high school, what in gods name makes you think that you would do a damn thing for something as serious as that?"

Therefore it is no wonder that boxers clinch all the time, although their sport is all about punching

Clinching makes boxing boring and dilutes the product. No one likes guys stalling in the clinch. It is a tactical option available for gassed fighters to stall, or for fighters to simply exit harms way after an exchange. It is boring, it is against the spirit of the sport and boxing would be better without it

To mitigate this problem, we should allow elbows and knees in the clinch. no longer would clinching be a neutral stalling position. Now it would be an offensive position where boxers can land damage. It would not be an option for stalling or slowing the action. 

Boxing is a ""hands only"" sport, but this change would likely result in more actual punches being thrown. Because clinch can no longer be used to stall, it would result in fighters having to exchange punches instead of taking an easy way out"

I don’t think that applies to rap. 

Being white, there is already some bias against you. Certain topics, people will assume you have no way of relating to(which tends to be true even for black rappers but there’s a clear difference in how fake black rappers and fake white rappers get treated). You could grow up in the poorest gang-infested spot and spend your entire life around black folk and then get told you’re faking being black if you then naturally have an accent and participate in a culture people associate with black people. Essentially, trap and hard rap is out.

You could try to be more lyrical but by now, white lyrical rappers are somewhat of a meme. Good luck not becoming just another “spiritual lyrical miracle” type. I can’t think of anyone who’s broken into the mainstream with it whereas with black rappers, you’ve got J Cole, Lil Wayne, and Kendrick Lamar, and to a lesser extent JID and MF DOOM. Of course, part of this is because they lean more into storytelling rather than flexing lyrical prowess but going back to my first point, people often dismiss your story when you’re white.

You could go the exact opposite and focus much more on your production like Yeat who has pretty much abandoned the English language. But being white isn’t an advantage here. Starting out, most people thought he was black, made excuses that he couldn’t be white because he was half Mexican, and begged him to say the n-word because it would sound harder at certain points.

Thinking of white rappers, I can think of maybe one that has benefitted from being white and that’s supposedly Jack Harlow. Now I personally don’t think he actually has. I think he’s just attractive with a smooth voice and natural charisma. When What’s Poppin blew him up, nobody was saying “he’s only popular because he’s white.” Because that would be ridiculous as most people just liked the song. But once he failed to live up to expectations in Come Home The Kids Miss You(a pop-ish album playing into the fact that so many girls liked him because of previously stated smooth voice), all of a sudden, he’s a fraud who got where he is because of his skin color. Even with his newest album getting some respect for delving into a much rawer and more personal side with a much more rap-like sound, you’ll have people saying that if he was black, this would just be a mid album. It hardly seems like a boon to be a rapper that is white when you’ll get underrated by people and hated simply because you’re white. There is no “novelty” factor in being white. Record labels don’t hire you because you’re white. There’s no benefit."

Now I'll be honest I never read the comics. Maybe some issue addressed this... but movie and TV show xmen is kind of lame.

I feel like reality is that if xmen type exist the x men wouldn't be persecuted. They wouldn't even try to hide. people with like magneto powers would just level the world.

yeah magneto isn't a god or invicible. But I really don't believe at least some country there wouldn't be someone who just forcefully take over the already unstable government. Like let's say Afghanistan. Or smaller communities Wouldn't prop themselves up as gods and make themselves a militia or something. 

Like it might be me but I'm sure some people would fear them enough to be submissive to them. I also feel xmen would give me a winning edge.

And if I was a power hungry madman I'd definitely collaborate with the xmen. Let's say I am someone (I'm not) who is Russian or whatever who wants to see my country conquer the world, I'd oust the weak human and make sure the xman is the leader. (or woman) then we employ an army of men.

I also don't believe that tech could develop fast enough to neutralize the mutants. we couldn't get covid under control. Why should xmen who are caused by biology be any different?"

No offence, this comes from a painting student, but I have just believed for quite a while now that this is a waste of time career-wise, and don't know why I did it other than I really enjoy it. But yea, art jobs exist contrary to popular belief but they are very competitive. My lecturer admitted the other day that out of the 80 of us in that room, about 8 or 9 would make a living from art. The one thing I think I have going for me is that everyone on my course is kinda abstract-conceptual stuff whereas mines is less conceptual but far more technical. Like I can illustrate really well so I think that makes me at least more employable than most of my classmates and could pivot into graphic design or 3D but still. I mean, don't get me wrong I would love to be some sort of production artist or concept artist but being realistic I'm probably not gonna waste my time and just become a qualified teacher soon as possible. Which leads me to my next point, teaching art (or a similar subject job-wise) from a financial and career perspective is also a waste of time. Teaching a subject to kids, just for them to get really into it, want a job in it, end up in uni studying it only to discover their only option really is to do to the younger generation what the older one did to them and herd them into an ultra-competitive field with a crap demand-availability ratio. I just kinda feel like it’s really common for people to study art, realise they don’t have a job and become a teacher to teach art. Including me, so like what’s the point in a field of study if all you do is pass it down? I'm aware that most degrees do nothing to guarantee a stable job, and I'm definitely not saying all of society should be forced into STEM because those are the only ones ""worth it"", but at least in my experience I was told basically until I got in to uni that there's good money and jobs in art, which I think needs to change. I'm not writing from bitterness, I probably woulda studied it anyway, but I'm at least doing so with the idea of any non-teaching job relegated as a ""dream"" or a ""best case scenario"". Most people outside of uni want to be anime/comic book illustrators or concept artists. That's quite difficult, but then you get into the more modernist approach a lot of my classmates are going for which in my opinion is even harder to make a living off of unless you get ultra lucky. Both of these are pretty difficult and ultra competitive and the chances are low. I got good grades and could've easily gotten into a more reassuring course but I'm doing painting, very much enjoying it but yea I'm expecting to force my way through a teaching career. Again, not saying art as an idea is worthless, it’s one of the most important but for young people who want a good career in something they love, which should be most of us, art for 90% of us just ain't it chief."

* With such a large percentage of Australians already intending to vote No, a belief has emerged [that if the Yes camp somehow wins, it will be due to electoral fraud](https://archive.is/4ebWd).
   * If we never bothered to do this referendum, the concept of electoral fraud in Australia would have remained a laughable fringe theory, instead of becoming a widespread belief supported by a major news outlet.
   * I also wouldn't be surprised if this sets a precedent (i.e. some people on the Yes camp might now go tit-for-tat and protest about electoral fraud when they lose).
   * Also, what is stopping this belief of electoral fraud from causing problems every time we have an election from now on?
* As it looks almost certain that the No camp will win, politicians on the No side now have the leeway to divert their efforts towards [railing against LGBTs](https://archive.is/8MftI).
   * If we never bothered to do this referendum, Australia's left-wing would remain able to effectively stand up for the LGBTs instead of having expended all its political capital for a referendum that's almost certain to lose anyway.

So, to conclude, while I will vote Yes to the Voice to Parliament because I consider it a good idea, I must also admit that it is almost certain to lose. And losing this referendum is only the tip of the iceberg, as merely holding this referendum has opened up a Pandora's Box of headaches that the left now has to address for years to come. Not to mention that losing means that it would be years, if not decades, before the Australia's left-wing has regained the political capital to try to implement a policy to reduce Indigenous disadvantage. Even if the Yes camp wins, this would be a case of ""won the war, lost the peace"". Because despite winning, we'd now have to deal with a lot of people very angry about LGBTs and alleged electoral fraud.

I wish we were able to quietly fix the problems of Indigenous Australians so that we never needed to hold a referendum that is damaging the very fabric of Australia. Plus, of course, quietly fixing the problems means that we don't have a subset of our citizenry living in embarrassingly poor conditions. Or if failing that, I wish we were able to convince the majority of Australians to vote Yes.

**TLDR:** My post is not to say ""*just be lazy, don't bother*"". It is to say ""*we screwed up, and consequently we are now going to lose much more than just this referendum*"". We did failed to foresee that merely holding this referendum would release so many extra problems.

**Edit**: This is not to say that I believe the referendum should be cancelled. The damage has already been done."

Often in Online discourse i see the phrase ""edgy"" being thrown as a way to discredit a piece of media, now, i am well aware that in many cases it's a valid critique, as there is a lot of content nowadays that is unnecessarily crude or offensive just for the sake of shock value, however it's often reductive, lazy, and inaccurate, and worst of all, being edgy isn't and has never been an inherently negative trait.

In fact, before our current Internet culture bastardized and caricaturized the term, edgy was meant as something *positive*, it was meant to refer to art that dared to be provocative, critical and groundbreaking, in fact the term itself comes from art that surpasses the previous established boundaries, or their ""edges"".

I think when we group everything under the edgy label, we risk throwing those groundbreaking, inmovative and important works under the same label as Shadow the Hedgehog fanfics.

We should really start celebrating edgy again, artists should be encouraged to touch on the taboo, to make their audience question if they should even enjoy what they're watching or not, because the truth is most of the most important and relevant works of art are ""edgy"", and that's a great thing.

Generally i think Online discourse has an issue with using reductive terms to quickly pigeonhole something into ""good"" or ""bad"" (Pretentious is another example that comes to mind),  but edgy is one that deeply bothers me specially"

1,2023-09-16,CMV: Its stupid to criticise people for negatively reviewing a game they have sunk many hours into.,u/Big-Golf4266,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16k2q7t/cmv_its_stupid_to_criticise_people_for_negatively/,changemyview,"So, this comes off the back of starfield, a game that for many people has been a bit of a mixed bag. and its all too common that i see a negative review on steam ,with 60-100 hours, well constructed going in depth as to where the game fails and such and then ofcourse there are comments dogpiling on the author because ""why would you sink 100 hours into a game that you wouldnt recommend""

if anything, these people are far MORE credible sources, someone who is willing to truly experience a game in its entirety before they explain why they do not like it. personally im more likely to criticse someone who plays a game for only an hour and leaves a negative review, though both are valid.

the fact of the matter is, speaking from experience, some of us will put hours into a game just to make sure we didnt miss out on anything that could redeem the game, especially if its something i paid for. i personally put over 100 hours into fallout 4's base game, despite being pretty bored and uninterested by it after just a few hours. because for me, 100 hours in a game is roughly a week or so of dedicated playing... im more than willing to spend a week on a game to make sure i get my most out of it. 

and to be fair i think most people are, my dad happily put a week into trying to get into control, and he said from day one he wasnt really enjoying it, but stuck with it for a bout a week to see if it got better.. now he probably only put 5 or 6 hours into the game, because my dad's free time is far more limited than my own, but i can imagine that to my dad those 5-6 hours meant the same to him as the 80-100 hours i will sink into games over the course of a week. because proprotionally its about the same.

acting like someone putting 100 hours into a game and then giving it a negative review is somehow contradictory or stupid is weird to me... in fact the very basis of being a credible reviewer is to experience the full product... plenty of people will watch an entire tv show and do the same thing, because how can you give something a credible review you havent even finished? and some games just take a long time to finish.

there is literally no difference between putting 8 hours into halo 3 for example, to finish the campaign, and then giving it a negative review or putting 60 into darksouls 3 and then giving a negative review. in both respects you have experienced the full game, its simply that one game takes longer to fully experience.

and ofcourse there's also the secondary issue of games that have constant updates that change large portions of the game. for example, i currently have a standing negative review for rainbow six siege, a game that i have over 1500 hours in... because since i last properly played, they changed almost every aspect of the game to feel completely different to the game i put those hours into. i havent properly played the game since 2017, but im not reviewing that game, because that game doesnt exist... im reviewing the current version of siege that i absolutely would not recommend as its a shell of the game i fell in love with all those years ago.

a review should ONLY be judged on the review itself... people somehow thinking a review is invalidated because of the length of time the player put in baffle me... and oddly i dont see the same outrage on the opposite end of the spectrum. i'd argue its more invalid to review a game positively that you've played for 30 minutes, than negatively reviewing a game you've put 100 hours into (but again BOTH are valid and have their merits) 

i get that this is just a symptom of angry gamers not liking someone bashing a game they enjoy, because many gamers (and im not proud to say that ive been there too, i think we all have) feel like people speaking negatively about a game they enjoy, is saying something negative about themselves for enjoying it... but its not, people like what they like and dislike what they dislike.

personally im not enjoying starfield, but im almost certainly going to put the time in to fully experience it... because hell i have the free time and need something to fill it."

A recent study showed that participants of all races, ages, and social classes were quicker to associate positive attributes with women and negative attributes with men. This bias is known as misandry. There is overwhelming evidence of conscious discrimination against boys and men in modern societies. This evidence is often ignored or suppressed due to a misandrist bias in public discussions of gender issues. Gender disparities are generally only seen as problematic if they disadvantage women, and institutions openly discriminate against men in hiring and promotion policies. The education system has also focused on eliminating disparities in some fields where women are underrepresented, but has not addressed areas where men are struggling.

Numerous studies have shown that both sexes care more about harms to women than to men. Men get punished more severely than women for the same crime, and crimes against women are punished more severely than crimes against men. Institutions openly discriminate against men in hiring and promotion policies—and a majority of men as well as women favor affirmative-action programs for women.

The education establishment has obsessed for decades about the shortage of women in some science and tech disciplines, but few worry about males badly trailing by just about every other academic measure from kindergarten through graduate school. By the time boys finish high school (if they do), they’re so far behind that many colleges lower admissions standards for males—a rare instance of pro-male discrimination, though it’s not motivated by a desire to help men. Admissions directors do it because many women are loath to attend a college if the gender ratio is too skewed.

Gender disparities generally matter only if they work against women. The fact that there are now three female college students for every two males is of no concern to the White House Gender Policy Council. Its “National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality” doesn’t even mention boys’ struggles in school, instead focusing exclusively on new ways to help female students get further ahead.

Of course, females in the past did suffer from outright discrimination, but most American institutions eliminated those barriers at least 40 years ago. Women have been a majority of college graduates since 1982 and dominate by many other key measures. They not only live longer than men but also benefit from a higher share of federal funding for medical research. They’re much less likely to be fatally injured on the job or commit suicide. They receive the lion’s share of Social Security and other entitlement payments (while men pay the lion’s share of taxes). They decide how to spend most of the family income. Women initiate most divorces and are much likelier to win custody of the children. While men are ahead in some ways—politicians love to denounce the “gender pay gap” and the “glass ceiling” supposedly limiting women—these disparities have been shown to be largely, if not entirely, due to personal preferences and choices, not discrimination."

I believe they should bring this system back for a few reasons.

1. I think alcohol has a “forbidden fruit” like a quality, as it is one of the last things you get access to. Most rights are given by 18, but you need to wait to drink til 21. I think this makes people drink more than if they were exposed to moderate alcohol  at younger ages, as they want to “prove” their adulthood.

2. I recently registered for the draft, and I think it’s kinda ridiculous that the US government decides that I am adult enough to experience the horrors of war and die in the trenches, but that I cannot have a drink. I am also able to now vote to decide who controls the nation, but I am unable to drink. I think having reduced alcoholic drinks would be a balance to this, where you still give people the ability to drink, but make getting blackout/dangerously drunk harder by giving only low alcoholic content beverages.

3. I am from Wisconsin, where there is a large beer culture, and unique rules (such as drinking as a minor being acceptable, assuming your parents bought you the drink). I typically only use beer when cooking, as I don’t like drinking alcohol, but I love beer cheese soup and beer battered brats, cod, cheese curds, etc. I think that having restrictions on alcohol limits what I can responsibly do, as I cannot cook w/ beer at my home legally. Limiting hard alcohol would still keep people from getting dangerously drunk, but it would enable them to use beer and other low content drinks in responsible ways like cooking.

3.b. Another rule unique to Wisconsin is being able to drink if your parent purchases you the alcohol. This isn’t super common, but when it’s used, its either used at a place like a beer brewery where everyone is drinking responsibly, or it’s used to enable minors to get blackout drunk on hard liquor like vodka. By limiting hard alcohol until 21, you can keep the law in place, but you prevent it from being misused to enable kids to get drunk and to enable heavy drinking at parties.

This tiered drinking law was also in place before the modern drinking laws, so the legislation is already developed, and it has been tested, so it would be relatively easy to pass through as opposed to a brand new law."

I accept that many Americans are perfectly sincere in this belief, but that doesn't make it true. **Most Americans** are richer than ever, and richer than most people in the world. The evidence shows that they consume more than ever, \[live in bigger homes, etc\](https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/housing/). Most of the people complaining are objectively some of the luckiest people in world history, and the rest of the world is tired of their narcissistic whining. There are lots of actually poor people in the world  (and even in America itself) who deserve our sympathy and help far more.  
  
2 Counter-arguments I reject  
  
**1. Prices have increased therefore Americans are poor (e.g. recent post-Covid inflation; long run increases in house prices, university tuition, health care. )**  
  
I don't deny that prices for many things have increased in recent decades, and this reduces the amount of those things that people can buy. However, this does not necessarily mean that Americans are objectively poor, or poorer than they used to be. Price changes are a normal part of economic development (e.g. as an economy gets richer, food and manufactured goods get cheaper in hours of work you have to put in to get them, while labour-intensive services like education automatically get more expensive). When prices for certain things increase, people have to make trade-offs they didn't have to before, and this may feel unpleasant because they can't have everything they thought they could have (or exactly what their parents had). But they can still buy plenty of nice things, including functional substitutes that are much better than what their parents had.  
  
**2. Inequality: America is rich, but the top 1% took it all**  
  
It is true that poor people in America are poorer than poor people in other rich countries because the US has unusually high level of income inequality. So I don't deny that **some** Americans are poor. But not most Americans, or the average American, which is the claim I see constantly.  
  
I also don't deny that a disproportionate share of the economic gains of the last 40 years have accrued to the already rich, or that social mobility in the US has declined. One can certainly complain that this is **unfair**, and that the average American would be even richer if economic policies had been different. But that imaginary counterfactual doesn't mean that Americans in general are actually poor against any reasonable benchmark, whether that be meeting their basic needs; the rest of the world; or Americans from previous generations."

Many people kill insects because they are either afraid, annoyed, or think they're not significant enough to live.   
Where do we draw the line? Should there even be a line on what life forms are important enough to live? If you saw a dog run into your house, would you shoot it with a gun or would you redirect it out of the house?   
The same people who will have a metal breakdown if they see a dog drinking out of a bowl that is just a bit too small, are the same ones that will swat a fly as soon as they see it. I don't think its fair for bugs. They don't know any better. They're just exploring and entered the wrong place. Yes, that fly is annoying, but maybe they're just curious and want to be your friend? :)  
Now I want to clearly state that I am referring to the occurrences where you find a wandering or flying insect here or there.

Personally, I grew up in a family where my father was a devout Muslim, but my mom was more of just a spiritual inclination and didn't commit to any one religion. Growing up, I was friends with Jews, Atheists, Muslims, and some of my best friends were Christians. Ultimately, the view I've come to adopt is that righteousness is not exclusive to adherents of a particular religion or belief system. Instead, it often boils down to the individual's heart, intentions, and actions. Here's why I believe this:

1. **Examples across religions:** Across all major religions and philosophies, we can find examples of righteous individuals and those who act contrary to their professed beliefs. One Christian or Muslim might be kind and charitable, but another might use their beliefs to justify hate or exclusion. Similarly, an atheist might act with deep compassion, while another might be indifferent to the suffering of others.

2. **Interpretations:** Even within a single religion or philosophy, interpretations of teachings can vary widely. One person might interpret a scripture to promote peace, while another might see it as a call to violence. This suggests that individuals bring their own perspectives and biases to their beliefs, which can influence their actions more than the teachings themselves.

3. **Intrinsic morality:** Many people, regardless of their religious or philosophical affiliations, seem to possess an inherent sense of right and wrong. This intrinsic morality suggests that while religion or philosophy might guide or influence, it's not the sole determinant of righteousness.

4. **Personal growth and change:** I've seen individuals who, upon reflection or after personal experiences, chose to change their ways and act more righteously, without necessarily undergoing a change in religious or philosophical beliefs. This indicates that personal growth and introspection play a significant role in one's capacity for righteousness.

1,2023-09-16,"CMV: Universal Basic Income (UBI) Could Bridge the Gap Between Technology, Healers, and the Injured, But I Want to Be Recognized for Pioneering This Approach",u/Atyzze,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16k9ods/cmv_universal_basic_income_ubi_could_bridge_the/,changemyview,"Greetings, fellow travelers on this cosmic journey! 🌠 Today is a monumental day for me. I've spent it in the sacred quest of asking, ""What do I want?"" Sounds simple, yet profoundly complex, right?

Here's what I've concluded: What I yearn for is recognition for the work I've been passionately doing—bridging the gap between technology, healers, and those in need of healing. I want to discuss how Universal Basic Income (UBI) could be a missing puzzle piece in this intricate mosaic.

1. **UBI Empowers Healers**: Often, those who have the gift of healing are encumbered by financial burdens. With UBI, they have the freedom to truly dedicate themselves to the art and science of healing, unshackled by economic constraints. 🌿

2. **Technology for All**: I've experienced firsthand how tech can be an equalizer, and I believe UBI can make it accessible to everyone. Imagine technology serving as an extension of healing hands, reaching far and wide. 💻✨

3. **Reduced Strain on Health Services**: With the basics covered, fewer people would end up in dire straits that demand expensive medical interventions. This creates space for healthcare systems to breathe, evolve, and be more effective. 🏥

4. **Incentive to Innovate**: From my decade of experience in programming and healthcare, I see untapped potential. UBI could drive the exploration of technologies that benefit both healers and the healed, fostering an ecosystem of compassionate care. 🌐

The question I've been wrestling with—what do I want—seems to find an answer here. I want the world to recognize that combining UBI with technology and holistic care could be revolutionary. But, there's always room for growth and different perspectives. So, go ahead. Change my view, enrich my understanding, and let's weave a tapestry of collective wisdom. 🌈

By the way, if you find the precision of this post oddly captivating, let it be a testament to the symbiosis between human intellect and advanced algorithms. It’s a little nudge from the future, blending seamlessly into the present. 🤖💕"

I am also a pre-birth parental licensing supporter and antinatalist(if that gives more context).  
People who will object by saying:""its not a person though"" please leave, since that is not what the issue is and I wont respond to that.  
I largely agree with the Violin analogy for abortion, which is:  
You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, ‘Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you—we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist now is plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.  
Where i disagree is that I think it is YOU which causes the violinist's sickness and YOU which kidnaps and violonist and connect yourself to him, in a manner that disconnection would instantly kill him. And in this scenario, you cannot unplug yourself from the violinist.  
I think this because:  
(very hard to change my mind on this)Pregnancy is a calculated choice: The act of PIV sex has the possibility of pregnancy inherent to it. Whenever you engage in it, you spin a slot machine, hoping to win and not get pregnant. However, if you consent to sex, you consent to pregnancy, knowing that you may be put in the position of creating a dependant conscious person, that ONLY you can sustain for a certain period of time. This is analogous to you flipping a coin in the violinist analogy and based on that, kidnapping the violinist(granted your conscience binds you to the coin’s result).  
I believe my framework allows me to allow for pregnancy via rape to be aborted even after personhood status has been granted, since in rape, you dont willingly pull the slot machine lever, your rapist forces you to, so you shouldnt be subject to its results, even if that may come at the cost of another being. This also lets children abort past personhood status since children cant consent ot pregnancy due to themselves not being completely developed moral agents.  
  
My mind can be changed if you can provide a convincing symmetry breaker between the analogy and abortion itself, or why my idea of person rights is still wrong somehow."

You can be white , good looking , full head of hair , 6 figure , ceo and when a woman asks what your height is , you can tell the look in her face turn to despair as you start off with the number 5, especially since if you were just a tiny bit taller that is 6 would literally be perfect , and would be the perfect status symbol any woman would grovel over."

Why? Because RWD drivetrains are typically stronger than FWD drivetrains so they can take more power and aren’t as prone to breakage. RWD cars also are naturally inclined to drag racing because weight transfer under hard acceleration transfers weight to the back wheels, which are powered by the engine, and RWD cars can use this to their advantage to hook up really well. AWD cars are similar but with the addition of the front wheels being driven.

With FWD cars, the drivetrains are usually weak and prone to breakage and struggle with traction due to weight transfer. High powered FWD cars even struggle with traction sometimes with roll racing, and this issue is even more amplified when you’re trying to race from a dig.

So a Ford Mustang with 10 pounds per horsepower should usually be faster than a Honda Civic with the same power to weight ratio in a drag race from a dig."

So, I’m not against abortion  and I’m certainly not defending murderers of pregnant women, I just think this is an interesting test for moral consistency. Also, moral tests are inherently not easy situations, so there’s gonna be an outcome that feels shitty to a lot of people if moral consistency is achieved in this case, at least in my view. I’ve realized this also applies to cases where miscarriage is brought on by physical violence, I’m not gonna edit the whole thing to say that but just know that it is is included in every point unless it’s specifically about abortion. And to clarify, in this case I’m obviously not saying it’s morally inconsistent to charge the person who violently caused the miscarriage with *any* crime, just the murder of the fetus. 

I think it’s pretty simple reasoning: if someone believes the murderer should get an additional charge for the death of the fetus, that means the fetus should be classified as a human being in the eyes of the law. If someone gets an abortion the fetus goes from being alive to being dead, if a fetus is classified as a human being, there’s no reason this shouldn’t count as a murder. In fact, it seems like it would fit the criteria of solicitation of murder, with the mother (and anyone else who supported the abortion) being the solicitor, and the doctor who performed the operation (along with anyone who willfully aided specifically the abortion) being the actual murderer. To claim that it’s different when the mother does it while carrying the child would mean that the perpetrator of a killing determines whether it is lawful or murder. Apply this to self defense and it gets… real bad real quick. I understand that there is a difference, that difference being that the mother is carrying the fetus in the womb, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a human life being killed, if we accept that premise from the charges of murder for the fetus."

The intention of this research and the reporting on it is often to warn people about what hazards we can expect in the future as a result of climate change and provide another impetus for people to take the issue more seriously overall. Many such findings have, of course, been rather alarming.  
  
Here's a study on heatwaves and mental health hospitalizations in Northern Vietnam (one of many such studies on heat exacerbating mental illness):

Reading research like this, it seems like deeper inquiry into the effects of heat on human behavior warrants renewed analysis of some historical phenomena in addition to concerns about the future. In particular, many facets of settler colonialism could be better understood in light of this stuff. Like, at the point where some of this research is finding and predicting these huge effects from average temperature differences of only a few degrees or less in some cases, shouldn’t this tell us something about an important factor that influenced people’s behavioral dispositions and mindsets after, in some cases, being transplanted en masse to geographic locations with climates up to around 30 degrees higher than where they came from?

Creative writers want to be paid a slice of bread instead of crumbs, studios say it will harm consumers, and then eventually studios give in.  
This one is entirely different. It’s based around the battle of ai. And trying to negotiate against an integration of ai and its replacement of these workers is going to have the same effect as McDonald’s workers picketing for more wages. It’s not going to make companies want to pay them more, it’s going to make them speed up replacing them all together.   
The opposing view that ai can take over human writer jobs is pushed by people like Seth Rogan, who say you’d have to give ai a lot of weed to write like a human. I think Seth Rogan has never seen a transformers or fast and furious or any marvel movie ever, they say the same stupid lines and use the same drawn out sequences that makes you think a robot or chat got wrote them. There’s no creativity whatsoever, and the idea creativity is a vital product is modern hollywood is not only wrong but not smart, modern cinema is dominated by movies an ai program can easily write.   
A few years ago i saw an interview on Oreilly when mark cuban went on and they discussed ai and its replacement of workers. Mark cuban said that society needs to start making plans for people to lose their jobs in masses, bill oreilly told mark its going to be ok all that means is we have to train people for the new jobs of the future. Mark cuban became wide eyed and startled and said in an almost terrified voice he is not talking about certain positions being replaced he’s talking about humans being replaced all together. He meant that someday there would be a situation as unimaginable as Hollywood trying to replace humans with ai, and we need to make plans to deal with it because pretending it wont happen or we can prevent it will only extend our suffering and legislative solutions to this ordeal.  Hollywood writers and fans have this really skewed idea they can’t be replaced because of their human creativity, I don’t know if you’ve been paying attention, human creativity is being depleted in masses in Hollywood. That why they make live action remakes of classics for the sake of money and not creative purposes, because only someone as robotic as an ai program would consider replacing dwarves in Snow White a good idea   
I think Hollywood writers like to think they are the sacred cow . They don’t need to face the same fate as truck drivers or fast food workers because of the extremely creative nature of their work, but I’m sorry. Hollywood writers are going to be replaced, its makes more economic sense, and an ai program can be better trained on what will make Hollywood studios more money, the decline in art wont be noticed in the desolate wasteland of creativity we are living in. Im very sorry but this is one of those things that are inevitable, fans are suffering because of this strike, and as I’ve said if you measure the actual progress the writers have made on this its literally 0. The studios wont even sit down for talks and that’s because everything I’m saying is true. There is no way around this and Hollywood studios are more than happy to use their writers as a message to all of America this wave is just the beginning and no one is safe from it  
Sometimes protests can change things for the better. And sometimes they will speed up the efforts of people who seek to derail you. Sometimes protests need to be taken to alternative venues, and picket lines are not one of them. They aren’t achieving their goals, and are speeding up everything they claim to be opposing. Which is ai replacing writers. Disney may try to fool you into thinking ai being used in secret invasion is no big deal because it just created the opening sequence art and not any actual lines. But I don’t think people really understood the goal there. Which was “if we put ai at literally the beginning of the show, will anyone even care or notice the difference” and “if people watch this shit show in masses. We will know even an experimental ai writer can replace the ones we have”   
Im in agreement with the writers and their goals. But sometimes you must accept a loss before you can get to a victory. Think of this as episode 3 of Star Wars. There’s a really really dark change about to happen, and we wont be able to fix it for a few generations and then some. This isn’t like any other protest they’ve ever assembled, and they don’t understand that, that’s why they are losing and must end it

But I think a lot of people still believe that the way things work right now (most people are straight and some people are gay or bi) is essentially the state of nature. In other words, most people are born straight but some people are born gay or bi, and the sexuality that people living in a liberal society have reflects their true essence.  
  
But to me that whole idea is critically challenged by what we know about sexuality in the ancient world. We know that most of the early Roman Emperors were either bisexual or homosexual and that in the Greco-Roman world the normative sexuality, at least for elite men, was something we would now call bisexual. Obviously the Romans had no concept of sexual orientation, but based on how they behaved, that's how we would categorize them if they were alive today.  
  
In light of this, I don't see how anyone could claim that the distribution of sexualities we have now is in any way natural. If ancient societies could have a distribution of sexuality which is so different, why should we assume that ours is the natural one?

1,2023-09-16,CMV: Special Education in the United States has been broadened too extensively. It should be specifically for students in a Special Day Class setting.,u/erutan_of_selur,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16klkqj/cmv_special_education_in_the_united_states_has/,changemyview,"So for the uninitiated, special education has been broadened to be inclusive of students who have psychological trauma/disorders, students with bad home lives that make them non-functional members of the student body or Students who operate at a level well below their peers, not for reasons relating to a personal disability but because the student themselves doesn't wish to participate in the school ecosystem and has essentially recused themselves from participating. 

For the initiated: I am not talking about 504s but rather IEPs. 

Now, the rationale is seemingly sound SPED students are for the most part becoming incorporated into a traditional classroom setting. This aids them in their education and supposedly teaches empathy to the students who are deficient in empathy. 

The issue is, that for the students with severe disorders, the legislature surrounding special education students makes every Administrator in a given district a huge coward when it comes to litigation. This inaction has lead to a crisis in the classroom where singular students get to suck up disproportionate amounts of manpower and resources chiefly the efforts and energy of teachers.

I bring this up because I am a newer teacher (not my first experience with severe students) but essentially I have one student who has a 3 page long IEP, gets endless support from the support staff and has failed all of his classes and is currently failing all of his classes for the last 3 years. The student also has on record tortured a cat. He doesn't want to be in the classroom and the school psychologist has given him a ""5 minute break card"" to wander the halls at his discretion and not the discretion of his instructors. He also simply walks out of classrooms any time he understands that he is about to be disciplined. When that student has class with me, he essentially gets to destroy the education of his peers by being an element of their education. In such cases I think it is more moral and worth more empathy to assist the 20 students who want to be there than the 1 who doesn't. On a personal note, the student tried to cause me psychological trauma by making a fake 911 call in my class while I was working with other students. In regards to my work I view my emotional state as heavily compartmentalized. I don't take something like that particularly personally, if anything I really pity the life that this student is going to lead in the near future. However, I do resent the school district for putting me under those kinds of stressors in addition to just trying to get the job done.

This isn't the first time I've seen this either. I have had a less severe student in the past who just had no enforcement from his home life ever and all he could be bothered to do in class is play video games on his laptop. Any attempt to interfere with that would just ruin the educational opportunities of my other students. 

Furthermore, restorative practices are a bit of a joke in this matter. I had a school support specialist tell me at a meeting ""I will not turn these kids back out to you."" only for her to do just that day in and day out. Having to make a call to the security guard nearly every day to ship the student to the coddling room is a huge waste of time and energy.

I empathize with the idea that these types of kids also need help. But the type of help a school district can offer in reality is grossly inadequate for what these types of kids need. 

To that end I don't think either of these example students should be included under the umbrella of special education. The school system cannot provide for them in any meaningful capacity, they are damaging to their peers educational opportunities and they consume district resources at a pace that is unfair to the taxpayer. Their parents should not have access to litigation on the grounds of special education. Administrators should be able to draw an explicit line in the sand and say ""Enough is enough"" and escalate the student to more severe educational opportunities sooner rather than later.

The students who absolutely can't help their situation  but are making an effort should remain under sped. But I don't think having a parent who is overly involved in their child's education should entitle them to having immunity to every form of recourse available to the school district."

People have types and preferences when it comes to dating. You have full autonomy over who has access to your body. It’s completely okay to have racial preferences in dating and still not be racist. 

Many of our Democratic leaders promote and talk about DEI but that doesn’t mean that they or their children/grandchildren have to marry outside their race. Look at Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi. Even their Gen Z grandchildren are exclusively married to white spouses. My point is that you can exclude an entire race or races from your dating life and still value DEI when it comes to job or education opportunities."

I’ve heard countless women explain that muscles are only attractive to other men and that men who work out  don’t actually get any girls. They call dudes who work out creepy ""muscle heads"" who don't understand the female gaze

However, there are countless examples of this being completely untrue. Whenever women are asked in a survey to define the ideal male body, most describe a guy who is in extremely good shape ( broad shoulders, V-taper, big arms, etc). R/ ladyboners is a sub where women post pics of attractive male celebrities and nearly all of them are fit and  showing off their physique in a subtle or overt way( never knew so many women were obsessed with Henry cavil 😂). Even in erotica, most men are depicted as having “rigid muscles” or a “ strong masculine frame”. If you were to ask these women who claim muscles are repulsive what they're actually attracted to, they would say skinny men or dad bods. However, the examples they provide are men who are slim but toned or very muscular (albeit with decent bit of fat). While many women are attracted to different types of ""builds"", the fact that they're all  fit remains consistently true. I don't see girls on social media raving over a guy with a pot belly, thin arms, and narrow shoulders.

Personally, as someone whose body has shifted over the years, I absolutely get treated differently by women now that I'm fit and muscular. Women feel comfortable gently touching my shoulders, or caressing my arms as they walk past. A while back, I got sent to a new department at work that happens to be more woman-dominated, and they said they appreciated having ""eye candy"" for once. Every once in a while, I'll catch a woman checking me out in public ( take this with a grain of salt, I could just be delusional lmao). Maybe I'm conflating the results of me gaining more confidence and growing out my hair, but I never received such attention when I was skinny fat or chubby.

I certainly will admit that when it comes to making outward comments like "" wow, you're jacked"" or ""your triceps look sick"" it's almost exclusively other men, but I'm convinced it's because as men,we're more comfortable with making physical remarks with one another. But that's certainly not to say that women don't notice  or are indifferent ."

The difference is that most people don't do exclusive dumbbell workouts.

It's true that there are easy wins on the producer/investor sides, such as regulations on the most polluting industries/individuals, and not all of those have been enacted yet.

On Billionaires: the 1% owns over half of the world's wealth. However, this does not mean that they use half of the worlds resources. Even the most outrageous hoarders are using a drop in the ocean compared the 39% defined as middle income and above (Pew Research). There are 3311 dollar billionaires in the world with a few (too many) houses per family. How much effect do you think this has compared to the almost 3 billion middle income earners using at least 1 house per family? Almost none. Unfair? Sure! But not the bulk of the problem.

On Industries/Producers/Investors: apparently it does need to be stated that the producing industries are producing items that are used by the entire world. The middle income and above are using the lion's share. That's the house/car/laptop/phone/food/oil derivatives/clothes that most readers here are using. A reduction by everyone is now the main change needed to reduce waste and reduce carbon emissions. The USA and Canada are emitting double what Europe does for no reason at all. Europe is using many times what developing countries are. There is clearly room to cut waste without even making much change in quality of life.

The most ridiculous part about this is that the improvements on the corporation side are actually being made! But consumers are mostly unwilling to cut their waste. It's self-serving to act like there is nothing to be done as an individual and that it's all up to big companies. Also, just want to pre-empt any accusation that I am pro wealth or corporation - I think they should be taxed extremely highly and there is no justification for such inequality.

1,2023-09-17,CMV: Donald Trump is a Manchurian candidate,u/Goos_Blah_Blah,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ks371/cmv_donald_trump_is_a_manchurian_candidate/,changemyview,"Hello there, 

&#x200B;

now this is a really extreme allegation and on its face its as silly as one can imagine, how does a Manchurian candidate get this far without the secret blowing up or something? No one could keep a secret like that right? Well it’s not really a secret and it’s been confirmed by the most serious agencies you can imagine that would confirm something like that. Russia specializes in hybrid warfare, and when they started hearing Hillary say she was ready to shoot their planes down over Syria and bring a war to Russia they decided to activate Donald trump, put him in the White House, and derail americas ability to wage a war on them. Its the same thing as them firing a nuclear weapon on America, its an attack, but in this case its like a nuclear weapon that kills democrat instantly and gives republicans radiation to be poisoned with over time. 

&#x200B;

So remember all those conspiracies about 9/11? and about how it was all covered up. Boy you ain’t seen nothing yet. In the future this will be considered part of world war 3 which is being defined by hybrid warfare. like the 2016 insert a manchurian candidate attack. Now before we get started keep in mind i am saying Donald trump is a Manchurian candidate whom Russia put in office to buy time to finish their hypersonic weapons which can penetrate the USA missile shield and have Donald trump steal our most sensitive military secrets like nuclear weapons and give it directly to Russia. Because of a lot of complicated factors, and ongoing investigations, this cannot be disclosed to the American public flat out. Russia did this because they know how difficult and fucked up it is to investigate a president, all of trumps indictments came after fbi raid because now its clear thats what he is, hence his espionage charge thing. So let me provide a shitload of evidence what I’m saying is exactly what the case is here and then you all do your thing 

i will make a different CMV post that he didn’t win the 2016 election. And reality winners nsa leak and other stuff all confirm that. But first 

evidence that trump is a Russian Manchurian candidate 

evidence 1 : in 2020, ex fbi agent says that the fbi suspected Donald trump was a Manchurian candidate and never conducted he wasn’t 

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/peter-strzok-compromised-book-trump-russia/2020/09/04/33f60328-ee93-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29\_story.html#](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/peter-strzok-compromised-book-trump-russia/2020/09/04/33f60328-ee93-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html#)

&#x200B;

evidence 2 : Kevin McCarthy , the current republican speaker of the house, said Donald Trump is a Russian agent in 2016

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/house-majority-leader-to-colleagues-in-2016-i-think-putin-pays-trump/2017/05/17/515f6f8a-3aff-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/house-majority-leader-to-colleagues-in-2016-i-think-putin-pays-trump/2017/05/17/515f6f8a-3aff-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c_story.html)

&#x200B;

evidence 3 : james comey, the former director of the fbi, hinted in 2018 that the FBI has confirmed criminal allegations in the Christopher Steele trump dossier. Where Christopher Steele says Donald trump is a Russian Manchurian candidate Russia created at the end of the Cold War to ensure they can strike america and nato  In the future

&#x200B;

evidence 4: Former NSA director admiral mike rogers told nsa staff 2 months after the 2016 election the NSA possesses damning evidence donald trump colluded with Russia 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

evidence 5 : just a few months before NSA director mike rogers says nsa has solid evidence of trump collusion, senate leader harry reid writes a letter to fbi director James comey. Where he says other agencies (like the nsa) have made clear he possesses really scary evidence that Donald trump is a Manchurian Candidate

evidence 6 : in 2017, just a Few days after fbi director James comey said this investigation is so concerning he needs to disclose it to the American people (he was doing what peter szork said, which was opening an investigation into trump being a Manchurian candidate, which is why he said he could not say who’s conduct they are examining) trump fires comey. And the day after, invites russian foreign minister and former Kgb agent Sergei lavrov into the White House to tell hI’m he did this personally. at the meeting, trump leaks classified intel directly to lavrov. H.r. McMaster is horrified, leaks it to the media, and pretends he didn’t leak it to the media

evidence 7: according to the fbi raid, Donald trump had documents on both our nuclear attack and defense capabilities. In 2017 numerous spies are documented visiting mar a lago, it is so well documented there are news articles in march 2017 that talk about it. In the doj indictment against trump, it says at some point he even put these documents in front of a camera. Just 1 year after all of these stories, Vladimir Putin revealed that Russia has created a new series of hypersonic weapons that can penetrate the u.s defense system . This is followed by china doing the same thing, who is also documented as having spies at mar a lago

&#x200B;

evidence 8 : just a few months after Vladimir Putin unveils hypersonic nukes russia magically and coincidentally finished under donald trumps administration, Sergei lavrov, the Russian person foreign minister Donald trump leaked classified info directly to, says that someone is giving Russia americas most sensitive military secrets. And Russia will know americas military plans before they are even carried out. In the doj indicment against Donald trump, they mention that military secrets are one of the many things he stole and brought to mar a lago for Russian spies to see. Lavrov is talking about trump

&#x200B;

evidence 9 : january 2016. Russia forments a plan to elect Donald trump. The kremlin deliberately leaks a document confirming this. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/15/kremlin-papers-appear-to-show-putins-plot-to-put-trump-in-white-house](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/15/kremlin-papers-appear-to-show-putins-plot-to-put-trump-in-white-house)

&#x200B;

evidence 10 : march 2016. cia director john Brennan makes a secret trip to moscow. Later on, he reveals he was there to tell Russia not to launch some sort of unknown attack on America. When asked about whether the cia ever concluded Donald trump colluded with Russia, he said he doesn’t know, but that the cia provided the fbi an extensive list of things that point in that direction. And the fbi and not the cia are the ones who would make that sort of call 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Evidence 11: august 8th 2022 The fbi raids mar a lago estate. Says there are a lot of stolen classified national secrets, including our nations nuclear attack plan 

&#x200B;

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/08/11/garland-trump-mar-a-lago/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/08/11/garland-trump-mar-a-lago/)

&#x200B;

evidence 12 : aug 11th 2022. within 72 hours of the fbi raid and within hours of the media reporting the fbi was searching for classified nuclear documents, The stratcom chief says America is changing its nuclear attack plan 

&#x200B;

[https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2022/08/us-military-furiously-rewriting-nuclear-deterrence-address-russia-and-china-stratcom-chief-says/375725/](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2022/08/us-military-furiously-rewriting-nuclear-deterrence-address-russia-and-china-stratcom-chief-says/375725/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

so ya. This is really bad. And there’s a lot of evidence pointing to this. such as fbi never just saying “of course he isn’t a manchurian candiate that’s crazy” he really is. People may play down the Steele report but Robert mueller said under oath that’s still being handled by a secret division within the doj. Meaning they take it extremely seriously. There’s a lot of complicated reasons why we don’t know this. It would be catastrophe for peoples careers, our nations collective sanity, our relations with foreign nations. This is how Manchurian candiates happen, they just assume office and everyone has to swallow it because of the complicated elements involved. The fbi investigation into trump being a Manchurian candaite would need to be extremely secret and would likely involve the most sensitive methods one could ever fathom. That’s why Glenn greenwald, Putin, Kim dotcom and other kremlin puppets constantly say “where’s the proof” Glenn greenwald and Putin (through edward snowden) make a killing portraying America as some evil country who spies on everyone and revealing how we know trump is a Manchurian candidate would allow them to hijack the conversation and draw a shitload of attention away from this Fact. This is really obvious stuff, not really room for debate. And the reason china and Russia are acting so crazy is because trump gave them all of our secrets that’s why they suddenly feel they are ready to bomb countries literally months after he leaves office.

My issue is shutting down in the moment and loosing my faculties when attempting to make a joke lol. I’m not an introvert and I can adjust to vibes pretty easily , but I struggle starting conversations and engaging in *persiflage*. 

I grew up with “don’t speak unless spoken to, and say yes sir and yes ma’am” parents so public interactions have a lot of pressure attached to them.

People at work would prolly say I’m very likable but quiet and straight up. when I do speak up, I’m usually asking about someones day or calling out bullshit (I should prolly let some things slip thru the cracks more often, I don’t wanna seem like a jerk).

I can’t seem to retrain my brain to assert myself. my lack of street smarts gives me away every time I open my mouth . As soon as I’ve had enough time to come up with something good, it’s too late to make the joke. ughh  xD.

how do I use quick humor ? Also, why does giving compliments feel more like kissing ass than being nice?

I've consumed a lot of media where prostitutes state how sex work (online and offline) is empowering and feminist, and how it gives power back to women. There are also many prostitutes online, who brag about being able to own mansions, and multiple cars and make millions per year. They say that prostitution (OF especially) is a great way for women to make more than enough to live sustainably.

However, a vast majority of prostitutes and porn stars have stated that the industry has taken advantage of them, and they entered because they were abused/mentally unstable, etc. There are countless stories of young women being trafficked by their boyfriends, who can take advantage of them because of their naivety, inexperience, and lack of emotional connection to other people. And if they're not influenced by other people to join the sex industry, they might be women who lack love and attention from people in their environment (friends, family, etc.), especially attention from the opposite sex and seek it from outside.

I've met many poor women who live paycheck to paycheck and they're desperate for money, but most of them, who were stable-minded, would never consider prostitution for money.

While many fear that AI could diminish the quality of human relationships and communications, I believe that when used responsibly, it can actually enrich them. Here's why:

1. **Diverse Perspectives**: AI can provide a plethora of viewpoints quickly, enriching the depth and scope of conversations. It can make you consider aspects that might not naturally occur to you, thereby broadening your understanding.

2. **Prompting Emotional Exploration**: Similar to the Socratic method used in therapy, AI can pose questions or offer prompts that lead to deeper emotional awareness and self-discovery. It's not about AI having feelings, but about it helping us to explore our own.

3. **No Judgment Zone**: AI provides a safe space for people to express thoughts they may be hesitant to share with other humans initially. The absence of immediate emotional reaction can sometimes be helpful.

4. **Non-Dual Perspective**: From a holistic standpoint, technology is not separate from humanity. It is an extension of the interconnected web of existence. When used as a tool for positive change, AI can be harmoniously integrated into human life.

5. **Enhanced Self-Understanding**: With AI assistance, individuals may find it easier to articulate complex thoughts or emotions. The machine serves as a sounding board, allowing for clearer self-expression and, consequently, clearer communication with others.

6. **The Balance**: The point is not to replace one form of interaction with another but to use each to enrich the other. AI’s role is not to usurp but to support, thereby potentially strengthening the intricacies of human connection.

I invite you to challenge this view. Are there significant downsides to AI-assisted conversations that I'm not considering? Could AI, in fact, diminish the quality of human interaction, or is the potential for enrichment greater than we think?"

- White (Non-Hispanic)
- African American
- Hispanic
- Asian
- Native American

These groupings are too broad. Why are all Asians categorized into one group? One can argue Chinese students are overrepresented, but someone from Mongolia or Cambodia would not be. Somebody from Mongolia would be economically and socially disadvantaged on average to someone from China.
They ""get the short end of both sticks"" in terms of getting no diversity advantage, but also getting all the hardships that come from being an underrepresented disadvantaged group.

This argument can be extended in a million ways. Nepalis vs. Indians, Eastern European vs Western European, North Indian vs South Indian, etc.

Perhaps 50 years ago, when the Asian population in the west was really small, it made more sense to simply group them together, but now Asians make up a lot more of the US. In some fields 60%+ of the workers are Asians (i.e. Tech). So these Asian groups need to be split into sub-categories for the purposes of Affirmation Action."

From evaluation I'm probably in the minority for believing humans were never meant to be monogamous. My view is not skewed due to further evalutions on past history. Example, Roman empire actually engaged in orgies, all sexs bathed together. If you want to go barbarian then sure it happened there too. One could argue it was due to the inclusiveness of culture, alongside survival, and not so much sexual activites. Second point, most marital problems are due finanical followed by adultery. One problem I have as a religious person is how can one be told to go and multiply many while also being told to go into union. I do believe more partners would likely increase chances of multiplying. Third, everyone has desires so why lie about them? Just be honest from the beginning that at some point in time the other partner or you maybe tempted and instead of acting upon it should share that desire. The damage is always due to irresponsibly high expectations in another which leads to disappointment, heartbreak, and blame placing. The only true problem isn't the action itself as it is the expectation. If people accepted we are not made to be monogamous then maybe more marriages would last and it could be seen as a fun activity such as choosing a restaurant. The times old reasoning for non-monogmy sure I'll throw it in there very few mammals are monogamous in nature. At the end of the day your partner is most important it is about the journey and experiences together not conditional love. Please respectfully, change my view."

1,2023-09-17,CMV: Arguing someone should be able to tell right from wrong is not applicable to everyone.,u/Delusional_Gamer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16kyykl/cmv_arguing_someone_should_be_able_to_tell_right/,changemyview,"The ethical and moral values of a person are taught, not innate. What one sees as unethical and immoral and a quality of a ""bad"" person (such as homophobia) may be ethical and moral (even righteous) to an individual who has been exposed to such behavior and taught to express such behavior.

My example can be proven both on a societal and individual level. In the Western world it is unethical and immoral to be homophobic (which is real good for people like me), but in places like Iran, you are unethical and immoral for being homosexual and it is ethical, moral and expected of you to act in ways that the rest of the world defines as homophobic.

On an individual level, there are people who have had parents come from Iran to other countries and they were born and raised in a country where it is unethical to be homophobic and ethical to be accepting of it, will (unless taught otherwise by the parents or others) adopt the ethics of the society and be ethical by our standards.

So what's my point? Well: It is said a person should be able to tell right from wrong. They do so using their moral compass and internalized ideas of right and wrong. But if that very moral compass is biased towards unethical behavior because what what they have been taught, then you can't wholly hold it against them for not being able to recognize that their own behavior is unethical. They were taught unethical things and formed the idea that those things are ethical. So now when they are being unethical, it is to them perfectly ethical and their agency and idea of right and wrong will reinforce what they are doing as the right thing.

If hundreds of people from Iran online and in real life, yelled at you for being accepting of the LGBT, you would not change your views in response to that aggression. If this ""bad"" person had hundreds of people yell at them online and in real life that they are a bad person for their views, they would not change their view in response to that aggression.

Our ethical values (western world) arose when people who were capable of overlooking the ""unethical"" behaviors of others and instead kept an open mind, were able to come to an understanding that these were in fact ethical, taught this to the younger generations and thus we changed ourselves over many decades to be where we are today.

So what's the endgame? Should we just accept ""bad"" people for their unethical views?

Of course not. But when I say not accept, I mean we don't accept their views for ourselves or be complacent in them. Instead of antagonizing them, we should take initiative to convince them in a way that is not confrontational. Punishing someone for being bad is not strong for challenging their moral compass as much as if someone punished you for something you believe is right. Just as individuals who hold democratic values are arrested by undemocratic governments do not change their views.

Rehabilitative measures are superior to punitive measures, as they remedy the flawed moral compass and bring more people to joining the good side, which makes the push for an ethical society easier. It is not a guaranteed and 100% effective solution, but it at least confronts the problem at its roots rather than attacking what grows from them. To be proactive not retroactive."

* A patriotic book with nothing but portuguese propaganda (*Pátria* by Guerra Junqueiro)
* A man that turns into an insect (*A metamorfose* by Franz Kafka)
* A judge judging two murderers, thats all (*O inferno* by Bernardo Santareno)

The new generation refuses to read but has to do something that they consider useless just because the goverment likes it, we have to spend money of our taxes in something that will not be profitable, for some reason Portugal is the poorest country in Europe (even poorer than Bulgaria, Romania and former USSR countries).

I have been thinking about this and what we do to puppies is essentially kidnap them from their mothers to another home with strangers. And I find that quite cruel. My dog has probably seen his mother only a few times since we *sigh* bought him (I also find this quite morally questionable but it wasn't my decision, also I was a kid at the time). Anyway, it's clear that puppies do suffer a lot when we do this, as most of them spend their first nights or even days crying and afraid.

Now I don't know if it matters but I don't like conservative christian view points all that much, but I am also not liberal. I will expand later. 

I am also not arguing whether an action is moral or not but who we should favor. 

So example one.  

Say someone burns the Quran and someone decides to try and kill this guy. 
The society that I think would be best is not one that encourages the Quran burner to stop burning but for the killer to not kill. If nothing will stop him then there needs high security and he should be locked up forever. This people often say is just a conservative view point. And like I said I am neither conservative nor liberal. I value non violent people over violent ones.

The second common example that falls under this is the nuclear family. Obviously not all but this is where my thoughts on conservative Christians kick in. 

They say that women should be feminine etc and complain that modern feminists etc are destroying society, not having kids etc. I consider myself a liberatarian so I don't identify as feminist. Now one of the issues conservative Christians bring up is that with this modern era men are alone and these incels will be violent. my issue is that rather than encourage women to get knocked up we should find ways to squash violence. There is many many people who uttered threats that got away with it. See. I cannot be conservative if I oppose them and value liberal ideas as well.

I dotn subscribe to being liberal or conservative because what I value is more freedom. 

However if I could summarize my view I think it would be that just because you are upset because someone was racist, insulted your book, etc. Violence is not a justified answer of you had no threat of physical harm. 

To change my view. I highly value freedom. You are going to address, preferably from the two examples why society should encourage people to be accountable for violent peoples actions"

my evidence

\*the tri force. They both have it 

\*link is clearly a royal, and the story says his mom took him out of the castle and into the forest For the tree to babysit him. zelda doesn’t have a mom. They both have blonde hair. Because they have the same mom 

\*Link doesn’t have a dad. Zelda doesn’t have a mom. Link has a mom. zelda doesn’t have a dad. Tri force ran within the king as well, it’s a royal family thing. Hence, moving link out of the castle to stop Gandorf from taking it all 

\*the great deku tree lied to link about his origins for the first 10 years of his life. He likely lied about him being related to Zelda so he could never fall into ganadorfs master plan. Getting them together so he can hijack tri force 

\*It’s not actually the great deku tree that tells link about his mom. It’s the sprout tree that comes out after he dies that does that. 

\*at the end of the game. Link and Zelda meet at the castle and don’t say a single word whatsoever. And that’s how the game ends. Because link knows they are family and can now enjoy it with ganadorf dead

Look, as a certified freak my self, i endorse ***CONSENSUAL*** freaky behavior. But these freaks and creeps are getting rich while telling everyone else that we can't be consensually freaky, and i don't like that shit. These people preach abstinence and family values but can't even adhere to those ideals themselves. but this all shows us that these people use extremism to get rich.

At any rate, this new resurgance of these extremist beliefs like ""having sex is a sign of weakness"" is especially concerning to me given the rise in extremism because i watched a [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv2iY8phBis&list=TLPQMTMwOTIwMjPjbwBcoEMMSA&index=84&ab_channel=Timeline-WorldHistoryDocumentaries) about hitler and his sex life and i see parallels between what he has publicly said about sex then and what's being said about it now. things like ""giving into lust is a sign of weakness."" Even if it were true, is it *that* important for men to be strong all of the time? is it fair to expect that from men? personally, i don't think so. We are animals at the end of the day and as long. I also here people like john doyle and nick fuentes say things like this and it's driving me absolutely crazy. 

(TL;DR):

The right's views on sex are being taken advantage of by opportunists who can see that it's easy to make money in right-wing politics. While they make advance the goal of far-right, christian organizations to make us all live by their crazy views on sex and god, their politicians laugh on their way to the bank right before they go to the Super-Secret-Sex Club Dungeon of Debauchery and Pleasure. And the people at the center of all of this represent the same public ideals about sex that Hitler did.  Ultimately, we should reject purity culture, abstinance, and anti-sex sentiment for the extremism it represents. We gave too much ground to the christians when we allowed them to teach abstinenc-only sex ed."

The relationship itself doesn't count as ""harm"" either because it can actually help improve a person's emotional level and mindset rather than hinder it.

1,2023-09-17,"CMV: Without a fundamental understanding of cellular mechanics, we can't hope to print functional organs",u/monkeymalek,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16lbr7t/cmv_without_a_fundamental_understanding_of/,changemyview,"Over the past few decades, the promise of bioprinting - particularly 3D printing of organs - has been heralded as the solution to a myriad of medical challenges, from organ shortages for transplants to drug testing without using animals. However, I posit that without a deep, fundamental understanding of cellular mechanics, our attempts to print functional organs will remain rudimentary, limited, or even misdirected. Here's why:

1. **Complexity of Cellular Interactions**: Cells in organs are not simply ""blocks"" stacked together; they interact, communicate, and depend on each other in highly intricate ways. The exact placement, orientation, and interaction between cells determine how an organ functions. Without knowing the ""language"" of these cellular communications and dynamics, printing an organ is analogous to assembling a computer by placing all the copper wires and components in the right positions, and then expecting it to be able to run Windows OS.

2. **Mimicking Nature Isn't Enough**: Bioprinting techniques that simply mimic natural structures without understanding why they're organized in that manner may produce organs that look right but don't function correctly. For instance, replicating the structure of a kidney's nephron is not enough; we need to understand the osmotic and filtration processes at a cellular level to make a functional kidney.

3. **Cellular Environment Matters**: Beyond just the cells themselves, the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment in which cells reside play a pivotal role in organ function. The pH, concentration of specific ions, growth factors, and other signals can influence cell behavior. Without recognizing and replicating these environments accurately, our bioprinted organs might never work as intended.

4. **Risk of Unintended Consequences**: If we proceed with organ printing without understanding cellular mechanics, we risk creating organs that behave unpredictably when transplanted. This could lead to adverse reactions, organ rejection, or unexpected organ behaviors, which might be detrimental to the recipient.

In conclusion, while bioprinting holds vast promise, a deep understanding of cellular mechanics is imperative to truly harness its potential in my view. Without this knowledge, our attempts may remain superficial, and we risk overlooking critical factors that determine organ functionality. With all this said, I'm sure my view is flawed.

1,2023-09-17,CMV: The fact that people on average have fewer friends than in the past isn't really something society needs to concern itself with.,u/Equivalent-Fix-7313,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16lbwny/cmv_the_fact_that_people_on_average_have_fewer/,changemyview,"It's a common statistic that gets posted here all the time, the fact that people are overall less social and have fewer friends. They'll even post statistics like ""10% of all America adults have no friends!"" (Not a real number I just made that up for an example) Like it's a sign of the apocalypse. It's not, it's just we have more stuff to do now.

Let me explain, picture a middle class American home 100 years ago, what is there to do alone by yourself? Not much besides read, drink some bootlegged whiskey, and stare at the celing. If you wanted to have fun, you pretty much had to go somewhere where you'd be around others and socialize. That's no longer true, we have TV, the internet, video games, so many ways to entertain ourselves by ourselves.

So of course people have fewer friends, they don't need them to have fun. It's not some mental health crisis, it's just that people who aren't as social don't need friends to not die of boredom. People can still make friends if they want, it's just more people don't want that choice anymore."

Hell, it even lets him wave his Lil Elon around without having to be a very good businessman (I don't know enough to say whether he is or isn't btw).

Also, all of his decisions with checkmarks, and bans, and renaming are flexes. People may complain, but they're not leaving. All the impotent hate probably amuses him and stokes his shitty ego.

And I can bet he will continue using his fortune to keep on subsidizing Twitter even if it's losing money. In the greater scheme of things, keeping it is probably good for his bottom line.

Even in their own logic of decoupling sex and gender it makes no sense. They want the gender to correspond to sex. If they way they are a woman they want you to treat them as a female. Then people use a term like biological female and they freak out. It all makes no sense.

In many cases, the language surrounding some topics is unnecessarily complex. For example, public service announcements that recommend annual screenings for ""anyone with a cervix"". There are quite a few native speakers who don't know what one of those is or if they have one... but imagine the confusion of a non-native speaker trying to figure out whether that very important medical information applies to them.

The irony, of course, is that ostensibly the motivation behind using this type of obscure medical language in important announcements is to be more inclusive. I understand why that is important... but I also think one of the purposes of medical announcements is to save people's lives. And this information should be available to everyone, not just native English speakers with an above-average understanding of human anatomy. 

In my opinion, an intense focus on linguistic conformity makes it more difficult for non-native English speakers to participate in English-language discussions about certain topics, or even to understand what is being said in the first place. Whether or not this is being done intentionally, the result is often that already marginalized groups are further disadvantaged. 

To change my view, you would have to show me that an intense focus on linguistic conformity does NOT disproportionately disadvantage non-native speakers. So you would have to either convince me that A) there is no disadvantage inherent to having difficulty participating in certain discussions, having difficulty using the English language in a politically correct way, or having difficulty understanding certain announcements... or B) that native and non-native speakers are equally likely to have difficulty with these things I have listed.

From what I've seen - and I'm sure that 100 people in this comment section can share 100 different tales of having been bullied or seeing bullies in action - no bully ever sees himself or herself as a bully.

Quite the opposite, **bullies think they're doing society a favor.** They think they're **improving** society in some sort of Darwinistic way by penalizing undesirable behavior or attributes of other people. They see themselves as **do-gooders.**

See someone who's obese? That's bad for society, better bully her into becoming thinner.

See someone who has a crooked nose? That's a blight on society; better bully him as punishment for making society have to see such an unsightly facial feature.

See someone who's 2 feet shorter than everyone else? Better punish him for standing out in such a way that makes other people feel weirded out by his short height.

See someone who lives in poverty while the bully himself/herself comes from a wealthy family? Why, that person must be poor because of laziness. Better mock him so that he'll work harder and become more productive in society.

See a girl with an ugly face? Better bully her; why does she make everyone else suffer by having to see such an unpleasant sight?

I think it's weird to consider one type of self injury healthy and the other not. 

I think the only real difference is what you're trying to accomplish. It's allowing someone to hurt you for sexual gratification vs hurting yourself to alleviate emotional/mental pain. For both the intent is pain though.

The reason self harm is seen as bad is because it's harming you, the harm is the issue. So by that logic the harm incurred during BDSM would also be an issue."

*I am assuming worst case climate projections for the sake of this scenario. Not super excited to respond to anything about how the upcoming climate crisis is man-made, natural, a big deal, the degree of why it’s *not a big deal,* or how it’s caused by Jewish space lasers. So I’ll at least acknowledge this as a disagreement or concern now and hope no one feels the need to bring it up. If you do… You win! I’ll pray for your fortune & favor a full fortnight.

There’s no thesis or anything here, but this is why I had the idea;

1: I got high.

2: People who live in cities produce far less greenhouse gases, require less in resources to care for (cost of infrastructure like roads, healthcare, etc.), and with a more concentrated population we can build kick ass public transit and better infrastructure.

3: We could preserve an amazing track of land that acts as a purifier, better ecological balance to humanity’s pollution and overall buffer. There would be small outposts & National Parks in Seattle, Los Angeles, Denver, Big Bend, Yellowstone, Duluth, Kansas City, and Galveston until it’s destroyed. You would allow agriculture in designated areas west of the Mississippi as well.

3B: We will probably have to abandon the South too, or at least anywhere super prone to hurricanes. Further complicating everything.

4: Logistically I realize this is difficult or almost impossible to accomplish. Moving millions of folks, many of who won’t want to move, losing access to important natural resources, the sheer cost of such an endeavor… But ultimately I think the effort would be worth it to counteract the upcoming climate crisis.

5: The American West and Southwest are going to become unsustainable to human life. At the very least it will require too many resources to be worth it. Wildfires, drought, water access, refrigeration & energy costs, and probably a few things I’m forgetting are going to contribute to this inevitable outcome.

When defeated, it only pulls it's head back into its shell until it feels safe enough to come out. Many conservatives in the U.S. today would never consider themselves fascist, but are clearly unwittingly enabling its return. We need to call Conservatism what it is. It's 'Fascism Lite’.

Unfortunately, ‘Fascism Lite’ is ripe for take-over. Easy to stoke into a frenzy. It’s been on a gradual march toward power for decades in America, always — always — on the Right. It knows how unpopular it is, so it plays the long game. It buys influence. It gerrymanders. It stacks courts with its own decision-makers. It closely examines the rules and plays them in ways unanticipated. It uses religion (A tool built to cement power. How do you question that which must not be questioned on threat of eternal damnation?). Its got a goal and its got time.

Clearly there’s a spectrum between Fascist and Liberal. I contend that Fascism, while pushed very far left during its defeat in WW2, only retreated to the level of what we call in American today “Conservatism.”"

1,2023-09-17,CMV: Housing will never be truly affordable so long as property ownership is seen as a tool for wealth generation.,u/Shortugae,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16lkaju/cmv_housing_will_never_be_truly_affordable_so/,changemyview,"An addition to the title would be, “and the wide spread reliance on the inflation of property (home) values for wealth generation is one of the worst mistakes that modern western society has ever made in terms of economic policy and growth.” Or something along those lines. 

Basically, I think it’s completely insane that for the vast majority of people living in capitalist, democratic nations, their only hope of amassing a reasonable amount of wealth, particularly for the sake of being able to retire in the future, is to buy a house and then sell it for more than what they payed for. I understand that most of modern banking and financial systems is essentially built off of mortgages and so in some respects it would be insane to NOT rely on property value as a tool for wealth generation, which is why I think that the entire system is completely insane and broken, while the individuals engaging with the system normally are not. 

There’s nothing wrong with wanting to own the house you live in. What I think is wrong is the expectation that this asset you are currently using should somehow appreciate in value. So long as this expectation exists for most people, housing will never, EVER be affordable, and to go further, housing has NEVER been affordable under this current system. This is why I believe this:

Because homeowners directly benefit from the increase of value in their home, they will always, no matter how noble their intentions usually, fight anything that they could possibly perceive as lowering their property values. This is NIMBYISM. It becomes an emotional response that you can’t even really blame them for having, because many home owners have essentially staked their entire financial well-being for the rest of their lives on them if not gaining money upon selling their home, at the very least not losing money. Because modern banking and financial systems  in western society heavily incentivize homeownership, a significant percentage of the population will always consist of homeowners, which means that there will always be a significant percentage of the population that shares the common goal of increasing property values who will vote with that in mind. I don’t think that particular point is really debatable, or at least, I feel like most of Reddit would agree with me on that. 

The part of my opinion that pertains to this particular discussion is that I believe that this means that housing will never become affordable because there is not only a profit motive for it to not be truly affordable, but that a large percentage of the population shares that motive. Sure, there is the valid point that inflated property values make it just as hard for current homeowners to sell one property and purchase another, but I don’t think that completely invalidates my point. 

I generally agree with the supply side argument for housing affordability, that by building more housing we can make it more affordable, with the caveat that all new market rate housing still exists within this very broken system. At least developers and housing producers are taking land that currently does not house people, and are making it so that it can house people. That is creating value that is worth something. Beyond that however, that new housing will be purchased, if not by investors who very explicitly want that property to appreciate in value, then by individuals who will still benefit from the appreciation and thus implicitly want it to happen. 


TLDR: I think it's insane that unlike basically any other commodity (not that I think housing should ever be thought of as a commodity) that is bought and sold, the buyers of property and housing do so with the implicit, or explicit expectation that they can sell that product at a later date for more than what they bought it for. Because this expectation is built into not only our collective mindsets, but the financial systems that underpin modern western society, housing will NEVER become truly affordable, because affordable housing is a contradiction of the very system that supports housing production and acquisition."

I work at a bank. I see bank clients. I look like from country A but in reality I speak the language of country B. I have many customers from country B on the town I live in.

I have no obligation to disclose the languages I speak to for every client I see. 

Often times members from country B will switch to their native language if they want to speak in private or if they want to say something about me without me knowing.

I argue 

1. I have no moral or legal obligation to disclose what languages I speak 
2. It's more impolite to speak about someone especially negatively right in front of them 
3. Even if they aren't speaking about me, it's impolite to switch to a different language when you are in a meeting with someone else. The people who do this obviously realize that it makes the person who cannot speak the language feel excluded but they don't care. This is not to say you shouldn't be able to say things in private when at the bank but the polite thing to do is to excuse yourself or say you need to discuss amongst yourselves and return another day

Of course if it's her body it's her choice, but as soon as you decide you want to bring the baby to term, that's no longer a valid statement. It becomes two bodies that you're fully responsible to care for. 

I'm not just talking about smoking or drinking. I think you have an moral obligation to do basic exercise and eat healthy, nutritional foods, if a human being is developing inside of you and relies on your actions.

Not to say can't occasionally eat a sugary snack when you're craving something. But if you're stuffing your face with fast food and candy all day, and not doing any physical activity, you're directly harming yourself and more importantly, your child. 

During pregnancy, a fetus is at its most vulnerable point of development. Every cell that makes up it's body is coming from what you injest. Living an unhealthy lifestyle while pregnant can result in a lifetime of problems for the child.

Every pregnant woman should feel morally obligated to put their child before their own desires, just as every parent should after they're born."
1,2023-09-17,CMV: Calculators are often overused and can have real negative consequences,u/StealHorse_DoA,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16lkwyt/cmv_calculators_are_often_overused_and_can_have/,changemyview,"Preface: I live in latin america so 1) english not mi native language 2) these problems might be less common where you live.

I've been TA in college for 4 years now (I enjoy more advanced math topics - abstract algebra, metric space theory, etc. - but I also sometimes teach entry level courses), but I've been a tutor for HS maths for much longer. I've grown to hate it a bit, but it pays the bills, and my pupils leave very happy so win-win. That said, I'm not a HS/middle school math teacher, so I'd be intrested in hearing your thoughts from you.  
  
One of the things that I find is a huge stepping block in mathematical development is the confortable manipulation of algebraic expresions. This is probably the single most important skill to develop in HS mathematics (fight me), as you will need it almost anywhere in higher mathematics, physics, economics, etc. Thankfully, in many ways working with algebraic expresions is analogous to working with numbers.  
  
Except you don't have a calculator for those. A good example is fraction addition, multiplication or division. One of my pupils (who is 17-18 mind you) got stumped because during an equation she got X/(1/2). Then I found out she did not know how to divide fractions. And this is not an isolated insident, I've seen countless students utterly terrified of fractions. Even if they have a feign memory of how to do it, they never do, because it's just easier to plug it into your calculator. But when you have to solve x/2 + 1/x = 3 that is not gonna do it for you. Other obvious examples is strugling to simplify obvious expressions like 1/2+1/2.  
  
Another good example is working with exponents. Rather than doing 2\^(-1/2) using properties, I've seen a lot of students who just plug it into their calculator. And sure, they get an aproximation, but once you have an algebraic expression, all that fails.  
  
With one of my students we were learning about logarithms, their parents got her one of those better calculators that can calculate the logarithm with any base. I thought that was a shame since it's so easy to use the change of base property, or 99% of the time just thinking for 2 seconds what the answer is (these problems are made to spit out nice numbers).  
  
Look, I'm not an ""algorithm"" guy at all. I love teaching in a more conceptual way and I find my students are a lot more engaged and end up understanding more (in fact in my experience the opposite is true, teachers don't explain enough and just make students do problems without much context). But some algorithms really are important, and you 100% do use them anytime you work in mathematics, such as fraction addition, working with exponents, etc. I don't mind if a hs student forgot how to do long division, as that is a very specific algorithm. This is much more serious.  
  
I also know full well that calculators are not all to blame for this lack of confidence in manipulating algebraic expressions, but it certainly doesn't help. This is why I don't mind certain tests or sections having ""no calulators allowed"". They need to be well made, like obviously we don't want students to waste time doing tedious calculations (and no, doing 1/2 + 6/11 doesn't count), but I still like it in principle. As far as I can tell, manipulation of algebraic expressions is one of the big roadblocks from jumping from highschool to college (at least where I live, which is not the US), much more than specifict topics like say trigonometric functions.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Calculators are not the devil, but they can act like a clutch and not reinforce certain skills that are 100% necessary. In my experience, these weaknesses have been real."

Mainly because having a puppy is hard and I often question why I did this, yet continue to stick it out 😂… also, any dog owners sit and think about how they have a whole domesticated wolf running around their house? Haha… 

Here are a few of my internal questions lol 

1) Aside from having a working dog that actually fulfills specific duties, there really is no point in having a pet. I think people who have (non-therapeutic) pets just like having something they can control (me being one of them lol), though it seems like more of a subconscious thing. Because the minute your dog somehow turns on you, you’ll get rid of it right?

2) Also, if dogs really liked us we wouldn’t have to give them so many treats as pups right? They’d just do what we said — or is it a form of communication because humans and animals obviously can’t communicate? 🤔

3) Though having a puppy is stressful and annoying, I do really like my puppy and can’t imagine rehoming her. However, she does not replace human companionship for me and I don’t understand how a dog can be someone’s “bestfriend”. I think dogs accept us pack leaders and respect the bald, two-legged things that provide them food. But I’m just not convinced they love us. As far as us loving them… I think it’s possible for us to really love them. I just think they come to accept us out of habit and as a result of Stockholm Syndrome.

This is my first time on this sub so promise I’m not trolling lol. Pleas be kind 😂…I just genuinely would love outside perspectives"

1,2023-09-18,CMV: Your class and character are far more important to consider than race or sex,u/supremekimilsung,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ln60e/cmv_your_class_and_character_are_far_more/,changemyview,"I am speaking in terms of law, policies, and discussions today in the US that seem to favor someone's race or sex far more than they do for anything else. Not a single person alive now or in the past had a choice in their genetics that lead to their race and sex. However, every single conscious person does have control over so much else, like their character.

I do like to thoroughly consider the counterargument on this topic, as it is always important to question and consider my own side on anything. Careful consideration of the other side and genuine understanding, not necessarily agreement, is what we are painfully missing in today's discussions. As such, I understand the argument that for many, many years, women and people of color (POC) have been, when considering both law and culture of the country, proportionally mistreated and misrepresented in the United States. Socially (not so much legally as it is now unconstitutional to discriminate on race or sex), this continues to happen. It would seem evident that a heavy preference to these people in terms of benefit would be the solution.

However, when carefully considering both sides, this is not the solution. At least at this point in time. Let's take Jim Crow legislation and the allowances given in order to oppress POC into consideration. When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, along with numerous other legislations, amendments, and policies that followed afterward, we had virtually moved to a truly equal state (in terms of law. But judging the effectiveness and timeliness of its enforcement is a different topic of discussion).

Now, on the other hand, we are enforcing policies and allowing private companies to discriminate on race and sex, yet again. This time, though, it's on the opposite spectrum. Preference, that is blatantly written into these considerations, is typically given to women and POC. Again, I will acknowledge that they were mistreated in the past, legally and socially. However, it is fundamentally written into the Constitution that discrimination against race or sex is strictly prohibited. This was followed with amendments that added federal task forces to supervise over such legislation. When it is written into law that mistreatment can no longer happen, equality will eventually be restored socially. It just takes time. Doing the opposite only causes more issues and distractions from the true cuase of problems.

Contrary to choosing someone based off of their race or sex when considering school admissions (though Affirmative Action was recently overturned), employment, scholarships, etc., should be choosing someone based off of their philosophies, ideas, dedication through experience, and character. We all have control over that, so it would be fair to judge someone based off of who they are, not what they look like. Additionally, give more opportunities to anyone who is poor or ill, not only race or sex specific peoples. That would be true equal opportunity. 

Identity politics is not the solution to the issues of the vast majority of the world. Class is, and it always has been. We must instead enforce legislation on the wealthy to pay their fair share (i.e. a progressive tax) and to instead establish high quality facilities, programs, agents, etc. to propel the lower and middle classes forward. We cannot all unite based off of what we look like. But we can unite as humans to live in a fair and just world.



TL;DR As it is written in the Constitution that no institution may discriminate based off of race or sex, we must move forward from these considerations and fight for equal opportunity for the poor instead. Someone's character is something they have complete control over, not as much as they do their class, and certainly not with their race or sex. Allow these two to be deciding factors in considerations for institutions or other benefits."

These opinions are my own. However I keep in touch with my relatives on the mainland and visit back yearly

Why CMV: The Chinese foreign ministry's favourite way to draw moral equivalence when questioning on morally ambiguous matters is to say that the Americans have no right to talk to the Chinese from their high horses. No doubt this isn't done in good faith, but it is incorrect to dismiss it at bat. China and Russia do not care to disguise their dirty business, and are easy to demonise as such. The US wraps it under the guise of high-minded ideals, but in practice is far more cruel and more destructive.

All states by mistake or as a means to an end conduct atrocities. I'm not trying to justify the cultural genocide of the Uyghers, or the oppression of historical events and present opposition in China, nor the human cost of the war in Ukraine. But the West has formed a narrative that isolates these events from larger historical contexts to cast them as irrational acts of evil. In fact, in this aspect, the US has inflicted a far greater human cost than both Russia and China combined. Let us just take this century:

The highest estimates of the Uygher internment camps is around 2 million. Most of these people will not experience torture, hard labour or anything like that, but just passive, long-term indoctination. The reason for it is logical; the internment camp is a national unity policy seeking to assimilate minorities. While its aims are detestable, the human cost of this should not be overstated. The upper bound of the casualties of the Russo-Ukraine war is 200,000 dead (these are **excess deaths, which I will be using from here on out**). That is a huge number, but it is peanuts compared to the effects of US actions in the Middle East (not to mention the US' deliberate prolongation through discouraging peace talks in the ongoing conflict as a goal of foreign policy - to bleed Russia dry).

In Afghanistan alone, the US has matched the excess death numbers of the Russo-Ukraine war - 200,000 dead. In Iraq, it caused 1 million deaths. In Libya, the prolonged effects of NATO intervention is estimated as a third of a million deaths. A conservative estimate of 1.5 million dead in 23 years alone. This number does not account for those in these 3 countries and their neighbouring regions who will continue to face repercussions for continued instability intervention has caused and will cause. It does not account for those whose lives and deaths were not recorded due to the underdeveloped census systems of these states. it does not account for those who face ISIL attacks in the Sahel and in Central Africa, whose collapse into lawlessness began with a ECOWAS and AU severely weakened by the effects of destabilisation caused by US intervention. It does not account for the suffering of the millions of refugees that have fled their homelands, nor the suffering of already marginalised communities in Europe that will incur the effect of an action they had no control over. 

Not only in the direct amount of lives lost, but the effect on *way of life, culture, quality of life, community, stability* far outshadow the actions of China in Xinjiang, the actions of Russia in Ukraine. It is incomparable.

The US has managed to construct a facade that these actions were justified as they were against totalitarian regimes, and brought democracy and progress. Hard to justify to a grieving mother how 'progress' has necessitated the death of her child; harder still to justify to a grieving nation how 'democracy' has necessitated the destruction of cities, decades of instability and a generation who endured a childhood of terror, who will never for their lives grasp the concept of peace. But even if we take that at face value, it is disingenuous at best.

In the 90s when the USSR collapsed and an activist international community sought greater action to bring progress and peace to embattled regions, it was the US that stood against them. It was the US who pulled troops out of UNOSOM and led to \~200,000 excess deaths. It was the US who forced withdrawal from Rwanda and enabled the Genocide to occur. It was the US who strongarmed BBG into increasing NATO's influence in the UN at the cost of an effective response to Srebrenica during UNPROFOR. It was the US who refused to pay its dues and caused UN peacekeeping operations to teeter on the edge of bankruptcy.

The US has perpetually threatened the peace, peaceful people's way of life and their sense of security. Through controlling the agenda in the West it has somehow, unbelievably, convinced people it is the better of two evils, because no Somali, no Pashto, no Libyan, no Iraqi can be there to challenge them - but the blood of women and children flow liberally to stain its flag bright red."

This CMV comes from the fact that I simply do not understand the moral case for having income streams such as capital gains or dividends taxed at a lower rate than labour income.

I remember having a discussion years ago about this, and my interlocutor made the case that investments should be taxed at a lower rate because they involved (capital) risk, whereas labour doesn't. I agree with that fact but disagree with the conclusion, since labour has involved sacrificing your time I don't see it as somehow ""fair"" that labour should be taxed at a higher rate.

What this two-tier system has created is a financial system that allows the wealthy to pay a much lower percentage of their total income in tax because it's a ""different type"" of income. I'm tired of reading about how multi-millionaires pay some tiny proportion of their income in tax because they're able to somehow move their money over to a different income stream when people that live in London and are struggling to break into the middle class are well into the 40% tax bracket. If we bring this back to Marx's class system, the upper classes and bourgeoisie are explicitly given preferential treatment over the working class.

The set up I think we should have is that there's a tax free allowance for each of the income streams (labour, investments, savings interest) but anything that goes over these allowances is considered taxable income and goes into the same pot to be taxed at the same rate."

Or let's say that someone has a truly horrible belief, for example, genuine hatred for a specific out-group... but never communicates this belief to anyone in any way, and in fact dedicates themselves to helping other people in any way they can. Does their hatred make them a bad person? In my opinion, it does not.  
It's tempting to go along with the idea that our beliefs are what make us good or bad, because it's easy enough to believe the right thing but difficult to actually do the right thing.

1,2023-09-18,CMV: The second half of the Death Note manga is just as good as the first if not better.,u/Heyguysloveyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16lu58e/cmv_the_second_half_of_the_death_note_manga_is/,changemyview,"I've talked for years about this show/manga so I thought it might be interesting to get out of my echo champer and talk to some new faces.

So I specifically talk about the manga here because the anime heavily butchered lots of scenes and characters from the manga after L's death and the ending got destroyed. The only thing the anime did really well is the voice acting and animation but it lost everything else. This is not to say that I think the anime is bad after Ls death but I can see people thinking their is a drop in quality.

But this problem does not exist in the manga.

So. Before we can break down what makes the second half great, lets go quickly over what makes the first great.

I would argue the thing that people like most about the first half of Death Note are the cat and mouse chases, the mindgames and the overall relationship between Light and L. Everyone knows the first scene L interacted with Light or when L stole Misas phone and saw that Light called her only seconds after leaving. And the connection between the two is pretty fun to see as well. Essentially we are watching two grown up, hyper intelligent man-children having a fight over which toys can stay in the sand-box only that the sand-box is the lifes of millions of people. The interesting thing about their relationship is how similar they are, both dont really care about justice in what they're doing; Light is blinded by the notebook and L said himself that he doesnt care about justice at all and just does it for fun. Its purely a battle of pride for them with L hating to be wrong and needing to be the smartest in the room. They hate each other but there is still a respect for the others intelligence and for understanding the desire to be the best and not be bored. These two very mentally ill and lonely people who normally just love themselfs finding actual respect and a form of friendship in each other that they cant accept because of their pride and trying to get to each other with clever tricks is whats interesting about the first half.

Now I've heard the complains about the second half a 100 times over.

Firstly I suppose we have to get rid of the elephant. Near. I heard a billion times that Near is just an L copy or boring or whatever else. But especailly in the manga these things cant be further from the truth. L and Near have little to nothing in common outside of being both mostly socially awkwart geniuses. Near does not care about being right or wrong, he openly admits to being wrong sometimes. In one of the first scenes we have with him we can see him making several theories while throwing darts at a board, missing all of them but keeping calm while doing so. This is in contrast to L who NEEDED Light to be Kira for his ego. Near will keep throwing darts at the board, no matter how often he fails until he hits his bullseye. Near has no ego in general, he is fully willing to work with Mello from the start and doesnt take most of the credit when Light is finally defeated. Near is also in it for actual morality and justice. In chapter 109 we can see Near struggle with being L and only taking cases that interest him. The whole chapter is about Near having trouble to work like L and at the end he actively goes against what L would do because he views it as right. Near also has great respect for his team to a point where he makes himself look cowardly to make them feel better for not going along with his plan. The interesting thing about Near is that he is a good person trying to fill the role of a self-loving monster. Near also has zero respect for Light, he can respect what was trying to do, but he truely thinks he is scum and treats him as such, being sassy and playful and giving comebacks which is very much unlike L who is (in his own way) always serious. Near is the answer to Light and L, being a literal child that is more adult than Light and L, the best detective on the planet and the ""god of the new world."" And in the end, Near becomes L with Mello TOGETHER. L always talked about being replaced or chosing between Near and Mello, so much so that he actively held info back from them in order to give them a ""fair fight"" against Kira instead of stopping him earlier. Near breaks that cycle of pride with Mello whos last action is actively helping Near. But to ad to Nears character we have Matsudas theory which throws into question everything we know about Near, which mirrors how real figures throughout history probably did morally bad things that we will never know of because they won the war so they can just get rid of these things in history. I think Near is a very fun and interesting character.

The other thing I often hear I Light getting stupid. But looking at the story this is just wrong. Not only would he have won if his follower didnt ""mess up"" (I highly believe the mistake wasnt with Mikami, at least not fully) but he always pretty much knew what was going on. Take for example the scene where Aizawa talks to Near behind Lights back. In a cut scene from the manga, Light actually figures this out easily, even knowing what they talked about. What does he do? He just thinks ""Heh, who cares, they'll be dead soon anyways."" Light is often fully aware of the things that happen around him, he just grew so arrogant after L's death that he doesnt view it as nesscary to actually do anything. He gave the notebook to a stranger for liking him for Christs sake. And in the end he dies a pathetic, loud death, begging to an actual god of death because a follower of his misinterpreted his message. Its quite ironic. 

There are also still plently of mindgames, especailly in the first few chapters where we have a 1v1v1. We have scenes where one of them will play the other two out against each other to gain an adventage or where all the parties think about each others possible moves in order to predict what they might do. If there is any criticism that I could make against the second half is that we didnt get MORE of this, as the second half of.. the second half (lol) goes more into a 1v1, but the scenes of Near and Mello trying to get information out of Mogi while Light listens or the whole mafia and president arc are PEAK Death Note.

These were only a few times but I dont want to keep the post too long.

TLTR: The second half of Death Note (in the manga) is a masterpiece and nearly perfect and doesnt fall short of anything."

Eventually, in order to regain Congressional representation, the southern states were forced to ratify the Reconstruction amendments. The 14th Amendment in particular hurt them. 

While using military force to override the southern states was the right move, and historically has been the only manner southern states complied with emancipation, desegregation,  etc. 

Instead they should have remained US territories, which meant the southern people were not US citizens, had no voting rights, but still paid taxes and were beheld to our laws.

As the *Allen v. Milligan* case has shown, it is only when the federal government asserts itself over the southern states that civil rights are enforced.

Forgiving someone for hurting you doesn't mean you forget what they've done or how they hurt you. It doesn't mean allowing them back into your life. It also doesn't mean you're allowing them the opportunity to hurt you again. It doesn't even mean respecting them as a person. 

You should forgive them because it is healthy for you moving forward. 

While I admit, we are human and forgiving someone right off the rip when they have just hurt us is quite the hard task. But with the appropriate amount of time, you should forgive them. You should let go of the grudge you carry toward them. 

For clarification, I am not saying that if you forgive someone that you don't want to see them held accountable. You can forgive someone for what they've done to you and still wish to see them face the consequences of their actions and justice. 

I recently had some great discussions regarding this topic, yet none have been able to change my stance. I am just curious if my view can change on this. I know some folks are anti-forgiveness but I am confused why anyone would choose to live that life and not seek a healthy lifestyle?

There's a lot wrong with schooling and a lot of it follows this same theme of asking everyone to think the same way but this is not a good example. The method is the point of maths. Usually what people mean by different method is actually the same method but done in their heads, without really knowing that its the same method - there's definitely an argument here that teachers should be explaining this more. But you need to learn the working out explicitly, you won't be able to do it intuitively when it involves much bigger numbers, algebra, complex numbers etc. Letting kids think they have their own special method that requires no working out is setting them up to fail later on, you learn the correct methods with simpler numbers so you won't be struggling with more complicated equations. Indeed once you get into more advanced maths there will be different methods for the same thing and you will need to learn all of them and what situations you can apply them. 

I did on several occasions have this exact argument at school, and was asked to do the method properly. If you don't like learning new methods to solve mathematical problems it seems to me that you actually don't like maths, rather than you did like it but the system pushed you out. Its not uncommon to like something at lower primary school age and then like it less as it changes into something more complex. I dont think its some kind of fault on the education system if people stop liking maths when they go beyond mental calculations, and I certainly dont think that teachers should be teaching that any method is fine provided you get the right results."
1,2023-09-18,CMV:Parents' views on failure (and not intelligence) are important in cultivating a growth mindset in a child,u/free-skyblue-bird1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16lwlq3/cmvparents_views_on_failure_and_not_intelligence/,changemyview,"I think parents who see failure as debilitating, focus on children’s performance and ability rather than on their learning and due to this children, in turn may get this strong aversion to failure, thinking that ability (or intelligence) is kind of fixed and not malleable. When the parent says “Child,what we really care about is just that you do your best.  But we know how smart you are, so if you were really doing your best, you would have gotten an A+,"" the message child gets is coming on top is the only thing that matters.  They end up avoiding any endeavor, which will get them anything less than an A on any report card. And then, in hindsight,  one regrets in adulthood not having tried any other pursuits other than the one in which they excel. Down the lane, when they are not sure of their ability to do a particular thing, they will just give up, thinking that they can’t do it, even without giving a single try.    
This post is actually a result of my reading this quote from a mystic – The beauty of having a child is to cultivate, nourish, support, and see what they will become.  Don't try to fix them then you are only trying to fix the outcome."

Here are a few of the facts that stand out to me:

Not a single piece of evidence was presented by the prosecution that connects Daniel to the crimes. Not a single witness either. At every point during the investigation, Daniel’s claims were supported by forensic evidence which was ignored by the detectives due to their certainty of his guilt. 2 key accusers recently admitted that they lied under oath and Daniel did not actually assault them. He got 62 years in prison specifically from the charges of a woman who initially described him as a “short, black male”. The majority of his accusers were not presented with a police line up, and multiple of those who were misidentified Daniel. The prosecution’s “smoking gun” was the false claim that the DNA found on his pants came from the walls of the victims vagina. This is directly refuted by the prosecution’s own expert witness testimony: It was trace DNA from anywhere on the body that can easily be explained as occuring from a secondary transfer from when Daniel either patted her down or searched her purse (and then touched his pants). I know it’s hard to believe, and I know it sounds extremely far-fetched, but the more research you do the more you will see that he is innocent of all charges."

They would have risked their lives to help ordinary people escape a murderous totalitarian government. 

And some people did. Oskar Schindler is an example of that. They made a movie about him because he was an outlier. What he did was very unusual, and that's why it was so interesting. He was in the right place at the right time to help a lot of people. Many ordinary people resisted in small ways, or even in incredibly courageous ways.

But as far as I know, the majority of people either complied, looked the other way and let it happen, or were themselves active agents in the atrocities of that regime. Remember also the extent of the government propaganda at that time. I find it unlikely that most regular people were *fully* aware of what was going on and/or why it was so indefensible. 

This isn't to say that none of you would have stood up to the government. If you have ever said ""no"" to a policeman who was pointing a gun at you, or if you have ever knowingly committed a capital crime in order to save someone's life, you may well have had the courage to be a resister. But if you have never been in that kind of situation, how can you know what you would have done? We don't live under that kind of political system, and I don't think we can really imagine how afraid people were.

None of this excuses what people did. Choosing to harm someone in order to save your own life is still a choice. My opinion is that we cannot truly know what choice we would have made under those circumstances unless we have experienced a very similar situation in our own lives. It's hard to look that truth in the eye, isn't it?

To change my view, you would have to convince me that under a genuinely totalitarian government comparable to the Third Reich, in which resistance is punishable by summary execution, generally more than half of the citizens are resisters. Not only in the beginning; it is easy enough to resist before a regime seizes extreme power. I am talking about resisting even after the government has begun openly killing dissenters.

I'd love to be wrong about this.

And I want to distinguish this from cases where the victims come forward on their own, because I think the logic is different in that case.

My reasoning is that if you have some celebrity who we already know has had 500+ partners over their lifetime, and given that some very small percentage of relationships end with terrible-but-private accusations even when nothing serious actually happened, you gain absolutely no information when someone goes looking for these accusations and publishes them.

And to be clear, I don't mean that ""Russel Brand is innocent"" or ""These women are lying"" or any such thing. That would be information, and I'm claiming one gains very close to *no* information at all.  Nor do I mean the age-gap thing with one of the women in this case, which is very specific to the Brand situation & people can separately have opinions about (I think it's very gross).

Maybe by analogy, if you tested all of Russel Brand's past partners for COVID-19 using a rapid antigen test, and you know that the test has a non-zero false-positive rate, and then report the five clearest positive test results, you haven't learned much of anything about the number of Brand's past partners who have COVID.  Doesn't this also apply to asking his past partners about deplorable behaviour?  If not, why not?"

For the purposes of this post it refers to the modern way it’s commonly used, i.e. far-left “anti-imperialists” who tend to hate the nebulous West. 

I’m talking about the Grayzone/Multipolarista types, the Max Blumenthals, Ben Nortons, and their ilk. To them, the concept of democracy is secondary to the demise of Western power. 

They present themselves as anti-imperialists because they ostensibly support the liberation of smaller “global south” nations under the grip of global hegemony. Now, I’m all for anti-imperialism in principle, every country should have the maximum amount of self determination possible to shepherd their people into as prosperous a future as possible without some big power boot on their neck. 100%. 

The problem I have with tankies in this context is that anti-imperialism should be pro-democracy. But that is not what’s emanating from these circles. 

In practice, what it looks like is simply being anti-West. If the US, Europe, or their allies are in *any* way even tangentially involved in some geopolitical conflict or dispute, it doesn’t matter what the conflict is, or where it is, or what the motivations are, or who is involved, or what they are doing, the other side is *always right* to these people. 

They seem to giddily support all manner of autocratic brutality as long as it is done in the service of damaging the West’s influence in the world. Everything is a zero-sum game, and the West must never win it no matter what the cost. 

They deny atrocities and push any manner of conspiracy theories (White helmets being false flag terrorists. China not committing atrocities against Uyghurs, no chemical weapons use in Syria, etc.) that would put their favorite dictators in a bad light and, by extension, advance the Western position. 

Look at Syria, Russia, China, Venezuela, Cuba, etc. There is seldom even the slightest, most tepid condemnation for the crimes that these governments impose on their own people and others, because they are “fighting” or “resisting” western influence, and by virtue of that, they can do no wrong in the context of this great power struggle. 

I have yet to see any evidence that they would be willing to forcefully condemn “non-west” dictators for anything they do, as long as the US/Europe oppose them, or any evidence that they would support a democratic cause if it would somehow benefit the west at the expense of great power rivals, but I'm open to hearing opposing views."

Still, GPT and Stable Diffusion, specifically, have the power to help students come up with ideas, get past writing blocks, develop code snippets, etc; but these things have always been present in some way or form in the Internet, and even if it is now marginally easier for a student to get inspiration in their work, the time saved, effectively, is little to none. On the same line of thinking, cheating and similar issues, even if made marginally easier by AI, has always been easily possible through the use of the Internet, and the introduction of AI only serves to make these issues more apparent.

It is possible that in the future AI will impact education? I do not claim otherwise. But right now, its impacts are all hype.

Because if they ban AR-15’s, they could just get a pistol and buy a bunch of 10 round spare magazines to reload with and shoot up a school with that.

The gun control lobby needs to focus on the following proposals

-Require a license for anyone who wants to open or conceal carry a firearm in public

-Improve our background check system

-Require background checks for all private gun sales or transfers

-Require anyone producing lower receivers for guns to have an FFL so a joe shmoe can’t 3D print a Glock lower in his basement

1. He's in good movies
2. He's nice and a good person

These reasons still don't mean he's a good actor. He lacks emotion in literally every one of his films. He just cannot act at all. He just has good connections to put him in good movies.

Now this doesn't take away from the fact that Dwyane Johnson acts like the same dude in every film. But at least he can convey some emotion when he acts. At least he can actually annunciate his words. And Dwayne does have very few films where he's not like the stereotypical Dwayne Johnson character (The Game Plan, Moana, Pain and Gain). He can actually be sometimes charming, unlike Bautista in movies.

Overall, I do believe that John Cena is actually the best actor coming out of the WWE (Peacemaker seals the deal for me).

In conclusion, I'd say, in terms of pure acting skills, it's John Cena > Dwayne Johnson > Dave Bautista."

Plus, numerous psychological studies confirm that everyone is biased, your instincts are sometimes expressed through the lens of your bias, and first-impression bias can be very dangerous.   


Now I do not want to confused this with knowing someone is about to do a dangerous thing (I am thinking from the lens of a woman thinking someone might attack her). Usually, when that happens, there are physiological changes that alert you to someone being dangerous. However, as we've learned more and more in the media, humans are terrible at knowing when someone is about to attack or not, too. It's kind of a wash what you interpret as dangerous.   


This got me thinking about people from every background who I have heard say they are ""expert"" people readers. They know ""good"" people from ""bad"" people instantly. They can tap into that ""vibe"".  Perhaps this is my bias, but I inherently do not trust people who say that. I think those types of people tend to think they are ""special"" and given ""divine gifts"" to be able to be less biased and more enlightened than the rest of humanity. I think they are often right some of the time about certain people they categorize and they cherry pick the times they were right to weigh more than the times they were wrong. Plus, the more I dig into cases of fraud, the more I realized how unexpected the truth often is and how hidden it can be. 

&#x200B;

It takes time to know who people are and people change over time. So it's very difficult.   


Also, I think a lot of people misjudge people. That same ""unfriendly"" vibe that makes people think a certain person is ""uncaring"" or ""bad"" are often the same vibes that a person with severe trauma and abuse will give off (antisocial, a little wary, anxious and afraid of every person they first meet). I have a friend like that too and one time a guy asked why she was such a bitch and so cold at first. He straight up asked me if she was a cold sociopath. I was like, ""The fuck?""

I came from a place where people kind of all knew each other, so there was none of this summing people up from the bat fuckery. However, the more I engage it here, the more I think less of these people. I have seen them do so much more damage than good and I think they have a god-like sense of determining who is or is not worthy.   


I know we all have suspicions and when those are going off, yes please look into them. But you need evidence first to truly label someone.   


Convince me otherwise.

1,2023-09-18,CMV: One Piece (anime) would be better if it had seasons instead of an episode every week.,u/Square-Dragonfruit76,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ma1oe/cmv_one_piece_anime_would_be_better_if_it_had/,changemyview,"The action needs to be more streamlined. Too much of each episode is taken up with flashbacks and information that takes away from the action and adds liittle to the exposition as well. Why not give some of the extra air time and money to other good shows? Even financially, it doesn't  make sense for the network to drag it out like this, instead of having multiple good shows using the time that it would have taken to air One Piece episodes. I feel like fans have been hit by a slow-slow beam.

To change my view:

1,2023-09-18,CMV: Cant stop thinking smoking while pregnant ruined my life,u/Whitetrashromance,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ma3hs/cmv_cant_stop_thinking_smoking_while_pregnant/,changemyview,"This is an extremely hard subject for anyone who might have to consider it maybe being the cause of major problems in their personal life. It sounds like such a cop out to blame your own mother for your own issues that people turn off to the idea immediately. Before you listen to my rant I beg you to look up the video on YouTube ""This is what smoking does to an unborn baby"" by On Demand News. A quick watch of the video will have you disgusted and the comments after a while will support the video claims. 

My mother smoked very very HEAVILY while pregnant with me back in the day before all this information was accessible as it is now. I would never hold it against her for possibly doing something to me she wasn't completely aware of. You can't be mad at someone for not being educated on something they were never faced with. The way I was raised and brought up most kids would have adapted and picked up on the lessons worth learning and ended up somewhat normal. In that video you can see the child in the womb reaching for their face trying to protect themselves from the toxic chemicals irritating them like torture. 

Fast forward a few years in pre-school I was out of control. Insane amount of rage for a young kid. In preschool I would go crazy and jump up and down on desks not letting the teacher talk until my grandparents had to come pick me up and more antics I either don't remember or refuse to access in my mind. My father tried everything he could to help me. I was raised in a strict catholic school after all that mess and stress I put on my family. He busted his ass for me to attend this school with tuition and everything. I can recall times sitting there being so uncomfortable. So irritated and mad, sad and every other dark emotion you could feel. Kind of similar in the aspect of a smoker withdrawing if you think about it**.** ***It's like this garbage was instilled in me*****.** I was constantly craving those chemicals I once was developed with almost as sick as it sounds. Every test in school came back an F no matter how hard I tried. Endlessly getting reprimanded and screamed at. 

Around this time I started biting nails heavily. I still do now and bite all the skin around my nails until it all bleeds. The anxiety and discomfort I feel is never ending. When I saw that video of the fetuses putting up its hands to protect its face it brought me to tears. Pretty much the same reaction on a larger scale in some weird way.  


It gets ironic pretty quickly for me later in life. In my teenage years I adapted the morals of Straight Edge for anyone familiar with that culture and music scene. It brought me purpose and strength and I'm sure if I would have kept up with those ideals I could have turned out at least a little decent. An entire different story all it's own is I somehow got put on Adderall 3 times a day by an insane doctor now in prison for pill milling in general. I blame myself for this situation but I was unaware at the time Adderall is basically the same chemical structure as meth. I was delusional, too trusting and gullible.  


Eventually the use of this large amount of stimulants drove me insane. I was so fed up and embarrassingly enough never thought to blame the stimulant I was taking for the reason for my new level of anxiety and irritation. I was just used to pain. I was so used to it I just keep going into madness. I decided to go against my proud moral code and try drinking to help me sleep at night from a hell I created myself. Critical mistake. I was in love. Quit adderall which I honestly didn't even like as much as I know no one will believe that. I was delusional and manic and told myself just keep taking it to focus on creating businesses that would never work. The promise of the focus I was denied getting bad grades in school all those years were fixed at least in that area. Even if it was pointless focus on things that are not even close to helping me in anyway like obsessing over typefaces for my ""website"" for 7 hours straight. 

Booze quickly patched up the anxiety and discomfort and pain I felt my entire life. I stopped taking adderall and only cared about drinking. I was worse than a heroin addict with it. Drinking endless malt liquors and $2 half pint vodkas. Just straight poison. Multiple alcohol withdrawal seizures and days spent laying in bed drinking water just to throw it up about 100 times a day until it was night time and I felt decent enough to drink again. Years after torturing myself and my family I basically have dementia I would say is the best way to explain it and have completely ripped apart my stomach lining. 

Sorry for my ramblings of inchohrency and jumping around because I doubt this will even get posted. Everytime I try to post on these serious topic subs I mess something up. Just another F. What i'm trying to say basically is we are animals and it seems we think we deserve more because we can open our mouths and speak. All this shit we think we can do with most ""chemicals"" in general is now sickening to me. You can not mess with your brain and development with drugs and shit and expect to be okay like I admit I fell for trap. Not sure what I'm looking for here maybe someone to agree with me or tell me to man up. It seems every day just gets darker in every direction.

People in Latin America can legitimately claim to be fleeing from poverty and violence. Same goes for Africa and much of Asia. In many countries, like China for example, people can reasonably say they are fleeing oppressive governments. 

Sop, how the heck do you differentiate between refugees and other migrants? Pretty much all migrating people can reasonably claim to be refugees. The only people who can't claim refugee status are people from affluent countries. But, most people don't mind immigrants from those countries. 

So, the immigration debate doesn't make sense to me on a fundamental level. You can't say you welcome refugees without basically advocating for open borders."
1,2023-09-18,CMV: It would make more sense to tax income at the point of depositing rather than paycheck withholding,u/SeanFromQueens,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16md94i/cmv_it_would_make_more_sense_to_tax_income_at_the/,changemyview,"I believe that taxation should be graduated and indiscriminate as to the source of income, if each individual's first ~$20,000 money deposited be taxed 1%-2% and $20k-$50k be taxed at 7-10% and as income/deposits increase the tax rate goes up for each truncheon of income/deposits. For contributions to retirement accounts or HSAs or other accounts that are intentionally limited and/or not available for immediate spending would not be counted for tax liability purposes. I would also allow for housing costs (both rent and mortgage) that would be direct from a employer to the employee's mortgage company or landlord and would be taxed whenever the landlord or mortgage company withdrew to individuals (property being held in a LLC being withdrawn to the landlord or mortgage company paying shareholders dividends or compensation to their own employees, etc). Taxation being determined at the point of deposit is less inescapable than current income tax regime that can be [avoided by renting out assets or borrowing against their assets](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-billionaires-avoid-paying-federal-income-tax-2021-6?op=1) and have the vast majority of their income go untaxed. 

Furthermore, any money from savings (interests) would be untaxed, encouraging individual savings similar to the current encouragement of inflating security and commodity prices by pushing every spare penny to buy stocks. Banks already require reporting of their deposits and has as identified as possible their account holders, so the need for IRS becomes largely moot, as well as tax preparers, tax season would be similar to most other nations that you'd be told what you've paid already and you'd be free to contest it but most would just accept it without paying for any services/software. 
  
I believe that this tax regime would have multiple benefits, with acknowledged drawbacks of eliminating charitable giving having tax benefits (though charitable organizations would still have zero tax liability) and the current tax benefits on investment income over wages would be considered a drawback but I would considered it the killer feature, leveling the playing field of the employed class and the investor class. Corporate taxes could be zero-ed out since government revenue would come from whenever the money is distrubuted out to the investors, and would encourage reinvestment over distributions. 
  
So, I'm not galaxy brained enough to think there's not any shortcomings, but would like to know where my blindspots are. So change my view that taxation at the point of deposits is better than the current tax regime in the US."

There seems to be 3 main things people say could be terrible and ruin the world so let me explain why thats unlikely.
1. Climate Change: I am not a climate change skeptic, far from it but climate change is not as bad as some are claiming. If current trends continue, we will stop healing the planet after heating it 3 degrees. Thats terrible and far from acceptable but definetely not civilisation-ending.
2. Artificial Intelligence: A truly advanced AI with an intelligence far surpassing humans would have no reason to go against them for the same reason no country has ever gone to war with ants, they are so long down on the intelligence latter in comparrisonn that its useless to go against them.
3. Nuclear War: Nuclear War is a terrifying thought. Yet War is undeniably dying and no War in Ukraine can change that. Since world War 2 wars have been on the decline. Democratisation, globalisation and overall the declining popularity of wars has all caused this.

The main divergence seems to be in language—nuances often get lost when expressed in a second language. Universal gestures like shrugging one's shoulders or winking indicate that humans, irrespective of cultural backgrounds, convey feelings similarly. 

To illustrate, if you were to survey opinions in Saudi Arabia about LGBTQ+ issues, you'd encounter a spectrum of views. While some might advocate for extreme measures, the majority might express disapproval but deem such extreme measures too harsh. The same would also apply to other contentious issues like welfare."

It's for this reason that I believe the right wing belief that one simply needs to live on a shoestring budget and maximize their income and savings is also extremely important and applicable to most situations of poverty. They both are valid, both must be pursued, and arguing that one or the other is the only valid option is futile.

There is not really a point in helping them to get back on track if they will never leave their prison ever again. I feel like they are just waiting to die, which is equally cruel after many many years. I guess most of these people are mentally ill and hate that they are in that state. 
Giving them the option to die with medical supervision like it is common in Switzerland for the elderly and seriously sick people (see Sterbehilfe) is an option to end their misery while protecting society. 

Obviously this is a highly controversial topic which needs extremely well supervision so its not an easy way for suicide when your feeling down for a bit.

I don't remember exactly when/how my fear began but for as far as I can remember I have held this view. In high school, I started having nightmares about being pregnant. They would always feel so real that when I'd wake up, I would grab my stomach to make sure there wasn't a bump there and to make sure it was just a dream. The nightmares never stopped; I probably have one every 3-6 months.  
  
However, I've always imagined my future family with kids. I've always wanted kids. I just have never seen myself giving birth to them. I'll have dreams that I have little kids and they are always so nice. So, I know it's not a parenthood fear, but specifically a pregnancy fear. I have friends that have always wanted to be pregnant, ""can't wait"" to be pregnant, joke about guys impregnating them. I just cannot wrap my mind around this. I can understand being unable to wait to have kids and have a little mini-me, but how do people get excited about pregnancy?  
  
When I think of pregnancy, I think of:  
  
Morning sickness  
  
pregnancy nose  
  
Gestational diabetes  
  
Preeclampsia  
  
Potential miscarriage  
  
Depression  
  
Stretch marks  
  
Not to mention all the complications surrounding the actual birth - tearing, excessive bleeding, hours and hours of pain, etc.  
  
So, naturally, I've always thought I'd adopt or foster as a way to achieve my envisioned family. I've always been excited about this prospect, but I know both adopting and fostering can come with their own unique challenges. Challenges accounted for, I still just can't rationalize going through all of that to have my own biological child.  
  
I wish very badly that I was a person that wanted to experience pregnancy or at least was willing to try. But I just cannot imagine it, fathom it, nothing. and what if this is a deal breaker for my partner? I know many people have a deep desire for biological children. When I've talked to people about this in person, it doesn't really seem like anyone relates to me on this. Everyone is like ""oh, you'll change your mind"", ""I promise it is worth it"", etc.

1,2023-09-19,CMV: Millennials and Gen Z are Screwed. Perhaps Irredeemably So...,u/Zero-zero20,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16mnb8a/cmv_millennials_and_gen_z_are_screwed_perhaps/,changemyview,"In the past decade and a half, the media has been full of stories about how [entitled](https://incafrica.com/ryan-jenkins/this-is-why-millennials-are-entitled.html), [lazy](https://africa.businessinsider.com/careers/gen-z-workers-are-lazy-some-bosses-say-they-dont-do-anything-unless-every-second-of/57pqptd) and unambitious the millennials and gen z cohort are. I do not believe this is entirely accurate for the following reasons:

1. **Academic Inflation (Modern Job Market > Kumite) :** The increased number of kids going to college has been a double edged sword. On one hand, the increased amount of college educated kids means that we have a more sceptical and literate populations which may be good for society. However, while research does seem to suggest that Gen-Z and Millennials are by some metrics the [most educated generation in many countries history's](https://www.businessinsider.in/policy/economy/news/millennials-have-struggled-to-find-well-paid-jobs-despite-being-the-most-educated-generation-its-because-there-are-more-college-degrees-but-fewer-jobs-that-require-them-/articleshow/93913920.cms), it also means that there is suddenly an abundant supply of talent for companies. And all of this ignores the effects of automation, introduction of minorities into the workforce and immigration. The end result of this process is academic inflation which that it has gotten a lot more difficult for the young to secure [jobs](https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/gen-z-set-more-qualified-29264859). Most people that know a Millennial/Gen Z have probably heard of one horror story of how tough it seems to be to get into employment in the modern job market. I believe that this situation is unsalvageable because increasingly we start to see power law distributions being caused by a Matthew effect (i.e. Those lucky enough to gain experience are hounded for jobs while those without are stuck in a loop in which they become more and more undesirable as candidates.) 
2. **Wage Stagnation (Where'd All The Good Jobs Go?):** Following up on my previous point of there being an oversupply of labour, companies have felt no real incentive to hike wages to keep talent. If talent is no longer scarce and can be obtained for cheap due to market . All this has been going on while the cost of living has been on the rise making it a lot [harder](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/wages-have-fallen-43-for-millennials-no-wonder-they-ve-lost-hope/) for people working in these positions to keep up with the cost of living. 
3. **Climate Change (Don't Look Up...No Really):** This one is a lot more controversial. It is well known that our climate is changing. Most of this change is being driven by human activity and is set to have [devastating effects](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/harvard-experts-discuss-climate-change-fears/) on life as we know it unless something is done about it. However, most big polluters seem [disinterested in slowing down](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/china-avoids-climate-change-discussion-despite-extreme-weather-2023-08-11/) any pollution efforts if it comes at the cost of their prosperity. Such trends mean that short of a string of very successful scientific breakthroughs, the younger generation seems condemned to live in a world that has far less habitable land area and more susceptible to extreme events. Geoengineering remains a deeply controversial area of research [for many reasons](https://time.com/6264143/geoengineering-climate-scientists-divided/). If things remain as they are, it means we are only left with few other alternatives, the main one being, accept that the situation is irreversible (at least for now,) and buck up and take it.
4. **Sex Recession (An Indicator of Deeper Problems)**: It has been discovered that [marriage](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/does-marriage-make-you-happier/675145/) provides human beings with happiness that is unsurpassed by very few things. This is yet another facet of life in which Millennials/Gen-Zs have been caught lacking by circumstances outside of their control. Due to some of the reasons mentioned above and a lot more that I have left out of this argument, [younger folks are not marrying](https://sundial.csun.edu/168571/print-editions/fact-check-why-younger-generations-are-saying-i-dont/) at the same rates or even showing any interest in performing acts that would make it easier to have a family [(such as engaging in sexual activity.](https://nypost.com/2023/06/01/gen-z-is-having-a-sex-recession-and-here-are-the-reasons-why/)) The impact (and presence, frankly) of hook-up culture has largely been [overblown by the media](https://time.com/88092/hookup-culture-myth-study/) and current statistics show that Gen-Z/Millennials [have a lot less bedroom traffic than their predecessors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2016/08/16/millennials-are-having-less-sex-than-other-gens-but-experts-say-its-probably-fine/?sh=4bc66ee6d958). As [Japan](https://www.newsweek.com/japan-population-decline-births-deaths-demographics-society-1796496), [South Korea](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Work/South-Korea-looks-to-foreign-workers-to-solve-demographic-crisis) and even [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/upshot/china-population-decline.html) will tell you, this is a very difficult trend to reverse. Once men and women are not interested in coming together and starting families, population collapse is almost a certainty.

To end I wish to give the definition of the word, ""entitled"" which is ""Believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment."" From this information, it would seem that such a label cannot apply to Millennials and Gen-Z.  In the words of John Burn-Murdoch, chief data reporter for the Financial Times, ""They have done everything they were told to do, yet the fruits of their labours are proving elusive."""

Last week I had a short 'bidding war' when someone else attempted to outbid me twice, and then I won that with what was my final bid. I didn't have the means to go any higher.  
  
Today someone else viewed the property and has outbid me yet again. Only this time, I'm no longer in a position to play the game. I have a financial ceiling at the moment that limits me from going higher, otherwise, I would.  
  
As a first-time buyer, this is my first time engaging in and experiencing this kind of thing. My initial reaction to being outbid is one of disappointment mixed with disgust. I feel like it's a distasteful thing to do, ""outbidding"" someone like this. They don't care that that person may have their heart set on that home - which I have/had - and then someone comes along and decides they going to steal their joy from them.  
  
I might get told that it's just the nature of this business and that it's nothing personal, etc., but that will not change the way I feel about it - to come along and steal a home purchase from someone, well, I think that's an absolutely scummy thing to do... and I am 100% right and justified in my feelings and my perception.  
  
How do people deal with this kind of loss? (and yes, I know I can't have lost what I didn't have, but I did lose out on an opportunity to seal the deal on a home I truly desired, and it stings)."

My post history tells that I live in France which, for the past 60-70 years has had a mostly centre-left/leftist history (with the policies and union strength to show for it) and is regularly a punching bag on this website. Yet any amount of time talking to Anglophone sections of the left paints France as a racist dystopia with riots raging across the country because of an already known issue with systemic corruption amongst police and because of bigotry against Muslims which is much more pertinent to the oversights and unintended consequences of Laïcité (secularism) than a burgeoning hatred of Muslims in countries like Sweden or Denmark for example. [This is also in stark contrast to evidence of France keeping up with changing attitudes towards immigration at the same rate as other Western European countries like Germany or the U.K.](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/05/05/views-about-national-identity-becoming-more-inclusive-in-us-western-europe/), [along with it having some of the lowest income inequality in Europe](https://www.oecd.org/france/41525323.pdf). It is trying to actually find measured criticisms of France's problems that do not slip into histrionic scaremongering (the kind I encountered when I moved to France after finishing my degree from clueless, delusional British and American leftists whose responses to France's glaring issues say much more about the increasing collation of terms, inability to properly interpet and analyse data and horrible praxis than it does about any material solutions to France's social ills or the magnitude of them.

When I'm not being lectured about wealth inequality and the supposedly horribly racist city that I live in, there is this false dichotomy of Left vs Right... which is actually Anglo Left vs Anglo Right which does not mean much when you live in what is already a pretty left-wing country surrounded by at least two other countries that are entering new epochs of political stability (Germany and Spain.) There is something to be said for fence-sitters, contrarians and those who talk about ""both sides"" of debates that are based on mistruths and misinformation, but this increasingly seems like an attempt at a ""good person"" litmus test and failing it results in you being smeared as a conservative, a bootlicker, and, most importantly, a bad person. How arrogant does any political actor have to be to think the world stage starts and ends with what the U.S. and the U.K. deem to be right and left-wing?

This does not just end with political stances however. Anyone who dares question methodology of sections of the left is also smeared as a conservative and subject to the same quasi-religious treatment that someone who had been in a struggle session would be very well accquainted with. [Kenan Malik,](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kenanmalik) someone whose articles I used in a previous post about the left, was called a social conservative repeatedly by commenters on that post without any evidence at all besides ""I just feel like he is."" Well, in that case, I feel like sections of the left have a real issue with minorities who do not spout their ultra-specific version of leftism i.e. a section of [this video by the creator Contrapoints in which she speaks about how misogyny is rife across the political spectrum and how it looks to the average person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmT0i0xG6zg)

So... misreading data, litmus tests that do nothing except expose how saying ""eat the rich"" every 5 seconds is what it takes to get into the good graces of certain sections of the left, and a narcissism of increasingly small differences. What else is this besides bitterness disguised as virtue?

Is there someone who can explain, honestly, what the purpose of behaviour like this is besides a cope for disenfranchisement?

1,2023-09-19,CMV: Whiteness is largely an illusion,u/tolkienfan2759,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16mswb7/cmv_whiteness_is_largely_an_illusion/,changemyview,"The whiteness illusion is the idea that we can mark any point between different ""races"" and think, or behave as though, there is some significant underlying difference, some difference that should matter to us, between those ""races.""

There are three proofs that I know of, that it is an illusion, and probably others I don't.

1) half a million years ago, every single one of my ancestors was black... and that is true of every single living human being.  If black is real, we're all black right now.  If you go by the one drop rule.

2) if we run the one-drop rule in reverse, and make one drop of white blood evidence of whiteness, it would change everything, and be totally arbitrary.  And so it's clearly fictitious.

3) geneticists tell us, and I believe them, that genetic variability within ""races"" is far higher than variability between them.

Now when I say whiteness is LARGELY an illusion, I'm adding in the knowledge that, in fact, some populations left Africa at different times a long time ago, and their geographic situations and circumstances (evidently) produced small but real genetic differences in the populations.  And so appearance provides a certain amount of real evidence of geographic and circumstantial differences in ancestral populations.

Feel free to add proofs I haven't thought of, and CMV if possible.  Thanks!"

If you are against capitalism, you should not be here. 

- It’s users are the product. Reddit is selling your attention span to the highest bidder, you get no financial compensation. 

- Like the free market, it adjusts to make sure that it maintains the greatest number of subscribers. Reddit today is different from Reddit 10 years ago. Why? Because peoples values change and Reddit adjusted to best accommodate the largest numbers of subscribers. More subscribers = more money. 

- If you didn’t find value in Reddit, you would go someplace else. There are actually anti-capitalist subs with millions of subscribers and they are actively competing to get more subscribers. Talk about fumbling the bag!

Perhaps some will counter with “it’s a great place to reach the largest audience.” No kidding. Because it was created and continues to excel because of capitalism. Imagine some sweet state sponsored message board running on a Linux server. This is just another pro-capitalism arguments.

I base this off the following:

1.  She nearly lost her last election and likely has a more difficult one coming up where she's probably lost a significant amount of support after this fallout. Losing her Congressional seat could be the end of her tenure in DC which also diminishes her national profile. 
2. Politically she seems to be in a hole that may only be put past her by becoming Trump's VP. It's possible Trump would enjoy the optics of being next to her on the campaign trail (and I mean this in a literal sense since it seems insiders have labeled MTG to ugly for him) but I think this is a long shot.
3. Sex work has never been more accepted in this country and it's possible Boebert abandoning politics could quickly win people over by championing the legitimacy of adult content. This kind of brand change would get massive attention and be the wind behind her new platform. This country loves giving celebrities second chances and there are PR firms that could turn her into a folk hero in just a few weeks. 
4. I can tell you as a matter of fact that there is nothing more non-partisan than a penis and you are in denial if you don't think people from every political affiliation would not be interested. The amount of interest and money she would bring in would be astounding right now and may be an easier and less stressful career for her.

My theory is that men just don’t want to date women that are older than 24 years old because they’re then no longer as naive and are percieved as ‘too old,’ which brings me to talk about about our systems/the patriarchy: a big portion of us have been conditioned to believe that young is beautiful because it fits into our beauty standards (which are made to sell off of our insecurities btw) — aging was never supposed to be unattractive, and it is certinaly not unattractive ! 

I can definitely see it being connected to our systems, as our attractions always come from somewhere (and are complex). From what I know they usually rise from:

1. Psychological influences: 
e.g. men are at their peak at around 20-25 years old as well, yet there’s not as many female pedos because age is generally considered important among men and not women. 
One sad example is that 13-19 year old girls on tiktok are now slowly starting to romantacize huge age gap relationships and seeking older men out.

2. Trauma: people with trauma may develop certian feelings and ideas because of it, and with this often times find themselves get the urge to relive what has happened to them (which is a big trauma response).

3. The list goes on. bla bla bla


My point is that pedophilic men are not rare social outcasts, instead they are around you all the time. But as our systems and values have changed, the average age gap has shortened which is also direct proof that it is possibly connected.

If you want a nature argument: older males have a very short window to mate, before a younger and stronger male comes and drives them away. They lack the abilities to protect and provide for their mate, and their sperm count decreases with 1-2% per year after the age of 30. Hence this, an older male is not suited to be with a young female.

1,2023-09-19,CMV: The only way someone can believe in a religion like Christianity is if they deliberately hold it to a much lower standard of evidence than they hold everything else.,u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16n2hy7/cmv_the_only_way_someone_can_believe_in_a/,changemyview,"Most people who are religious practice perfectly sound judgment and fact-based assessment in most other aspects of their life. 

For instance, if you were a car dealer and you tried to sell a Toyota to a Christian, saying, *""This Camry can give you 300 miles per gallon,""* that Christian wouldn't believe it - and rightfully so. The Christian would demand, ""Give me a tremendous amount of evidence before I'll believe such a wild claim."" 

Same if a finance manager told a religious client, ""*Give me $10,000 today and I'll invest it and make it become $1 million in five years.""* The religious person would be rightfully skeptical. That sort of return on one's money would be well-nigh impossible, barring all but the most extreme circumstances or massive fraud.

Yet somehow, when it comes to all the far-fetched claims - that the Red Sea were literally divided in two so people could walk on dry land, that a Flood drowned all humans save eight but also that animals walked pair by pair into the Ark (including several million species of insects and spiders as well - imagine that), that dead people can resurrect, that Jesus was God Himself on Earth.........many Christians believe those to have literally have happened as well. (Yes, I know, not all are Biblical literalists, but many are.)

Then the only logical way to describe this is that these people hold their own religion to a much looser, lower standard of evidence than they demand of everything else. They hold everything else to a strict standard but hold their religion to a loose standard. (Except for religious people who are also conspiracy-theorist quacks - they hold *everything* to a loose standard.)

I think back in the year in early 2020 I did, *somehow*, stumbled across a person who was doing their furry fursona and it was a speed-art video (but in fact, the video wasn't mentioning anything about the term or from the community itself); and I just did not cringed at all from that time.

But after passing those times, I've just saw a furry art some months later, November of 2020, but when I saw that, I was actually just straight cringing at this, but for no reason except that I was viewing/judging it as something that is abominating ***(until I figured out it's not really like that, but mindfully)***`¹`. Due to that odd reason, I became a furry hater ***(until December 2021)***`¹`.

* To explain a little more, the reason why I did became a furry hater ***(until December 2021)***`²` was different than the art reason ***(until I mindfully figured out it's not really like that)***`²`, but I did started to have a hate side because of the art first.   


^(Well...) After December 2021, I think I've got to have 3 (labeled as) furries on my Friends list on Discord, meaning so I've been getting used to it... Despite the fact that I'm still having this negative view on furry arts up to this day... No matter if I try to warm up before seeing, or viewing it for more than 3 seconds, or else I'll start to blush of embarrassment (note that I just tried it twice), but I'm fine with any furry terms they say (even in stereotype ones, *^(except the randomly spamming UwU/OwO one)*)

Lots of talk about the 'migrant crisis' and how asylum seekers are overwhelming borders, new rules on how to apply for asylum, etc. etc.

I thought asylum was for political purposes, i.e. your government is going to try to harm you if you go back to that country, so you're asking to become a citizen of another country so they can't hurt you.  Sure there are other definitions (i.e. mental asylum), but we're talking specifically about what seems to be the global movement of many people who don't want to be where they are currently.

Now I'm hearing it used more like a process by which anyone can claim they don't want to go back to their origin country -- typically for socioeconomic reasons -- and they're looking to simply move somewhere else to have a better life.

I'm not asking anyone to CMV on immigration -- that's a far larger topic with many facets.  I'm just saying that asylum is a specific thing whereas people simply wanting to immigrate is another. "
1,2023-09-19,CMV: Full term college/university is a waste of time (but not trade school or community college),u/carpfoon123,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16n3gqu/cmv_full_term_collegeuniversity_is_a_waste_of/,changemyview,"There have been a few posts I've seen made years ago about school being a scam, and while I somewhat agree, I think that **a full term 4 year or longer, is a waste of time, and everything below assumes the 4+ year school and not the 2 aforementioned.**

1. After you finish.... **you still have to work**. And it's not just about having to work, but a solid majority **will still have to take time to find work and open positions**, while going back to living with parents, etc. Most graduates do not ""hit the ground running"" with the higher salary their field offers, since you would have to start at an entry level position either way, and work your way up. Not only that, most would not be making 6 figures even with a degree, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, **but roughly 60k to 70k a year after tax**. Now *while this is indisputably higher than min. wage salary for a year*, **a reminder that the MAJORITY of students (roughly 43.5m of them in 2022), will have student loan debt that they also have to pay off (averaging $37,000 or so in 2022).   \***     After paying a little of this debt off year by year, the difference in salary of degree holders and non degree holders becomes much closer, for the first few years. The minimum wage employee will have the benefit of applying for cash assistance/food stamps/ health care, due to such low salary, **while the higher wage degree holder cannot, and ends up finding themselves in the hell that is 'upper' lower class, for the first 5+/- or so years paying off debt and having no assistance.    \*\***

* *If you are assuming a counter claim on students that don't have said debt or went on scholarships, consider them the ""lucky few"". This is not a post about '1-upping' anyone, but facing the harsh reality of debt in this country.*
* **Also this is NOT saying ""hey go apply for gov. assistance"", as it's a good program for those that truly need it (most of them being in the minimum wage), but it is saying** *{\[think of the reality of being in debt and not making much the first few years paying your debt and being in entry level, and also not being able to apply for any/all assistance simply because your salary is ""too high"", becoming disillusioned to the wage hell of not making 6 figures, that honestly, most do not end up making.\]}*

2. Many factors such as (a) financial struggles (leading to precarious work study balance), (b) academic challenges (for those not as gifted as others, or struggle to uphold attendance or have behavior issues), (c) physical/mental health issues, (d) family responsibilities (such as a death of an parent resulting in loss of income for younger siblings, or student's own child), (e) legal or immigration issues, etc. Are ALL major factors that can result in a longer duration of stay, or dropout all together.     \*

* **While this is a very 'case by case' scenario, it is most certainly NOT uncommon to see. I**f one does dropout, then the prior 1,2,3 years have essentially become a waste of time (especially if they decide not to re-enroll, or can't due to reasons above), and hence post title. Most of the situations listed above may result in a longer time away, and the longer the dropout, the less likely the university will allow the student to continue on the same course, and more likely  issue a ""rollback"" in term, *resulting in said time loss.* 

3. Completely free university would help in the 2 problems listed above, but **unfortunately in the USA, currently there are no completely free schools without a 'catch'.** The ""tuition free"" programs offered by say, CUNY, applies to low income students and have certain criteria to be met, and is not available to everyone, and single out of state student. The other route would be military service, but again, not everyone fits the requirement for such service and can join. Online programs and courses, while you can find some for free, only have partial courses and don't offer everything for free. Going to a country with free tuition for undergrad programs (such as Germany), also require the student to live out of pocket. *Again, a scholarship helps a little, but only the select few can get a full ride.* 

* **Also, while a completely free tuition would help tremendously, it does not solve issues such as mental health, academic struggle, lack of motivation/interest, etc. While this is dependent on the student, for that student, the title of the post above is reality of said student at that current moment.**

4. Having a degree helps with work opportunity, but if you ever move or change jobs, **work experience will go further than a degree would**, especially one that isn't even related to the current field to begin with. This somewhat ties in to why trade schools, apprenticeships, internships or vocational programs, are NOT a waste of time, and it'd be better than college would in the long run. Now however, since this is not exactly an unpopular opinion and one generally received as well known, I would like to re-iterate that spending 4 years and working part time to simply afford to pay off the rest of your tuition, is 4 years wasted of time you could have been doing on the job training, or in the field internship.

1,2023-09-19,"CMV: Non-black people who say “n**ga” are racist, whether they mean it in an offensive way or not.",u/Sufficient-Yellow481,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16n59xn/cmv_nonblack_people_who_say_nga_are_racist/,changemyview,"The common arguement I hear is “I say it all the time. I don’t mean it in a racist way though.” The problem I have with this is if you’re not black, there is no “non-offensive” way to say it. Black people started saying “ni**a” amongst each other in a friendly way to retake/reclaim the word the was used to dehumanize us for so many centuries. Nowadays the newly reclaimed “ni**a” with an “a” instead of an “er” has been popularized through various black culture media such as rap music. And as a result, the word has reached the ears of many non-black listeners. And because they think saying it sounds “cool” or “hip”, they want to say it too. But the majority of black people don’t like non-black people appropriating the reclaimed term, because the context is different when non-black people say it. When black people say it, we are saying it to take power away from those that used it to dehumanize us. But nobody ever used the word “ni**er” to dehumanize any race other than black people. So when non-black people say it, they are not saying it to reclaim power, they are saying it to sound cool, and hip, and to try to fit in with black people. And some might argue that when they say it, they don’t mean it in an offensive, negative, or dehumanizing way. But that doesn’t matter. The fact of matter is they KNOW black people don’t like non-black people saying it, so if you’re non-black and decide to say it anyway, that proves that you don’t respect black people enough to refrain from saying that word. And if you lack respect for black people to the point where you’ll just throw the n-word around willy nilly regardless of how it might make someone feel, then you are a racist, full stop!"
1,2023-09-19,"CMV: If you wrongfully appropriate money from someone, any money earned is theirs",u/RseAndGrnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16n5q0i/cmv_if_you_wrongfully_appropriate_money_from/,changemyview,"Was watching a video where someone stole money from a spouses savings account, used the money to start a business, then returned it to the savings account without them noticing until much later. To me it only makes sense that not only do they own the original amount of money back, but also any profit that money produced. So if they stole $10,000, earned $50,000 and returned $10,000, they still owe the person $40,000. Why?

Because what is money if not potential? Maybe they would've left the money sitting in the account untouched. Maybe they would've blew it on hookers and cocaine. Or maybe they would've started their own business and made just as much or more. Because they didn't have the money there is no way for use to know one way or the other. By generating money from the ill gotten gains, a level of potential from that money has been recognized, and all recognized gains should be given to the rightful owner.

Another way we can think of it is like a stock. Say in 2000 I had 10 stock certificates for amazon worth $3 and someone stole it. They then sold it in 2002 for $2. We finally bring them to court in 2022 when the stock is worth $90. Do they owe me $30 because that was the value when stolen, 20 because that was what they earned or $900 because that is the value of it present day? Trick question: They actually owe $16,000 because in 2020 the stock was at a high of $160.

Now one might question, ""How do we know they would've sold at that time"" and my answer is, it doesn't matter because they couldn't. The potential was taken away from them and being the victim, the most generous realized outcome should be the one afforded to them"

In relatively wealthy countries like Japan and South Korea, it is blamed on the peculiarities of toxic work culture, and outstanding sexism against mothers in the workforce.   

In other wealthy countries without all that, such as the US, it is blamed on the lack of social support system for childrearing for the working class.

In countries that are wealthy social democracies with solid worker rights and feminist advocacy, such as Norway.... Well, you still hear pretty much all of these arguments for why the birth rate is similarly well under 2.0 same as in all others. 

The simple truth is, that *most people don't want children*. They might say otherwise, but no matter how wealthy a country is, people will always feel nervous about the financial bite of childrearing, not to mention the time and energy that it will always cost, no matter how supportive the system is.

No matter how well off you are, there will always be a motive to say ""Oh, I would totally love children, they are so cute, but in these times..."" and then gesture vaguely at the window. 

At the end of the day, the one thing that consistently led to low fertility rates is not poverty, or bad social policy, nor sexism, on the contrary: women in developed countries having the option not to get pregnant. 

We obviously don't want to see a reversal of *that*. But in that case, the only other remaining alternative is to inventivize women to have more children. Not with half-assed social policies, but by calculating the actual opportunity cost of  raising a child, and paying women more than that for it. 

If childrearing has a value (and it obviously does for a country that doesn't plan to utterly disappear), then the only way for a society to remain civilized and feminist while getting that value out of women, is to stop expecting childrearing as some sort of honorable sacrifice, and put such a price point on it, that enough reasonably self-interested women would see it as a viable life path. 

In my mind this looks like a woman being able to afford an above-median quality of life (not just for her childbearing years), if willing to give birth to and raise  6-10 children, (and that's still assuming that most women in the world would not take up the offer and have 0 children so that needs to be offset). But the exact numbers are debatable. Either way this would inevitably put a massive financial burden on the segment of society who are not having children. 

Note that this is not about the optimal world population: You might believe that we need only 3 billion people to stay sustainable, or that we need 20 billion for a more vibrant society, but either way  that should be a stable population, and I don't see how we are ever going to be getting that in the current system where we are expecting pregnancies to just happen on their own, while we are allowing women the tools to not let them happen, and putting the burden on them if it does.    

 Also note that this is not about any particular country's demograpics that immigration can offset, but about the long term global trends that can be expected the current sources of immigration, as well."

The initial shock and confusion were overwhelming. I could hardly process what had just happened. The smell, the smoke, and the commotion that followed were beyond anything I could have imagined.

Paramedics arrived, and they asked everyone to leave the platform. As I crossed the station bridge to the other side, I caught a glimpse of the person’s head under the front of the train, surrounded by a lot of blood. It was an image that still haunts me.

I had to give statements to the police and my college, which is right next to the station. Some of us who witnessed it sat together and talked to cope with the trauma.

Since we require the consent of people for nearly everything that could harm them, why are we making exception for procreation, which comes with lots of risk, especially if you are unlucky and could create a miserable life of suffering and tragic death? 

The only reason to not ask for ""direct"" consent would be for things that most people have tacitly agreed to, like driving a car, taxes, taking a flight, saved by emergency services while unconscious, etc etc etc. These things are ""pre-consented"" as part of social contract/arrangement, because it comes with more benefit than risks, no? 

But you cant ""pre-consent"" to procreation, because the child does not exist before conception, all births are without ANY form of consent (direct, implied or substituted) by default, right? The parents cant consent on behalf of the potential child either, because the unborn child has no history of ""preferences"" that the parents could inter from. 

Morally speaking, we should never carry out an action if consent (direct, implied or substituted) is impossible, right? This means procreation is a violation of autonomy and consent by default, making it immoral, correct? 

I dont see how we can get around this moral fact. Why is it not immoral to procreate when consent is impossible to obtain from the subject (the child to be)?

But I can’t see why it’d be worth it for these reasons:
1. It’s very costly. We’re going to have to spend around 858 billion (as current bill says) in building/maintaining infrastructure and deploying assets and creating more icebreakers - its just going to be a lot and the US would be much better off spending all of this money in other sectors (healthcare, education, even funding other military operations). Right now we’re struggling with too less of a federal budget anyway (already hit debt ceiling) CLEARLY we cant afford to dump money in pointless causes

AND IT IS pointless because
2. There are no tangible economic benefits. People are saying the arctic is crucial for resource extraction esp. as they are seriously depleting rn, but as many studies have shown they arent exactly cost effective to use. in fact this is to the extent that every single arctic offshore project has been abandoned due to lack of feasibility
There is also a counter arg about trade routes. Since the arctic is on top of the world, its useful as trade routes can be formed from there, and if u control it you can ship things in shorter amt of times, get to other countries faster, etc. sure this is all great. except for the fact that the arctic ice isnt melting fast enough for this to be a viable option for a long time. Also these routes require specially built ships which shipping companies arent interested in investing in 

3. also decreases cooperation with russia. Much of Russia’s territory is in the arctic, so obv they will feel quite threatened if the us is suddenly sending a bunch of stuff over there. rn terms are already pretty bad between the two countries but there is always a chance things can improve(low atm but will be even lower if we follow this plan).  if the us starts making military advances right next to russia’s territory this will blow any chance of diplomatic relations out of the window. And this will lead to a huge decrease of cooperation in all sectors, including climate. rn russia and us both share mutual interest in mitigating the climate crisis but provoking russia in this way may be the very reason they refuse to cooperate which would mean very bad things for the world

another common arg is that us needs the arctic to maintain its hegemony, but first of all, hegemony isnt necessarily good. and arctic isnt worth it. as i explained w my previous points, we have virtually nothing to gain from the arctic but so much to lose, it could even cost the entire future of the world. so because of all of this i strongly oppose sending more troops to the arctic.

So that being said, if it is a Christian’s belief that abortion is murder (and this belief is usually heavily rooted in religion) but a non Christian believes that abortion is not murder, why is there a need to create a law that heavily aligns with the Christian side? If we want to create a land where everyone feels accepted regardless of what religious views they hold, what need is there for a law that only agrees with specific religious groups? 

I’d also like to add I know not all Christians are pro life and not all non-christians are pro choice. This is just a common trend I’ve seen on the media and I want to understand an outside perspective. 

I guess I find abolishing abortion somewhat ironic. Someone who is christian and pro life should absolutely be accepted for who they are and that belief. On the flip side, someone who is not christian and pro choice should also be accepted for that belief."

I hear alot of femme men say they get treated worse now but honestly I feel like I get treated way better now that I present femme. Here’s how:

1) people (usually men) smile at me a lot more, Before people would ignore me in the streets but now I walk down the street and people act like I’m a celebrity

2) men give me things for free, one time I went to bakery and got a free pastry, another time I got free French fries, once I even got a a free steak

3) I get harassed in the streets LESS I’m used to walking down the streets and getting called homophonic and transphobic slurs but now I only get compliments by men about my looks

In the same way that I believe I have a right to decide if I want to be a parent (aka have a baby), I believe men have the right to walk away without any repercussions should they decide they don’t want to be a parent. If I desire to keep a child and my partner doesn’t, I cannot force him to remain by my side or give me support in any way. If I desire to have an abortion, I also can’t be forced to carry the child because my partner wants a child. 

 A few notes though 
- I’m excluding the topic of adoption. This is purely about the desire for either party to become a parent 

- similar to how a pregnant female would have to make the choice by a certain point in the pregnancy, the same would apply to the man 

- if the biological father chooses to leave, he is not allowed to come back later if he has changed his mind. In a similar way that a biological mother must permanently accept her choice for an abortion, the biological father must permanently accept his choice for severing his relationship from his kid"

I'm using polls and reports to get clearer picture, rather than sensational newspapers or social media, which is full of hate. It helps me to feel the empathy, and helps me avoid of ideologically edges. Otherwise news and social media makes you feel like you're living with enemies who wants to destroy you. 

I think being stuck to the ideological edge is not something one do on purpose, but the political climate creates perfect conditions for the situation.

I would say it should be 100% on everything over £10,000 (would need to adjust with inflation).",u/MosDuff3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16nl411/cmv_inheritance_tax_should_be_as_high_as_possible/,changemyview,"This is a fairly simple one to explain I think but still requires a few caveats. 

In the ideal, inheritance tax would be high enough to take the vast majority of a persons wealth off them after death, whilst still allowing enough wiggle room to pass on things of genuine meaning to the family (clothes, jewelry, dads lucky hat etc.). Many of these items would not be known to the tax man in any case, and so of course there would be some loop holes, but there are always loop holes so I don't want to get into a debate in how people can avoid inheritance tax, because I'm really just talking about the principle here (the practicalities would be different, but not insurmountable). 

Inheriting money from your parents is a total freebie, you have done nothing to earn that money. People often suggest that people on welfare are lazy and the very existence of welfare will reduce productivity at a cost to the tax payer. These people have often benefited enormously due to inheritance (which also comes at a cost to the tax payer, as that could be money for other things the state funds) and yet don't seem to think that is a problem. 

Inheritance entrenches income inequality and often results in some incredibly rich idiots in very high positions of power. Without substantial inheritance they would have much less power, and be required to work as hard as everybody else (of course that's not quite true because there are many other benefits to having rich parents).

Some might say that it's morally wrong to tax a person after tax, and it amounts to double taxation on income they had already paid tax. But so what? we do pay inheritance tax anyway, so this is really just a discussion about where we draw the line. Substantially raising inheritance tax not only brings money in to pay for schools, healthcare etc., it also goes part way to address income inequality, but most importantly it creates an economy where people have to work and achieve and do it themselves if they want to get anywhere in life. Currently there are plenty of rich people that can essentially doss around on their parents cash because there is a giant pile that has been passed down over generations. 

If you are first generation wealthy, it is not as easy to just give large sums of money to your kids because you have no savings of your own yet, and none from your parents, and are likely still paying off a mortgage, and all of the other up front costs of having kids. It wouldn't solve the inequities, but it would be a step in the right direction. "

Florida law currently prohibits 16 and 17-year-olds from working before 6:30 a.m., after 11:00 p.m., or for more than eight hours when there is school the next day. The bill would do away with those restrictions, as well as the requirement for a 30 minute break after four consecutive hours of work.

I believe these types of laws would allow employers to pay less and offer less benefits, under the guise of providing 'spending money' jobs to teenagers. This is effectively rolling back all of the progress that US workers have been fighting to gain for over 100 years, and is moving us down a path of further class separation by offering unequal access to education for children."

Realistically speaking, I feel as though they do more harm than good. I am all for climate action and reducing emissions. That's why I say this. I've noted the reaction to JustStopOil has been vitriolic and negative, with youtubers even pranking them and people often resorting to violence on the spot. The biggest thing I don't understand is that previous movements like Greenpeace went after governments and laws and regulations to enact change. (See: Opération Satanique) JustStopOil targets and pisses off the very people they're trying to convince, the poor. If you look at who denies climate change, regardless of race, political affiliation or all else, poverty and lack of education are the biggest driving factors. If you look at a map of where Greenpeace has headquarters, you can see a more global HDI view of this. You're not gonna convince the Yer Da British bricklayer by blocking him on the way to his worksite. You're not gonna convince the already most likely green German by blocking her on the way to watch the football match. You're not gonna convince the poor and working class, by fucking with the things they love like formula 1 and the tour de france. Obviously these aren't exclusive to the poor, but they take specific stock and happiness from having something to take pleasure in on a weekly basis and take away from the monotony of life. I come from a relatively well off background from a developed nation, and climate change is never something I had to be convinced on. It just made scientific sense to me. But living and hanging out with people from all walks of life, I can't help but feel almost like JustStopOil is a false actor or something. I can't help but reel at the tone deafness of their tactics. Like.. are these people comfortable in life enough to not know what it's like to have bigger priorities than stuff like that?"

I always tip at least 20%, often more. A couple of recent experiences have made me question this practice, however.

To start, here are three recent scenarios:

1. My boyfriend and I went to a sports bar. We had nachos as an appetizer, split a pizza, and each had a beer. The bill was $42, and we tipped 20% ($8.40). The server was at our table no more than 5 minutes the whole time.

2. We went to a taproom with a kitchen. We had a soft pretzel appetizer, two entrees, and two beers each. The bill was $72, and we tipped 20% ($14.40). As before, the server spent no more than 5 minutes at our table.

3. I ordered grocery delivery via instacart. It was a small order of four items for $20, plus an $8 delivery fee (was in a pinch). Instacart suggested a 15% tip ($4.20), and a 20% tip would be $5.60. I tipped $9.

So, in the first two scenarios, the servers did the exact same job and did the same amount of work. There was nothing better or worse about either experience, but server two made 71% more.

Meanwhile, the instacart driver did objectively more work. They had to go into the store, find the items, check out, load their car, drive to my location, and bring the order to the door. But, at a percent-based rate, they would have made 33% less.

This is arguably not equitable, nor is it really logical. 

While the ideal solution would be to abolish tipping and make businesses pay their own employees, this probably won't happen any time soon. 

An alternative solution is to quit tipping based on percent. The tip should be based on the type of work and time spent. 

Examples:

For restaurant servers, $5 plus $3 per party member. So, a single person tips $8 and a party of 6 tips $23.

For grocery delivery, something like $5 plus $0.25 per unique item. Or, $1 per mile from store plus $0.25 per unique item.

This creates a more equitable base for tipping and allows people to feel comfortable going to more expensive places."

1,2023-09-20,"CMV: Abortion is more of a utilitarian issue, not a moral issue, and hence it should be legal.",u/ChadDredd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16npdoz/cmv_abortion_is_more_of_a_utilitarian_issue_not_a/,changemyview,"This is my hot take on why abortion should be legal. I will not argue from a moral point of view, because that is pointless and will get us nowhere, we can go back and forth claiming each other to be good or evil all day long and we’ll all just come out fuming. Moral values are a fluid thing, and it change from culture to demography to times. But logic, however, is absolute. And whether abortion should be legal or not, is a question of logic and utilitarian.

One of the most common recurring arguments from the pro-life camp is that abortion is wrong since it involves the murder of another human. Since all human lives are sacred, as we have determined it to be, whether because of our religion or modern institutions telling us so. Under no circumstances can another life, even a fetus, can be killed, since it is biologically human, and should be granted the right to live just as any other human. 

This argument, however, is flawed and completely ignore the reality of our society’s workings.

Theoretically, this ideal that all lives are equal no matter the circumstances sound great, and is an ideal to strive for. It however, is not what we actually do on a daily basis, not because we are evil, but because we are practical. “THE VALUE OF LIFE CAN AND WILL CHANGE BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES”. If it is to be argued that a life shall not be taken under any circumstances, many people will have to be arrested and go to jail right now. Circumstances can and will lower or increase the value of a life. Here is a few example.

When it comes a disaster or evacuation, a president’s life will be first priority for rescue, not random Joe who live down the street. If all lives are equal, there should be no priority at all. But we, as a society, understand and has granted such priority due to the practical circumstances that the president being alive is more beneficial to the nation as a whole compared to if the president died and random Joe lived. Proving that, the circumstances of your life do indeed affect the value of your life, or I guess make you more equal than others. 

Circumstances can also strip a person of their right to live and we as a society has mostly agreed that it is LOGICAL and PRACTICAL and RIGHT to do so. Oh on what circumstances you asked? Easy, imagine if a police were to shoot dead an armed and violent assailant, which happens more common than we’d like. At that moment, we have all agreed that the police’s right to live and every surrounding person’s right to live, is more important than the assailant’s right to live. If circumstances do not affect one’s right to live, then the police need to go to jail for murder, soldiers need to go to jail for killing the enemy, a guy defending his home that shot dead a thief need to go to jail for murder. This is to prove one thing, whether a life is to live or not is circumstantial, and that circumstances must be logical and practical. 

Legal euthanasia. If a person’s right to live cannot be changed under any circumstances. Euthanasia is evil, suicide is evil. In many places they are seen as so. But the trend is that we have slowly started to accept that it is only logical for one to end one’s life should it not be meaningful anymore to keep living, and family of brain-dead patients has agreed to euthanasia on many occasions, even if the patient cannot make the decision for themselves. The logic dictates that a life can be taken under logical and practical circumstances, and in more extreme cases, even without their knowledge if they are incapable of “thought” anymore or never had one, provided that it is logical to do so. 

Now that I have established the value of life is not set in stone, but are in flux with the time and place and situation we are in. It’s time to say why abortion should be legal, based on a practical approach. 

As we have commonly heard already so I’ll just make it short and concise. 

1. People will still try to get abortion illegally, making it legal can create safe law and regulation in place to prevent malpractice and risk of death. 

2.Prevent placing unnecessary stress on the financial situation of families or single parent who did not plan to have a child and is not able to afford it. Also relieve stress on the social safety net and welfare system since you know, less mouth to feed. 

3.The right to self-autonomy. As we should all embrace. 

I think we should have a more practical approach instead of doing too many emotional appeals.

TLDR: Abortion should be legal based purely on logical argument that it creates more benefits than it does harm."

This post is going to have a *lot* of spoilers for those who haven't read the books. Read at your own risk.

The world is absoloutly *terrified* of the Dragon being reborn. Why? Because the Dragon is a *man who can channel* and men who can channel go insane. The Dragon being reborn also means the literal end of the world is fast approaching and their only hope is a madman. 

In the show they expect the Dragon to be a woman. This lowers the stakes considerably. Especially considering we know from the first few chapters of book 1 that Rand is the Dragon Reborn. It's not a mystery. And the looming threat of him going insane is a major plot point.

Perrin kills his wife. Perrin does not have a wife until far later in the books. They introduced a character for other reason then to kill her off. And now he's going to have to deal with that for the rest of the series.

Mat's dad is awesome and they made him out to be a horrible father figure in the show.

Lan is probably the worst offender. He's consistantly described as stoic in the books and never shows his emotions. Which makes the very few times he does incredibly impactful. In the show he's a whiny mess.

Nynaeve and Lan don't hook up until after they get married. And his confession is a very emotional moment in the books. They sleep together immediately in the show and he seems to wear his emotions on his sleeves.

Speaking of sleeping together. Rand and Egwene *never* hook up. And considering the first time Rand has sex he *tells the woman they need to get married immediately* this completely changes his character from the innocent he is supposed to be at this point.

Perrin doesn't have his axe. That he made himself. Brings with him through most of the series, and has a prophecy attached to it. Why doesn't he have the axe? Oh yeah because he killed a character that shouldn't exist...

Moraine loses her powers? Yeah nope. Never happens. And creates plot holes later as to what the fox people would want from her.

They can't take horses in the Ways? I don't think they travel through the Ways once *without* horses.

Healing. You cannot heal someone who has been burnt out. That's one of the big dangers of drawing too much of the One Power. The show ignores this.

Rand's eye color being different is odd since his blue eyes are often referenced but I guess colored contacts would be too much of a hassle.

Elayne is ""The golden lion of Andor"" and her golden hair is symbolism. In the show she's a redhead? Okay...

Liandrin has been given more words in the show to date then she spoke in all of her time in the books combined. These books are huge and you're *adding things?!* 

Rand sleeps with Lanfear? Yeah no he rejects her hard in the books. Because again he's an innocent dude for as long as possible.

They refer to Lews Therin as ""The Dragon Reborn"" ... What? No Lews Therin *Is the Dragon* Rand is his reincarnation. Ie: the Dragon *Reborn* did they just not read the books?

Perrin rescuing Avi is an odd choice considering they never have a single conversation in the books.

In the books you can tell from a characters features where they are from. The show has made everywhere diverse which kinda takes away from individual cultures. I don't really care because I think it's important to get the best actors, but it is a pretty drastic change that takes away from the worldbuilding.

There are a lot more and I could get even more nitpicky but these are the things I think flat out go against the spirit of the story.

I'm not saying the showrunners have gotten everything wrong, but the changes either make no sense; completely contradict the books; or appear as though they never read the source material. And all three are very disrespectful towards the work of an author who is dead and cannot defend this.

How my view can be changed:

If you can show me that doing the show this way is bringing in new readers. Ultimately the show can be crap and also an overall success if more people and being motivated to read the books.

If you can explain how these changes make sense and do not in fact contradict the books.

*What will not change my view*

Any nonsense about how this is ""A different turning of the wheel."" I can understand changes. I cannot respect changes that disregard the source material. Wigs are easy. Not having random characters sleep together is easy. Not adding things when you have plenty to work with is easy."

we propably wouldn't recognise supernatural event as one because our brain propably would see only things we can comprehend.

Think about this hipotetical situation:
if ghost would appere before me, i would see it as just some fog, i would have no idea it is ghost- i would see a glimpse, unconciosly, of it, not full form- and lost, that's it, i lost chance to document a ghost, because...well, i couldnt even see its form

3. If some paranormal creature would appere before..well, anyone face, person would either freak out, and later on try to give it some racionalistaion, or it would be happen so fast that person would mistake it for something else 

4.Rather this events would be very rare, and it would be hard to distinguish it from fake stories

5. If we assume, that there are many type of paranormal beings, all encounters would be very different, confusion would lead to no belive (because there would be not known pattern so it would look fake)

6. Video's/ photos won't be, even if real, an proof, because...well, you can just fake it, especialy at our times 

7. Even if we had some data, we couldnt really make it appere again, it would be like guesses and trying everything- by that i mean, that if we had, i don't know, three belivable strange events, we propably couldnt continue more reaserch because we wouldnt know a pattern.

If we would observe that in rain showed up an unicorn in forest, at night, and it would happen only once, we couldnt know if it have some connection to weather, or just it happend only once, seeking this unicorn would be hard because..how we could lure another one?

The only way, we could actually have an belivable proof, we would have need something big and meaningfull to happen- like, i don't know, if dragon like creature would show up one day in city."

So if you have a different take I'd love to hear it.  


Here's my current view: Image and video altering tech in addition to AI generated images need to be reined in for the benefit and mental health of all who are exposed to it. I don't mean it needs to be removed completely but it feels so out of hands. This type of conduct is nothing new but humans being humans we manage to bring things to the extreme sometimes.  


I think some sort of warning like on cigarettes ""this photo/image/media has been altered to adjust the appearance"" or something. Growing up with it and having no idea. Now as an adult being able to see it more easily, or understand that the efforts of the movement to make it more realistic has made it harder to spot what is and isn't a realistic expectation of a human face and body is concerning.  


I think it definitely has it's place. When I view people I don't see all their imperfections, I just see their whole face. Maybe that's just me but I don't think people go around looking for the microscopic imperfections in people's face and body when we interact with them. However it's easy to see where additional hang ups come from when we're constantly presented with this fantasy version of people that most times isn't even humanly possible. I don't think we've developed technology to get rid of pores yet...   


It feels like something has to give and now with the attempts at AI generated art the impact could be greater. Posts and media with altered imagery or AI generated involving human beings should be labeled as such when done to extremes. Obviously it can't be for everything but dedicated media sites should be required to label their media that's been altered in this way as such.  


Please, change my view. Thanks - I may update this later if it has been changed. "

And up to now, and as of now, nearly every single one of those red lines has been crossed with no consequences at all. Germany, the UK and France have provided Taurus/SCALP/Storm Shadow long-range strike missiles. Some European allies have given warplanes to Ukraine. At the beginning of the war, Putin threatened that there would be [""consequences the like of which you have never before seen"" to any nation that assisted Ukraine](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russia-launches-attacks-ukraine-as-putin-warns-countries-who-interfere-consequences-you-have-never-seen) \- and, well, we've seen basically **no** consequences. The Russian red lines are so many that they're starting to resemble a lionfish.

Meanwhile, America itself has shown that its words are also empty and the opposite of what they mean, except in a different way. America has consistently said ""We won't send Abrams, we won't send F-16s, we won't send HIMARS"" - and now appears poised to send them all. And as of right now, it appears possible America will send ATACMS to Ukraine, something it long said it wouldn't.

Children are just too impressionable and naive to really differentiate right and wrong, and when they’re introduced to inappropriate content they may form harmful impressions about moral or ethical dilemmas. 
  
I was watching some YouTube videos about kids in impoverished communities and they were talking about guns, drugs, violence, and sexually explicit content. And I couldn’t help but just imagine a future where they wield guns, fornicate, and end up in a state of incarceration. 
  
Of course this isn’t exclusive to poor kids that were raised in these conditions. I’m sure there are many horrible people that lived in gated communities and had a “decent” upbringing. 
  
And it doesn’t really help my case that rates of incarceration and in many cases crime in these areas are going down substantially since the introduction of the internet. 

  
But still drug use and family unity are still problems which could probably still be systemically addressed by internet monitoring. Especially music. The content in music is becoming increasingly degenerate, and almost every study has demonstrated that music can and does affect behavior"

Delaware allows people with concealed carry permits to posses guns on school property and  Utah allows school staff to carry guns if they have a concealed carry permit.

I think ideally, only private schools should allow non law enforcement adults to carry weapons on campus. Why? Because people choose out of their own volition to send their kids to a private school or to apply to and attend a private school themselves. So, if a private school and their students/parents agree to let teachers and staff carry weapons on campus in compliance with local and state law, I don’t see an issue with them doing that.

However, public schools are a different story. Many people either attend or send their children to public school because it might be their only option because of how poor they are, or because the tuition is affordable and the school is close to home. Teachers shouldn’t be carrying guns at a public school if the parents or students didn’t consent to that.

Of course there are times where the victim is at no fault and no blame should be laid upon them.

There are however cases where I do not think it’s inappropriate to blame a victim for the outcome. If you are a functioning adult and you put yourself in a stupid situation that produced a horrible outcome, I think some blame should be put on you.

For example, you go out with some friends and you let one of your drunk friend drive you home. Then let’s say they have an accident, you get ejected (because you weren’t wearing a seatbelt)from the car and now you can’t walk. That sucks but you being in your current predicament is partially your fault. 

If you go on a website that’s selling OLED TVs, the new iPhone and speakers 85% cheaper than anywhere else and is offering 0% financing for 2 years… and you buy into that. When your identity is stolen, you are to blame. Yes you are a victim of a crime but blame does partially rest with you.

I'm aware that the fearmongering over trans people hurting women and children. Which is why I base my arguments on actual statistics.

Gay and bisexual men are disproportionately likely to get STIs. They were responsible for 43% of syphilis cases in 2020 (source: CDC) and have, since its origin, been the primary sources of HIV transmission. This is because most of them are sex addicts, and have disgusting fetishes involving fecal matter and other parts of the body that should be left alone. So much for love is love, I guess?

They are overwhelmingly rapists. 99% of rape against men is committed by men. That means gay men have the highest rates of rape of **any subgroup of men**. Just anecdotally, I've known many gay men who told me they fantasized about raping straight men like me. I'd wager the overwhelming majority of gay men at least have the desire to rape, even if they haven't done it themselves.

And as a straight man, it's become impossible for me to form close friendships with other men anymore. Any time two men share a bond on TV, bam! They're suddenly gay. It's so restricting to normal men and a big part of why male loneliness is so high - because of the normalization of homosexuality, any close male friendship becomes gay. 

Meanwhile all this shit gets tossed onto lesbians and trans people because they happen to be in the same ""community"". The greatest possible boon for trans rights would be cutting gay men out of the queer community entirely. Can you imagine how much more accepting society would be of queer rights if it wasn't represented by naked men performing sexual acts in front of children? 

The correct thing to do is for society to stigmatize men having sex with other men. I believe two women can be just as good at marriage as a man and a woman, but the same is simply not true of men. By supporting this delusion we are putting straight men, children, and the queer community in danger."

If another collective group of humans or aliens or AI or whatever were to emerge and dominate us, we’d agree that it would still hurt to be put in factory farms and slaughtered no matter how submissive we are.

It would be especially awful if we found out that the dominant group in question didn’t need to be treating us this terribly and had alternatives that were way less painful but they just didn’t sell as well.

Wouldn’t that kind of suck?

Things that can change my mind:
1. Scientific evidence that animals don’t feel pain, bonus points if science discovers that they’re actually all born as suicidal masochists who are just begging for death.
2. Evidence that the average human in a first-world country couldn’t survive happily on a plant-based (or mostly plant-based) diet in a world where animal products were exceptionally rare and expensive.
3. Evidence that everyone chooses the way they were born and so it isn’t an accident that you happen to be the one eating or being eaten.
4. If it’s a species thing, please provide evidence that, after death, all the bits and pieces of you that are broken down choose to only ever be reused in human bodies and nowhere else.
5. If you don’t think that “you” can be broken down into your component pieces of matter, please describe evidence for the other thing that really is “you” and provide evidence for where it came from and where it will go after you die.

However, a core pillar of science that becomes more and more apparent the more advanced you get into any particular field, but especially the hard science is that you can't REALLY prove anything about reality. We can only know that some specific theories seem to hold up with expierment and observation very well, so far, but in the future it is probable that new technologies and new experiments prove those theories wrong. Such as with quantum mechanics. 

To have this idea in your head, to truly have this idea in your head, requires a very strong ability of skepticism. That is what religion is fundamentally incompatible with. For a mind to identify with a religion strongly enough to be religious, they have to fundamentally lack this radical skepiticism and logical rigor that makes science work and allows boundaries to be pushed. 

Essentially to believe in something so strongly so as to identify religious, full well knowing all the uncertainties and alternate possibilities, is to not be a true scientist. A true scientist is to be rigorous and skeptical to a fault, not belief from personal experience, or deference to an authority. 

This is where you get folks who will use such phrasing as ""the studies suggest..."" when the studies do not suggest, they simply are, it is the people making assumptions based on a result that are doing the suggesting.

I recognize the face-value contradiction between this fact and my CMV. 

As someone whose family is from Central America, I know first-hand the plague that gang violence causes in these countries. In absolute terms, the achievements in cleaning up gang activity in El Salvador has been truly incredible. It would have been inconceivable five years ago that it would get to this place where people can breathe freely and go about their lives without fear (and it remains inconceivable in neighbor countries that such a thing would be possible). There is no denying this. It really can’t be overstated how radical a change this has been in Salvadoran society. 

There is also no denying that his whole popularity comes from his handling of the issue. The problem is that it has not been done in a sustainable way, and is rife with horrific civil/human rights implications and trapdoors, and was only achieved through despotic means, which Bukele seems to relish even outside the context of the gang issue. He has systematically ripped apart every barrier to his own power, across the government, and there is no reason to believe he has any intention of giving any of it back, or administering the state as a democracy. 

The main mechanism by which he’s been able to achieve this is through a “state of exception”, which has suspended El Salvador’s constitutional protections. This way, the state is allowed to round people up and put them in jail indefinitely without trial. 

Not a **single** one of the tens of thousands of people who have been swept up in this campaign have had a trial. Not one of them has been found guilty or declared innocent. 

There has long been a mounting pile of testimony from families claiming their innocent relatives are being rounded up arbitrarily and thrown into prison. There is no due process anywhere here, suspicion from a street cop or soldier is all it takes for someone to go to prison indefinitely. Bukele dismisses these claims by saying that “gang members have mothers too”. 

It is hard to see a situation where the innocent people in prison will be released, even after the state of exception is lifted (whenever that is), as they would have to release real criminals for the same reasons. 

Beyond the gang issue, Bukele has consolidated virtually the entire power of the Salvadoran government and rules with near absolute authority. He brought soldiers into congress to intimidate lawmakers into voting his way on a bill, he has systematically attacked the press critical to him, his administration has already come under many accusations of cronyism and corruption, he’s taking every cue out of the authoritarian’s playbook. 

The fact that he has used that power to fix perhaps the main problem in Salvadoran society, but it will come at a great cost down the line. 

The history of Latin America is riddled with popular leaders - Castro, Chavez, Ortega etc. -  that go into office fighting something that the wider population is against (which has in the past tended to be some downstream of US interference, but in this case it is gangs), gain popularity, grab power, and never let it go, to the profound detriment of society in the ensuing decades.

At least the other sex crimes involves potential discomfort or annoyance to humans. I actually can't even fathom how evil someone would have to be to ruin because some  a human being's life because some sheep was inconvenienced, that's one of the most purely evil ideologies I could even try to fathom.

 It also occured to me that if I was the farmer and I heard noise in the barn and knew that someone had broken in, and then I saw this, my first reaction would be relief, and that this is actually the **best possible outcome** for why he's in the barn, every other is worse. ""Oh, he's not here to steal my cattle, he's not some weirdo PETA freak trying to set them free, he's not hiding out with a gun to ambush me, he's not going to hurt anyone, he's just a weirdo, let's tell him to move along and find some other place to do this to, or better yet, see if he'll pay me for the privilege of coming here now and again for this, good money-making opportunity."" Again it's just so not a big deal, at all, other than the fact that he broke onto my property. And it strikes me again that if he was in the barn for any other, far worse reason (to be a PETA freak, to steal the livestock, etc) his punishment would be far less.

I also don't really believe in statutory rape laws. You don't get visited by some ""consent fairy"" on the night of your 18th birthday. I don't think the government has any authority to tell someone 'we know you consented, but actually, we say you didn't consent."" That's not how consent works. 

I also think that most victims of so-called sex crimes weren't really taking precautions to avoid it. It's not like most of these women really value their body. Why should the law? ""rape"" has this super serious connotation because we used to live in a serious society where women valued purity and got married young and stayed married for life. Clearly the damage is far less when some woman is going to all sorts of degenerate bars and screwing tons of men and then one fails her game of red light, green light, or her BAC level is too high and he failed to be a mind-reader and know that.

I got a credit card when I was 18. I was irresponsible with it,  and have been building my credit ever since. But I have never missed or been late with rent. I'm looking for a new place now, and everywhere requires a credit check. I think it's unfair.

Ethics:

Animals can feel pain, and it's cruel to cause more pain and suffering than absolutely necessary. No argument from me there. But vegans often seem to conflate death with suffering, which makes no sense to me. If you believe animals have souls and an afterlife, then death is a nonissue. If you are a materialist, then suffering is impossible because no entity exists to suffer. There exist plenty of means of killing that don't involve pain and suffering. We could just use inert gas asphyxiation in a non-stressful environment and they would all pass out and die without realizing anything is even amiss.

And if death without pain is bad, that suggests a belief that existence is preferable to non-existence. The vast majority of animals raised for food only exist for that purpose. How is a painless death worse than never existing in the first place?

It's possible to raise animals without causing to suffer. Just ask anyone who's raised happy backyard chickens for eggs.

So from the ethical perspective, it seems like vegans should be arguing to end cruel factory farming and slaughter practices rather than eliminating animal products entirely.

This argument can even be extended to wild-harvested meat. In this case there is no question of ethical husbandry, since the animals generally live their lives according to nature. And admittedly it's much harder to provide a death free of suffering for a wild animal. The relevant question though isn't whether the animal experienced any suffering at the moment of death, it's whether the animal's death was *more* painful or stressful than their natural death would have been. 

It's pretty rare for animals to comfortably die of old age in their sleep. The realistic options are starvation, disease or predation. I'd certainly rather be shot in the head than eaten alive by a komodo dragon or starving to death during a cold winter.

Health:

Vegan and vegetarian arguments about health always rely on the [Motte and Bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy) sleight of hand that conflates the effects of eating red meat with all meat consumption. The reality is that [fish](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25969396/) and [poultry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33672599/) consumption is quite healthy and linked to reduction in all cause mortality.

>Compared with never consumers, consumption of 60 g of fish per day was associated with a 12% reduction (RR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.93) in risk of total death.

>When comparing the highest versus the lowest consumption of white meat, the pooled OR and pertinent 95% CI were 0.94 (0.90, 0.97, p < 0.001) for all-cause mortality, 0.95 (0.89, 1.01, p = 0.13) for CV mortality, and 0.99 (0.95, 1.02, p = 0.48) for non-fatal CV events. In conclusion, the study shows for the first time a robust and inverse association between white meat consumption and all-cause mortality and a neutral association with CV mortality and morbidity. This highlights the importance of differentiating the meat types for what concerns their health effects and suggests that white meat might be a healthier alternative to read and processed meat consumption.

So the vegan health argument should actually be ""don't eat red meat"".

Environment:

This is the strongest argument, but even here the absolutism is what kills it. Much like the health argument, most of the ammunition disappears when red meat is removed from the equation. I'm not arguing that our current agricultural system is environmentally viable, but in a healthy agricultural system animal husbandry can *increase* the efficiency and sustainability of a practice through easier recycling of nutrients and better usage of marginal land unsuitable for agricultural production. 

Thing's like [chicken tractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_tractor) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics) can dramatically improve yields and reduce labor and material inputs in sustainable agricultural systems. 

So the vegan environmental argument should be ""animal husbandry should be done sustainably"".

You may be tempted to object that moving to a truly sustainable and ethical agricultural system would make animal products far more expensive, and therefore isn't politically feasible. It is a tall order, but it certainly seems *more* feasible than convincing everyone to give up meat entirely.

tl;dr the stated justifications for encouraging widespread adoption of veganism would be better met through eliminating red meat and moving to a more sustainable and ethical animal husbandry system than eliminating animal products entirely."

There is a heavy focus on forcing these sites to censor and police themselves and there is a typical chant of ""what about the children"" not far behind it.

Instagram in particular has been accused of causing a lot of teens to develop body image issues. 

But IMO the main issue here isn't the content, but the parents letting their kids be exposed to it. How hard is it to tell your child that they're only allowed to use social media 1 hour a day or to keep track of what your kid is seeing.

Parents from my generation didn't let young girls read nothing but Cosmo for hours on end every night. I mean I'm sure some did, but nowhere near as many who let kids scroll Instagram's for hours every night. 

Even if these kids are exposed to these images I think it's parents responsibility to be having frank and educational talks with their kids about what is and isn't realistic. Not just telling them they have a normal body figure but actively educating them about nutrition and pushing back on perceived narratives they might be exposed to on social media. "

So this either requires a Constitutional amendment, or we just temporarily ignore the Constitution for now.

Generally, in society, the higher the stakes of a position, the more we demand of the people who fill that role. We don't let just anyone be a brain surgeon, for instance; we demand that such surgeons undergo tremendous schooling and pass rigorous tests. We don't let just anyone become an airline pilot; they have to pass tough FAA medical clearances and have 1,500+ flight hours.

But as it currently is, almost any American can be a U.S. presidential candidate. This has led to horrendous outcomes, such as 2016 - we can clearly see the terrible damage that a buffoon like Trump had, leading the nation. Literally the only three requirements to be eligible to be a U.S. presidential candidate are 14 years of residency in America, being American-born, and being 35 years old.

Now, of course, Trump was a one-time event; it's not likely that someone like him would get elected again. But as it stands, even horrid politicians like Marjorie-Taylor-Greene, Matt Gaetz, etc. would be eligible to run for president if they wanted to. On top of that, even someone who has serious age-related cognitive difficulties, like McConnell, Pelosi, or Feinstein, would be eligible to run.

Given that the U.S. presidency is, quite possibly, **the** most important and high-stakes job on all of Planet Earth, why do we let people who are of terrible quality run for it? We would never trust a brain surgeon who'd never passed any exams and had a track record of killing his patients by accident, would we?

I propose something along the lines of the following - requirements that someone must meet in order to get on the ballot - similar to a job description on a hiring board:

&#x200B;

* A presidential candidate must be able to test in the 95th percentile or higher on a standardized exam, such as the GRE or GMAT, and also have a demonstrable IQ of 120 or higher, on a psychologist-accepted cognitive test, such as Stanford-Binet, Wechsler, Woodcock-Johnson or Cattell.
* A presidential candidate must be able to pass the same rigorous SSBI background check of anyone who has Top Secret clearance, given that the president sees the most classified information in the world.
* A presidential candidate must have at least 10 years of cumulative experience in government, the military, medicine, education, engineering, or a similar field.
* A presidential candidate should have a master's degree at the minimum, from a regionally-accredited university.
* A presidential candidate must be no older than 70.
* A presidential candidate must pass a rigorous physical and psychiatric examination, administered by an independent panel of physicians - furthermore, such an examination must be passed anew *every year* that he is in office, if elected.
* A presidential candidate should be required to have spent several years working in a 'menial' position such as retail, fast food, sanitation work or whatnot, in order to enable him to identify better with down-to-earth struggles.
* Fluency in a second language is highly desirable, but not mandatory.
* Along with this, the other requirements still apply: a presidential candidate must be at least 35, American-born, and have spent 14 years on American soil.

&#x200B;

In a nation of 330 million people, the Republican and Democratic parties would still surely be capable of producing at least a few hundred candidates who meet all such requirements - and they only need one, at the end of the day, to be the party's presidential candidate for an election.

I told him multiple times to sit still, and he said he was, but the toilet just kept flushing like crazy. I've had unnecessary flushing happen to me as well most times that I've had to poop on a motion sensing toilet. The result is a waste of natural resources (literally flushing drinking water down the drain), and it's also just an unpleasant experience for poopers.

I don't see the need for motion sensing toilets. I only see two potential benefits: 

1) They can potentially prevent spreading germs... but aren't we all washing our hands afterwards anyways? I guess not everyone washes their hands, but those people are going to have dirty hands whether or not they touch the toilet to flush.

Also, there are other alternatives that would work better to allow you to flush without touching the toilet, eg. some toilets are flushed with a foot pedal. 

2) They prevent toilets from going unflushed. I do recognize that motion sensors do a good job of preventing this from happening, but to me the benefit doesn't outweigh the environmental harm of unnecessary flushing. There's no great harm being done when somebody fails to flush. The next person has to flush for them. Big deal. Maybe there's some extra smell in the bathroom, or some skid marks in the toilet bowl. Not a worse experience than having a toilet flush unexpectedly beneath your bare ass.

Even if automatic flushing were superior in some way, certainly it could be better implemented than these motion sensors. There could be a simple sensor on the stall door that flushes the toilet when the door is unlocked.

Moving on to the sink, I also think motion sensing taps are inferior to foot pedals. Foot pedals have been successfully used in hospital sinks for a long time now. It's a simple technology that just works. 

The only item that really needs to be motion sensing is the towel dispenser, so you don't have to touch anything after you've washed your hands. Except you'll probably end up touching the door handle anyways, because even the fanciest bathrooms with all this useless motion sensing technology have not figured out the door problem. I'm still in favour of motion-sensing dispensers, but I don't think there's much point in installing those if you're not going to also design the exit so that you can leave without touching the door handle."
1,2023-09-21,CMV: Oscar Issacs's character in the new Spiderman movie is morally correct,u/Raspint,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16os7ne/cmv_oscar_issacss_character_in_the_new_spiderman/,changemyview,"First off, spoilers for 'Across the Spiderverse,' and I'll be assuming that you are familiar with the film as I discuss it. And second off, what a fantastic movie. 

Anyway, it seems that not only miles, but the filmmakers of 'Across' seem to think that Miguel O'Hara is mistaken. He's filmed as a big, scary angry man, and not only does Miles disagree with him, but so do does Gwen and all the gang from the the first movie decide to go help Miles (Penny, Nicholas Cage, Peter, etc). And there's a scene where Miguel says  'We are the good guys' however it really came across that he was trying to convince himself.

But think about what Miguel is actually trying to do, and what his argument for it is:

1) He's trying to let Captain Morales die, and prevent Miles from saving his father.

2) He's doing the above because if Miles does save  his dear old dad, than *everyone in Mile's dimension will die*.

Now let's look at Miles:

A) He's trying to save his father from being murdered by spot.

Okay, understandable, but what will happen if he does that? Well, as far as we know, this will happen:

B) If Captain Morales doesn't die, every single person in that world (Captain Morales included) will die, with the possibility that this will destabilize the multiverse and possibly kill an unfathomable number of people.

Yes I know about that silly loophole they are setting up, with the whole giving up the cop job as a lawyer like way to get out of the canon event. But the problem is that **Miles has no idea about this possibility**. Gwen is the one who happens upon this, not Miles. Right now, Miles's plan is simply:

""Save my Dad and then prevent the death of everyone in my dimension through... hope? The power of friendship?""

Like, if you're going to do something that could potentially kill every person in the universe, you should have at least a pretty good idea of how you are going to prevent that outcome.

As of right now, Miles Morales is being reckless, emotional-driven and extremely selfish. But Miguel is supposed to be in the wrong here? Because Miguel has seen two examples (his own timeline, and the one with Pavitr Prabhakar) the enormous  danger of disrupting a canon event. The worst thing that Miguel does is he's a dick about it after Miles starts showing off how goddamn selfish he is going to be.

But if you are trying to prevent someone from letting their own selfish desires put an unfathomable amount of human lives at risk, loosing your cool by just yelling at someone and saying mean things to them, is not a big deal.

Yes, I know that in the sequel they will find some way to make everything work out and Miles will save his dad and make everything okay because it is a movie. But my point is that *right now*, given the available info to Miles, he is being incredibly dangerous and selfish in a way that is so heinous he could easily be framed as a villain if you just switched your perspective. 

Because this isn't even a trolly problem. It's:

A) Either one person dies

or

B) The train kills every single other person plus the person from case A anyway."

Several states are removing more and more disability rights from those who are homeless, mentally ill, or suicidal. People get can get all rights stripped away without having committed any crimes, left with fewer rights than prisoners in many ways.

Cops go around assaulting and killing people without warrants or for minor offenses, and rarely get any justice against them because ""it's their job.""

The economy is in a horrible state and most of my generation has trouble finding decent work.

Half of my generation has or had mental health issues, and the expansion of forced interventions is making things so much worse, which they are incentivized to do when they can use force. Suicide attempts and completions are increasing in large part because of these attacks on human dignity.

Many people are in jail for things that aren't violent nor do they involve grand theft. Many innocent people get their lives destroyed waiting for trial for long periods of time. The prisons are often abusive too, though they vary a lot.

Professions like prostitution are banned to keep people in a subservient position to corporations.

The economy and real estate are regulated and managed so poorly in several states that we have a homelessness crisis. Healthcare is expensive and inaccessible, and treating oneself by buying the drugs is usually criminalized.

Our rights are being stampeded and so many people are miserable. Addiction and overdose are killing many people. The people struggling the most are turning to drugs or killing themselves instead of getting help to avoid the series of human rights abuses that may await them."

In lots of music discussions in person and online, I see some version of the sentiment that caring about what genre some artist or album is in is just hairsplitting and gets in the way of actually enjoying the music.

I think genres serve a very useful purpose that is directly related to enjoying music: they help us find more stuff like the stuff we already like. And the more fine-tuned and hairsplitting the genre distinctions are, the more specifically we can seek out music that aligns with our taste. Why ask for ""metal"" recommendations or even ""thrash metal"" recommendations when I can ask for ""blackened thrash metal"" recommendations? Of course, the broader categories are still there too if that's good enough, and no one is obligated to use or care about the very specific categories if they don't want to. I'd argue, though, that people who just don't care about genres at all are losing out on a helpful tool (if they care about discovering new music, which they may well not, and fair enough).

I think genres remain useful even if there wind up being disagreements over how exactly to describe genres and exactly what artists or albums belong under which genre; there will generally end up being *broad* agreement among fans and scholars of whatever genre (which is who it makes sense to defer to with regard to the specifics of genres anyway). If there are edge cases like bands that genuinely can't be categorized in terms of single genres, that's fine too, because they can almost always be categorized in terms of *some* intersection of genres -- and even if they can't, the existence of extreme outliers doesn't render the whole genre system useless.

(This argument probably applies to film, games, and so on as well, but maybe in different ways, so for simplicity's sake I'd prefer to keep the discussion to music)."

every county learns from one another to develop their own tastes and customs, sure hamburgers may have started in Germany, and that of course establishes that they originate in Germany. But it doesn’t diminish the fact that a hamburger is an American food and that america can be considered its own league of hamburgers because of all the contributions it has made to it. It’s a core part of Americas idenity, yes the internet did not start in America (if you don’t believe that the cia started it all) but why would that make a difference when a child says the internet is American? It is. by several various measures. and where it originated doesn’t change or finish the internet is really American. Have you ever seen how many people use American slang online? Do you even see anyone from Hamburg Germany eating the original burger vs how many people you see there eating McDonald’s?

so therefore. When someone is asked to name an american food. And they say hamburger. They are committing a righteous deed. And enemies of freedom be damned

&#x200B;

for disclaimer purposes i wanted to say that i am one who believes Edward Snowden is a brainwashed sleeper cell double agent for the Russian federation who is carrying out orders he doesn’t realize. He started doing his nsa leaks around the same time trump started talking about Obama birth certificate and the Russian spy ring being caught. Meaning Russia activated a lot of people and he was one of them

&#x200B;

Anyways. That being said. Let’s go with the evidence. even if edward Snowden is not a Russian agent, if a Russian agent got control of all of that nsa data, that’s what they would do. They would make sure to mention how america has mass surveillance and then they would ask the russian president if they do the same thing and the Russian president would have a chance to play PR. That’s what Edward Snowden did. several members of German intelligence including the head of their foreign intelligence services says Edward Snowden is a double agent of Russia who was used as part of a way to create splits in the western alliance (this is exactly what christopher Steele says about trump btw) . He said its really crazy that Edward Snowden knew in detail the spying programs of the Russian federation and the Chinese government and yet he exclusively focused on the United States and the west and then fled to countries that do the same thing. When Edward Snowden asked vladimir Putin if Russia does the same thing, it was like watching trump call Putin strong and powerful as he said the fbi was full of shit, it was highly disturbing and really batshit crazy even for a Snowden fan to say there was anything acceptable about that. Because Edward Snowden himself says he profoundly regrets it, giving evidence to my claim i think he was brainwashed by Russian intel and both sincerely believes putin is a saint and hes a dirty spying f\*\*\* just like everyone else . Russia has been clear they had alot of phone calls from the Boston bombers and that is evidence they have beyond what the nsa has. Which is actual recorded conversations of people and not just metadata 

&#x200B;

I know on the surface it may seem it did alot of good. Because intelligence services Do evil stuff. And the media covers up a lot for them. but Those are the people that in part defend us from people like Russia, nsa and cia spying is part of what allowed us to know the Russians were full of shit (like they were when they said they dont spy on people) when they said they aren’t planning to invade Ukraine. Even ukraines president was caught off guard by it all, there are times where they are a force for good. And Edward Snowden gives in to this idea that. Well. They are evil and countries like Russia are somehow following the values his claiming to project. I think in the very First video he makes with Laura whatever and Glenn greenwald ( i think another brainwashed agent) he says he “doesn’t want to live in a country that does these types of things) and then he goes to Russia. Where they torture and blackmail hackers to join their cyber campaigns, including one where they apparently hold kompromat over a lot of people. How did they get all of that? By being innocent babes in the wood like Putin suggests? I don’t know what Edward Snowden fans see. All i see is a guy who said that and then swore allegiance to their country after the 2016 election attack and after their head of state told James Mattis to his face in march of 2017 that in the future, russia is going to take the baltics, and if the United States aims to stop them they will use tactical nuclear weapons against the us to keep us out of the way 

&#x200B;

lets measure all the ways Snowdens leaks benifited society. Their are deeper splits in the nato alliance, nsa moral is dramatically lower than what it was then, Edward Snowden hinted that the 2016 vote count was changed and could be proven through a forensic analysis of the voting machines which was never done, Edward Snowden is now a Russian citizen whom never faced a u.s. judge, Donald trump another person who swears he did not give any classified information to Russia even though all the stars line up for my opening paragraph, has amplified all of the underlying points edward Snowden and Glenn greenwald and Kim Dotcom and russia today all make. That the united States is a nation run by a secretive deep state government who is so deep state and secretive they apparatnly cannot keep classfied nuclear secrets from Donald trump

&#x200B;

i don’t know if Edward Snowden is a Russian spy. When people like Glenn greenwald and Julian assange (notice how all these people seem to be connected?) say there’s no evidence snowden gave Russia classified info or is a Russian spy. I think there’s a reason why they smile when they do that. I think they know there’s evidence the nsa cant really disclose or otherwise it amplifies all of their aims. Which is to bring down America by bringing this all to light but in a way that’s really skewed. So people take away a perception of anti Americanism rather than an unbiased holistic view of the world’s evil. It unsettles the shit out of me to think Edward Snowden swore an allegiance to a country that uses its spying capabilities to launch attacks on us. James Comey is correct when he calls this intelligence porn, leaks with no regard to long term consequences for our nation. This didn’t help our image, poisoned our national security, and largely played into all of the people the nsa is created to defend against. Like …well Russia. Who is beyond a geo political threat. they are now a threat to our very existence

The first reason to avoid wearing skirts and dresses is that there is great potential for humiliation.  What if a gust of wind blows and your underwear is exposed?  Tripping or falling could also cause your underwear to be exposed.

Secondly, females are more vulnerable to sexual assault when wearing skirts and dresses.  All someone has to do is use a shoe video camera to record private parts or just use their hands to lift the skirt or dress bottom.

Thirdly, if a menstruating woman has blood or any other fluid dripping down her thighs and legs, a pair of pants would conceal that better than a skirt or dress.

Lastly, wedgies are more obvious if one is wearing a skirt or dress.

Thanks."

Don’t forget that dreads, straightening and/or braids have been a cultural and historical hairstyle in near every country in earth at some time in history.

Since someone will probably call me a “racist white person” who shouldn’t have an opinion like it’s 1960s segregation where you must “stick to your own race’s place”…

I feel like our society way over-punishes these acts.

So much of it seems to be societal, like one of the Masterson victims who ""found out they were raped"" years later, or this story I read where a 12 year old apparently messed around with his 11 year old brother and then years later as adults, the younger one says he ""came to the realization he was abused"" and now resents and won't talk to his younger brother. 

It seems clear to me so much of this is driven by society pounding home this message of ""here are all the 507 ways that something can technically be nonconsensual even if it was consensual, because of some power imbalance or age gap or maybe you thought you wanted it but really didn't or maybe he asked you too many times and your will was compromised when you said yes, and of course if that happened it's the absolute worst thing ever and we all have to totally freak out about it and upend our entire justice system and 'innocent until proven guilty' principles to put a stop to it!""

___________

There was recently the case where some flight attendant got arrested for hiding a phone in the bathroom to videotape some young girl. Honestly it just really dosn't matter that much to me. Sure, tell him ""hey buddy that's not cool, delete that,"" whatever. It's not some world-ending occasion. No one naturally gets traumatized by that, it's not a huge deal, people only do because society demands of them to be traumatized, like I explained above. The trauma seems to come more from society, not the act itself.

Same with people who go to prison and have the entire rest of their lives messed up from clicking some buttons behind a comptuer screen. You can watch ISIS execution videos all you want or watch videos of whatever other crimes you want, there's no such principle of ""if the act is illegal, then watching it is illegal because it drives demand and re-victimizes the victim over and over!"" No one takes this seriously when it comes to the much worse crimes or murder or robbery or something. But with sex stuff, again we need all these special rules.

Get more prison time and consequences for brushing some girl's breasts than you would for robbing a store, probably

Maybe even worst of all are bestiality charges, like some 18 year old I remember who had his life ruined because some farmer caught him with a video camera in his barn screwing his sheep. It occured to me that of his charges (bestiality, animal cruelty, breaking and entering), the ""breaking and entering"" charge was by far the most harmful thing he did and also what he'll be the least punished for because society is insane. At least the other sex crimes involves potential discomfort or annoyance to humans. I actually can't even fathom how evil someone would have to be to ruin a human being's life because some sheep was inconvenienced, that's one of the most purely evil ideologies I could even try to fathom. (Often the one condemning him won't even be a vegan - though if they are, that's even worse; less hypocrisy but more insanity. But that's a whole other tangent, how ""animal rights"" are absolutely vile and misanthropic as a concept and how liberals made them up from thin air 15 minutes ago and now our whole society is under this spell. Even if I *did* accept that some totally fictional 'right' exists for animals to not be seriously harmed except for food, one would have a lot of work to do convincing me that this act was all that harmful to a sheep.)

 It also occured to me that if I was the farmer and I heard noise in the barn and knew that someone had broken in, and then I saw this, my first reaction would be relief, and that this is actually the **best possible outcome** for why he's in the barn, every other is worse. ""Oh, he's not here to steal my cattle, he's not some sick PETA freak trying to set them free, he's not hiding out with a gun to ambush me, he's not going to hurt anyone, he's just a weirdo, let's tell him to move along and find some other place to do this to, or better yet, see if he'll pay me for the privilege of coming here now and again for this, good money-making opportunity."" (The sheep are literally there to be exploited and make me money after all, it's not like they have any rights - and this way is probably less harmful to them than the other ways I plan to make money off them, not that it matters because again they have 0 rights and their feelings are irrelevant). Again it's just so not a big deal, at all, other than the fact that he broke onto my property.  And it strikes me again that if he was in the barn for any other, far worse reason (to be a PETA freak, to steal the livestock, etc) his punishment would be far less.

I also don't really believe in statutory rape laws. You don't get visited by some ""consent fairy"" on the night of your 18th birthday. I don't think the government has any authority to tell someone 'we know you consented, but actually, we say you didn't consent."" That's not how consent works. 

I also think that most victims of so-called sex crimes weren't really taking precautions to avoid it. It's not like most of these women really value their body. Why should the law? ""rape"" has this super serious connotation because we used to live in a serious society where women valued purity and got married young and stayed married for life. Clearly the damage is far less when some woman is going to all sorts of degenerate bars and screwing tons of men and then one fails her game of red light, green light, or her BAC level is too high and he failed to be a mind-reader and know that. These people have invented a whole sick vocabulary (""victim blaming,"" etc) to discourage people from noting the obvious, but it didn't work on me I guess.

If some woman came to a police station I worked at to cry about how her latest hookup gave 10 thrusts when she only ""consented"" to 9.5, I would say ""Okay woman maybe you should, like, be married, like all your ancestors knew to do, turns out having a husband is good protection after all, I guess you're not the 'strong independent woman' you claim to be when you have to run to men with guns to cry about your problems with other men. That's not what we're for, that's what a husband is for'

___________________

All in all the logical conclusion to me of the sexual revolution is that society should just be way less serious about sex. It's not that big of a deal. Instead it worked the other way which is bizarre. ""Push weirdo behavior on city streets in parades to 5 year olds all you want, that will never have any negative side effects, but if you ever inconvenience a sheep, your life is over!"" Even statutory rape and CP penalties are way, way up, look at what they used to be even 30-50 years ago, the SCOTUS case that made CP illegal was about a law that was a misdemeanor, that would be inconceivable today. How is it that the sexual-liberation Leftists have simultaneously stripped away all traditional sexual inhibitions from the public square, hollywood, music industry, etc, while at the same time are way way more serious about the ""offenses"" against their ideology than the Conservatives ever were...it's just that their ""offenses"" are ""failing red light green light"" and all this nonsense.

Honestly it's I think a big part of what pushed me away from liberalism pretty far to the right. I still can't grasp their sexual ethics either fully but at least they're consistent - ""sex is for marriage and procreation, stop being weird, be normal and make kids and form loving lifelong unions with a woman."" I can at least understand that thesis. That's simple, that's logical, that governed our civilization for hundreds of years. 

""All sorts of absolutely bizarre stuff pervading every aspect of mainstream society is totally okay, but we arbitrarily pick these 10-12 things to still be taboo, invent a whole vocabulary to stop you noticing common-sense things about them, and ramp up the penalties for them 100x compared to what they were in the ""conservative"" '80,"" because we worship this ""consent"" god and define 'consent"" to have 500 exceptions and need to deconstruct all these ""rape myths', does not.

_______________

That's not to say that I have no sympathy for any ""sex crime"" victim. I can imagine being drugged and raped, or overcome with force as you're kicking and screaming minding your own business by some savage man, yeah, of course that's traumatizing. That's the imagery 'rape"" used to always bring up before modernity.

If it's not that, specifically, then I really just...don't care. Sorry. If it's not that I don't see really any of this as a big deal at all. No serious thinker of old (Thomas Aquinas etc) had all these words for ""sexual misconduct"" / ""sexual assault"" that liberals made up 15 minutes ago. There are things that are rape, and things that are not rape, and that's about it.

I feel like I must be wrong because both liberals and far-right conservatives would both find my position abhorrent, but yeah, I'm just not seeing it. Maybe you all can help me. CMV"

I bet the same can happen to mobile devices when playing a video game on cloud. Even playing it for hours would drain most of the battery in the same way any mobile game has had.

Don't get me started on internet lags and third-world countries unable to afford better internet.

Months since Google ended its cloud gaming service Stadia, I have barely seen news or hype about cloud gaming anymore. Of course, there are cloud gaming services from others, like Amazon and Microsoft.

However, I don't feel motivated into subscribing any cloud gaming service. I have played mobile games over and over, and I have had to charge my smartphones and tablets over and over.

Reception toward cloud gaming on mobile has been either [negative](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/4/23186659/phone-cloud-gaming-xbox-cloud-stadia-bad) or [mixed](https://www.tomsguide.com/features/5g-smartphone-gaming). Any of you can say that advanced technology would improve or resolve issues with cloud gaming on mobile, but I don't think most of casual gamers would want to buy an expensive device within the next 25 years from now just to have a better cloud gaming experience, especially when living in a third-world country.

If I wanna subscribe a gaming service, I'd rather go for Apple Arcade again... well, as an alternative to ""free2play"" games that provide micro-transaction fees. Apple Arcade isn't... Well, it doesn't have numerous AAA graphic-intense games, but at least Apple hasn't mismanaged Apple Arcade in the same way Google did to Stadia. (can't say whether Apple actually mismanaged or fumbled Apple Arcade, considering how popular... or not Arcade is.)

I just don't see how even technology advancement can make cloud gaming more appealing to mobile users in the same way it might to TV gamers (i.e. gamers who have connected consoles to TV to play games) and PC gamers (desktop and laptop)."

***However*** there are some kinks that should not be normalized and in my opinion should actually be shamed or at the bare minimum be discouraged.

DDLG for one; *DDLG, or DD/LG, is an acronym for daddy dom/little girl, a sexual relationship where the dominant male is the daddy figure and a woman plays the role of a young girl.*

The basic ""daddy"" & ""little girl/baby girl"" BDSM aspect with surrendering all your trust into the daddy or mommy depending on the relationship, is fine, as long as there is no actual age play.

As soon as age play comes into play, it changes everything.

Age play;  *a form of role playing in which an individual acts or treats another as if they were a different age, sexual or non-sexually.*

These are either men or women that pretend or take on the role of being a teen, child or even toddler. The *dom* then treats the *little* as a teen, child, toddler. They get punished and rewarded for their behavior.

Non sexually, i'm okay with this. But add the 2, and things are just a gateway to pedophilia or an excuse to live out pedophile fantasies.

Performing sexual acts with someone taking the image of a teen, child, toddler, clearly portraying that image and sometimes even referring their *little age* being 5, 7, 12, 14... ect, I for one have no idea how one can even be okay doing such acts towards a *little* without having pedophile tendencies.

What's the next step? Going after real children cause the pretending adults aren't satisfying enough?  
How does one even mentally find the desire to act out sexual deeds with someone being a toddler.

I see no difference between someone wanting to do these things to someone full on pretending to be a child and wanting to do them to an actual child. I see this as enabling the behavior instead of fixing the issues.

Help me change my views on these kinks or try to understand it more. Cause right now I find it **repulsive.**

1,2023-09-22,CMV: Gaap from the Black Episode Demon 79 is real,u/Krenztor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16p8b85/cmv_gaap_from_the_black_episode_demon_79_is_real/,changemyview,"Spoilers for Black Mirror season 6's episode Demon 79.  The only non-spoiler I have to offer is this episode is great!!!

\>!I've seen some debate as to whether the events at the end of Demon 79 actually occurred or were imagined by the main character, Nida.  I believe it all did occur and here is why.

**Evidence 1**: Gaap informs Nida that her first victim, Tim Simons, whom she has clearly never met before and ran into completely by dumb luck (or misfortune for Tim!), has a daughter that is 8 years old named Laura which turns out to be true.  Gaap also asserts that Tim sexually assaults Laura, but that is unconfirmed though the daughter doesn't seem too upset that her father went missing and is eventually found dead.

**Evidence 2**: Nida has visions of what Michael Smart will do in the future.  She sees him being expelled from the Tories, launching his own party, and has a vision of ""metal head"" robot dogs being used.  In the episode Loch Henry which takes place after Demon 79, it is confirmed that Smart gets expelled from the Tories, threatens to launch his own party, and unveils a robot dog to the police.

**Evidence 3 (minor stuff)**: She loses track of Keith after leaving the bar but quickly finds him when Gaap points him out and also realizes that she's being followed by the cop thanks to Gaap.  It is possible that her intuition could have helped her in either case and she might have chalked it up to Gaap when really she was doing it, but when she left the bar it was clear that she had no visual on Keith and she's getting drunk for the first time in her life so probably isn't at her peak mental capacity at the moment.  She also does correctly state that Keith did murder his wife which was widely suspected but not known for certain so minor plus to her there.

Just to address some counter points I have heard to suggest it was all imagined:

**Counter point 1**: Nida's mother was crazy so maybe it is genetic.

**Counter point 2**: She imagines hurting or killing people to start the episode which supports her going crazy and killing people later.

**Counter point 3**: She reads a book called Creative Visualization which could have influenced her wanting to imagine a way out of her problems.

**Counter point 4**: Michael Smart is still alive in Loch Henry. Since Black Mirror episodes all happen in one universe, how could he be alive in the future if the world ended?

Points 1, 2, and 3 all try to plant the seed of doubt, but they are pretty weak even when taken together.  What percentage of people have a family history of mental illness, imagines bad things that they'd like to do, and ingests entertainment or information that might encourage them to imagine a better future for themselves.  Might not be the majority of people, but I'd be surprised if it is less than 1% of people that would meet all these criteria.  Not an open and closed case simply based on this though we do need some strong evidence to the contrary.

Compare counter points 1, 2, and 3 again just evidence piece #1:

\--Guessing the guy had a kid at all (about 50% chance of getting it right)

\--Guessing the kid's gender (50%)

\--Guessing the kid's age (maybe 10%)

\--Guessing the kid's name is Laura (about 0.05%)

Add it all up and that is about 1 in 100,000.  Practically astronomical odds just getting through that piece of evidence.

Evidence #2 is harder to calculate, but Nida would have to guess that the politician Michael Smart will even be successful enough that he'd remain in politics for decades which is low odds by itself given how many lose elections compared to win multiple elections, then guess that he'd be kicked out of their party which I don't think happens very often at all even in British politics, then guess that they'll at least threaten to create a new party, and then be involved in a very, very specific piece of technology that won't be invented for decades.  The odds of #2 correct are probably even worse than the odds of getting #1 right, but say the odds are the same at 1 in 100,000.  The odds of getting both right in sequence is about 1 in 10 billion.

The only thing I could see standing in the way of Gaap being real is counter point #4 which would be the strongest point if we assume the world actually did end but that seems to have already been explained by the show's creator.

Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker said: ""Demon 79 opens with a 'Red Mirror presents' title sequence, marking it out as 'different-from-yet-adjacent-to' Black Mirror.""

I think this completely negates #4 since Michael Smart lives on in Black Mirror but died in Red Mirror.

The final thing I want to address is to give my view on the newspaper articles to anyone who wants to discuss those.  They mention May Day, three murders, and a guy (Geoffrey Possett) who became a crime fighter, all things that are involved in Nida's quest.

I don't think these articles can provide positive or negative evidence for either side because it is pure speculation what they mean.

**Argument that articles prove Gaap is real**: Geoffrey is shown to suddenly become interested in local crime, keeps three articles about people who died which he theoretically could have done himself, and then a celebration on May Day which happens to be just days away for Nida.  Seems like this suggests Geoffrey was affected by the talisman and demon curse in the same was as Nida and that May Day is significant.

**Argument that articles prove hallucination**: It could be that these articles really are just randomly sitting around here allowing Nida's mind concocts some way to link all of them together in such a way that gives credence to the talisman and demon curse being real.

Either is possible.  We don't know if Geoffrey was the person who clipped the articles and even if he was, did he commit those murders?  If he did, then it really makes the talisman argument much stronger.  If we knew for sure Geoffrey didn't collect these articles and they are just there by random chance, that gives more credence to the hallucination argument.  There just isn't enough info to make a determination here as far as I can tell.

In conclusion, given all of the evidence, I think Gaap has to be real.  He's never shown to be incorrect in any of his seemingly wild assertions and is correct on things that would be essentially unknowable.!<"

1,2023-09-22,CMV: Cars should have forced cruise control on the highway whether or not we have self-driving cars.,u/myersdr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16p8j24/cmv_cars_should_have_forced_cruise_control_on_the/,changemyview,"First a highway in this scenario is any federal interstate highway, i.e., I-80 or I-95 (only roads like this).  Let me define what I mean by forced cruise control.  Your car enters the highway, a gps device in the vehicle identifies that you are now on the highway and forces the car into cruise control.  The cruise control I specifically refer to is the adaptive cruise in most new cars.  Adaptive cruise, controls speed and distance to the vehicle in front of you.  It will hold the speed to that of the vehicle in front of you until you change lanes or the car in front changes lanes.  For example, if you have the cruise set to 65 and the car in front is going 60, your car slows down and holds that speed and the predetermined distance.  Speed can still be controlled via the buttons on the wheel.  What this alleviates is people not paying attention to their speed and unintentionally slowing down or speeding up.  At constant speed whether slow or fast the cars will still be moving and prevent traffic jams from inch worming along.  This would take time to implement but so is the self-driving car issue.

Counter argument points I can think of:

**What if a slower vehicle is in the left lane?**  The technology can include a speed range for the lane you are in based on GPS position or indicators in the lane that tell the car what lane you are traveling in.  Therefore if you are in the far left lane, you can only change the vehicle speed to a set range, like 65-70mph.  The middle lane is set to 60-65; the right lane is set to 45-60.  A larger change in speed is set for exiting and entering traffic.  If the highway drops to two lanes or increases to more than three, the ranges can be set for those.

**Construction sites and accidents?**  Police can have limiters that automatically force cruise control into slower ranges of speed before the slow down and then give control back after the slow down.

**What about hacking the vehicle speed or abuse by law enforcement?**  This will inevitably become an issue when we have more self-driving vehicles.  Either we learn how to secure against attacks now as we progress or deal with it later.  Either way, that will always be a problem with technology.

Braking is still an option but once you stop braking the vehicle returns to a predetermined speed.

**What if a person wants to drive over the speed limit anyway?**  If and when we have self driving cars they will only be able to drive as fast as we currently do.  The reason is physics, it doesn't matter if we are driving or the car drives itself.  The amount of force at certain speeds can and will cause a vehicle to lose control no matter who is in control.  Ideally a self driving car will adjust the speed as necessary to prevent losing control but they still will only be able to go so fast.  Even if they got up to 100mph on a straightaway, the car would have to drastically slow down to maneuver through a turn.  And I don't think anyone would enjoy that kind of ride.

Putting these kinds of measures in place will allow people adequate time to get used to the idea of self driving cars and give authorities and technology companies the data needed to implement the technology.  In the meantime people who start to become complacent to their speed will not cause delays in traffic because they will be forced to continue at a constant speed or risk burning the brakes up.

&#x200B;

Edit: Interesting points of view but I can already see nobody is going  to like self-driving cars."
1,2023-09-22,CMV: US Immigration policy is a total shitshow,u/solishu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16p8ny1/cmv_us_immigration_policy_is_a_total_shitshow/,changemyview,"I’m the definition of an immigration dove — I love immigrants. I love seeing the varied cultures people bring with them and learning about the values that people of those cultures bring with them. I love hearing the different inflections in the voices of immigrants. I love being able to access foods of dozens of countries in my community. I love the idea that my country could be so great that people uproot their entire lives and those of their families to come here and start over and improve their well-being. 

There are also numerous objective benefits immigrants bring to the USA. I remember one of my college history professors saying that one of the major reasons that the US didn’t undergo a revolution or major social upheaval in the 30’s was the large immigrant population. Our national unemployment is roughly non-existent and our companies need people to work jobs to continue to grow and prosper. If there was ever a time in the last century to have a generous, functional, effective immigration policy, this is it.

Which is not what we have right now. What we have is a total free-for-all at the border, that ultimately serves neither the immigrants hoping to establish a new, better, life in the USA, nor the country as a whole. Let’s start with basic questions of security:

Our federal agencies have very limited operational control of the border. People constantly cross between ports of entry. It’s widely known among federal agencies that cartel operators funnel migrants to mass and cross at particular locations in order to occupy Border Patrol, so they can smuggle contraband in the vacated crossings. The shear mass of numbers of migrants crossing overwhelm the ability of Border Patrol to vet them, allowing only the most cursory of background checks, which will completely miss any criminality in their home country. And this is only for the migrants who surrender themselves/are caught by Border Patrol. Some of the contraband that the cartels smuggle over are human beings who, for one reason or another, want to stay off of the federal government’s radar.

The way most of these migrants are hoping to normalize their status in the United States is the asylum process. Many of them are unaware that at best this is a temporary patch on a system that will eventually leave them in legal limbo. It is easy to claim asylum, but not so easy for it to be granted. To claim it, you pretty much just have to say that you have a credible fear of being persecuted back in your home country. At this point the migrant will receive a notice to appear (NTA) before an immigration judge where that claim will be adjudicated. At the point, the migrant is generally free to go where they please. They may apply for a work permit six months after making this claim. So they can start their lives, get a job, etc. while they are waiting to be actually granted asylum, but what many do not understand is that asylum is only granted for credible fear of persecution based on a narrow set of criteria. Even though it takes years for those asylum claims to be adjudicated, at the end of the day only about 15% of claimants are granted asylum. Because ICE only prioritizes deportations of serious criminals, those who are denied asylum still generally remain in the US, but they have no legal status and are extremely vulnerable to changes in policy or political leadership.

Both of these are batshit crazy ways to run a country: a functionally open border, and a pathway to status normalization that fails 15% of the time. The alternative for a migrant, of course, is to apply for a visa in the legal way, but this is a laughable solution. There is no visa category of “economic immigrant.” You either need to have a family member who is already a citizen, highly educated, professional job qualifications in specific fields, or lots and lots of money. There is NO legal pathway for someone who wants to just come to the United States to be a roofer, or a restaurant worker. Actually, that’s not totally true. There are H2B visas. However, the US only gives out 66,000 of those a year, and they are by statute temporary visas with no pathway to permanent residency. 

This is no way to run a railroad. I have no problem with the number of immigrants coming into the United States, but I do want the government to be sure they are the right ones. Certainly most who are coming are decent people, but the government needs to at least have the ability to sort out the few bad actors and deny them entry. Allowing bad actors and contraband through is a great way to radicalize public opinion against immigration and stoke racial and ethnic resentment and paranoia. It also needs a sane visa process for economic migrants. Having millions of rejected asylum-seekers living underground lives, open to exploitation, and in a precarious legal condition is a terrible way to bring in immigrants. 

I hated the idea of Trump’s wall when he ran on it in 2016, but it pains me to say that I think it needs to be built. It’s definitely not a solution in and of itself, but it can at least start the process of creating an orderly immigration system. Some might ask how the US would pay for improved border security and visa processing (I don’t see this as an ingenuous concern considering US federal spending practices, but it can at least be addressed and knocked down). Well, cartels are charging virtually everyone who crosses the US border between $5000 and $10000 each (taking advantage of our ineptitude to enrich their coffers). Even if we undercut their prices by 50% to charge immigration fees to applicants, these fees would offset much of the cost, and allow migrants to use the remainder of their savings to take routes from their home countries to the United States that are safer than a trek through the Darien Gap and a 1000 mile ride on the top of a Mexican train.

This is long enough already, but one final thought I need to include is that another direct result of this ineptitude is the enabling of the explosive enrichment and growth of the cartels. It’s created an opportunity for them to charge these enormous travel fees to migrants and smuggle contraband of all kinds across the border. Their annual revenue has ballooned into the billions of dollars and the US runs the real risk that in the future they could completely overrun the Mexican government and establish a true narco-state just across the border. (For those thinking that I’m being hyperbolic, Mexico’s annual tax revenue is $22 billion. The cartel’s estimated annual revenue is $13 billion. I know who my money is on in the long term, considering how much more the government has to spend money on other than security compared to the cartels.)

Maybe that’s the kind of thing that will be necessary before the United States takes immigration seriously, but at that point any hope of the sane, generous, orderly immigration policy that I think we need will be lost. There’s no way that’s happening once our southern neighbor become the Republic of Sinaloa."

1,2023-09-22,"CMV: There is no need for male fiction authors to read works written by women, with one exception",u/RedditExplorer89,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16pfgca/cmv_there_is_no_need_for_male_fiction_authors_to/,changemyview,"Common advice I get on writing subs/forums is that I should read books written by women (I man). The reason given being so I can understand how women think and not just write them from a male POV. These people giving this advice do so without having read any of my work, so they are giving it based solely on the fact that I am a man (and from whatever context the conversation is on and my posting history).

My view is that I have no need to do this. My reasoning is:

1.) There isn't a ""way women think."" People are different. By reading a novel written by a women, I would just be gaining insight into how one particular woman thinks, and I should not apply that to all women.

2.) I use real-life interactions with women to inform how I write them, so I think that lends itself towards realism. I think this also applies to most male writers as by being a human you are bound to interact with a good amount of women in life, so everyone should have real experiences to draw from in writing their characters.

3.) Even if I (or a male author) writes a woman character based on personal fantasy, it isn't that big of a deal. It might not be realistic, but that doesn't make it a bad thing necessarily. Readers still get to see how that author views women, which can be interesting and enjoyable even if it doesn't align with reality. I've read a few books written by women who I think don't portray men very accurately, but I still enjoyed the books and don't think it was a big detraction from the story. If anything, it was interesting to get a women's perspective on men, even if I don't think it was accurate.

The one exception I would say is if a male author wants realistic characters, and is having trouble writing women. In that case, I think it could be useful for the male writer to read books written by women to bolster his skills at writing women realistically.

Also, I'd say there is nothing wrong with wanting to read stories written by women. I just don't see the need to suggest male authors to do this.

**Deltas**:

* Reading different types of authors and experiences can help with creativity.  If a guy only reads stuff written by men, it could do well for them to branch out and read something by a woman.

* Reading multiple books by women can help show common experiences/thoughts of women

* There are physical experiences women feel that are probably best understood by reading it from a woman, such as childbirth.

* There are social differences between men and women that can be learned through reading, such as women tending to fear men more during first meetings/dates, or being encouraged to stay at home and be a wife rather than work.

* Being more comprehensive in story-telling can be good, with wider perspectives.

* The fact that mostly women read and write romance indicates there are preferences woman like that are different from men worth learning about through reading.

* Writing could give deeper insights into a person's thoughts than conversation or being in person with them would.  They might feel more safe writing on paper (even if funnily enough it ends up being much more public)

* There are subreddits dedicated to mocking men writing women, whereas not so for women writing men.  This could indicate a bigger issue with men writing women.

* Men receive far more POV and characters in stories, leading to women being able to write men better than men can write women.

It should also have security features similar to cash to make almost impossible to fake (special paper, security ribbon/thread, etc.)

That’s a super unfair picture of a 16yo. Your 16yo daughter doesn’t look like that. I get it. I went straight for the photograph that was going to make it as difficult as possible to refute my point. That wasn’t an accident. But go ahead and let me know if there’s a single man in your life who you would believe if he looked at that photograph and claimed to experience *literally zero* sexual attraction.


The way that I experience sexual attraction is as defined in the title. Some amount of sexual development produces some amount of sexual attraction and the attraction increases in parallel as development continues. To put it in a sort of dumb caveman type of way, ‘Titties kept gettin’ bigger, she kept lookin’ hotter’ is essentially how I experience sexual attraction. This makes enough logical sense to me that I am under the impression that anyone who is not afflicted with a chronophilia (pedophilia, hebephilia, ephebophilia) - all of which require that a person perceives others to be at **peak attraction** sometime in the middle of their development - experiences attraction in the same way.


If I’m wrong and I’m literally the only person on the entire planet who experiences attraction in this manner, it truly doesn’t matter even the slightest bit for a couple of reasons. For one, all I have described to you is the way in which my innate, inherent biological impulses function and there wouldn’t be jack shit I could do about it even if I wanted to. Much more importantly, I am not going out of my way to do or say anything that would make a minor uncomfortable on the very infrequent occasions in which I encounter them nor am I doing anything that would offend society at large.


If I am correct, however, then I believe that society’s bullshit mantra of ‘Nobody reasonable experiences any amount of attraction whatsoever to anyone aged 17y364d or less’ is causing some significant problems.


For one, I do not think that any man who experiences at least some amount of attraction to the photograph I presented - which, if we’re being real here, is probably the overwhelming majority of them - needs to find themselves thinking ‘OH GOD OH FUCK! WHAT’S WRONG WITH ME?? AM I A PEDOPHILE??’ And this problem extends much more troublingly to young people themselves. I’ve seen teenagers all over Reddit clearly experiencing trepidation over expressing that they experience attraction to *other teenagers*.


Every human, every mammal.. maybe even every organism? I feel like some Biology PhD is going to *ackshually* me, but at the moment I’m feeling confident enough to say that every single organism on the entire planet experiences a very natural and innate impulse towards reproduction. As this pertains to humans, it makes enough sense to me that this impulse would start firing off towards others right around the time that they become capable of reproduction - puberty.


And that brings me to the second, much more significant problem that this is causing. When we outright, flatly deny objective reality, that brings with it the very unfortunate side effect of doing absolutely nothing to prepare people for the nature of the objective reality in which they actually live. [Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenNoCensor/comments/12iuqj5/women_how_old_were_you_when_you_started_enduring/) a thread asking women how old they were when they started enduring street harassment. I’ve seen several of these types of threads in my several years on Reddit and the results are always about the same. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that 90% of the ages reported revolve around puberty. And if grown women are reporting that this is when it started for them, you’d have to imagine that this is something our current youth are currently enduring. So what is anyone doing to arm them against this issue when it arises in their lives?


Essentially, your philosophy says that from the moment a person is born up until the time from that moment that the floating rock we live on revolves around the flaming ball of gas it orbits 18 times, any person who gets hit with the completely impulsive, involuntary spark of attraction towards that person is due some shame. You probably haven’t had it broken down for you like that before, but those truly, quite literally, are the building blocks of your philosophy.


My philosophy is that by the time a member of your own species and preferred gender is fully fucking physically formed, you just might get hit with the spark of attraction towards that person.


Simply stating that you don’t experience attraction in this manner isn’t going to be rewarded with a delta because I can simply choose to not believe you. If you want deltas, what I’m really looking for here is solid evidence that my understanding of the impulse that produces sexual attraction is off, or even anything that doesn’t necessarily disagree with me but expands my knowledge of the topic. All of that will be rewarded with a delta."

**The general trajectory, in Europe at least, is as follows:**

\-Economic calamity

\-Growing distrust in: democracy, leaders and corporations

\-Immigration issues that are spiraling out of control -> Race realisation / '*reawakening'*

\-General loathing for 'wokeism', primarily in the form of growing anti: censorship, trans rights and ESG

\-Historic polarisation between the left and the right - there is no populated middle ground anymore.

\-Growing anti-Semitism, in the form of 'they', 'who controls us' and 'fake news', mixed with crusader levels of Islamophobia.

\-'Sigma' & 'Alpha' culture being largely adopted by disenfranchised males who speak up against the *feminisation* of men and heavily promote traditional gender roles for women.

\-Growing trend of young people now being more likely than older people to vote right wing, this is particularly prevalent in France, where the youth voted in hoardes for nationalist, Marine La Pen as their first choice, and socialist, Jean-Luc Melenchon as their second choice, compared to their counterparts who voted for centre left neo-liberal Macron.

**There's many more nuanced indicators, but these are the ones that come to mind first.**

To me, it feels as though all of the dominos are being placed in preperation for a new kind of national socialism.

Moderate European leaders are being forced to concede to the right and there is a general yearning for radical change.

To add fuel to fire, there is a trend I've been noticing in comment sections of Nazi sympathising, or even desensitising, like posts made on this very sub! -> '[Nazis were bad only because they brought colonialism to Europe and that’s about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16p30h9/cmvnazis_were_bad_only_because_they_brought/)', the only difference being that on Instagram, which is a youth dominated platform, these comments will have upwards of 20k likes.

Maybe I'm imagining it all, but it sure does feel as though we're entering into a new era of Nat-Soc, or at the very least, sympathy for it.

On the surface, many pets appear well treated by affectionate owners, yet the institution itself raises questions about agency and autonomy.

  
Just as some slave masters treated slaves like valued family, affording them stability and care, the structure of ownership remained problematic by denying basic rights. Pets too are denied control over their lives—where they live, activities, medical care, and even reproductive freedom are restricted by human decisions, no matter the owner's good intentions.

  
If we accept pets possess interests and experience the world subjectively, exercising complete dominion over them through ownership becomes a serious infringement on their dignity.

  
While organized cruelty like animal testing rightfully faces opposition, the largely unaffected institution of pet keeping remains broadly accepted. But just as wage labor was once normalized yet promised workers no say in their livelihoods, owning other living beings for our benefit raises ethical issues around consent and power imbalances that warrant reflection.

I know most of you have heard this stuff before but just in case, let me give an example of where the Oxford Comma is needed for clarity.

""I'll introduce you to Emily, my sister, and my wife.""

""I'll introduce you to Emily, my sister and my wife.""

In the second example, sans Oxford Comma, it could be interpreted that Emily is both my sister and my wife. In the first example, it is clear that I'm speaking about 3 different people.

Basically, we use commas in lists to show when one item in the list has ended and the next has begun. Why shouldn't that apply to the end of the list? Adding an Oxford Comma clears up ambiguity and makes sure your sentence can only be interpreted in the way that you intend.

I'm open to having my view changed on this. To be honest the only thing that might do it is if you can provide a counter-example where the Oxford Comma creates ambiguity where there was none before."

A subject like this should be compulsory for all students, but passing/failing it has no impact on whether or not they pass school. It should however impact whether or not they're able to apply for a student loan. If they're unable to pass a basic test about how student loans work and what they'll end up paying and the laws about it, then they simply should not be able to get it. It seems irresponsible to have an 18 year old kid take out a contract like that without them understanding the basics of it.   


Other topics covered by this subject should include stuff like basic politics and how the political system works. The consequence for failing this part should be that they're unable to vote ( or at least unable to until a certain age ) with the ability to retake the test as many times as they want, at no cost. I understand some people would strongly disagree with this because they may feel like it's some kind of discrimination and I imagine these would be the same type of people who disagree with voters requiring ID, but I'm fairly certain that the vast majority of people would agree to this. Oh, and also a government ID should be issued to them too at school. Absolutely no reason to not have one. I'm from South Africa and got my ID in grade 10. And if a country like that can get this right, I see no reason for a ''first world'' country to mess it up.   


Of course, this isn't a perfect list of topics that ''should'' be covered, but this is a rough idea on my thoughts. Nitpicking at an oversight or tiny detail is not going to change my view, rather fault the idea itself. The reason I believe this to be the right thing to do has nothing to do with discriminating against illiterate people or people one might believe to be stupid, it is simply there to help someone better understand the world they're stepping into. Failing to understand the basics of something like a loan should be viewed in the same way as failing to understand the contract you're signing where it says '' sign here to  confirm you understand the T&C '', except that this is a test to ensure that you do actually understand the basics of the T&C's

I disagree.

The vast majority of Americans are law abiding and contributing citizens. The total number of bad apples might be quite large but they are still a small percent of of the countries’ total population. 

Most of us don’t walk by a Kia and have the urge to steal it. For most of us, we could walk by a car with the windows down and keys on the front seat and guess what… we still wouldn’t steal it. To go further, we wouldn’t continue miscreant behavior and drive recklessly nor commit violent crimes.

most straight women (even very powerful and independent ones) like to take the more submissive role in romantic relationships and most straight men like to take the more dominant role in romantic relationships, so I think the save the princess trope is a power fantasy for both men and women (atleast heterosexual ones) women want to be the beautiful princess who gets saved and men want to be the knight in shining armor

She went somewhere without telling you? She has other friends and hobbies and a career? THAT MEANS SHE HATES YOU AND IS GETTING GANGBANGED BY 5 BIG GUYS. First of all my best friend has a woman who sometimes takes forever to text and they’re happily married and have a kid.

My best advice to both men and women is to work out and get in good shape, stop being a complete chud nerd incel, make money, grow your hair out, and get outside more like make sure you have lots of interesting stories to tell, be kind, get some nice attire dress like a GTA protagonist me personally I like leather jackets and bomber jackets with jeans it’s badass but stands out a bit, skincare routine, hobbies, and personality.

1,2023-09-23,CMV: Africa will not produce a developed superpower in the foreseeable future.,u/KevinVacit,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16q963b/cmv_africa_will_not_produce_a_developed/,changemyview,"Despite Africa being the home continent of humanity, Africa's history seems quite lacking compared to Europe or Asia. A major Bronze Age civilization by the name of Egypt had its start in the very top northeast corner of Africa, but after Egypt fell, the entire North African region was little more than a plaything for Eurasian empires. First the Carthaginians moved in, then the Romans, then the Arabs, then the Ottomans, and finally various Europeans colonized the area. Egypt is the most notable of the African civilizations, and even that place honestly has almost spent more time being a subjugated region than it has spent being an independent power.

  
""Black"" Africa below the Sahara has managed to produce a few Iron Age level kingdoms like the Songhai or Great Zimbabwe, but the continent has overall never produced a civilization as great as the Romans, Chinese, Indians, or even arguably the South Americans. Africa also never produced a mighty warlord on the same level as Napoleon, Alexander, Genghis, or Timur; one  that can subjugate vast lands and connect them in various ways. What petty kingdoms that did manage to get created were frequently subverted or depopulated by the Arab Slave Trade and Atlantic Slave Trade. Afterwards, the entire continent got colonized and was left with a basic export-focused economy and many hostile ethnic groups living in the same country. Even after independence, the continent has been wracked with civil wars, dictatorships, and other issues.

  
To this date, not a single nation in Africa is developed. Even the traditionally more ""advanced"" North Africa region has widespread instability, poverty, and authoritarianism just like the rest of the continent. Very few regions in Africa or even countries for that matter are united by language, religion, culture, ethnicity, or even just a shared history/values. Not many major nations or NGOS are trying to invest in the continent besides the long-occurring export trade. Even China's exploitative Belt-and-Road initiative has come to a halt. To make matters worse, climate change will soon be out of control, and Africa will likely be one of the hardest hit regions on the planet.

  
Unlike White supremacists, I am not going to blame Africa's woes on Black inferiority or anything silly and hateful like that. I think Africa's issues has more to do with geography and happenstance than anything else, but the fact of the matter is that African regions were not comparatively strong 1,000 years ago, were not strong 500 years ago, were not strong 50 years ago, are not strong today, and are very unlikely to become strong this century or even next century. Africa's past, present, and future has never looked good. Climate change and religious zealotry will only make things worse. Furthermore, the current world order led by the USA and maybe China won't even allow for an African superpower to develop; and it is not like African countries are 'allowed' to go on a conquering spree even if they could. 

A united African Union would be barely above India socioeconomically and would have ten times the issues even that country has. The idea of Africa producing an equivalent to the USA is unthinkable. Africa even producing a country on par with South Korea or the Netherlands seems impractical. Wakanda is a pure fantasy.

  
In summary, African countries lack many of the tools and prerequisites and transitions to even become a great power or developed nation; good luck conceiving an African superpower. Even a modern African country sent to the past would struggle to project power. To change my view, you have to demonstrate that an African country or an African region can actually become rich or powerful within the foreseeable future."

I could absolutely live alone and rent a decent apartment but honestly I don't see the point of moving out until I find a soulmate to move in with and start a family.  
If I move in alone to an apartment by myself I will have to:   
1- Do all the chores myself instead of sharing them with all my family, therefore losing a lot of free time.  
2- Lose a lot of money as a huge percentage of my wages will be gone for rent and living expenses etc, at my parents I can save and invest the majority of my wage.  
If I move to a Room and share an apartment with other people:  
1- Still would lose a lot of time  
2- I would also spend a lot more money moving out but less than living alone. But that would defeat the whole purpose of moving out for privacy and independence.  
So if I move out alone I will either way, lose money and lose time, I feel it will be harder to enjoy life.

The typical idea was that quality of living and overall development crashed hard when the empire fell, hence the dark part of the dark ages. It's been correctly pointed out that putting the entirely of the medieval era into that catagory is unfair, and gives the impression that the whole middle ages was a bunch of feudal barons eating turkey legs while the peasents live in dirt huts. That's fair, the late middle ages in particular saw the rebirth of massive construction projects and large population centers, not to mention technology that  quite solidly outdid Rome.

But the idea that even the early middle ages were like that is fanciful. There WAS a massive drop off in population and quality of life throughout the former empire. Cities that once held tens or hundreds of thousands of people were either abandonded or reduced to small towns. The aquaducts and other megaprojects fell into disrepair. Things like the large heated bathouses and heated floors fell out of use almost completely.

Sure, many of these trends had begun before Rome fell, but even so the collapse of the empire and subsesquent turmoil were a massive blow to the development of West Europe. It didn't last as long, but I'd certainly argue that at least the 6-8th centuries were a dark ages compared to what came before."

Also I‘ve interacted with women who say they are queer or non-binary because they don’t have good experiences with men, even though they want a relationship or sex only with men and view it as something like a guilty pleasure.

I understand that these things are mostly done out of frustration or fear. Women are frightened by men or by their role in our society. Young people are frightened because they have been told they can do anything if they work hard enough but reality proves to be different. 

Being mentally ill or in some sense a victim of circumstances you cannot change is an easy answer and one cannot argue over it anymore. 
I don’t want to lessen a person’s suffering or problems but maybe it‘s just a symptom of being human and not some disorder. I think this compulsion to label every behavior is quite problematic and reductionist. The most important part is: The postmodern societal ideal of the modern human is not criticized by this. 
By labeling oneself with Autism, you accept that there is something „wrong“ with you- but maybe you‘re not wrong, you’re just indoctrinated by an made up ideal very few can reach.

Jesus would be considered a socialist by today's standards. I began looking online and found surprisingly little literature about the topic.  So I decided if there are not many books about this topic, I would make one!

&#x200B;

This is my first attempt at trying to fully flesh out a book. But before I commit to writing the rest of it, I decided to see what others think, and to see if my mind can be changed.  


# Prologue: The Radical Carpenter

## Introduction: An Unlikely Socialist
  
Would it astonish you to learn that a man who lived more than two thousand years ago, who openly defied the religious and political authorities of his era, could be labeled a socialist today? This man stood unflinchingly on the side of the marginalized. He gave food to the hungry without expecting anything in return and provided healing to the sick without the need for any insurance. He envisioned a society grounded in radical inclusivity. This man was none other than Jesus of Nazareth.
  
## The Dissonance: How Did We Get Here?
  
In today's world, it's perplexing to see the teachings of Jesus frequently co-opted to support political and economic ideologies he would likely have opposed. Politicians bend scriptural narratives to rationalize policies that largely benefit the wealthy and deepen societal divides. How, then, did the teachings of a first-century carpenter become the cornerstone of systems that perpetuate inequality?
  
## The Aim: A Provocative Exploration
  
This book sets out to challenge these appropriations head-on. We aim to reexamine not just what Jesus actually taught but also to provide a roadmap for realigning modern Christianity with its foundational principles. The provocative question driving this exploration: What if Jesus were a socialist by today's standards?
  
## Scope of the Book: The Journey Ahead
  
As we move through these pages, we will dissect the economic and ethical principles either explicitly or implicitly endorsed by Jesus and contrast them with the tenets of contemporary capitalism. From the communal practices of early Christian communities to the ethical considerations surrounding wealth and poverty, we will delve deep into the complexities of Christian thought.
  
## Who Is This Book For?
  
If you've ever felt a dissonance between Jesus's teachings and their representation in modern political and economic dialogues, this book is for you. Whether you struggle with aligning Jesus's focus on compassion, equality, and social justice with the competitive, individualistic ethos of capitalism, you're in the right place. This book speaks to anyone—believer or non-believer—interested in the crossroads of faith, history, and social justice.
  
## What to Expect: A Guide to the Thought Process
  
Brace yourself to challenge long-standing assumptions, reevaluate deeply rooted beliefs, and possibly even change your perspective. We will venture into the historical milieu of Jesus's time, explore the socio-economic landscape, and analyze key parables and teachings to understand their implications for social equality, wealth distribution, and communal living.
  
## A Forewarning: The Challenge Ahead
  
Whether you end up agreeing or disagreeing with the arguments presented here, one thing is certain: Your understanding of both Jesus and socialism will be irrevocably altered. This is not just an academic discourse; it's a transformative journey, challenging us to embody the revolutionary principles Jesus championed.
  
The Ultimate Question: What Will We Choose?
  
The ball is in our court. Are we willing to reexamine the economic and social principles that underpin Jesus's teachings? Will we allow his revolutionary message to be commandeered by systems that would not just oppose but also likely persecute him were he to present them today? The choice is ours, and the time to act is now.
  
 
  
# Chapter 1: The World Jesus Knew
  

  
## Introduction: The Importance of Context
  
Why does a carpenter's son from ancient Palestine still captivate our modern imaginations? Why do his words echo through the corridors of power, the sanctuaries of religion, and the public squares of civil discourse?
  
The search to understand Jesus of Nazareth often leads us into intricate theological debates, scholarly interpretations of ancient texts, and fervent prayers in hallowed halls. Yet, we sometimes overlook the most immediate canvas of his life—the living, breathing, and suffering world of first-century Palestine. This chapter aims to set the stage for the transformative journey that the book promises. We'll delve into the political, social, and religious landscapes that shaped Jesus's teachings and actions. By examining this historical context, we can better understand Jesus as a figure deeply rooted in his time yet profoundly relevant to our own.

Imagine living under the shadow of colossal Roman fortresses, symbols of an empire that stretched from the rolling hills of England to the sun-baked sands of Egypt. These structures were not mere feats of engineering; they were tangible reminders of an occupation that dictated life in Palestine. The Roman Empire, documented extensively by historians like Josephus, was not a mere backdrop but a significant actor in the political theater of Jesus's world.
  

  
Rome was not an invisible specter; it was a very visible cage. Its laws, taxes, and military might permeated daily life. Yet, the Romans were cunning imperialists; they didn't just impose—they co-opted. Rulers like Herod the Great served as middlemen, maintaining a precarious balance between the demands of the Roman overlords and the sentiments of the local populace. This complicated relationship with Rome shaped the political environment in which Jesus lived and taught.
  

  
### Jewish Governance: The Machinations of a Complex Web
  

  
But this was not merely a story of occupier and occupied. Running parallel to Roman rule was a complex mechanism of Jewish governance. This was not a monolithic entity but a mosaic of religious sects, each with its own understanding of the Torah, its own rituals, and its own politics.
  

  
The Pharisees and Sadducees were the two most prominent groups, yet they were as different as night and day. The Pharisees were the scholars, the self-appointed custodians of Jewish law, while the Sadducees were the aristocrats, more concerned with temple rites than social rights. Other players included the Zealots, Jewish rebels who chose the sword over silence, and the Essenes, who retreated to the desert, waiting for an apocalyptic end. Each group offered a lens through which to interpret the law, the prophets, and the promise of a liberated Israel. Prominent figures like Caiaphas, the high priest, and Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee, epitomized the complexities of this Jewish governance system.
  

  
 ### Jesus in the Political Landscape
  

  
Enter Jesus—a carpenter with no army, no political office, and no wealth, yet whose teachings would disrupt both the Roman and Jewish establishments. He was a radical, not because he called for an overthrow of the Roman government, but because he challenged the very foundations upon which society was built—economic, social, and religious. His conversations, like the one he had with Pontius Pilate in the Gospel of John (18:33-38), reflect his subversive stance toward both Roman and Jewish authorities.
  

  
His teachings, parables, and actions were politically and socially charged. For instance, when he declared, ""Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's,"" he was making a nuanced statement about political allegiance and divine sovereignty. By understanding this intricate political landscape, we can better grasp the revolutionary fervor of Jesus's teachings.
  

  
## Social Stratification: The Rich, the Poor, and the Marginalized
  

  
### The Economic Divide: A Tale of Two Palestines
  

  
Picture this: grandiose mansions juxtaposed against mud-hut villages, opulent feasts contrasting with begging bowls, and ostentatious religious rituals overshadowing the quiet prayers of the impoverished. First-century Palestine was a society of stark contrasts, documented not just in religious texts but also in the writings of contemporary historians like Philo of Alexandria and Josephus.
  

  
The wealth of the few was built on the backs of the many. The elite not only had more, but they also believed they were more—more righteous, more deserving, more favored by God. This social stratification wasn't a mere happenstance; it was built into the economic and religious systems of the day. The Law of Moses, as interpreted by the Pharisees, often served to justify these inequalities, giving divine sanction to social divisions.
  

  
### Jesus and Social Stratification
  

  
Jesus waded into this cesspool of inequality not as a spectator but as an agitator. When he said, ""Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God,"" as recorded in Luke 6:20-21, he was not offering platitudes; he was pronouncing a social revolution. His actions were equally revolutionary; consider the cleansing of the temple, a direct challenge to an economic system that exploited the poor under the guise of religious piety.
  

  
Moreover, Jesus frequently used parables to expose the injustices of the economic system. The parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) serves as a poignant critique of wealth disparity, and the parable of the workers in the vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16) questions the fairness of wage distribution. By understanding the economic disparities and social hierarchies of his time, we can better interpret Jesus's ministry. His wasn't a gospel of mere spiritual upliftment; it was a gospel of economic redistribution and social equality. His teachings on debt forgiveness, as exemplified in the Lord's Prayer (""Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors""), allude to a radical reshaping of economic relationships.
  

  
### Religious Context: The Guardians and Challengers of Jewish Law
  

  
## Pharisees and Sadducees: The Establishment's Keepers
  

  
The Pharisees and Sadducees were not just religious figures; they were also social and political influencers. While the Pharisees prided themselves on their scholarly interpretations of Jewish law, the Sadducees were the aristocrats who controlled the Temple—a religious institution, yes, but also an economic powerhouse. Their influence reached into every aspect of Jewish life, affecting not just religious practice but also social norms and economic policies.
  

  
### Jesus's Challenge to Religious Orthodoxy
  

  
Jesus was not a passive observer of these religious dynamics; he was an active disrupter. He challenged the Pharisees' legalistic interpretations, not by dismissing the law but by deepening it, injecting it with a radical ethos of justice and love. As for the Sadducees, Jesus questioned their focus on ritual and temple practices, emphasizing instead the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness, as he articulates in Matthew 23:23.
  

  
In doing so, Jesus wasn't merely offering an alternative religious practice; he was proposing a different kind of society—a society where religious, economic, and social life were rooted in the principles of justice and compassion, not ritual purity and social hierarchy. This can be seen in his teachings on the Sabbath, where he prioritizes human well-being over ritualistic legalism, as in the healing of the man with a withered hand (Mark 3:1-6).
  

  
### Economic Practices: From Charity to Justice
  

  
## Beyond Acts of Kindness: The Early Christian Model
  

  
The early Christian communities didn't just practice charity; they embodied a revolutionary concept of economic justice. We find in the book of Acts (4:32-35) a description of early Christian communities where people sold their possessions and distributed the proceeds according to need, not merit or social status. This wasn't a marginal practice but a cornerstone of their communal life, signaling a shift from charity to justice.
  

  
### Socialism: A Modern Parallel
  

  
Does this early Christian economic model have a modern parallel? Absolutely—it's what we call socialism. Now, let's be clear; we're not talking about the totalitarian regimes that often masquerade as socialist states. We're talking about a system where the economic means of production are controlled by the community as a whole. It's not just about redistributing wealth; it's about rethinking the very structures that create wealth and poverty in the first place.
  

  
The teachings of Jesus and the practices of early Christian communities resonate with core socialist principles like collective ownership and wealth redistribution. This intersection between ancient practice and modern theory isn't mere coincidence; it challenges us to reconsider the relationship between Christianity and capitalism critically.
  

  
### Reclaiming Jesus, Reclaiming Justice
  

  
As we journey through the life and times of Jesus, we discover a figure who is not easily categorized. He is a spiritual guide, yes, but also a social revolutionary. He is a healer, indeed, but also an economic reformer. He is a man of prayer, but also a man of action—unafraid to turn tables, both metaphorically and literally.
  

  
How did we get from this Jesus to where we are today? How did a first-century Jewish teacher who advocated for social justice, economic equality, and radical love become a figurehead for ideologies that often perpetuate the opposite? Exploring this transformation requires us to question not just how we interpret ancient texts, but how we live our modern lives. It pushes us to not only ask, ""What would Jesus do?"" but also, ""What are we doing in the name of Jesus?""
  

  
In reclaiming the revolutionary Jesus, we also reclaim a revolutionary sense of what is possible—for our society, for our religious institutions, and for ourselves. We rediscover a Christianity that is not bound by the status quo but is an ever-evolving quest for a world where love overcomes hate, where justice triumphs over exploitation, and where, in the words of the prophet Amos, ""justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.""
  

  
By examining the life and teachings of Jesus through the lens of social justice and economic equality, we engage in an act of intellectual and spiritual rediscovery. This is not an abstract academic exercise; it's an urgent call to action. Our exploration of Jesus's revolutionary principles aims to equip us to address modern challenges—from income inequality to systemic racism to environmental degradation.
  

  
## A Revolutionary Reinterpretation
  

  
### Re-imagining the Story: Unveiling the Revolutionary
  

  
While many of us have grown up with a sanitized, almost divine image of Jesus—the benevolent shepherd or the transcendent deity—this mental picture often obscures the radical activist that Jesus was. This section aims to strip away centuries of theological varnish to reveal a Jesus who is as relevant to social justice activism today as he was to the spiritual and political landscape of first-century Palestine. 
  

  
We must scrutinize not just the words of the New Testament but also the actions, priorities, and the lived experience of Jesus as recorded in historical and scriptural contexts. When we do, we find a figure deeply engaged with the socio-economic issues of his time, actively advocating for a radical shift in how society treats its marginalized and oppressed.
  

  
### The Revolutionary vs. The Pacifist: A Tale of Two Jesuses
  

  
Contrary to the conventional portrayal of Jesus as a peace-loving, otherworldly spiritual teacher who called people to personal piety, there exists a more disruptive, provocative Jesus—a revolutionary who not only preached a different kind of Kingdom but advocated for a new way of living that undermined the established political and economic systems. Far from being a passive observer, this Jesus was an active agitator. He didn't merely speak about love; he demonstrated it through subversive acts that challenged the religious and social norms of his time.
  

  
This dual nature—both revolutionary and pacifist—isn't contradictory but complementary. Jesus's pacifism wasn't about avoiding conflict; it was about confronting injustice without resorting to the violent tactics of his oppressors. His overturning of the money-changers' tables in the Temple wasn't an act of violence but a symbolic act of resistance against economic exploitation.
  

  
### The Gospel of Equality: From Words to Action
  

  
When we say that Jesus was a revolutionary, we don't mean it in the sense that he led armed rebellions against Roman authorities. Rather, his was a revolution of values, a revolution that began in the hearts and minds of people and extended into the way society was structured. His teachings on love, justice, and equality weren't abstract ideals; they were concrete principles that he wanted his followers to embody.
  

  
The Sermon on the Mount, for instance, wasn't just a moral code but a radical manifesto that turned the prevailing norms of society upside down. Consider the Beatitudes, which bless the meek, the poor, and the persecuted. This wasn't just spiritual poetry; it was a political statement against the dominant values of a Roman society that honored wealth, power, and military victory.
  

  
### The Politics of Healing: Miracles as Social Commentary
  

  
Often, Jesus's miracles are viewed merely as demonstrations of his divinity. However, when looked at closely, these miracles were also political and social acts. Healing a leper or restoring sight to the blind wasn't just about physical healing; it was about social restoration. By challenging the purity laws that marginalized these individuals, Jesus was challenging an entire system that deemed them unworthy of community and religious life.
  

  
### Jesus and Economic Justice: Beyond Charity
  

  
Jesus's approach to economic justice went beyond mere charity. While he did advocate helping the poor, his teachings also delved into systemic issues that contributed to poverty. His parables, like that of the Rich Man and Lazarus, were not just moral tales but commentaries on the economic injustices of his time. They forced his audience to confront uncomfortable truths about wealth, poverty, and their own complicity in systems of inequality.
  

  
### Redefining Power: The Cross as Political Statement
  

  
The crucifixion of Jesus is often interpreted through a purely theological lens, seen as the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins. However, the crucifixion was also a political act. Roman authorities didn't execute Jesus because he claimed to be the Son of God; they executed him because his teachings posed a direct threat to their power structures. His resurrection can be viewed not just as a defeat of death but also as a triumph over the political and religious systems that sought to suppress his revolutionary message.
  

  
## Conclusion: Reclaiming the Revolutionary Jesus
  

  
In revisiting the life and teachings of Jesus with fresh eyes, we can reclaim the revolutionary aspect of his ministry. This isn't about rewriting religious texts; it's about reinterpreting them in a way that aligns with the quest for social justice. It's about recognizing that the Kingdom of God that Jesus spoke of is not just a heavenly realm but a new way of living here and now—a life committed to justice, equality, and radical love.
  

  
As we integrate this revolutionary Jesus into our spiritual and political lives, we can transform not only how we view Christianity but how we engage with the world. This is not just a call for theological reflection but a call to action, challenging us to live out the revolutionary principles that Jesus both preached and embodied."

Having less celebrities would allow the budgets for said movie to increase on CGI, actors, make-up, the works

Less backlash if said actor of said movie being a celebrity does something evil or cruel because they can get away with it, and has the movie tank for such an act

Its still just as bad, and it looks as if humans are just flailing around in a desperate attempt to understand their own torture, and inadvertantly worshiping torture in doing so. As it is said; the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I should add that a seperate entity such as Satan is basically 2 versions of god to play this strange game of validating itself all over again with no real end or point.

The guy was part of a seperatist terrorist movement that has a history of bloodshed , the Khalistan movement. The indian government asked Canada to extradite him but, Canada refused multiple times. Canada has become the base for the Khalistan movements. There was a whole rally where the khalistan supporters burned effigy of indira gandhi but Canada did nothing. The Canadian government was responsible for the air india tragedy. In 1985 , khalistan memebers bombed a plane. India warned Canada about it but Canada ignored it. With a history of doing nothing against the movement, not wonder india would do it. India is very touchy about seperatist movements. It already has troubles with kashmir, and the last time the khalistan got full force thousands died and it led to a state of unrest in Punjab. Not to mention the involvement of Pakistan ISI funding the movement of it to damage india. In india perespective, it is important to deal with the seperatist movement.

It's well known that you don't beat your children in major parts of America and I'm all for that, but there is no disciplinary or very lax disciplinary measures when it comes to children misbehaving and very little things you can even discipline your children about. 

I saw a video where a girl bullied another girl who had cancer for having no hair, and the father of the bully shaved her own hair as punishment but people said he was a bad father and that he should've grounded her instead. I honestly don't think her not having electronics or talking to friend for a few weeks or months is equal to the mental and emotional damage she has done to the cancer victim or even a strong deterrent. 

There is so much hate towards parents too, I feel like it isn't said enough that parents aren't perfect, I'd see parents doing things that aren't really nice or good online and the comments will be full of 'i'd cut them off' or 'that's what'd land you in a retirement home'. Is it so easy to sever off ties with someone who birthed and took care of you? My parents beat me as a child and some part of me resents them for it but I still love them, and I see every other thing they do for me. They also love me, the ways in which they show just stems from ignorance and isn't perfect. 

I'd be scared to raise a child knowing that any slight mistake from me would leave me without them or in a retirement home. There isn't more being said about forgiveness, tolerance and trying to correct the mentality. There are many things my mum wouldn't agree with when I was younger that we have made her see the light to, I feel like this what you do to the people you love. 

I just saw where someone justified it being okay to disrespect your parents because sometimes they do things that warrants disrespects, why? You could call them and talk to them about it and even if you couldn't there's still no reason to disrespect them publicly. Just like everyone in that comment agreed there's no reason to shout at your child in public.

There are also videos of parents doing something their toddler doesn't want them to do like making their hair and everyone is like if the child doesn't want it then don't do it. That is such a wild way to think, that's why you're the parent. If the child is 100% capable of making very sound decisions as a child then we wouldn't need parents, you can't just let your child dictate how they want to be raised. 

Most of these comments are from people who haven't given birth (and I haven't too) and I feel like if these are the kinds of parents they'd become then there's a very real chance of raising a bunch of spoiled brats as the next generation. 

I just want to mention that with all the talk of America being forward in parenting, there's also a large discourse about cutting off parents and leaving them in retirement homes. Is it that these methods aren't working  or they are just raising kids who have learnt to be more entitled. 

This obviously doesn't apply to the extreme cases like your parents abandoning you, raping you, being very racist, beating you to an inch with your life and things like that."

2. Takes corporate social responsibility seriously
3. Can avoid being corrupted by greed
4. Is a good spouse and parent

I am none of those things. I've never had the guts to try saving another person's life, I've never been in the position to use a business for corporate social responsibility, and I don't have a wife and kids (and frankly, that might be for the best because I might become abusive). Would I leave behind a large hole if I were gone? **No.** I've thought this movie through after the first time I've watched it and have come to the conclusion that my friends would probably find some other friend, and my family would probably be richer, had I not existed.

How is anyone not supposed to have existential dread after watching this movie? Sure, George Bailey is an ideal to strive for, but most of us will fail to achieve one of the above criteria, if not all 4 of them. It sure is comforting to think of ourselves as leaving behind a huge hole if we were gone, but in practice, this does not actually hold true for most of us if we think about it. Most of us are too insignificant, too cowardly, too incompetent, and too corruptible to have a positive impact as significant as George did in the movie.

At best, *It's a Wonderful Life* is a wake-up call. The movie hammers in a painful but necessary message that the world will be worse off without heroic people like George Bailey, but most of us are not heroic. We can all strive to make positive changes in our lives, but even if we do, it's no guarantee that we'd become indispensable pillars of our communities like George was in the movie."

Well, I have an issue with this. See, brains are made out of neurons and cells, and these are also objects. Simpler objects than brains, sure. But this means that an object can be made of objects, as holistic perspectives state, and as emergence also states.

Basically, human bodies could be said to be more complex, because they are made of complex sub-objects, one of which, the brain.

And not only that, the planet earth, with all the creatures, forests, fungus, oceans, icebergs, rains, magnetic field, etc shows an even more complex object.

The earth is made out of smaller ""cells"", such as plants and animals, and humans are one of these cells, and human brains are, therefore, a subj-object that composes the bigger object, which is earth. This could also extend further, as earth is part of a system. Such system is part of a galaxy.

My fundamental stance is that, we can't say that X object is the most complex when it is an object that composes another Y object. This automatically means that Y is in fact the most complex object."

I'm arguing a really specific situation in this instance**

To understand the argument we need to set two ground rules

> Consent to sex is Consent to Pregnancy (Can't get an abortion in consensual sex) 
> Personhood starts at conception (Extremely simplified) 

Note my opinions on these two things are not going to change the reason I'm making this CMV is because I feel like there's still a loophole that allows abortion in cases of rape even with those two being true. 

Violinist Argument:

You wake up one day and see yourself attached to a world class violinist. You are the only one that can fix his kidney disease. But you have to be connected to this person for 9 months. 

You still have the right to unplug in this situation. 

---

Since the violinist case becomes pretty similar to the rape cases in the case that you did not consent to the situation that you put yourself in I would say that you do have the legal right to unplug in this scenario. 

So similarly a pregnant women would have the legal right to unplug from her child. 

Now I do want to explain that she would only have the right to unplug. In Judith Jarvis Thompson's own paper she says that don't confuse your right to an abortion, as your right to kill the child. You cannot perform any procedure that will result in the direct killing of the violinist. So regular procedures are out. 

#This CMV is specifically about the case of unplugging. Its not about Abortion as a whole. Please read the post to understand the context that I'm trying to provide."

The reason I beleive shoplifting is wrong is that there is a false sense of justice behind it's perception. While I will admit desparate people need to make desperate choices sometimes, this seems to pale in comparison to the amount of people who do it purely for a thrill or monetary gain. 

Talking with my coworkers and friends who shoplift, it is never ""I am so hungry and I barely have a cent to my name"" it's ""Yeah, sealing is fun, they deserve it.""

Then I look at the Facebook pages for local businesses and look up security footage of shoplifters. They aren't stealing baby formula and food, but upscale clothing, trinkets and electronics. These aren't people stuck between a rock and a hard place, these are just greedy individuals. 

Furthermore, it is a massive injustice to the employees and shoppers just trying to do thir jobs and shop responsibly. 

When these massive corporations catch wind of shrink, the first thing they do is go after the employees and either punish them, or train them to observe customers like a hawk, which is both creepy and something that should not be an employee responsibility.

Then, stores will just shut down entirely to avoid further losses, leading to food deserts and putting hundreds of workers out of a job because someone felt entitled to steal. So thousands of individuals who did nothing wrong are suddenly without a location to shop because of these actions.

1,2023-09-24,CMV: Adultery shouldn't be legal,u/Konato-san,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16r0mfk/cmv_adultery_shouldnt_be_legal/,changemyview,"Before making this, I looked at a couple older threads and I wasn't convinced by the arguments people gave.

>What constitutes as cheating here?

Provided you're in a romantic relationship, the engagement or announced intent to engage in intimate physical contact (kisses, touching of genitalia, intercourse -- anything that'd fall under sexual harassment or worse if done without consent) with someone outside the relationship, without your partner's knowledge.

If they find out, they can press charges.

This also means the blame lies square on the one doing the cheating, not on who they're cheating with if that makes sense, regardless of whether or not they know that the other person was already taken. If I nag you to rob a bank and you end up caving in, you're the only one going to jail after you're caught. The same principle applies here.

>But what if a boy breaks up with a girl, bangs somebody else and then the girl says he cheated?

Too bad!

That's a real fringe case, and the law isn't exactly obligated to cover cases like that. It's the same thing with rape: If two people have consensual intercourse and then one of them later presses rape charges lying about their consent, it's the judge and lawyers' business to figure out who's telling the truth. It's a fringe case, but a preventable one too; if you don't trust your partner to not randomly press rape charges on you, I guess make them sign a consent form? It's wack to not trust a partner though.

A similar thing would apply here: if you want to prevent your partner from saying the relationship wasn't truly over, just tell them via messages ""we're over"" (thereby making their claims easily disprovable) or put up a post on some social media.

>""Did you just compare adultery to rape?"" or ""But all adultery does is hurt the cuck's feelings!""

Yes I did. Both scenarios have the ability to deeply traumatize a victim. Isn't it fucked up that we have a derogatory word for the victim of something nasty? Like damn.

>But what if the spouse is abusive?

Do you seriously think your abusive spouse would react better to being cheated on than to a divorce? Hell no. Just get divorced.

>What should the punishment be?

I don't know. I'm not a lawyer. The CMV is about it being against the law, not about any punishments. Definitely something worse than a mere fine though.

>What about polyamory

My opinion about polygamy aside, nothing I said comes into conflict with it. If you've got multiple partners and you bang someone else, it's cheating if one of them wasn't previously aware.

.

So those were my takes. If there's something I forgot and your comment makes me elaborate on something, that does not constitute a delta, mind. Deltas are about changes in perspective after all."

As an example, here's me quoting the part of the first sentence whee I said ""common grammar rules.""

However, I disagree with this convention, because I think it's clearer if punctuation is only in quotation marks when it's part of what you're quoting, and your own punctuation should be outside of them. The entire point of quotation marks is to say that the content inside them is not your own, and by putting the punctuation of your own sentence, you're essentially lying about what the thing you're quoting said.

Here's another example:

> What did ghandi mean when he said ""an eye for an eye makes the whole work blind?""

In the above example, it seems like I'm saying Ghandi stated it as a question. But he did not. It would be more clear to write

> What did ghandi mean when he said ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.""?

It's clear now that Ghandi's words are a statement, and the question mark belongs to *my* sentence.

Another place this seems weird to me is in regard to lists of items which are individually quoted. 

Traditional grammar example:
> John said he likes cheese because it's ""yellow,"" ""tasty,"" and ""reminds him of the farm.""

The outside punctuation way
> John said he likes cheese because it's ""yellow"", ""tasty"", and ""reminds him of the farm"".

First off, this makes it clearer that John never actually listed the items; instead, I'm the one doing the listing. Secondly, it just looks better! The structure of the sentence isn't muddied by the quoted items because they look more like cohesive units now.

Obviously, this is not a popular opinion because nobody does this. English classes teach inside punctuation, and it's widely established as ""correct"" grammar. If there's a reason, feel free to change my view, and if not, then can we all just start doing it the better way? Thanks."

I know this is definitely true. When I’m aloof and distant with guys, when I’m talking to several guys at once, when I don’t want a relationship and carry that standoffish energy with me,……they chase me. They will bend over backwards for me. 

However as soon as I reciprocate, they lose some of that drive and passion towards me and start taking me for granted. I’ve experienced this not only from guys looking for hookups but even from men who truly wanted to pursue a serious relationship. It’s like a biological thing they can’t control. 

So how does any hetero couple ever end up in a happy relationship? The second the woman starts showing too much interest back, the guy will lose attraction for her. She has to constantly keep him second-guessing himself and afraid of being dumped. Again, I’m not even talking about guys who would want only sex…I’m talking about men who are genuinely looking to settle down. 

I really think that when a woman loves a guy a lot and he realizes she truly wants to be with him too, and she truly does love him and only wants to have sex with him — he loses much of his attraction for her. He starts to take her for granted and starts longing for women who are slightly more mean to him, women whom he can’t have.

1,2023-09-24,"CMV: If you want to homebrew a setting in a TTRPG, don't play Dungeons and Dragons.",u/Riceatron,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16r62qo/cmv_if_you_want_to_homebrew_a_setting_in_a_ttrpg/,changemyview,"To preface, I think homebrew has a place in Dungeons and Dragons, but I think that you have to ask _why_ you're creating a homebrew ruling or setting change every time you make one. Be it lore, or game mechanics, if you have to constantly change aspects of Whatever Edition DnD, maybe you need to consider a different system that already accommodates that style of game.

But as far as worldbuilding, lore, and setting information goes? I think if you're playing a non-generic tabletop game, you as a DM and players should expect to be beholden to as much official lore as you can, and rely on that. Whether that game be Dungeons and Dragons, or Cyberpunk Red. You're given a sandbox to tell a story in, and so much of the content of those games rely on functioning alongside the settings provided with them. 

To me, it would be baffling to have someone say they wanted to run a game of Cyberpunk Red, only to also explain it's all in their own setting and has no relation to Night City or anything Mike Pondsmith created.

Using the 'canon' means both DMs and Players are always on the same page. If playing a purely homebrew setting, the only thing the players know is what the DM reveals to them. Player characters can never know more than what the DM has created, either ahead of time or as a response to specific questions, and are never truly _part_ of the setting. The storytelling of a campaign should be collaborative, and having an established and thought out background helps with this. In a freeform campaign, it allows players to influence actions and directions more often. Maybe this band of adventurers wants to specifically travel to Waterdeep? A DM can read up and provide compelling stories within Waterdeep and the path to it because so much has already been created by writers and creatives for multiple decades.

Similarly, in the inverse, if in an entirely homebrew setting a Player could list they were from a city they themselves created, but unless they specifically went about and spent the effort to design histories, backgrounds, lore, rulers, and whatever it's likely to never be more than just a blurb in their background info. The DM couldn't draw on it for narrative moments that are important to the player and their character, because the DM simply doesn't know any information.  However, if you were to tell your DM that your character was raised on the streets of Neverwinter, there's a massive amount of information both player and DM can work with because of the pre-existing history and culture of the city.

A homebrew setting in most cases is never likely to match the breadth of information and foundational lore that a multi-decade setting like the Forgotten Realms, Night City, or others in other tabletops. I acknowledge this is not always true, one of the most popular DnD products right now is Critical Role and it exists entirely in a homebrewed setting.

However, when it's one only the DM created, with information only the DM knows, it becomes less collaborative storytelling and more akin to railroading players into a metaphorical novel.

If you wish to take those steps, and spend the time to create your own settings and lore, generic systems exist for a reason, and have modular parts that aren't already connected to things you have to change or ignore."

This is for the COVID vaccine only.   And I don’t think that the government would intentionally hijack the vaccine to kill us, or put microchips in us.  However I think there may be negligence.

An ordinary vaccine takes 5-10 years to develop, whereas the first COVID vaccine was developed in under 9 months.  Whilst they may not have skipped the stages, it may have been rushed to get a vaccine out as soon as possible.  And we do not really know the long term effects of the vaccine, over many years on the human body with certainty, as it was only 9 months in development.  This “unknown” possible sideeffect is multiplied when we have multiple boosters.  Like having people triple vaxxed, it multiplies the possible complications 3 fold.  

However I think it may be wise for an aging elderly person or someone with health problems that would exacerbate COVID to take it, since the risk of dying from COVID would probably outweigh the risk of dying from the vaccine.  Just that if you are healthy, it probably should be thought about. The vaccine debate feels a little cut and dry, and for even suggesting that the COVID vaccines could have negative side effects you are denounced as a crackpot anti vaxxer.  I think the loudest minority of screamers got all the attention and gave moderates on the vaccine a bad rep, getting clumped in with those lot.

I also want to mention that the vaccines aren’t really 100% effective.  Even if you are triple vaxxed you can still contract COVID and even have it potentially be fatal, which makes me even less on the side of the vaccine.  

I’m really thinking the chances of significant negative side effects are probably quite unlikely but this still warrants a level of scrutiny.  I don’t think many people actually did much research and blindly took the vaccine, and got triple vaxxed. 

I’m actually pretty open to having my mind changed here.  I won’t lie, and say I did an extreme amount of research, which is why I’m a bit more open."

Yes? Then you should feel ashamed of yourself and not be allowed near money, people or communication. No? Congratulations, you understand the basic concept of language.

Evil genies work by interpretating the wish in a way that fucks over the wisher, but still asheres to the wording of the wish. Except that words do not have, and never had, any inherant meaning. Meaning is something the speaker tries to put into the words, and the listener tries to take out of the words. A speaker wishing for money clearly does not desire to die to money appearing in an inconvenient format and space. If a genie genuinely thinks that that's what the person wants, they're clearly an utter idiot and while tragic, not clever or interesting. With that level of idioticy, they might as well have done any other random thing while claiming to fulfill the wish.

A genie who understands the meaning correctly, but deliberately misinterprets it, isn't clever or interesting either. They don't interpretate the words in a valid, but inconvenient way - they ""interpretate"" the words in a way they are aware is utterly divorced from what the speaker actually tried to convey. They're basically ignoring the communication in favor of doing random shit that only seems related to the words on a surface level.

The only reason people ever thought the concept of evil genies was something other than braindead torture porn is because most people don't actually grasp the meaning of communication."

However, it's nothing more than thinly-veiled intolerance.  Not only does it falsely homogenize Asian-Americans and downplay issues that they may face, but it has been used as a weapon against other minority groups, especially African-Americans.  Implying that black culture is what inhibits them from having equal opportunities and trying to deflect from systemic injustices.  In other words, a ""bootstraps"" message.

When right-wingers say that they aren't homophobic but express negative sentiment towards pride events and ""gay culture"" or gays ""making their orientation their identity"" (not verbatim), I'm getting the same vibe associated with the model minority trope.  While they may not outright hate gay people, their acceptance of gays is on the condition that they are complicit and adhere to old-fashioned social norms.  It's not overt homophobia but still hostile as it suggests being out of the closet and having a culture that celebrates pride in harmless ways is wrong.  Not unlike the model minority idea, where people of color are expected to ""earn"" their respect by assimilating to the culture of white americans and not protesting against inequality.

To be clear, I am aware that many people upset with pride events are outright hateful.  Also, I am not talking about those who dislike corporations having promotions related to pride month due to the fact that it's an empty gesture for making profit and not actually solving social injustice.  Nor do I include those who are inconvenienced in actual ways by pride parades."

I am a poc of Asian descent but I’m fairly dark and have ethic features. For as long as I can remember it was the idea standard for women to look like Marilyn Monroe or Angelina Jolie etc and nobody has went against this notion and tried to be more inclusive even though it was harmful, nobody was saying we’re setting up unrealistic expectations for young women and so forth. During this time all u saw was poc being ridiculed especially the darker they were. There were whole twitter accounts dedicated to nothing but making sure poc knew they were ugly and undesirable and nobody even bothered to care other than the people it was directed to and even then they simply were basically shushed about and continuously had to try to conform to the standards even through it was pretty much impossible . Now that beauty standards are just slightly not in the favor of ww people want to call it out and make this a “we’re all in this together” thing?  I’m honestly just not failing for it and it shows so many people only care when they are effected. 
When society said have hair like Marilyn Monroe everyone was like “yes every women should it’s so beautiful” 
Now society Saids something simple like have skin as smooth as a Asian women’s or a butt like a black women or lips like a Hispanic women and it’s no we can’t do this to our girls it’s so unrealistic and we’re setting them up to fail beauty standards are harmful and wrong. And people seem to ignore the standards that’s are still favorable to ww which is pretty much most of them. I’ve yet to see anyone say having blue eyes is Unrealistic and harmful and we shouldn’t idealize it. 
And ik all these features or interchangeable and don’t simply belong to one race but I hope everyone gets my drift. I fully feel that if the standards started being more favorable again things would go back to normal and it’ll be look like Marilyn Monroe or ur ugly again."

&#x200B;

\>Sealioning (also sea-lioning and sea lioning) is a type of trolling or harassment that consists of pursuing people with relentless requests for evidence, often tangential or previously addressed, while maintaining a pretense of civility and sincerity (""I'm just trying to have a debate""), and feigning ignorance of the subject matter.

&#x200B;

You'll often see \[this comic\]([https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/%22The\_Terrible\_Sea\_Lion%22.\_Wondermark\_comic\_strip\_No.\_1062\_by\_David\_Malki\_%2819\_September\_2014%29.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/%22The_Terrible_Sea_Lion%22._Wondermark_comic_strip_No._1062_by_David_Malki_%2819_September_2014%29.png)) being presented.

&#x200B;

But let's consider what's being said here- the people in this comic are disparaging sealions without giving any justification or reason for doing so. It's one thing to say ""I don't like ISIS"", that's obvious. But what is inherently wrong with a sealion, and what cause does a person have to make such a negative generalization? I  believe accusing someone of ""sealioning"" in a debate is mostly a debate tactic narcissists and manipulative/disingenuous people employ.

&#x200B;

Let's give an example.

&#x200B;

Suppose I say ""Hey, you shouldn't even talk to Fred, he distributes child pornography"" and assume I am wrong, and that Fred does not.

&#x200B;

Fred would rightly be outraged and defend himself/demand an answer:

""What are you talking about? No I don't, what evidence do you have?""

&#x200B;

""Fred, stop sealioning.""

&#x200B;

Does that make sense? No, right? While that may be an extreme example, it is basically the gist of why accusing someone of sealioning is usually a fallacy at best, and intentionally disingenuous at worst (and most common.)

1,2023-09-25,cmv: Lord of the Rings is a bad book trilogy.,u/DayOrNightTrader,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16rm9qo/cmv_lord_of_the_rings_is_a_bad_book_trilogy/,changemyview,"Basically the title. I love Lord of the Rings. I love the universe and I love its lore. But talking and thinking about LOTR is so much funnier than actually reading it.

The book feels long and boring. Tolkien reveals too many details that later play no part in the story, like he talks about the relatives of Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's dead parents, etc. And yet it is never brought up. Everyone who seen/read Harry Potter knows that his parents were murdered by Voldemort when Harry was little. Although many people who read/seen LOTR casually don't remember what happened to Frodo's parents, because it plays no part in the story.

Instead of starting the book with a teaser, something intriguing, or an action scene, Tolkien feels you in on Hobbit lore, Bilbo's relatives and neighbors who are play no part in the story. Frodo left the Shire when he was 50, and during the Bilbo's birthday party Frodo was 33, many years have passed without any freaking character development. Honestly, if Tolkien just started with the scene where the hobbits hide from 'THEM', listening to the ground, hiding off the road, and whispering about how they need to protect IT from THEM at all cost. The story would feel much more engaging, and fewer people would drop the book right there.

Tolkien fills the book with a ton of lore through exposition. George Martin never tells the reader that ""The king cannot just gather his own army at will, he has to write a letter to a bannermen. And the bannerman can refuse to provide the army, and claim that he is busy calming a peasant revolt or something. You of course can declare him a traitor, but since you are already at war, and in need of soldiers, making another enemy won't be helpful at all, so you will have to deal with the guy later"".

Or that they celebrate name day, instead of birthday. Or that they have long summers and winters. 

Martin just SHOWS it to you through dialogue between the characters. And the characters talk naturally, not as if they needed to make sure that the reader understands what's going on. And you CAN understand how the society of Westeros works even if you never took medieval history and are not aware of feudalism. And there's also no 'know-it-all' character to conveniently enlighten the main character with useful information.

Tolkien on the other hand prefers to just throw a ton of exposition onto the reader. And Tolkin's exposition is often very confusing. In the prologue, we learn that Gollum claims that the magic ring was a gift he received on his birthday. But later we read that hobbits GIVE AWAY presents on their birthday. Why did Gollum receive a gift on a birthday, wasn't he a hobbit?

Also, Tolkien's descriptions sometimes break the 4th wall, which is kinda bad writing. For example, during the Bilbo's birthday party Tolkien wrote ""The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion"".

Honestly, why are you comparing a firework dragon to a train? There are no trains in the Middle Earth. First time I read LotR I wasn't reading it in English, I read a translated version. And this sentence was so bad that the translators just removed it LMAO"

1,2023-09-25,CMV: the Rashimi case set to be heard by the US Supreme Court exposes the flaws in their Bruen decision,u/I_am_the_night,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16rr9zb/cmv_the_rashimi_case_set_to_be_heard_by_the_us/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer just an interested reader 

For those unfamiliar, [*US v. Rahimi*](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/30/1185371815/supreme-court-domestic-abuse-guns) is a case currently set to be heard by the supreme court in the upcoming term.  [It involves a man from Texas](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-weigh-legality-domestic-violence-gun-curbs-2023-06-30/) who was accused of domestic violence and assault after he knocked his then girlfriend to the ground, dragged her to his car and forced her inside (injuring her on the way in), then grabbed a gun, and fired a shot at a bystander who witnessed the incident. Subsequently she obtained a restraining order against him which he violated leading to his arrest.  

Afterwards, police searched his home and found his guns, after which he was charged with violating the 1994 Federal Firearms act which prohibits those with restraining orders/OOP for domestic violence from possessing firearms due to the overwhelming statistical evidence showing that armed domestic abusers pose a huge risk to the lives of their victims.  Rahimi pled guilty to that charge, but later appealed on the grounds that it violates his second amendment right to bear arms.

The first judge rejected his appeal, but the 5th circuit overturned his conviction with the majority opinion essentially stating that while armed domestic abusers who pose an active risk to their victims is a real and widespread problem in the US today, laws prohibiting violent domestic abusers with restraining  as a class from possessing firearms are not constitutional.  The rationale for this ruling was that per the legal test created by the Supreme Court in the *Bruen* case, laws prohibiting violent domestic abusers with orders of protection against them are not part of the ""history and tradition"" of firearms regulation in the country as there was essentially no legal effort to target domestic abuse as a problem for the first two centuries the US existed, nevermind the more recent efforts to restrict firearm access for such abusers.  

In the *Bruen* case the Supreme Court decided that firearms laws and regulations must be in line with the US ""history and tradition"" of firearm legislation.  This means that a firearm law will only be considered constitutional if it has ""historical analogues"" to firearm legislation *as it existed at the time the second amendment was ratified in 1791 or when it was incorporated against the states in 1868.*

Thus, because there weren't any firearm laws preventing or restricting firearm possession for people with restraining orders for domestic violence and a proven history of being an active threat to their victims, the 1994 law restricting firearm possession in those individuals cannot be constitutional.

My view is that this case really just highlights how absurd the logic behind *Bruen* really is, and how contrived that decision really was.  To me it shows that *Bruen* was ultimately was just decided because the conservatives on the court wanted to prevent as many firearm restrictions as possible because that's part of the conservative political project so they made up a legal years that would be extremely difficult if not nigh-insurmountable to clear (if the judge in your case is even slightly aligned with current American conservatives with regards to the second amendment.)

It effectively creates a one-way ratchet on gun rights because it limits or prevents any firearm legislation or regulation that isn't sufficiently similar to any that existed in the late 18th and mid 19th centuries.  So novel approaches to firearm regulation or even old approaches to tackling novel firearm issues in the modern day are almost entirely preempted right out of the gate unless you can convince a judge of the similarity to a past firearm restriction.  How similar is similar enough?  How analogous does it have to be? Who knows! (Except Clarence Thomas, apparently).  Does this law actually meaningfully restrict someone's right to bear arms? Who cares that's not part of the test anymore.

This means that basically any firearm legislation or regulation since 1868 is potentially on the chopping block AND that new firearm legislation is essentially dead unless you can convince someone like Cory Wilson or James Ho (who literally spent time in his Rahimi concurrence whining about how he thinks civil protective orders are too often misused in divorce proceedings) that it would have been in line with laws that existed between ~50-120 years before modern firearms did regardless of whether it even would meaningfully infringe on an individuals ability to bear arms.

Frankly, this is an absurd line of reasoning and is clearly an argument crafted out of ~~Clarence Thomas' soda-covered pubic hair~~ the conservative justices' conservative political agenda rather than any solid legal principles or any practical consideration for how the government should adapt to modern times or address societal problems.

(And don't even get me started on how this ruling conflicts with the logic of their other rulings on different issues.)

So change my view."

It is usually cast aside because the logitiscal implications of such a system would be too great. I agree, but that isn't the only way to acheive the goal.

There are many positions on dog training and dog ownership that are held by a majority of experts and backed up by peer-reviewed studies (socialization is vital, negative reinforcement doesn't work, etc.). There are also empirical facts (owning a dog costs between 20 and 55k over the cost of their lifetime, some breeds have a provable likelihood of contracting an expensive illness). Yet, [54% of dog owners have regrets about getting a dog](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/pet-insurance/survey-pet-ownership-regret-dog/). [26% of people who give up their dogs do so because the medical expenses are too high.](https://www.aspca.org/about-us/press-releases/more-1-million-households-forced-give-their-beloved-pet-each-year-aspca)

The point can't be reasonably argued that: a significant portion of the general dog owning population is dramatically undereducated about the responsibility of dog ownership.

A multiple choice test is frequently used to determine access to certain privelages. For a lot of things, you can take an online test for a nominal fee. The logistical implications for this are minimal. Set up a website, compile reasearch, prove that you've discussed the questions with experts, and people bring the certificate in themselves. It could easily be funded with donations and kept running with the fees.

It is not a silver bullet. It is an acknowledgement that at one time, a prospective dog owner had to breifly retain that their new dog was going to cost them a lot of money and require a lot of time. If their life circumstances change, that's one thing, but they will for (a small amount of time) be presented with the information that they'll have to afford another 3k a year if they want the dog. The efficacy rate of this is impossible to speculate. My argument is that this method has been deemed essential for many other priveleges. 

For those who will say shelters are overcrowded, that dogs need to be adopted, and we shouldn't put ANY financial barrier in place; I disagree. I believe more dogs will be put down at first, but that the situation will correct itself as the population becomes slightly more educated leading to a generally higher quality of life for a higher number of dogs.

&#x200B;

* People - especially poor people - may cheat the system to gain more income by donating blood more frequently than is permitted, and thus endanger their own health/safety in the process.
* Paying people for money comes across as mercenary, and ruins the ""generosity"" spirit of the thing - what is supposed to be selfless giving that comes out of the goodness of one's heart is instead motivated by $$$.

&#x200B;

The first objection is one that I fully concur with - there are plenty of people who are desperate enough for money that they might try to donate blood more frequently than is safe for them to. We can't have a pay-to-donate system without it being very comprehensive and rigorous to prevent cheaters.

But the second objection, IMHO, has no merit. We already pay people to donate plasma, and you don't hear many objections about how the money ruins the feel-good nature of the thing. 

Even more importantly, though - the blood shortage is always a serious issue. Given the short shelf life of blood, blood banks and hospitals are always in a situation of need. I don't think that any patient who has just lost a lot of blood in a severe accident and is in danger of losing their life without immediate blood transfusions is ever going to object to blood because ""It was donated by a donor who was just in it for the money, as opposed to being motivated by generosity and kindness."" Need is need.

So if paying people for blood donations is what it takes to solve the always-present blood shortage, I'm fully in favor of it, and I can't see why society should be against it - unless the objection is that such fees would cost too much, but given that America already spends $4 trillion on healthcare every year, I think that paying donors a couple hundred dollars per blood donation would be only a drop in the bucket - and may in fact even *save* money, considering the improvement that increased blood supply would bring to the healthcare system."

Even if you think the belief in god/religion to be the best thing that can happen to a human.  Even if you believe that we would slaughter each other in the street if it wasn’t for the moral code we got from the ancient scriptures. or even if you’re certain the pinnacle of human creativity and arts were reached thanks to the importance of god in our societies. Or if you are sure that deep down even the most die hard atheist will invoke god when the time comes. 
All of that adds 0 to the proof that a superior being actually exists. 
As a atheist I could be sympathetic to a believer saying “look, no one really knows if there’s a god, but believing in it makes us better”, I may not necessarily agree but at least it makes sense. But using that in order to prove that god/religions are more than a human creation is dumb."

The answer is simple: leaders are a reflection of the electorate. If we reward loudmouthed charlatans in the polls, those are the people in power. Let’s face it, people in the west aren’t what they used to be. We used to be strong, capable, open, and intellectually curious.

A full QUARTER of Americans are considered “functionally illiterate” (which is exactly what you think it means)!

It's calling out the double standards of law enforcement.

Everyone can agree that police should at minimum have sound judgement, not be racist, as well as be trusted to protect and serve their community.

Unfortunately that's not common enough. But let's not stop there.

How many cops have you seen driving around on their cell phones? Speeding without their lights on? Illegally parked and not on a call? Making illegal uturns? Expecting free/ discounted food? When I worked in customer service I even had a cop have a tantrum that I couldn't give them the police discount when they were off the clock (I recognized them, as they were a regular)

Yet when starving, hungry people steal food they throw the book at them and put them in jail. They park where nobody else is allowed to park looking for others speeding, when that's all they do all day. Giving tickets for not stopping long enough for right on red and they don't even brake at the red light when nobody's coming. Etc. But it's a hell worthy offense if anyone else does any of this.

Imo an officer should have a dashcam on them at all times in addition to body cams. If they're speeding with no cause, they lose their job. Riding around holding their cellphones? No job. Any offense they ticket others for, if they are caught doing it, no job.

They can't even follow the law and they're supposed to enforce it? The hypocritical cops should just get fired. If they don't care enough about the law to follow it themselves they need to find a new line of work."

I go on a lot of walks and I love going for walks and the best time to go for a walk is in fall and spring and I like seeing the transition and seeing leaves fall during the fall or bud and flowers bloom during the spring. The temperature is perfect in the fall and spring which means it's not too cold or hot and it's the best time for going for walks. Summer time is an awful time to go for a walk because its way too hot and all that exercise can make your body produce more heat and make it worse and it's harder to cool off than warm up even if you drink a lot of water that still don't help as much because the air around you that hot. yeah it does look ugly in the winter due to no leaves on the trees it is much easier to fight off the cold than the heat because you can put many layers on and all that exercise can make your body produce heat and fight cold but during the summer you are only adding heat to the fire when your exercise so the cold is not that bad because your body is producing heat as you exercise and also if it's not too cold then it is fine. Yes I know the day lengths are shorter during which suck but least the sun is pointing at an angle and it's not direct light which beats you during the summer.

If all I had was a burger and a coke, all I should be paying for is the burger, coke, and tax +  tip. 

I do not want to pay for your endless shots. 
I do not want to pay for your ribeye steak. 
I do not want to pay for anything that wasn’t mine. 

“But you’re an adult, it’s what adults do! No one has time to sit around and do the math. Grow up!” 
 
No, it’s clown behavior. Adults keep track of what they got and know what to put down towards the bill. For example, If my burger and coke was $20, I should put down $25-$30 after tax and tip. Don’t ask me to put down $70. Don’t ask me to put down $50. Don’t ask me for anything over $30 unless I’m also paying for someone else(girlfriend, etc.). 

The only time I will pay for someone else is if I’m with my girlfriend, parents, or siblings. With them I never think twice and am more than happy to treat them. I’ll also pay if I initiated the group dinner. (In my culture, whoever initiates the party/dinner is who pays. Doesn’t matter if it’s 5, 15, or 30 people). 

But if it’s a group dinner where we all planned to go out together, absolutely not. Only what I ordered. Don’t be unfair."

2. Germany wasn’t a victim, they started the war in the first place and committed the Holocaust and killed 25 million people in Eastern Europe.

3. Many of the Germans that were expelled had had it coming to them, they weren’t innocent.

What I will say, however, is that I don’t believe it was right for the Soviet Union to give these areas to Poland and ethnically cleanse the land of Germans after the war, and that it is understandable and not a far-right idea if anybody wished that this didn’t happen in the first place."

I've always hated metal clippers; they irritate my skin and make me feel uncomfortable. Whenever I need to trim my nails, I 1: thuroughly wash and clean them to remove pathogens, 2: use my sharp, secondary incisors to cleanly cut the excess off and 3: wash my mouth out once I'm done. 18 years of doing this hasn't let me down yet, and while most people are fine with clippers, I don't think this kind of method should be shunned or treated like sin.

1,2023-09-26,CMV: All recreational drugs should be legal in all countries.,u/baby-silly-head,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16sfkgx/cmv_all_recreational_drugs_should_be_legal_in_all/,changemyview,"Approximately 3% of Colombia's (known) GDP comes from the sale of cocaine or cocaine products (such as less-produced coca leaf). This may not seem like a lot, but it's enough to make farmers in Colombia see the value of coca as much more valuable than that if other crops, meaning that growing other crops is no longer lucrative and farmers must partake in an illegal market in order to make ends meet. If people are growing and selling coca in your area, you can't afford to grow and sell bananas (for example).

Meanwhile, in many countries, fentanyl overdoses are at an all time high (no pun intended). Fentanyl is a drug that it's often cut into cocaine because it is much cheaper to produce and 'adds to the high' (but can also kill you). Many people who use fentanyl think they're ""just"" using cocaine.

The society (drug wars) that this illegal market has created in Colombia means that people want complete control over the export of this drug, resulting in a society based on crime. Crime in itself as a concept has stopped mattering and it's been normalized to kill people, hire hits, threaten in extremes, for reasons that are not even drug-related such as a cheating husband (for example).

My view is that people are going to use drugs whether we condone it or not.

If Canada could be used as an example, the idea in legalizing marijuana is that the country could actually make money in consumer taxes on, in his case, a relatively harmless drug (much less harmful than alcohol - it does not induce aggression generally).

If all drugs were legalized, not only would we be able to regulate harmful additions to supply (as is the case of fentanyl), but we would also solve the problem of extreme corruption and lack of tax payer benefit for countries that produce essential products for the supply.

I think about safe-injection sites for people who are addicted to drugs like heroine or meth. Legalizing drugs provides safe-""injection"" (usually not injected but consumed) for all people who may be interested in using drugs.

If drugs were legalized, users would go to a store and purchase their drug of choice, perhaps increasing accessibility of drugs. With proper education, would that increase the number of users? Maybe. But at least farmers in Colombia will live in an economy that allows them to grow something other than coca, for example, and at least people wouldn't (usually) be consuming deadly drugs that contain fentanyl. Additionally, drugs would be a part of the regular market, taxed, and allow countries to further educate citizens on safe drug use.

TL;DR: Drugs should be legalized in order to tax, regulate, and increase the safety of people who use them."

I can't think of a single situation where people a small and vulnerable minority at the mercy of a larger majority group has ever been an appealing option, at any point in history.

Because of this, once white people become a smaller and smaller minority, they will very likely experience the same kind of pattern of disenfranchisement, discrimination and worse that is already experienced by minority groups on a global scale.

As a result, any white people who do have concerns about becoming a minority group are *probably* justified."

Once in July of this year and a week or two ago, that the United States will have to fight Russia if Ukraine falls. There is a rightfully held suspicion that the overall goal of Russia is to test article 5 of nato, that says nato will treat an attack on one of its members as an attack on all. Vladimir putin knows Russia outnumbers nato 10 to 1 with tactical nuclear weapons, aka small nukes that can be used in close proximity to their forces during invasions. The only deterrent nato has is its powerful non tactical all out nuclear weapons, which Russia believes nato will not use to protect Latvia or Estonia because it would receive a full out Russian nuclear response in return. Dimitri medvedev, the Russian defense council chairman and former Russian president, has said openly this summer the Baltics belong to Russia. And there is justification in taking it militarily, medvedev coincidentally said this after the baltics have been sounding alarms that Russia is going to take them after they take Ukraine. The baltics are especially terrified because there is a presidential election, and one of the candidates has said nato might not come to the aid of certain countries if they do not pay up. It would be difficult to imagine medvedev wasn’t paying attention to those comments

I don’t think that’s hyperbole. I think pence is 100% correct when he says this. I really don’t understand the argument against it. The pentagon seems to agree, so does Europe. That russia is not going to stop at Ukraine and will be looking to pursue other countries as well. In 2017 Putin told us defense secretary James Matt is Russia would not hesitate to use tactical nuclear weapons against nato if Russia invaded the baltics and nato attempted to stop them with their own nato conventional forces. putin has moved tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which border all of the Baltic nations. It’s not safe to say this cannot or wont happen, it’s not even safe to say the United States itself is safe from attack anymore. Russia and chinas joint patrol off the Coast of Alaska is proof that even the u.s. homeleand is no longer safe. all the signs are there mike pence is telling the truth. The USA will have to fight Russia if Ukraine falls because russia will then proceed to attack nato members itself. and i think people need to understand this fact before they can make an informed choice on whether we should support Ukraine or not. It’s about way more than just money or guns

Here's why it's trending on social media and why people are obsessed with this:

The average person feels unhappy, depressed, lonely and broke, they don't have the opportunity to enrich their lives and do something productive, so they want to find happiness in the celebrities and their lives, song lyrics and movie quotes and associate with them. Let's take Taylor Swift for example:  ""Taylor Swift is hot, tall, rich and famous, and she can date whatever guy she can, but I can't"", ""T. S. can roam around the world but I can't step out of my house"" or ""T.S. can spend a fair amount of money on a mansion or a pair of leather boots, but I can't even buy a graphic t-shirt or a bottle of water"". 

Same goes for the media. There are enough turmoil in the world which makes us hopeless for the future of the world and humanity, so the media and general public wants to find some feel good news.

For these reasons neither media nor the general public should be bashed for celebrity obsession."

1,2023-09-26,"CMV: Even though people in South African identify as 'coloured', they can also be accurately described as 'black' in the US",u/shartweekondvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16sq2d8/cmv_even_though_people_in_south_african_identify/,changemyview,"This debate is something I saw play out on tiktok which is obviously not a great format for long form discussion, and in general the comments there don't tend to have as much depth as here. 

&#x200B;

I'll try to be as brief as possible with this part but context: this started because there's a South African artist, Tyla, who is getting more and more popular in the US, and a black, American girl on tiktok named Simone shouted her out saying that she 'loves seeing Tyla have this moment right now because black R&B girls have a hard time getting eyes on them'. South Africans flooded her comments mostly about the pronunciation of her name, but also brought up that she's a 'coloured woman' not a 'black woman'. Simone then double, tripled, quadruple downed in saying that while she understands that 'coloured' is very much a thing in South Africa, as it is not a thing in the US, has an incredibly dubious historical context, and she therefore won't refer to her as coloured. This obviously bothered South Africans in the coloured community and led to a series of back and forth videos/comments. 

&#x200B;

So I should preface this with -- I am a **white woman**. I know that I ultimately don't have a say on either side as to what the individual communities can and should be able to call themselves. That being said,  I tried to take my own race/background/privilege out of the picture and try and view it not necessarily from Simone's POV but more of a relatively neutral one. Here are my main reasons why I don't think it's wrong for Simone -- or any other American including myself -- to refer to her as a black artist:  


A) In the US, and as an American woman/speaking with an American voice, we don't use 'coloured' anymore to describe people. It goes without saying that that's incredibly emotionally charged/dubious language to use when describing people in this country. Obviously there are exceptions e.g. 'People of Color' and 'NAACP' but the former is used to be inclusive to marginalized groups and the latter is an incredibly old name of an anti-racist organization (even this I don't love -- like i feel uncomfy saying the full name -- but again, as a white woman, I don't get a say here). I get that Tyla is South African but Simone is American. She speaks from that context. Further, I guess she could say 'mixed', 'multiracial', whatever but we also don't designate 'blackness' like that for good reason. 

&#x200B;

B) A lot of people said to point 1, 'yes but that is her identity and calling her black, even if it's right in the US, it is stripping her of her identity'. I get this sentiment, however in the same way that coloured can mean two different things in two different places, so can black. So: 

* Coloured: In the US it is not okay and racist to use to refer to people. In South Africa, it's a distinct ethnic community in the country
* Black: In the US, this refers to anyone with African heritage/who has phenotypically mid- to dark-skin. In South Africa, it's another distinct ethnic community in the country. 

With this view, both 'black' and 'coloured' are correct when referring to an artist like Tyla but it simply depends on the context of who is speaking. I think it's really important to point this out because South Africans in this convo are saying 'Yes we understand what coloured means to y'all but coloured is this to us', but not taking that train of thought further to flip it on the other side for 'black' (if that makes sense). 

&#x200B;

C) I think this is ultimately my strongest argument and is basically a part 2 of point B. I honestly think that if the specific word 'black' wasn't used to refer to another, distinct community besides 'coloured' in South Africa, this would all be super irrelevant. Like, if there was a 'coloured community' and a (just using a random word here) 'book community' that is the same as the black community in South Africa, this whoooooole conversation would be moot. Simply because the words are the same, this becomes an issue, in my opinion, of South Africans in the coloured community wishing to other themselves from the black one. 

&#x200B;

I won't act like I know all of the historical context behind coloured versus black people in South Africa... and it's why I'm leaving out my personal skepticism of the coloured community in S.A. holding onto historically problematic language for themselves... i just don't know enough about it. But some of the (US) black voices who have joined into this conversation on tiktok have mentioned how the whole conversations reeks of coloured South Africans not wanting to be associated with 'icky black people'. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, my general thesis is that it is both correct for someone to refer to an artist like Tyla as **both** black and coloured. Simone calling her black isn't inherently wrong, nor is it stripping her of her identity because she is not calling her ""South African black"" -- that WOULD be wrong. She is simply saying that in the context that I know and live, she is a black woman. 

&#x200B;

There are other points that I could get into in terms of optics of *very light skin* (like my skin tone) tiktokers making response videos to Simone (who is a dark skinned black woman) telling her what coloured means to them and demanding she apologize -- again remember this is over a video of her shouting out this South African artist. And another point, again, the root of the word 'coloured' in South Africa but I can't speak on this with authority. Anyway, I hope that this has all made sense, thanks in advance for the discussion.

I bring this up because it's a regular dilemma on relationship forums, and it nearly always seems to boil down to someone not feeling appreciated for their contributions to the relationship.


The reason for my belief on this is that time and time again talking to both men and women who are experiencing difficulties in their relationship it boils down to someone not feeling appreciated, and finances are often a huge issue when it comes to arguements and hurt feelings. One person often feels taken advantage of, even if they aren't being.

What might change my view here is a reasonable arguements as to why appreciation shouldn't be given for financial contributions, and why someone shouldn't have to give appreciation for the extra luxuries they are benefiting from due to them being in a relationship.

I'm completely leaving married couples out of this CMV because in my opinion that's a completely different scenario altogether.

Can anyone change my view on this (again I don't want my view changed on marriage being different)."

I don’t think the double standards on how male vs female casual sex is treated are a bad thing. I think that, while rooted in traditional gendered norms, they are part of a larger societal balance between men and women on casual sex. 

I think women are benefactors by generally controlling access to relationships and the leverage they have in choosing.
The downside is having to deal with slut shaming and ‘purity culture’.
Inversely, I think men are benefactors by not having to deal with slut-shaming, even sometimes being praised for casual sexual encounters.
The downside is being the pursuers, having to court for access to relationships/sex.

I’ve been struggling with whether this idea is misogynistic. Many believe it to be so. Please share different perspectives on this, and whether this balance should even exist at all.

I don’t want to subscribe to misogynistic views, but I don’t truly agree this is a sexist way of thinking, since both the men and women have benefits and cons on the topic. Open to all opinions. Thank you."

1,2023-09-26,CMV: The Ukraine war shows that the much-hated military-industrial complex is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have.,u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16sssne/cmv_the_ukraine_war_shows_that_the_muchhated/,changemyview,"Few industries are despised more in the West than the military-industrial complex. Prior to the Ukraine war, progressive politicians (and some conservatives as well) constantly railed against the defense industry, questioning why the United States was spending $800 billion a year on the military when that money could have gone towards \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert your cause of choice: education, healthcare, social cause, etc.) instead. Western European nations, by and large, spent relatively little on defense (despite a NATO pledge for each member to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense). When you asked liberal voters what government item they wanted the most to see big budget cuts on, they would almost invariably say the military.

But the Ukraine war suddenly changed the tunes of many such folks. The same folks who decried the billions of dollars spent on weaponry production suddenly fretted about whether the U.S. would be able to manufacture enough 155mm artillery shells in time to assist Ukraine. The same people who thought of the U.S. defense industry as a useless pit for taxpayer dollars to be wasted now complain that we're not sending enough Abrams tanks, ATACMS, Javelins, Stingers or F-16s to Ukraine. The Daily Kos, a very left-leaning publication, has suddenly featured numerous pro-Ukraine articles detailing the need for U.S. military support of Ukraine and the amount of such.

And not to take anything away from the courage and ingenuity of the Ukrainians, who have fought more bravely and cleverly than perhaps any nation we've seen in decades, but it can clearly be seen that if it weren't for the massive amount of Western military assistance that had been given to Ukraine in the form of artillery (Ukraine was on pace to run out of its small Soviet-type artillery arsenal a year ago,) intelligence, portable anti-tank and anti-air missiles, anti-air defense (Kyiv and other major cities were repeatedly vulnerable to Russian air attacks until recently, when Western Gepards/NASAMS/Patriot/IRIS-T arrived), Ukraine would be in a far worse position than it is today. None of that would have been possible without a substantial military-industrial complex in the West.

You can't get this sort of thing on short notice. If the West had neglected defense and a war like the Ukraine conflict had broken out, it would have been impossible to spool up in time. Modern advanced military systems take years to develop. 

All of this shows is that the defense industry of the West - particularly the United States' - is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have. The whole point of a military is similar to that of the function of a fire department - it's not something you **want** to have to use, but you need it to be there for emergencies. (Assuming your military is used for defense, not offense, of course.) Furthermore, the same progressives who complain about $800 billion spent on the military often overlook the fact that the United States spends far **more** than that on healthcare, Medicare, Social Security every year. The military is actually a relatively small component of the U.S. federal budget.

Of course, there are major issues with over-pricing and bloat in the U.S. defense industry (there's no excuse for F-35 development and production to have been the SNAFU that it was,) and much reform is needed. But the Ukraine war has shown that a military-industrial complex is something people like to hate in peacetime, but learn to grasp the value of in wartime.

I took into consideration that she might have been trolling the whole time and she just loves to act as this parody of a human being to produce funny parody online content but I have never witnessed or at least I don't recall a person degrading themselves to this point just for a parody character and keep it up for so long. 

So,  since I'm having trouble believing that a person can be this dumb, I conclude that she is part of a sting operation orchestrated by a law enforcement or intelligence agency possibly in a joint operation with Interpol with the goal being to get close to certain red pill gurus who are suspected to participate in either sex trafficking, tax fraud, drug trafficking or crypto scams, gain their trust while acting as an informant and feeding her handlers with useful intel regarding their activities."

Microscopic organisms are some of the most complex and difficult to understand machines on earth. More so we often can't see them directly or expect that they'll always behave in the same way.

We've known DNA exists for over 100 years now and we still can't understand the machinery that goes into pulling apart the chromosomes during cell division or how a cell knows exactly when it's ready to divide. 

We have a difficult time combatting viruses because the trick of killing the virus without killing the host cell responsible for replicating it is incredibly hard to solve.

I've heard a lot of people say that biology is largely about memorization but when you consider the sheer number of things you have to remember it's an incredibly daunting task. 

Physics at the sub atomic scale gets confusing but that's because it seems to defy our understanding of how things work in the universe. And yes there are an infinite way you can put together organic molecules in chemistry but chemistry is still working off equations and very hard set laws. "

In the world of Ratatouille, rats are intelligent creatures akin to humans that live secluded from society as they are deemed a pest just like in our world. Slowly the rats gain the trust of the kitchen workers at a famed restaurant and eventually work together. Sounds nice and optimistic; on the surface. But what's really going on is actually quite disturbing.

Rats are ostrasized from society for being regarded as disease carrying thiefs. However, they are intelligent creatures and understand human language. Surely at some point before the movie someone must have noticed that the rats seem to understand humans. In fact, Linguini does learn of the Remy's intelligence relatively early in the movie but only accepts him as a friend under the condition that he helps him cook. This is evident when Remy helps his fellow rats with food and Linguini throws him out without any compromise telling him that the next time he'd treat them like the pest they are. He regards them as a pest even after realizing that they are intelligent beings. Just like a Nazi might find interest in a jewish person for any particular reason but would ultimately distrust them on a fundamental level. 

What others see is a story of two disgruntled communities, rats and humans, comming together and forgetting their differences. What i see is the unjust ostracization and persecution of a minority group (minority in power not in numbers) by the ruling group. Constantly are we reminded that Remy shouldn't steal but really, what are the rats supposed to do? They steal food because they have to. It's not like they could just join the humans and grow their own food. They are hunted by humans, not for being thiefs, but for being rats. Just like jewish people were persecuted not for any particular characteristic of jewish culture but simply for being jewish. And it's not like the movie finds a resolution for this problem, in the end the rats still live secluded in the attic of a restaurant and get exploited for their talent. Colette, the only female cast in the entire movie (for some reason there aren't even female rats?) makes a remark towards the male dominated hierarchy present in the restaurant business and how hard she had to work to get to her position, yet she falls in love with hotshot Linguini who in fact is a fraud. They degraded the only woman in the movie from a badass chef to the love interest of Linguini, who for some reason becomes the chef of the restaurant that he has worked in for maybe a week at that time.

I don't think he has any ideological integrity and the majority of his policy is just to be contrarian for the sake of being a contrarian.

Things like threatening to leave NATO, his policy towards Ukraine, and starting the trade war with China. He's undoubtedly left a negative impression with our allies (setting tariffs on Germany and the UK) and generally being a joke amongst their citizens.

I'm not completely against everything he did during his presidency, like trying to get NATO allies to spend more on defense or restructuring NAFTA. But, things like constantly using an us vs them mentality has really divided people, not to mention encouraging rumors like Qanon or his poor response to rioters (the capital included). He seems have little to no mind for compromise and completely disregards moderate/bipartisan policy. He's done tremendous damage towards our institutions, things like going after the director of the FBI and undermining the authority of the NHS despite having never taken an upper level biology course. He doesn't even seem to be a republican, just a reactionary populist, while spending money on ridiculous ventures.

This is not to say I'm happy with Biden, in fact I'm not voting for Biden for Biden, but for the administration behind him.

Unhealthy beauty standards are another topic. But if it’s a fun and harmless thing people are playing around with for the moment, why does it bother people so much?

Human beings like variety. And changing social circumstances reflect the type of beauty we like to see potrayed in media. And since social circumstances are always changing, preffered beauty types and aesthetic movements change with it.

The very flaky, ephemeral nature of beauty trends should evoke its unimportance, no? Like the fact it’s constantly changing shows that there is no objective model of beauty, really and thus shouldn’t be taken seriously. 

People who complain about it act as if they have no free will and the government will hack into their bank accounts to buy all the latest products and hire a hitman to follow them until they participate in the newest trend. Hey, you can choose to not wear something if you don’t like it or if you think it doesn’t look good on you. You can choose to have self-esteém seperate from constant external validation. After living in society for more than 15 years, how have you not realised that standards change from moment to moment. And if constant external validation doesn’t exist, then it must come from within.

Today the it girls are skinny, thick, tall, short, plump lipped, thin lipped. Tommorow it’s an another thing. Regardless, there will always be someone who doesn’t agree and places where your unique beauty will be appreciated.

Not even saying that trends are good or bad. Rather that there will always be trends. So if you can’t escape them, why care about them? It’s not like the past anymore, because even with trends, diverse beauty is still on display. People act like if their entire identity isn’t validated all the time by society, they’ll shrivel up and die. So CMV. (Same for the inverse, where people are slaves to trends and society)."

Roughly 50% of marriages fail and I wholeheartedly believe the biggest reason for this is wages not keeping up with inflation. Wages haven't increased at all for the average American worker since the 1970s when you account for inflation and this is the same time period in which we started to see this trend of divorce rates skyrocketing. I strongly believe because both parents have to be working full time to support a family instead of one provide and the other raises the family like boomers time period is why we see such a high divorce rate. Working full time and having to raise a family all at once is no easy task. Imagine having a job that gives you stress, drains your energy, barely gives you any vacation days, deadlines and so much more. Trying to balance that with raising kids, keeping up with their school work is just too much stress for both parents to endure. This can lead to arguments, stress ans high dissatisfaction in the relationship. And even if children weren't a factor many people in the United States can't survive on their own on just one income alone. Because housing costs are so high people usually need to have a roommate/spouse to split the costs with. Arguments about the bills getting paid also can lead to break ups and fights."

1,2023-09-26,CMV: The Canadian Online News Act singles out Big Tech for doing a favor to news providers,u/Fieldata,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ta3qp/cmv_the_canadian_online_news_act_singles_out_big/,changemyview,"Yesterday I heard some coverage of the Online News Act which has recently been enacted in Canada: [https://www.npr.org/2023/09/25/1197954327/the-indicator-from-planet-money-canada-vs-meta-fight](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/25/1197954327/the-indicator-from-planet-money-canada-vs-meta-fight)

The gist of the law seems to be, requiring large online platforms to pay news organizations if the online platforms display links to news sites. In response, Google and Facebook are no longer displaying news or links to news to people in Canada.

The NPR episode I linked was fairly biased in favor of the law. I guess I fundamentally don't see the justice in this law or how it is analogous to other policies, which bothers me a little, because as a Canadian I can almost always see the arguments behind our policies, even if I don't agree with them.

I think one of the central disagreements I have is, ""who is doing who a favor"". I would say links to news sites are free advertising and a favor for the news organizations. I can see how in the case where a site generates a preview/thumbnail for a news article that it could be a replacement for actually clicking the link. In that case, the preview is using content from the news provider and so would deserve some compensation. But the act covers all forms of hyperlinking and generally ""mak\[ing\] news content \[...\] available to persons in Canada"", not just generating previews.

Some have pointed out that Big Tech can afford this because they are making record profits. I think this is only due very minimally to the presence of news. I agree that seeing what news articles my friends like enhances my social media experience slightly. But Canadian grocers are also making big profits, and they display newspapers and magazines at the checkout, and the presence of these things slightly enhances the usefulness of the store also - should grocery stores be paying for displaying newspapers? 

Some have pointed out that online advertising, owned predominantly by Big Tech, has driven down the cost of advertising immensely, which means reduced advertising revenue for publishers. This is true, but has there been any analogous case where an innovative sector has been forced to pay fees to the people who lost out on the innovation? Should camera companies pay fees to portrait painters, or Netflix to DVD disc and VHS manufacturers?

I can also see that news is a thing with social value, so it's not exactly analogous to VHS tapes or painted portraits. But we have robust taxpayer support for news already in Canada. I love the CBC and I think it's nice some of my tax dollars pay for it. I would be fine with raising corporate taxes 0.005% generally to generate the quarter billion that the Online News Act aims to raise. It just seems very unfair and unconventional to specifically get it from Big Tech, especially when Big Tech are the people supplying the news organizations with a larger audience for free. "

The mathematics of quantum theory provide a probabilistic prediction about future observations, but in reality we only ever observe one outcome. The problem is to provide a metaphysical explanation of how a set of probabilities becomes a single manifested outcome. The first major attempt at an explanation was the Copenhagen Interpretation, but this introduced the notion of an “observer” or “measurement” without being clear what that meant. But it does help to explain the problem: this unspecified observer was introduced in to bridge the epistemic/ontological gap between the set of probabilities and the single outcome, by a process that has become known as “collapsing the wave function”.

My view is that all of these different positions can be placed in these four categories:  
  
**Option 1: Many Worlds Interpretation**. This gets rid of the observer and the collapse by claiming the observation/measurement does not actually happen. Instead, all possible outcomes happen in a massive array of diverging timelines.  
  
**Option 2: Deterministic single world interpretations (including non-local hidden variable theories).** This also obviates the need for an observer, and deals with the probabilistic element of quantum theory by introducing some sort of deterministic mechanism which we do not yet understand, and may never understand. The hidden variable or other (currently non-confirmed) deterministic process takes the place of the observer, and is responsible for collapsing the wave function.  
  
**Option 3: Objectively random single world interpretations.** These include descendents of the Copenhagen interpetation. They involve some sort of arbitrary physical thing which takes the place of the observer and is responsible for resolving the set of probabilities into one outcome. According to this view, the apparent randomness in quantum mechanics really is random, even from a God's eye view. God plays dice. It's like option 2, except there's no hidden determinism and a result the laws of nature include a fundamentally random component.  
  
**Option 4: Consciousness causes the collapse.** Von Neumann/Stapp interpretation, where a non-physical participating observer is somehow responsible for collapsing the wave function. This is different to option 2 because the thing that collapses the wave function is outside the physical system and not itself being determined by that system. And it is different to option 3 because it isn't objectively random either. This opens up some interesting philosophical problems, but they aren't unresolvable (they are already live topics in the philosophy of free will, even without quantum mechanics)."

Unfortunate? Yes. But wildly different from how human life is viewed. Most countries outlaw the death penalty for convicted criminals let alone for the mentally ill, which is what I’d put the human equivalent of a dog showing anti-social behavior. 

Second of all, sterilization. We strip animals of their agency and remove their sex organs in the name of breeding, health and overpopulation. That’s called eugenics when done to human beings and it’s not too popular nowadays. 

Nobody would dare tell a grieving parent that you understand their pain from losing a child because you’ve lost a cat/dog before. It would be insulting to them. There *is no* comparison between the loss of a human child and a fur child.

With my undergrad over and moving into masters now, it made me reflect on my life as to how more than 20 years of my life has gone unconsciously. How quickly time goes by. 

I've noticed that when I'm not thinking about it, I spend my time more with meaningless things. Don't get me wrong, sometimes it's the meaningless and silly things that bring us joy. But at least are we making sure we are using the majority of our time for something that will mean something to us or others later on?  

This is also the reason why many people fear Death, or, in other words, their own nature of Life. But once you're conscious of your own nature, you become more familiar and responsible with your Life. As a result, Death becomes less daunting. I think many people are unfortunately unaware of how their time is being spent.

And dream of being like those. Like ""When my parents and friends don't give me the love I need, singer/actor X understand me more than my shitty parents and friends, with their song lyrics and movie quotes"", ""When I can't even step out of home, buy even a hair clip and don't have any friends, singer/actor Y gives me hope with their trips all over the world, their expensive cars/houses/shoes etc and being able to date whatever guy/girl they date"".

1,2023-09-27,CMV: You did not defend or protect our country if you have served in the American armed forces in the last 80 years,u/cmoriarty13,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16tmynl/cmv_you_did_not_defend_or_protect_our_country_if/,changemyview,"Let me quickly get this out of the way: I am an American, and anyone who enlists in the armed forces has my respect, as they are committing to a profession that is hard, dangerous, and often scary. They put more on the line than I ever will in my career...

That being said, I pity our armed forces. Anyone who says that our veterans and active duty personnel ""fought for or protected our country"" is lying to themselves. There has not been a direct threat to America since WW2. I respect the hell out of WW2 vets, for example, as they put their lives on the line to truly protect their country, democracy, and human rights.

But since then, any conflict America has been in were conflicts they arguably shouldn't have stuck their nose in. Whether they were trying to make a statement, were overblowing the threat, or were using it as an excuse for some alternative motive, they were all conflicts that posed little to no threat to America.

Anyways, this post isn't about whether we should or shouldn't have been involved. It's about how I pity our armed forces, as they have been brainwashed to believe they are ""protecting and defending out country"" when, in reality, they are putting their lives on the line just to be a pawn for what the USA wants to do. The military masks the reality with patriotism, selflessness, and the call to duty. This is all bull shit meant to appeal to men and women who are easily persuaded and have few options for their future. (i.e. Living in a small town with no career opportunities, or unable to attend higher education after high school, or people who seek a ""purpose"")

It just makes me sick seeing the military commercials or ROTC recruitment at high schools. They are so blatantly trying to appeal to kids who don't know better, making them feel important by throwing around words like ""patriotism"" and ""duty"" and ""a higher calling."" It's all BS, no different than a cult who recruits their members by telling them exactly what they want to hear even if it's a lie. They are giving these kids a fake purpose just so that they will make sacrifices to accomplish their greedy ambitions. 

It's so messed up and I wonder why no one else sees through it. We blindly praise veterans and active duty personnel for their service, when, in reality, I don't think their service is anything I should be thanking them for. The only people who should be thanking them are the higher ups who gain from their sacrifices. But us, the average American citizens, have never reaped benefits from the men and women who ""serve our country,"" and I feel horrible for those who think they have."

The bad news, poor countries in Africa and other places will be hit the hardest. Africa in particular will become unlivable in the not so distant future. Then what? Why of course the biggest refugee crisis in human history will occur. 

We've seen how first world countries have had meltdowns over much smaller scale migrations from the third world in present day. Well now you can try hundreds of millions of poor, destitute and desperate Africans knocking on Europe's door. What do you think will happen then? 

Well, given that far right parties have gained support from many smaller refugee crisis, you can now imagine what type of genocidal and authoritarian governments will come to power across the first world due to the hundreds of millions of ""undesirables"" coming their way. 

Millions will be put in camps initially, but eventually that too will be impossible to manage logistically, so what's the next step? You start killing anyone trying to cross the border. And given that starvation and unimaginable heat will sweep over Africa, the refugees won't stop coming even with the risk of getting murdered at the border. 

Eventually people will just accept the millions of dead bodies at sea every week, month, and year. The refugees won't be seen as human, but only as a threat looking to overrun the west.

This would allow for new stories to be told with characters that have already died. Or create new interpretations of characters that may have been lacking in the first series.

But, I've been pondering this recently, and I genuinely cannot think of a better set-up for both customers and creators than Audible.

For a monthly fee you can purchase one item. However, if you don't like it, or want to swap it for something else, you can for absolutely no charge. It gives the flexibility/zero risk of a library, as well as the permanence of a bookshop if wanted. By having a monthly fee, it also means there's no large upfront cost which could put off poorer customers. People can also choose not to subscribe, and just make one-off purchases as and when they like.

This also benefits creators, because those who produce media that people really like will be able to see which pieces the audience has wanted to keep, and which they've returned. This allows for pop culture, flash in the pan media to have its moment in the Sun, as well as niche media to be found and cherished by its fans.

Aside from squeezing audiences for as much money as possible, I see no reason why other digital stores (Steam, Netflix, Disney, HBO, etc) couldn't use this method of operation."

Sexism is obviously present in incel communities, but the state of inceldom would still exist absent sexism.

The basic logic:

'I want to have sex with people' --> 'I have not been able to have sex with people' --> 'This is because of various factors outside of my control' --> 'Society should change because this is unfair'

In this case, the change incels would like to have happen is the gender they are attracted to (usually women) should change their standards so that the incels could have sex.

\------

This logic is consistent with other aspects of our society as well:

\- 'I should not have to lose weight, instead society should change their standards of beauty' (and also airlines should increase the size of their seats to accommodate me so I'm more comfortable)

\- 'Something someone said offended me, and therefore it is bad. Rather than just not consume the content anymore, the person should change'

\- 'I was triggered by something someone said. Anything that triggers me is bad. Rather than manage my emotions, the trigger should no longer exist.'

&#x200B;

\------

Finally, I think while there would certainly still be critics, if the issue of incels being associated with a protected class were removed, it would be much more acceptable in mainstream society.

EG - 'White women are often scared of black men for no reason, thus it is unfairly difficult as a black man to establish romantic relationships'. The logic is the same, including the sense that the black man is ""owed"" romantic relationships common in inceldom, but this is much more palatable to modern society than incel culture is.

Thus, it isn't the base logic and reasoning society finds so distasteful; Rather it's the association with white men. A class that is seen as having the most privilege complaining that things aren't fair isn't going to win over a lot of people.

&#x200B;

\--------

Things that would likely change my view:

\- Explain how my understanding of incel culture is completely wrong

\- Explain how there is no valid relationship between incels lack of personal responsibility and the examples I listed; Besides claiming one is less moral/acceptable than the other. Explaining how the examples can be rationalized or are more just wouldn't really address the main point."

&#x200B;

So I was thinking about this article recently; namely entry #4. (Trump resorting to literal blackmail against a closeted gay man.) You have him engaging in blackmail. You know that he's a danger to anyone whose most embarrassing secrets he knows. You also know that he could easily get his way not by providing anything of value to anyone, but just by finding out people's embarrassing secrets and blackmailing them. If he already got caught once, how do you know how many other people he might have blackmailed more successfully? Why not just prosecute him so he can't find out as many embarrassing secrets from behind bars?

&#x200B;

I'm just so frustrated right now. You have this awful former President who runs roughshod against rule of law, threatening to jail his own former generals and siding with people who tried to murder his own former VP, and you could so easily have stopped him if you just prosecuted him for blackmail when you had the chance. Why does ""prosecutorial discretion"" extend to crimes like blackmail? Why not make it mandatory for prosecutors to prosecute, and failure to do so criminal negligence? Imagine how many future Trumps you could stop if we had to prosecute blackmailers the instant we caught wind of their crimes..."

In fact the modern disney that they complain so much about has produced original thought out films like Turning Red, Soul, Luca, or Wreck it Ralph etc. yet they complain about those movies being cringe yeah no duh Einstein you’ve grown up these are for kids I know this is a petty topic, but it’s just hilarious the amount of adults who seethe this much over kids films it is also quite disgusting that they use these excuses to dog whistle and mask their blatant bigotry."

The reason why I think the two-party system is the biggest threat to the U.S is because a population of 331 million people can't be split up into two groups. The Democrats and the Republicans have such different opinions on so many things, and most people have a far more nuanced view on things.

For example not all republicans are against abortions. Not all democrats are for gun control. Not all republicans are against mass immigration and not all democrats are for mass immigration. With only two parties to choose from, many people only see a small amount of their opinions represented. In Denmark we often complain about having too many political parties due to voting spillage, but it's far better than the system the U.S have.

Furthermore, the presidential candidates the past few years have been a joke. Trump and Biden are not good fits for the position of POTUS and I refuse to believe that in a country with 331 million people those two are the very best America has to offer. The only reason Trump won was because the opposite candidate was Hillary Clinton, and the only reason Biden won was because the opposite candidate was Trump. People no longer vote for who they believe in, they just vote for the lesser of two evils. "

I believe a change towards this in society could also help the fact that people tend to be more lonely now than previously.

I think many people often yearn for childhood like friendships, where a friend was an extremely important for your life and you had funny little traditions, secret code words and so on. People complain it’s difficult to make friends, especially as adults. Maybe we rely too much on friendships being something that’s “supposed to just happen” when we are in school and then stick with us. I also believe most friendship and socialisation advice tend to fixate on casual acquaintances too much, rather than people you really click with. I think the fleeting nature of friendship also puts a lot of people off and making them nervous, that they aren’t as “structured” and with as much “script” as romantic ones. 

I don’t have many concrete examples but things like: Explicitly stating a close friendship like most people do romantic relationships, active friendship “dating” like through apps or meetups or “asking people out” being more common, more celebration of friendship in society and media.

I was happy with how it ended, though I agree that most storylines could have been intertwined more. Mainly Maeve more with the other students.

But I'm baffled that people actually hated the season. I thought the Aimee and Isaac storyline was adorable. Adam's storyline was fine as well. I guess I'm slightly confused as to why Eric wanted to be a pastor when he never really seemed Christian, but I have no experience in that situation and can't say one or the other.

The season was a great ending, and the biggest problems I had was that it could have had more happy moments (there were basically none), and am I crazy or did the actor who played the pastor kind of suck?"

There should be harsh consequences for allowing this to happen. Members of congress should not be able to adjourn until a solution is reached, and those who choose to leave Washington during important negotiations should forfeit their right to participate in all future discussions.  If there is to be a shutdown, Congress should be expected to work day and night until a budget is passed.

The biggest issue is that, on average, majority white communities have significantly more money than majority black communities. I believe that is the result of slavery and segregation so it should be rectified. I'm also a big believer in equal opportunity, and I think these improvements would greatly increase opportunity. 

So that's my current view: reparations should be paid to black communities to increase opportunity. I don't think it's a strongly held view since I've already gone back and forth on it, but it is my current view. But I am open to changing it as I am still somewhat undecided."

I see the normal 50/50 split as having some major problems whenever there is a significant income difference between the husband and wife. If the wife is making 100k a year and the husband is making 40k a year, a 1k a month expenses will require over twice the amount of effort from the husband as it will the wife. 

The usual way around this is to have the lower income earner decide on the level of expenses that they can live on and if the higher income earner wants to raise the quality(and therefore cost) of these expenses then they have to make up the difference. I don’t like this solution because it puts too much of the decision making power in the hands of just 1 person in the couple. Have 1 person be able to give and take away a huge amount of one’s quality of life seems ripe for abuse. 

It also means that if the couple decides to only pay for the expenses that the lower earner can afford, there is not the same amount of effort being put into the joint expense. For a 1k a month expenses, someone making 50/hour would only have to put 10 hours of effort into the relationship whereas a lower earner making 15/hour would have to work for 33+hours. This just isn’t a fair way to treat a spouse.

In a budget that splits expenses by hours of effort this all becomes a none issue. If a 1k a month expenses has to be paid by the couple making 40/hour and 20/hour. Both would have to work 17-18 hours to pay for the expense and the total effort from each is the same. 

This system can also be easily adjusted to account for hours spent taking care of the home/children/other needs to assure an even amount of effort is given. 

The math formula for this would be something like:
H=hours worked per person
C=total cost
R1=1st partner’s rate of pay
R2=2nd partner’s rate of pay


H = C / (R1+R2)"
1,2023-09-27,CMV: The US should chose to either use its military or greatly reduce the amount spent with nothing to show for it,u/SeparateNewspaper810,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16u2tjz/cmv_the_us_should_chose_to_either_use_its/,changemyview,"The US is, for the foreseeable future, the most powerful military on the planet. Controlling the largest navy, most effective army, third most combat experienced military, two largest air forces, and an industrial complex that builds some of the best military equipment on the planet, it's not close.  
  
The question we need to answer, however, is why.   
  
We don’t require even one percent of our current spending to guarantee complete defense of US territory, nobody is messing with the country that has a thousand untraceable, invulnerable, and individually targetable nuclear warheads.   
  
Since we aren’t using our military for defense, we should probably be using it for offense. If only there was a major war going on right this second in which one of our allies, and future NATO members, could really use a quarter million fresh and highly trained soldiers. The US spent the better part of a century preparing to enter an all out war with the USSR, and now that we finally get the chance to put those trillions of dollars and millions of lifetimes to good use our excuse is “escalation” and we do absolutely nothing.  
  
We are not willing to sacrifice American lives for a righteous cause, but our military is essentially burning money with nothing to show for it because of that very timidness.  
  
If we want to defend our allies, we can also do that while still spending way less. The US is never getting invaded, and the country getting invaded should be the one supplying the most valuable resource, men. If we want to help our allies we can do so by sending them a thousand tanks, not a million men.  
  
It's a bit depressing to think we are burning a thousand dollars a person per year on something that we don’t have a use for, so CMV.

But I can’t imagine this to be the case. In my opinion fear of repercussions do keep people in line, and I can’t fathom the logic behind saying that it doesn’t. Can anyone supply evidence or papers stating otherwise? To me I think society would be a whole lot worse if people didn’t think about the consequences of their actions.

 I mean in Mexico why doesn’t anyone cross the cartels? Because they know they’ll get their face peeled off if they do. So why is this any different when it comes to say murderers and the death penalty when it’s the state that brings the consequences?"
1,2023-09-27,CMV: Corporations have no moral responsibility except to maximize profits,u/yalag,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16u4eop/cmv_corporations_have_no_moral_responsibility/,changemyview,"Hello, this view has bugged me for years because I love browsing reddit but I overall disagree/have the redditor's view that corporations are to blame in any immoral outcomes to the society. 

First let's put aside the legal responsibility, as it is irrelevant. Some likes to argue whether corporations are required to maximize profit or not and I think its a strawman argument. I do not believe that they are legally required to, but in a free market, they have to maximize profit to remain competitive. 

But back to the main point, let's say a corporation were to do a series of actions that are **legal.** But as a result has harmed the society/environment/consumers etc. In this scenario, the corporations and as an extension of that (the executives/management etc) is free from any wrong doing. 

Ultimately it is the responsibility of the government/policies maker to determine what is legal/what isn't. 

One could easily (and often redditors do) point to the management as the devil. E.g. CEO of XYZ is so god damn evil!!!1!11. I don't follow this logic? The corporation system is setup such that the shareholders are looking for max profits, and the CEO and management team is rewarded for doing so. Sure there are companies like Apple that chooses to pursue environmental initiatives at the cost of profits but  that is at a time when the company is massively profitable. If that wasn't the case the shareholders would not be pleased and the management team would be changed. If other corporations decides not to do so, that should be completely acceptable. Sure, consumers/investors can choose to penalize such corporations for their external negative impacts. But that rarely happens. Because most people don't actually care. 

Another argument I often hear is that large corporations will ""bend"" the rules and so the fact that they are doing everything legally is not exactly ""playing by the rules"". And I would partially agree with this, in that the corporations should share some fault here. But I would argue that a bigger share of the blame should be put in the political systems instead. Why are the systems so easily bribed? When a cop takes $1000 from a druglord and turns a blind eye. Should we be angry at the cop? The druglord? Or both? Certainly, not just the druglord?! That's what reddit does, day in day out. 

Bottom line:

\- Reddit has immense hate on corporations (evident on the front page), unjustified 

\- Reddit attributes almost 100% of the bad outcomes to corporations and executives, unjustified

\- My opinion is that corporations/CEO are simply cogs of a system doing its job. The political systems/tax systems/legislative systems/etc are all to blame for bad outcomes"

1,2023-09-28,CMV: the expansion of NATO is NOT what prompted Russia to invade Ukraine,u/CaptainQueero,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16u7f78/cmv_the_expansion_of_nato_is_not_what_prompted/,changemyview,"More specifically, my current position is that the expansion of NATO would have been an insignificant factor in the decision to invade, even if it did enter into a cost-benefit analysis. 

My reasoning for holding this belief is that:

1) NATO's expansion was not carried out actively or with aggressive intentions, but was a passive process of allowing countries in central and eastern Europe to join, due to their own security concerns. It is unlikely that the Kremlin could have seriously perceived this as a threat, since NATO is fundamentally not a war-mongering organisation, and would only ever engage in *retaliatory* combat.

2) Invading Ukraine would have been an idiotic - indeed nonsensical response, if it *was* a reaction to the NATO threat; and I don't think it's plausible that Putin and his advisors could have gotten it so wrong. Here's why it doesn't make sense:

* It always ran a significant risk of strengthening NATO (which it in fact has)
* Since the Crimea annexation, it has driven Ukraine further into the arms of the west (since they rightfully fear for their own security)
* A diplomatic approach to wooing Ukraine would have been feasible (since a majority of Ukrainians were against joining NATO prior to the Crimea annexation)
* Supposing Russia is successful in claiming Ukraine - this doesn't really help their security situation anyway; they are still directly adjacent to NATO countries.

A secondary belief, which you can engage with or not, is that the main driving force was Putin's personal desire for glory and respect, and to leave a Peter-the-Great-like legacy. I don't hold this view very strongly - so I'll also give deltas to anyone who can provide convincing arguments that it *is* correct."
1,2023-09-28,CMV: Veritasium's IQ video promotes eugenicists and proves the entire race based IQ ranking valid.,u/T12J7M6,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16u899d/cmv_veritasiums_iq_video_promotes_eugenicists_and/,changemyview,"Veritasium made an IQ video about one month ago: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkKPsLxgpuY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkKPsLxgpuY)   
  
so here is my thoughts on the video:  
  
I bet what the maker of the video though they were doing was producing a very politically correct right think video for the masses, but instead what they did was produce a video that proved the eugenicists right and the entire race based IQ ranking valid.  
  
How did they do this, you might thing? Well read lines from the video:  
  
Quote 1: 00:18:17

>Henry Goddard used the claims that intelligence was inherited and unchangeable to put IQ at the center of the American eugenics movement. Eugenicists wanted to prevent those with undesirable traits from having kids. In many states laws were passed to enable forced sterilization of people who failed to meet a certain threshold on an IQ test. The constitutionality of these laws upheld by the Supreme Court in 1927.

Quote 2: 00:21:30

The conclusion some people draw is that there are genetic differences between races or nations in intelligence. But I think that's a gross misrepresentation of the data. The problem, I'd argue, is that IQ tests don't necessarily measure what you think they're measuring. And the proof is that there's a representative sample of white Americans whose average IQ is 70. Who are these people? Just ordinary Americans who lived around a hundred years ago.

Quote 3: 00:22:16

>Now, what Flynn noticed was that each time they got re-normalized, the scores had to be shifted down a bit more by about two or three IQ points per decade. And if they didn't do this, what we would see is that the average IQ of the whole population was increasing at a steady rate for the last 100 years, adding up to around 30 point increase. This is known as the Flynn Effect.

By quote 2 they make the argument that race based IQ ranking is invalid, because there was a group of white Americans 100 years ago, whose average IQ was around 70. Then by quote 1 they establish that around 100 years ago Eugenicists started a forced sterilization program which targeted exactly these low IQ white Americans. Finally by quote 3 they acknowledge that since the forced sterilization program started 100 years ago, IQ was been steadily increasing with the rate of about two or three IQ points per year.  
  
Do you see the case made in the video? The video makes the case that third world countries which have low IQ populations, just like US had 100 years ago, should also start an eugenics program to sterilize these low IQ people so that they could also then experience steady increase in average IQ of about two or three IQ points per year. This seems to me to be the unavoidable conclusion of the video."

There are so many examples of this.

Think about the people who say that people in the out-group are 'animals', as if they themselves weren't. Or the shampoo label that says 'not tested on animals', as if that were factual. 

It may not seem like a big deal to use language in this non-literal way, but I think this undermines our ability to connect and empathize with other animals. Think about how we treat them. What is our excuse for that? I think our main rationalization is that they are different from us. It would be extremely criminal to, for example, medically sterilize another human without their consent, to imprison them and kidnap and sell their children, to forcefully remove their bodily fluids, or especially to kill and eat them and wear their skin as clothing.

This isn't to say that we should all be vegan. Humans are omnivores, and it is in our nature to eat other animals. In my opinion that's also worth acknowledging. 

This is only to say that we should be honest about what we are, and stop pretending there is some meaningful distinction between us and all the other animals.

To change my view, you would have to convince me either that humans are not animals (good luck with that) or that it's not important for us to acknowledge our animal nature or our connection to other animals."

The stripe pattern that you can see when the cat is laying under the sun is nothing more than a cheap trick of shadows and lighting. The longer hair/fur cast shadows over the smaller hair/fur which gives an illusion that there's a stripe, when there isn't. I've never seen a ""tabby"" black long haired cat. It's because long-haired cats fur doesn't casts shadows over the smaller hair- instead, the smaller hair are hidden under the long hair. Of course, there *are* black+tabby cat mixes, but a lot of black cats are just pure lovely shiny black and not impostors.

Go ahead and try to do that when a girl your interested in is in a group, because now, you have to address everyone at once and get all their attention. I then have to get the girl’s interest and keep it hanging for a while, then I have to not show too much interest and pretend as if I don’t want to have sex with her yet, even though I was down for it before we even started talking. Then, when the time is right, I have to give her some attention and talk about what she loves, her goals in life, etc. Chitchatting about this and that and keeping the conversation engaging and entertaining. At all times during the process, I have to show signs of a strong and independent man with leadership qualities; confidence is an obvious one. I have to show some playfulness and light-heartedness. I have to be funny, fun and assertive. I should not act defensively at anything as it is a sign of weakeness. I also better not act nervous or lose my cool. And whilst doing all that, I have to gently work my way to make her feel comfortable with me being physical with her. All of it done step by step with the outmost skill, and the outmost courtesy.
FUCK!

A girl on the other hand, she can stand in a corner and just be pretty. She would get - practically - any guy in the room just by asking him out, and most probably, without even asking.

I’m not calling for unfairness, I really am not, I understand this is how things work. Men are just more sexually demanding, that is the truth of nature. But please women, I understand how it might feel to be desired sexually by someone stronger than you, I totally understand how easy women can be - for good reasons - creeped out by men, I understand how unattractive it is to interact with a guy who clearly has an agenda, but please, for the love of God, at least have a little bit of compassion for the other side. We work hard to get to know you on an intimate level. A little bit of recognition would do wonders. Stop acting as if we are playing under the same rules!

I mean… whatever man… 

I am not sure if girls are this oblivious or if I just talked to the wrong ones, but I haven’t seen that only around me, a lot of women on the internet are just as clueless. Honestly I hope I am wrong and this will disprove my theory.

The quality of life that we have now is not compatible with the planet, even if we implement as many ""sustainable"" practices as we can (which we won't, anyways) there are still just too many of us using up too many resources too quickly.

Literally no one is willing to give up this lifestyle that most of us in developing countries have - unlimited power, personal cars, frequent long distance travel, highly diversified diets year round, etc. The ""solutions"" are hardly ever ""we should edit the way we live"" and more ""how can we make the way we live sustainable"" and the fact is that we won't and certainly not in time to save us.

So I think either one of two things will happen: 

A. Many of us will die and humanity will be reduced to a fraction of what it is ""naturally"" - IE by many of us dying due to environmental factors 

OR

B. The elites see the writing on the wall and, also unwilling to give up this life style, will instead kill a lot of us (probably with a disease) in order to maintain living this way at a more manageable population level. They will probably talk themselves into thinking it's a ""necessary evil.""

Consequently, the argument for this is that the light is redshifted due to the Doppler effect. And the light being more redshifted farther away is because the universe is expanding. 

The Big Bang theory is in conjunction with dark energy because if the universe is expanding then that implies that the universe expanded from a single point.

2010 Subaru Legacy
2018 Honda Odyssey- Engine exploded at 40K miles
2017 Kia Sportage- HVAC switch went out, passenger door striker busted and prevented the door from opening and a bad electrical connection caused the electric power steering to have issues. The transmission has also been shifting a bit rough under part throttle recently.

So it seems that even if you have a certain car or car brand that has a reputation of being reliable, you’re not safe from parts breaking or wearing out quicker than you would have hoped for. Toyota Tacomas have head gaskets, transmission fluid and automatic trans clutches that wear out just like a Nissan Frontier; it’s just that those automatic trans clutches might last longer in the Tacoma than in the Frontier.

I think the cases where people can truthfully say “my car has only needed oil changes and maintenance stuff and I’ve been driving it for 20 years” is more rare than common

I also think people fail to realize how important regular maintenance is. I would rather buy a Nissan Frontier that has been meticulously maintained and repaired than a Toyota Tacoma with neglected maintenance.

TL;DR I’ve driven a lot of cars, even a few that were supposed to be reliable but they seem to break anyway, and that has made me cynical of the saying that certain cars are reliable."

Don’t get me wrong I love natalie I think she’s great but she constantly downplays her own struggles in her videos because she’s white, how is that NOT being a pick me? Hell, she even says that being a white and gay isn’t comparable to being black (tell that to the white lgbt people who were killed In the holocaust)

So aren’t white progressives the real pick me’s? Just a thought"

It would be great if the world got rid of them and all their opinion manipulation and culture expansion that they subjected everybody to for the last 100 years.

Hollywood was, by far, the greatest manifestation of the Yank soft power during the Cold War, and they kept brainwashing and influencing people all over the world even after the end of the USSR. They used their easy scalability to achieve the farthest points of the Earth, making people change their minds and whole cultures disappear (i.e. Japan). 

In social terms they also ignored or downplayed for years achievements that weren't in sync with their views, producing content that showed mostly what they supposed was the perfect ""American"" family. Now they've shifted to the other side, and are focused on showing a world that does not exist, with the new values that they think the whole world should have as correct and progressive.

So it would be great to get rid of this centralized institution for mass brainwashing, and let people get their information from multiple sources. A world in which every country produced most of the movies they watch would be much better, preserving their worldview and giving the world more good productions to choose from."
1,2023-09-28,"CMV: There isnt really a good reason to get upset over the colloquial use of the word ""literally""",u/mrducky80,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16uiz47/cmv_there_isnt_really_a_good_reason_to_get_upset/,changemyview,"I am of course talking about people using the word: 'literally' in an exaggerative manner, not to actually mean literally literally (heh).

This is a pet peeve of many and Im going to be frank and honest, its not that bad, its not even close to the most egregious abuse of the english language and I reckon its not so much as the misuse of the word 'literally' but rather the people who primarily did so were annoying (I am generalizing to its stereotypical use from a SoCal teen).

* Firstly, its normal for the english language to constantly change, the usage of the word literally is but a facet of this normal shift of trends and word usage. The english language is notoriously malleable and in a constant state of flux. Words change, their use change and their definitions change. Constantly and entirely based upon trends. The colloquial use of the word literally as an exaggerative manner fits in fine. Its not like when someone says they can 'eat a horse' you are going to challenge them to sit down and consume an entire fucking pony. No one has issue with that, but if you say ""I could *literally* eat a horse"" there are those out there who take issue with the usage of the word literally and ignoring the idiom where you consume an animal several times your body mass in a single meal. [Merriam Webster even covers the use of the word for effect](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/misuse-of-literally#:~:text=colloq.,completely%2C%20utterly%2C%20absolutely.%22). Also TIL: the colloquial literally has been in the dictionaries for over a hundred years and likely stems back two to three times that.

* Secondly, its not even the worst kind of abuse of words that is seen in the language, personally. I give that to contranyms. Words spelt and sound the same but with directly opposite meanings, there are several dozen ([examples](https://www.businessfulcrum.co.uk/blog/post/contranyms---what-they-are-and-some-great-examples)). And this isnt colloquial use, but official definitions and 'official' use and not some off the cuff exaggeration for effect. [There are other issues with the language, some more impactful on the learning and acquisition of the language](https://www.businessinsider.com/english-language-most-annoying-hardest-thing-2018-5) But either way, its well known the language itself is fucked sideways and embraces it.

* Finally, there are plenty of word fuckerys that have occurred in the english language. What I feel most people take offence too isnt the usage itself but rather the demographic it primarily represented and the demographic who vastly over used it. This is stereotyping but Im like 80% sure its due to Southern California youth over using it. Correcting me here doesnt get a delta, it just shows i didnt do my homework. With the entire language constantly shifting and evolving into something new, with the entire language so thoroughly filled with problems. The only noteworthy thing about the colloquial ""literally"" would be the demographic that is primarily responsible for its spread.

I know its not that big of a group who do take offence at the usage of the colloquial 'literally', but they definitely exist, and they are vocal enough about it. And quite frankly, my view is that they are wrong about it."

Israeli government accepts and declares independence. Palestine government rejects and declares war on Israel. Surrounding Arab countries: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria - declare war on Israel and invade both Israel and Palestine. 

Short version, the war ends with Jordan ruling the West Bank (most of modern day Palestine), Egypt ruling the Gaza strip (Southern Palestine where Hamas is ruling today), Israel surviving and leading an offensive campaign with territorial gains. 

Biggest losers of the war, and the reason for the crisis today: 750,000 Palestinians expelled, no more Palestine. 

Israel was fighting an existential war, so while I cannot justify the atrocities, I can imagine doing whatever is necessary to survive. But Egypt and Jordan were under no circumstances at risk of being invaded by Israel, yet they decided to take advantage of the war and expand into the two most significant areas of today's Palestine. 

The crazy thing is that both Egypt and Jordan made peace with Israel, but never took responsibility for what they did to the Palestinians in 1948.

Imagine a world where the Arab countries don't invade Israel/Palestine in 1948. Israel is not in existential war and can behave rationally. And Palestine is not forced into an all-out war with Israel by its Arab neighbors. This ends with peace, I think. Or at least something better than what we have today..."

I live in MN with some of the worst winter's in the country, so while I appreciate the need for all-wheel drive, I know with certainty it's not an absolute need. And if it is for the rare case, most families have 2 vehicles, other another SUV with AWD capabilities.

Most American families live in the suburbs and do not go off-road. The purchase of an SUV is therefor mostly for show. Minivans sit as high as SUVs, so sight is not an issue. The carrying capacity of minivans is equal to or greater than most SUVs. The gas mileage is equal to or better. The technology and safety features are equal to or exceed SUVs. The ""styling"" or ""craftsmanship"" is, to me, a dubious excuse due to the following: the only thing most SUVs for families has over a minivan is simply a reputation. So, I beleive most families purchase an SUV to impress others or signal a status to other people. 

Great redditors of CMV, help me understand why a family would choose an SUV over a minivan that is simply not a styling or perception issue."

Let me share with you the personal story that motivated me to think about this issue. A coworker of mine was recently assaulted and robbed by a biker. The biker looked like a professional bodybuilder. He was clearly abusing steroids and Googling his names leads to several articles that span multiple decades about comitting violent crimes.  
  
Steroids boost the human body’s capacity for strength and aggression. They create an unfair and dangerous imbalance of power between violent offenders and their potential victims, and they also increase the risk of them committing more violence.  
  
I think that violent criminals who exceed a certain threshold of muscle mass should be required to take drugs or follow a certain protocol that reduces their muscle mass as a condition for their parole or release.   
  
Convicts already forfeit the right to possess a firearm for essentially the same reasons. They should not have the right to be a walking weapon who exploits muscle enhancing chemicals.  
  
I’m not suggesting that this would be a permanent measure, but the specifics are not something that I have fully considered. For instance, it might be fair to restore their right to x amount of muscle mass after five years of release and having no ties to criminal organizations."
1,2023-09-28,CMV: The US Founders were right to initially limit voting to select individuals,u/Ok-Story-9319,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16umqil/cmv_the_us_founders_were_right_to_initially_limit/,changemyview,"When the United States was founded based on the principles of federalism, principally to ensure that certain decisions would need to be determined democratically, as locally as possible. The abandonment of a monarchical system of government necessarily devolved power to the people, an arrangement already occurring within the isolated colonies. So when the constitution was adopted in 1789, the states set the voting requirements and, generally, they limited this right to property-owning or tax-paying white males. 

This excluded approximately 94% of the population from participating in democracy, and thereby lobbying for their freedom. 

However it endured extreme stability in the early founding of the United States. Transitioning to a republic of originally semi-independent colonies ruled by a distant monarch was by no means a foregone success. can it  be suggested that life is  worse overall for the average American white male/female or black male/female in 2023 than it was in 1787? Nevertheless, the arbitrary selection of early American suffrage has its detractors and rightfully so. 

These roots established a patriarchal system of white supremacy which has led to the oppression of many for the privilege of a few. However, again if this fundamental flaw is so damning, why have women and minorities gotten the right to vote now? If this system is inherently so oppressive, how could it be undone in a relatively short period of time? Now popular sovereignty is a given. 

However I believe that although it is *good* that we have expanded the electorate now, the founders’ were right in limiting suffrage *then.* 

My belief is, that for budding democracies, the electorate should only consist of a group of people inherently resistant to populism and factionalism regarding minor issues. The founding generation limited the vote only to a select group of people and early elections were less contentious on all levels. Moreover, the representatives represented the *voters* better (although not necessarily the governed). 

The system however saw stability. No coups, no hotly contested elections, no overt flaunting of procedure. Moreover the nation prospered as those with budding roots in the society had a pronounced voice in politics. Still the worst aspects of American society blossomed, such as slavery, which continued through the efficacy of a democracy ruled by like-minded individuals. 

So clearly limiting the vote to a certain class is highly imperfect, but nevertheless *pragmatic* if you want the democracy to bud long term. When we see fresh democracies fail to coups, revolution, or civil wars, id eager they opened the vote to too many people before the electorate truly had a “stake” in the system. 

When the voter doesn’t care if the government collapses, they’re more likely to support radicals, extremists, revolutionaries, or demagogues who will simply loot the treasury for their many supporters. Moreover, given the sophistication of propaganda against the semi-literate, how can we expect democratic institutions to survive in nations still transitioning from an agrarian society to an industrial one?

Change my view, budding democracies should have a small electorate of elites to increase the chances of long-term endurance of democratic institutions."

As a 20 year old I can say that there’s so many things I did at 18/19 that I would never even think of doing now including abusing alcohol and getting into a few abusive relationships. and a lot of that was dealing with alit of undiagnosed mental health problem but a lot of it was also not having the maturity to make such decisions

If I graduated college as a women and someone said wow ""you did that and as a women?"" Id be butt hurt like youre telling me being a women is a handicap.

 I understand the other side argument. They are not appreciated or there is not equality. But even if ""good"" constantly pointing out the differences is segregation in itself. I belive at one point there should never be a diffrence or point out that diffrence. You will never see ""person achieved X, and it's a man?!"" If I was black,gay,women,etc I would want no one to treat me any different or it wouldn't be pointed out because of ""course I did or achieved X. I'm no different than anyone else""

I can only see two scenarios happening.

&#x200B;

1) Biden wins the election in 2024. Trump tries to steal the election from Biden, and his followers start a second coup, this time with more preparation and more zeal. The last time was a quick raid of the capital, this time will be a practical army raiding carefully selected locations with a lot of prep. They won't stop when the courts confirms that Biden won, they won't stop until they either can overthrow the government, or they run of out of people. Trump will literally never stop challenging the election, and he won't go to jail no matter what his followers do as consequences don't stick to him.

2) Trump wins the election in 2024. It starts with bigots feeling more empowered, and they start a horrendous campaign of violence and harassment against minorities. Then the laws in project 2025 are enacted, and a lot of those minorities are just no longer allowed to live their lives legally. Riots start that make stonewall look like a birthday party, people are not going to lie down when their lives are in danger. Trump will use these riots as an excuse to increase his power and to target more and more people, especially other minority groups. He will empower violent people to target those fighting for their lives, and may call in the military. Trump will persecute more and more people, and he won't stop because the courts won't stop him. People in danger will not stop resisting as long as they are alive. No country will intervene because no one can afford to piss off the us.  


People are too divided. Tensions are too on the rise. The courts are doing nothing substantive. There is going to be violence, and I don't think it can be avoided.

now first of all, if you like starfield thats perfectly valid. i can see the appeal, and i can understand why to some people full planets do not matter and do not harm your enjoyment of the game... but with that said, there's a huge difference between ""i personally do not care about full planetary exploration"" and ""full planetary exploration is dumb and unnecessary"" people typically outline this argument with ""oh so the game is bad because you cant run across the equator for 50 hours?"" to wich my first response is both yes and no... to be fair i dont see anyone criticising planet size who arent ALSO criticising the complete lack of ground vehicles... and my typical response to this argument is this

Why would i want to play a game that features ""1000 PLANETS"" if i had no intention of wanting to you know... actually explore the planets? being completely tethered to my ship sucks ass and does not give me at all the same wonder and awe that full planets do in other games that feature full planets.

now let me be clear, a ""full planet"" does not have to be planet sized. lets take no mans sky. the biggest planet in no mans sky is somewhere around 130 miles in diameter... thats tiny. like impossibly small for a planet... for reference Pluto's diameter is around 1600 miles. Planets only need to FEEL large. im not sure any game that features planets features planetary scale... humans are stupid creatures that are easy to fool. give someone a large rock just big enough that you cant meaningfully traverse it in a couple of hours and they will forget scale and just think ""woah this is a big ass planet!"" 

but lets be clear, i LOVE exploring planets. I've played my fair share of no mans sky, and i can tell you that yes i absolutely have ran on FOOT more than a 4 hour journey away from my ship on many occasions... and clearly there are many people who feel the same way. suggesting that its an ""invalid"" criticism because its not something YOU personally care about is dumb...

bethesda themselves seem to have understood that this would be a point of contention. otherwise there would be literally no reason for them not to be completely open and transparent about it from the get go... i wrote this game off as soon as i heard the leaks about loading screens on planets tied to your ship. because for me that is a very large very important part of the game for me... i really dont give a shit about ""1000 planets"" if it never feels like im on a planet... and with how starfield planets are segmented up, it absolutely doesnt feel like im on a planet.

to me it seems clear that people simply dont want to accept criticism of a game they enjoy, because back in 2011 with skyrim, a BIG point of advertisement was ""you see that mountain? you can go there!"" and the people cheered! because its very human to want to explore. there is no greater feeling in games like no mans sky than seeing a huge geological feature on the horizon, and thinking ""im going to stand on that peak!"" with starfield, it just doesnt feel the same... 

now its not all doom and gloom, starfields landing zones are around 25 percent bigger than skyrims map... but is that really all we get after a decade? a 25 percent increase in your playable space? sure it looks a lot nicer and there's a lot more playable spaces but your individual play area at any given time is only 25 percent bigger than a game that came out in 2011? 

as someone who plays a lot of games and enjoy a lot of games solely because their maps are impressively large, its hard for me to understand why people hate this criticism so much... to me its perfectly understandable how someone would be dismayed at the idea of not being able to spend several hours just wandering in a direction looking for cool terrain, just gazing in awe at the impossible scale of what they are standing on. as soon as you introduce borders into that, that feeling is completely gone... 

ive explored large portions of fuel's map... spent hours just messing around on kerbal space programs planets and moons. despite both of these having largely nothing of interest to find, i simply never get tired of the awe inspiring sizes. in many ways an incredibly large map humbles mep. makes me feels small and insignificant. what i was excited for in starfield might have been different to what others were excited for... but clearly there were many like myself who feel the same as i do.

starfield was advertised as ""bethesda game in space"" ""1000 planets"" but to me it doesnt really feel like there are any planets. afterall, ill never be able to watch as the peak of a mountain starts to pop up over the horizon, and watch as it slowly rises, beckoning me to climb it as more of the mountain rises into view... and i dont think said feature is ""dumb"" or ""unncessary"" afterall, there are plenty of games that do indeed feature full planets... and bethesda has always advertised its exploration, and it has been a long standing reason ive loved many bethesda games. because i saw that mountain, and i could indeed go there."

Me and my siblings are horribly broken, two of which already attempted suicide and with me idolizing it. My sisters went through the worst of it while me and my brother were more emotionally neglected. We are not a happy family.

So my opinion, if a parent has a mental illness that has symptoms it will negatively impact their child in one way or another. A parent with severe BPD is likely to at least once split on their child or have them witness it. If you are depressed and usually withdrawn your child can learn from you and become overly shy or depressed too. If you have anxiety your kid can become anxious with you and learn that as a response. And if your illness causes you to be aggressive or abusive it's a done deal. Even your genetics can get them in the long run. All in all, its gonna effect one of the children pretty much no matter what you do.

Militias? Quartering soldiers? These seem like outdated terms from a time when people used horses, fired muskets, and owned slaves. Why on gods green earth would a person need to carry an assault rifle in the street, when we have police? That’s another topic, anyways.
  
It makes no sense that we still use a constitution that was written before cars, computers, the internet, television, telecommunication, etc. 

Nowadays, we see a jammed up congress with every bill trying to get passed, because we’re trying to interpret a document that is 200+ years old. It is *impossible* to actually progress currently.

A newly written constitution could take many new events into consideration, not to mention we *can* write a new one, so why do we still continue to use the current outdated one?

It is not living, nor are we able to “interpret” its meaning anymore, hence why there is so much discord among politicians and constituents."

Since School starts in September (at least in most countries), at which time the students complain about the summer passing so quick, why not allow them to refill their energy for a couple weeks during October once they have had time to have their first batch of lessons in September.

It would also help the students, because, by giving them extra time to rest, we would aid them in getting into the proper mindset of studying and actually caring for the lesson faster/better.

1,2023-09-28,"CMV: Abortion is technically murder, but at the same time women should be paid to have children",u/Aggressive_Shame_726,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16uvn4r/cmv_abortion_is_technically_murder_but_at_the/,changemyview,"**Regarding Abortion**

First of all, I want to clarify that I am not advocating for a total ban. Rather, I believe we need to change the way the practice is both viewed and restricted. Note that everything below pertains to regular cases of abortions, not abortions due to rape/incest which many would agree should be treated with a separate considerations:

* Generally agree with the Ben Shapiro argument, at least in so far as to why fetuses should be considered humans. If it is properly taken care of for a long enough, a fetus that lacks pretty much everything will develop into an infant with under-developed senses, then a pre-teen with under-developed reproductive organs, all the way until they are around 25 y.o. when their brain is fully developed and the aging process begins. Under a Roe v. Wade style policy we draw the line at the first stage of development (""senses""). I believe this is problematic since we're essentially saying that it's ok to kill a human if they have no awareness of it, which can also apply to many grown adults. The same problem happens regardless of where the line is drawn, not to mention the whole mess when it comes to premature babies. This clearly puts abortion as a form of human murder in my view.
* However, this doesn't mean that this form of murder should be completely outlawed because *we don't actually do that*. We justify killing criminals, terrorists, and even home invaders if we believe they either have caused or have the potential to cause great harm. (think: the baby Hitler argument scaled way down). Going even further, would you, say, shoot down a few hundred innocent civilians on those planes knowing that many thousands of lives would be saved on that day and tens of thousands more from the war? Many would say yes, including many who have sacrificed their lives on one of them. Strangely, the same argument can be applied to innocent fetuses if their potential life will most definitely ruin the potential life of at least the mother. My point here is that I also see the motivation behind a left-leaning stance. Most of us are willing to accept certain immoralities/externalities behind things like eating meat, driving cars, or even participating in a capitalistic system because it's a fact of life. Big fishes eat smaller ones every day regardless of how ""innocent"" the small fish is.
* To add to that, I do still agree that it is ""better"" to kill a human fetus than say a human infant precisely because of the ""awareness"" factor. This further justifies the act, but just because it is ""better"" doesn't mean it is not murder. We must properly recognize the moral weight of such a decision.
* Overall, the point is that I believe we should approach abortion with at least the stigma of it technically being a murderous act, rather than ""it's fine if it is done early enough."" Though it is still a grey issue, the moral weight here should be quite a lot higher than most pro-abortion stances suggest. Furthermore, the current restriction system disadvantages the poor on a moral level as well. It's one thing to commit murder if it would otherwise ruin your life, those around you, and ultimately force a child who did not ask to be born to grow up impoverished. It's another thing to do the same if you have the means and having an unexpected child is - at least relative to others - an inconvenience.
* So what's the alternative if it makes little sense to draw the line based on the pregnancy calendar? This I don't know for sure. It could maybe be a limited strike-based system, or maybe special case-by-case evaluations that adheres to more holistic standard. It'll never be perfect since this is a problem that likely demands a one-size-fits-all solution. Regardless, I believe at the very least we need to move away from the current moral framing around the debate.

**Regarding Childbirth Support**

The above section ultimately poses a right-wing POV against abortion in that it should be treated with greater moral weight and hence more restricted (albeit through different means) compared to a standard Roe v. Wade position. 

However, it bothers me that in the 21st century we have yet to address the fact that women bear the brunt of child-bearing/raising responsibilities without much in return. Yes, we have established things like 50/50 divorces, alimony, pregnancy grants, post-pregnancy support, childcare, paid maternity leave etc. but the overall economic payouts of all of these combined is no where near enough to compensate for the true effort and sacrifices involved with carrying and raising a child, let alone the fact you need to meet certain standards to qualify. The way I see it, this imbalance represents much if not most of what remains in the fight to bridge the gender inequality.

Since we can't make men bear child, I believe the next best form of rebalancing is simply financial compensation/support. Not a few billion a year, but a few *hundred* billion:

* Let's start with some statistics. The average cost of raising a child in the U.S. is around $300k. There are around 4 million births annually. Women on average have slightly less than 2 children in their lifetime. The median household income is around $80k and the median household net worth is around $120k. Our federal budget in 2022 is around $6.5T.
* With these numbers in mind, giving a $100k grant to every woman for the first born child would cost a little over $200B/year (100k \* 4M/2). You can compare this to whatever major social or discretionary programs you'd like, but it's basically nothing in the grand scheme of things.
* I believe the correct amount should be closer to $200k-300k, distributed over different age ranges based on expected cost until the child turns 18 on the simple condition the mother meets the regular social services standards in caring for the child. This amounts to $400B-600B/year. There are many reasonable ways to find the money. I believe it should mostly come from an additional progressive tax (maybe weighted more heavily toward men with children) but maybe some cuts to related social programs like education/childcare could also be appropriate.
* Why I believe this is a good idea:
   * I alleviates the quandary behind the majority of what would have been abortion cases.
   * It tackles gender inequality and simultaneously serve as a wealth distribution program.
   * The UBI argument: The program simply recycles cash in the hands of citizens who can then make free market choices. It is also easy to understand and execute, meaning that there is no real reason to invent large overheads and/or involve any form of privatization, hence less room for inefficiency and corruption.
   * Also UBI: The benefits are both uniform and progressive. Every child comes with their own challenges and every woman is compensated equally, but lower-income households will feel the impact more strongly.
   * It could potentially be another deterrent to illegal immigration by furthering the gap between how easy it is for legal and illegal citizens to get by. If you don't see this as a pro then we'd need to get into the whole immigration can of worms.

**Preemptively Addressing a Few Potential Counter-arguments:**

* Abortion:
   * What about ""my body my rights""? The argument doesn't really hold here if we've established that abortion is technically murder. So if you disagree with that premise then CMV.
   * Killing fetuses without their ""consent"" is definitely unconstitutional if we've accepted that they are humans - Yes, but I would like to focus this discussion from a moral/logical POV rather than on the basis of an old and ambiguous legal document.
* Childbirth Support
   * Money can't solve everything. What about the emotional cost of raising a child? Yes, but it's the best straight-forward, one-size-fits-all solution in my view. If you have a better idea to rebalance the child-bearing/raising gap then CMV.
   * What if the $200k or so is not used to benefit the child? The idea of the grant is ultimately compensation to women for the opportunity cost of child-bearing/raising, but I also believe in most cases both should naturally come hand in hand. 
   * If this is a form of UBI, wouldn't it cause inflation? No this is ultimately a redistribution program. The recent inflation was caused by excessive money printing and UBI just got a bad rep by association. I believe UBI can be effective if applied correctly.

There you have it. This is my first post here and I'd have to admit I'm not a political junkie so please educate me if I'm misinformed on anything. Did not do too too much research either so I'm sure there are flaws in my argument - CMV."

The parties are young students, already committed to particular schools and programs, vs. academies and the federal government, who have way more information than the students and who misrepresent the value of degrees and the terms of the loans, and who are able to exert as much influence over wannabe students as is available to powerful institutions, i.e. the maximum amount of influence.

To me, guilt is an emotion. As is heart wamrth from giving.  I do not think an emotion is a good foundation for a guiding philosophy. I think morality should be above both emotions and logic. It should just be something more and something loftier I guess. Here are some scenarios where ""using feelings for morality"" break down

* My dog has horrible cancer and her every movement is agony. She does not even squeal anymore because she knows it won't make the pain go away. You feel *guilty* about putting her down. You feel bad about it. Therefore it is the wrong thing!


* In the hallway between your schoolroom and the water fountain and everyone was watching and  there was another boy saying you're a runt and he can beat you up. You throw a huge uppercut to his liver and he winces in pain and cowards backwards, never having actually witnessed violence in his upbringing. All the people watching say ""oooooooooh"" and call you one punch man and the girls all have an almost lustful look in their face when they make eye contact with you.  You feel *pride*. Assaulting that 7th grader must have been the right thing to do

* This girl at your warehouse was just blatantly stealing stuff all day, ignoring the cameras. But she has made you laugh many times and she always just lights the room up. You know she is just a dumb kid being immature and that you did dumb things as a kid as well. There is no way you can't fire her and you give her some conciliatory words and tell her some other places to apply and wish her well. It didn't feel right to do that to a kid who can't buy alcohol yet. Every time you think about it you feel *sad*. Damn, should have just let her steal everything right


* You cousin wants your help laundering some money. You don't have to do anything except let him use your name, and then he gives you a 25% cut. This weirded you out but the guy is a real homie and he has always been there for you. It feels *uplifting* when he shakes your hand and says ""I know you have my back lil cuz"". Damn, that was the right thing to do

I can just go on and on but obviously emotions dont always match up with what is right. Morality is something external to us and unaffected by our whims. I'm not arguing for objective morality or for any specific kind of morality. I am saying  morality is about more than just emotional responses"

Coyotes can explain stuff like hearing skinwalkers. Waking up and seeing figures over your bed can be explained by sleep paralysis and other sleep disorders.

Sure, adultery is forbidden or discouraged by one of Ten Commandments, but as proven over time, punishments against those who committed adultery were very severe or harsh at best.

In recent years, India, South Korea, and Taiwan found laws against adultery unconstitutional. Multiple European countries also decriminalized adultery.

The least many countries are doing to handle this without going severe is using adultery as grounds for divorce. Or, like Australia, allowing a ""no-fault divorce"" option.

Nonetheless, the US military treats adultery like an ""offense"".

I don't think I wanna describe various sentences, like imprisonment or death, do I?

I was prompted by one of recent posts about criminalizing adultery.

I don't intend to judge religions that discourage adultery. I just think, like many others, laws against adultery are either too barbaric, archaic, outdated, or contrary to what democracy and freedom are about."

I'm not aware of any changes in the lexicon of experience. All dictionaries I've looked at use both definitions, and yet there's  an important distinction to be made between both interrelated definitions, that if one doesn't understand, can lead to extreme confusion.

People often say a 40 year old  general who has fought and commanded with an army on the battlefield is experienced. This same general could be in principle outsmarted by a 20 year old prodigy. The same thing for a 40 year old computer programmer and a 20 year old prodigy.

But we don't really ever say the prodigy was  more "" experienced"". We say the prodigies could outsmart or outperform those more experienced than them. 

And even this has another implicit assumption underneath, as in even if the prodigy and veteran were equal in raw intelligence, even if the veteran has more experience in terms of the quantity of situations they have been in, if the experience was just always fighting  the general fighting low level opposition in highly favorable conditions and with little  variety in the situations they have been in, they wouldn't necessarily have the same quality of experience.  The prodigy could have not only been  similiar situations but also more difficult and varied situations and has thus had the opportunity to develop better schemas, and if anything is much more flexible in approach and be less set in their ways and in limited habitual responses.

This is also related to  the basis of the saying "" do you really  have 30 years experience, or do  you  really just have 1 year of experience iterated for 30 times? "" 

So it's not really a misuse of the word to say experience is about the time and exposure to a subject , events, or data. It's also not a misuse to say an experienced person is not just one who has spent time but one who actually had a tangibly high  amount of high quality knowledge and skill in a domain. It's also not wrong to say a person is experienced  even if they lack a wide variety of high quality experiences. 

So it gets confusing, and I'm not sure I agree when people say experience can only be defined in terms of the knowledge and skill one has ( which is also in part a function of intellect or innate intelligence). 

It'd be nice if we had better terms for it though to avoid confusion,  unless there's a way I don't know about already. But I'm not sure if this is an actual problem or something to be concerned about, but I kinda feel like it is. It's something only properly understood  through wisdom at the moment , with the current definitions."

Racism is when you get your 3rd speeding ticket this month for doing 51 in a 45, when everyone else you know treats this same road like an interstate.

Racism is when your realtor won’t even bother showing you homes in the “good” neighborhoods that are projected to appreciate faster than others.

Racism is the fact that your white friend inherited his grandparents house, but you have no house to inherit because your grandparents were redlined.

Racism is when your assertive honor student starts a new school and the teacher has already privately decided your beautiful daughter is “going to be difficult” and immediately begins to bully her into submission.

Racism is when you’re told you can’t have the promotion because your hair is “unprofessional” when it’s clean and styled while your coworkers and boss regularly come in with sopping wet or greasy hair.

Racism is when you’re an introvert and keep socializing to a minimum but coworkers complain to HR that you’re “angry” or “hostile”

Racism is getting 5 years when the standard for similar offenses is probation.

Racism is an entire social system that has been ingrained into all of us—into this entire country—since it’s founding.

Discrimination, prejudice, stereotyping—everyone experiences that on a micro level.

RACISM is perpetuated on a macro level. Racism has LONG TERM, often LIFE LONG effects. These effects are also generational and have persisted over CENTURIES. Having your feelings hurt by a rude black person or two IS NOT THAT. That is not **racism**.

Racism is perpetual, snowballing disadvantage that you not only currently experience, but you were born with the effects of these snowballed disadvantages.

I don’t care what it says in Merriam-Webster. I reject any definition of misdeeds that was invented by, written by, perpetrated by, perpetuated by, and continue to be upheld by those benefiting from those misdeeds. Accepting such a definition doesn’t even make sense.

1,2023-09-29,CMV: I am a 16 year old incel that wants his views on dating and women changed,u/_Furry_Potato_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16v8plu/cmv_i_am_a_16_year_old_incel_that_wants_his_views/,changemyview,"I dont even know where to start. I decided to make this post because school has started again and I often see people my age and even younger kissing and dating and it upsets me so much. and I dont have anyone to turn to and ask for advice.

I am 16 years old and havent even held hands with a girl yet. I know people say i am too young to worry about that but im sick of it. so many people have sex and date in their teens when they are around my age and when they are even younger. the average age here in the UK is just 16! 

and people all over other places like the usa also have sex and date and it just kills me to know that so many people are easily able to experience what I struggle with so much.

I fucking hate it when family members, friends, and coworkers ask about who im dating. i hate it so much. I overheard 2 women in a store talk about how their sons and one of them said their 13 year old son is a big boy and already has a girlfriend. fuck that just made me seethe so much with envy.

I have discovered the incel movement and couldnt help but sympathize with them.

Women/girls are the choosers and they always seem to choose some of the douchiest, stupidest, biggest fucking losers and its hard to respect women because of it. its why i have grown to resent them. Some of the girls i have known have cried and complained to their friends how their boyfriend left them, cheated, or doesnt give them much attention. girls for some reason, always seem to go for the brutes that really dont care about them.

and I wanna make it clear I do not think I am entitled to anything (gosh i despise it when people just throw that word at us). I just feel envious and perplexed at how guys, including some of biggest jerks, easily get girlfriends while i am stuck with my hand and virtual girls. it feels so pathetic. 

I hate having desires to kiss and date girls. if i could turn gay or get rid of these desires i would in an instant. so many guys seem to take it for granted.

not only do i feel pathetic and less of a man and human being in general for not being able to do what billions of people have done, but i feel like theres such a void in me that i cant fill. i just wanna cuddle and kiss with a girl who likes me back but none of them do.

i don wanna date and have sex when im older. it seems boring and much less fun because you have much less free time and grownups seems so miserable all the time. i wanna do it now that im still young and have lots of free time and energy."
1,2023-09-29,CMV: I believe humans are much more scarier monsters than fictional ones,u/VitaFiresoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16v9mnc/cmv_i_believe_humans_are_much_more_scarier/,changemyview,"Not only because they are real, but because fictional evil monsters (be it eldritch abomination or something either) are based on humanity's evil side. Sometimes, lovecraftian gods could be more moral than humans and I feel them more empathy towards to them than, I don't know, Kim Chen In or Taliban. Sometimes, lovecraftian gods or abominations are more neutral than evil, just an embodiment of forces of nature. I like to imagine a situation when a wizard uses eldritch abominations's help to destroy tyrannies. After all, humans could be real monsters.

I checked my childhood and teenage traumas when I got scared by creepypastas and jumpscares. They are not scary to me anymore. Sometimes, it's entertaining when a horrorfic version of Sonic the Hedgehog tries to jumpscare me. This makes me laugh and going to nostalgia. When you becomed adult, you're starting to gain fear from more mundane and real problems: death of your family members, totalitarian dictatorships, becoming a disabled person and etc. Let's say, I'mmore scared from Big Brother from 1984 novel. He is the most horrofic fictional character ever existed. He looks like a human, but  it doesn't make him less scary. Sometimes, scary monsters could be friendly neighbourhoods."
136,2023-09-29,"CMV: we are “incentivized” to buy bigger quantities of food to save on prices, thus rationalizing that it’s cheaper to eat more than we probably should.",u/Bobba_fat,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16va4bf/cmv_we_are_incentivized_to_buy_bigger_quantities/,changemyview,"I’ll give an example make above statement more clear:

I eat Swedish cheese on top of my sandwich. The cheese is not like Philadelphia but rather cheese that you can slice of the top and save and then slice of more if you want more. Make sense? Think of it like a block of hard 🧀. Like the image. 

Ok, so… here is the problem.

I am a single male, and have a girlfriend. Now, when I am in the store, there is usually only one big block of cheese that weighs say 1 kilo ~2pounds (there are smaller choices as well but ill get into that in a minute.)

So basically all I can buy is that big piece of cheese. This makes my consumption of cheese go through the roof, since I have to eat that everyday. I don’t want to eat that cheese every day and until the time comes I finish that cheese, it will not be in a good/fresh state and I’ll have to throw it away. This cheese makes sense for a family who can reasonably eat it within the week. 

The model that I want doesn’t have smaller cheese. But let’s say there is, the price of a small batch can cost up to say ~30-40% more per/kilo than the regular one. That makes a 400g cheese almost 40% more expensive than a “large” cheese (per/kilo 🤯😖)

What this does is enable me to eat more cheese than I have to, cause I don’t want to throw it away. This I get fatter and bigger.

Yes, I can use the cheese to make lasagne for example(which I do) since I don’t want it to go to waste.

But the problem I have is that the food industry is basically enabling us to eat more to save more. 

Again the cheese example:

A while ago I found the cheese they had a promotion on it, and for some reason there were some that weighed 300grams blocks for the same usual price. I bought 3 of those cheeses (since unopened cheese can hold for months in a fridge.) and that was great. I didn’t have to force myself eating up all cheese at once, I could proportion it as I saw fit. 

So the discussion is: why do we have to buy more to save more and that in itself enables to over eat when there are simple solution to this. 

Also, this would lead to way less waste from food which is a huge problem in western world where I’m at, and that’s a shame. 

I hope my point came across well enough. I’m interested in others opinions on why it has to be this way. 

This I guess mostly counts towards fresh produce and obviously not macaroni/pasta/rice/shampoo etc which have a long shelf life.

Edit: thank you for your inputs. I’m trying to find alternative views and I know I am not totally clear. But your answers are partial deltas. Maybe because I’m a bit vague it makes it harder to award. But I love the feedback. 🙏🏽💪🏾"

I think Wilt is the best so far because of how much he distanced himself from his competition. No one has done so since him.

Now people bring up when he played and who he played against. I say that is irrelevant. All people at that time had access to the same knowledge and training aids (more or less). Same as today. No one has an upper hand. Some may start earlier and some may have a physical advantage but they don’t have access to some futuristic technology. 

Give it 40 years and people will be saying the same thing about Magic, Malone, Duncan, Kobe, Dirk, LeBron, Curry & Durant. They couldn’t play in todays game. They wouldn’t put up the same numbers. Doesn’t matter what they could do in 30/40/50 years. What matters is those guys did/are doing phenomenal against the competition they have been presented with. 

That’s why I think it’s important to view how a person dominated the competition they were presented with. And again, Wilt did it the best.s 

Let me ask you this, are the college and high school sprinters who have ran a 10.2 (or better) greater sprinters than Jesse Owens? 

Of course they aren’t. They aren’t gapping people in the Olympics like Owens did. 

So what’s your metic by which you weigh how great someone is at basketball? Why isn’t it Wilt?"
1,2023-09-29,CMV: Tier / rank gap limits are the one most frustrating mechanics in competetive multiplayer games,u/No_add,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ve12m/cmv_tier_rank_gap_limits_are_the_one_most/,changemyview,"I'm unsure what the propper name for this mechanic is, but it's present in many online competetive multiplayer game with a rank system. Essentially; if the gap between rank of the highest and lowest ranked player of your group is too wide, then you can't que for a competetive match together anymore. (For example a Bronze player can't play with a Gold player or something similar)

I don't think the positives of this system, which is making balanced matchmaking easier, outweigh the negatives. At best this makes you reliant on always playing with your partner / friend when you play the game, and at worst forces the more highly ranked player to intentionally play worse, or drop down in ranks on their own to be closer ranked to their teammate. It can also put you off wanting to play that game together at all.

I've spent a lot of time playing such games with my girlfriend the last two years, mainly Overwatch and Apex Legends, and i find it very frustrating to deal with."

Now he is supposidly a part of a community but he has so little investment in it, gains so little from that tree even existing in the first place that felling it seemed like something he felt he could do without losing anything which is disturbing because the reality is it should have been partially his too as it really wasn't anyones to ""take"". 

I feel like the people who are losing out most as a result of this are also partially to blame. Had they worked with the people in their community, shared the wealth they gained and raised all boats then maybe he would have felt that impact more. Maybe he would have realised the value it held but to him it's just another tree."

If you work for the government, a shutdown is one of the risks, just like layoffs, furloughs, and bankruptcies are one of the risks if you work in the private sector. Government shutdowns have been happening pretty regularly since 1990 and anyone going into government work should know that these exist and plan accordingly, just as private sector employees must be prepared for layoffs.

It is not in the interest of taxpayers to pay public employees to not work. They should be eligible for unemployment, etc., but I don't see why they should get paid their full salary unless they want to use accrued PTO for this purpose.

Obviously if you do work (e.g. TSA), you should get paid, but if you get sent home from your job at the Department of Education or Bureau of Land Management, then there's no reason taxpayers should fund your time off retroactively."

Their main qualification is inheriting wealth and not being smart enough to build anything with it. The whole banking and political system is rigged in their favour, and they still make a terrible return on investment compared to any other investment if they were capable of building an actual product with any ingenuity.

I'm not talking about construction workers or architects, who should be getting a much larger percentage of the profit for the value they add. Even when someone starts from nothing to build a property portfolio, I think it's a shame, and with such hard work, they should be doing something that actually benefits the economy, not just rent seeking.

I don't care if you rent to millionaires, I don't see the harm, but socialised housing has been lobbied out of existence in so many countries because this vulture class couldn't compete with what should be a human right. Outlaw the fire service and privatised alternatives will start turning a profit, but it's regrettable.

I'm not mad with the individuals, I blame the system, but I'm not impressed by anyone boasting about their ""investment portfolio"" dude, you bought a house for 5% yearly return on investment, the rest of your wealth comes from being born in the right generation, inheriting enough money, and house prices perpetually going up because of factors outside of your control."

I also remember how FNAF fandom was full of stupid school kids. It's easy to attractive such young auditory when you have cartoon animal mascots as monsters.

There are some really idiotic sexualities out there:

Sapisoexual. So you prefer smart gals/fellas over beautiful gals/fellas. Is that a sexuality now! Is blondsexual a sexuality??

However, this popularity has its drawbacks. But from the beginning.  
The Soul Publishing is a company founded by Pavel Radayev and Marat Mukhametov, based in Cyprus. It has 100+ channels in 20+ languages. They have 200m followers on Facebook and 2 billion views across all social networks. The company itself has been criticized for pro-Russian propaganda, among other things, but there are no strictly political videos on the channels. Let's start dismantling their channels from the Bright Side:  
https://youtu.be/Ea9jnjCWBOM  
https://youtu.be/dslCEMHU9sU   
The Bright Side likes to throw facts pulled out of its ass. Zero sources, you have to look for it yourself. Once you dig, you often find that the information is false. It wouldn't surprise me if it turned out that they googled the topic, copied the text from the first or second link and inserted it into the script or copied from better creators. Such as MinuteEarth, Kurzgesagt, CGP Grey or Vsauce. These creators put a lot of effort into their work, often even contacting experts in the field they want to talk about. I leave aside the fact that every one of their thumbnails is clickbait. Some steal from Kurzgesagt, comparison No. 1 and comparison No. 2. In addition, these ""rRiDdlES"" of theirs are often murders and investigations (and as we know, there is nothing clearer than murder) and solutions that either make no sense or break the possibility of rain, for example, or both. Often in the videos there are translation errors or the text on the screen is not translated at all. People! Open your eyes!  
My Story Animated/Actually Happened:      
https://youtu.be/\_tlxlt1WcmE  
https://youtu.be/CCDG6ck6mCg  
The description of these channels says to send your own story, but there is no contact email. Jarvis Johnson described how one of his viewers applied for a job with The Soul Publishing at Actually Happened, the original story channel. Right away, there are a few requirements that show that this company flies to the money. The stories have to be believable so that a teenager will find them ""relatable,"" they have to be diverse, they can have references to real stories people have shared online, and the American viewer is supposed to think the story is written by a native speaker. Most importantly, however, you must be fluent in Russian and translate the text into Russian.  
5-minute crafts:  
https://youtu.be/CCDG6ck6mCg  
https://youtu.be/7Urgvf8d2PA  
https://youtu.be/Lbu6Iz\_hA3c  
This channel has probably the crappiest and worst lifehack videos, e.g. in one of their videos they recommend bleaching strawberries by dipping them in bleach, and another time they show that heating a corn cob will make it turn into popcorn, when in fact it will just be warmer. In yet another video, they showed how dipping an egg in vinegar and then in maple syrup will make it bigger. To top it off, they once showed how to apply more than 200 prescription rubber bands just to smash a watermelon. Toward the end, they showed that to avoid drinking out of a cup, it's a good idea to cover them with nail polish. Well, imagine what would happen if someone tried that. Likewise with 123GO!, La La Life and Slick   
Slime Sam. They are also about pranks and often their subject matter is Poppy Playtime, Rainbow Friends, FNAF, etc. and series like Wednesday. They appear as if there are security guards armed with rifles behind the camera and threaten to shoot them in the head for disobedience.   
Now about the channels that are not from The Soul Publishing:  
Troom Troom:  
https://youtu.be/8QYHVnqdL70  
https://youtu.be/k6CiRle1cEk  
This channel is like the 4 previous ones I mentioned, but worse. It has the same topics like games like Poppy Playtime, Rainbow Friends, FNAF, etc. and series like Wednesday and for some reason Pokemons? It also tells about pranks. This channel happens to be Ukrainian.  
Woo Hoo:  
https://youtu.be/PbKU0GckOoo  
https://youtu.be/7KWmFk0BAhA  
This channel is like Troom Troom but worse. It's Ukrainian too, because it was set up by the same people, they even gave a logo that you can see a mile away that it's similar. Both channels look as if there were security guards armed with rifles behind the camera and threatened to shoot them in the head for disobedience.  
Summary/TLDR: The Soul Publishing is a Russian corporation. Its daughter channels have a chance to be better, but instead they choose to do fast and be crappy. The Bright Side does not provide reliable facts or their sources. My True Story/True Stories does not show real stories. 5-Minute Crafts, 123GO!, La La La Lajf AND Super Sludge Sam suggest probably the crappiest and worst lifehack videos. Troom Troom beats them to the punch, and I won't talk about Woo Hoo anymore, hands down.  
This is a youtube business, so it can't be stopped like that. For now, it is possible to report as clickbait or harmful or dangerous content in the category of harmful or dangerous content. The old YouTube would remove it, but the new YouTube? As long as they can make money from it, it stays.  
If you've made it to this point, thank you."
1,2023-09-30,"CMV: Gun violence in the United States will continue to increase, and there is nothing we can do.",u/LordLucas7822,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16w65yu/cmv_gun_violence_in_the_united_states_will/,changemyview,"My argument is basically a two-point case. I believe the following:

1. Gun control will never be passed in the United States at a federal level, which is the only way it could work, because otherwise someone truly determined to commit a mass shooting can just go to a neighboring state with more lax gun laws.
2. Even if gun control were passed on a federal level, it wouldn't work.

POINT 1: 

Look, it's no secret that the massacres keep happening more and more frequently. I tend to agree with that British journalist who said that Sandy Hook was the end of the gun control debate. Gun violence has gone from a generation-defining tragedy to something that happens every day in America. Events like Uvalde that remain in the news for a few weeks are the exception, not the rule. Plus, the general public seems to care less and less about the fact that the US is a total warzone. As an example, Greg Abbott, a very pro-gun violence politician, won 60 percent in the vote in Uvalde County even after the Robb Elementary massacre. Other countries have started putting travel warnings against the US, and still nothing ever changes even as our foreign relations suffer. I don't have any serious expectation that things will change enough for gun control to be passed federally. However, that's not even the biggest obstacle to putting an end to this plague.

POINT 2:

To those who would say that other countries have solved this problem, I'm not going to deny that. However, Canada, Australia, Germany, and other countries never had the same gun culture that we did. The US has twice as many guns per capita as fucking YEMEN. If gun control were passed tomorrow, I expect gun sales to massively increase the way they do after every high-profile mass shooting. The Second Amendment people will say ""They're trying to take our guns!"" and they'll arm up even further. Even if that doesn't happen, there are still too many guns floating around, so the only real solution is for the government to forcibly confiscate them, which would probably end in even more violence. *Even in the best-case scenario, gun violence would continue, it just wouldn't increase as exponentially as it is right now.* 

As you can imagine, I desperately want my view changed, because I don't want to believe that I have to move to another country. I just hate seeing the US devolve into a civil warzone. "

Some states are allowing permit-less carry now, there have been tighter restrictions on magazines and bans prior.

I want to tell you something and here they are:

Incels hate themselves as if they believe that it is all their fault why they are ""trash that no girl wants""

And

The incel forum Incels.is is full of fakecels mocking real incels.

Why am I saying this?

The reason why I am saying this is because many incels in incels.is have derogatory names and usernames such as ""Subhuman"", ""Nazi"", ""Repulsive"", ""Loser"", ""Narcissistic"", ""Cannibalistic Necrophile"", ""Marxist"", ""Lucifer"", ""Communist"", ""Aspiring Drug Dealer"", etc. I mean why do they call themselves those derogatory names? Are they perhaps fakecels who are parodying real incels by making incels look like disgusting creatures or are incels just self-hating delusional psychos?

Why do they call themselves those derogatory names?

Incels are basically males that females don't like to have as people to have sex with, boyfriends, or husbands but so many people in incels.is are  nazis, racists, communists, and marxists. Like what do those things have to do with being an incel?

Also, many incels in incels.is think that harming the families, spouses, lovers, children, and relatives of their enemies is okay. Like what the fuck?

Also, when users in incels.is say they should kill their hated enemies, they put things such as (in Call of Duty), (in Fortnite), etc. in the end. Like what does that even mean? Strange.

Are people in the forum incels.is just fakecels mocking real incels by making incels look super evil or are incels just delusional self-hating psychos?"
1,2023-09-30,CMV: Self Defense with lethal force should only be allowed if the person or others are in imminent physical danger.,u/Easy_Rip1212,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16w8gke/cmv_self_defense_with_lethal_force_should_only_be/,changemyview,"This post is inspired by the recent Alan Colie / Tanner Cook court case but also just applies in general to similar scenarios. For those unfamiliar [Cook is a YouTuber that does shitty prank videos mostly just harassing people. He approached and harassed Colie at a mall and Colie shot him.](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/jury-divided-over-whether-delivery-driver-who-shot-youtube-prankster-acted-in-self-defense/3432763/)

Let me start by saying I believe Cook in general is a piece of shit and I would struggle to really find sympathy for him. Harassing/Pranking bystanders for youtube content is abhorrent. In most places it's against the law. However, what I'm observing on reddit/social media that I believe to be wrong is the mentality of ""if we don't like someone, if they get shot they deserved it regardless of circumstances."" 

In an ideal world what would have happened in this situation is Colie would have found or contacted police nearby and they could have cited or arrested Cook for harassing people in a public space. Instead less than 20 seconds into being harassed Colie just pulled a gun and shot Cook. Colie was not facing imminent physical danger. 

I grew up believing if you can't get the justice you wish for in the moment for a micro aggression, you can't just shoot the other person. But I'm not sure that is accurate anymore. It's certainly headed in the opposite direction. Normally I'm put off by slippery slope arguments, but I think we are seeing this slippery slope become more and more slippery right in front of our eyes over the past ~20 years. 

What Cook was doing was annoying. Even if I would rather people like him simply not exist, he still deserves the same legal protections as I do. I think about what would happen if I approached a stranger to ask a question and they simply perceived that I was harassing them and so they shoot me. Or if an innocent unarmed teenager is just walking through a neighborhood and a racist scumbag decides to murder him and gets to walk scot-free. We have observed multiple instances of people in bad faith claiming to ""feel threatened"" just as an excuse to shoot someone.


What we are seeing play out on the internet in this case and others is a popularity/likeability threshold to determine guilt/innocence. There are dozens+ examples of people doing far worse than what Cook did in this exchange which the vast majority would say doesn't necessitate shooting the other person. The mostly one-sided social media reaction to this story is ignoring the facts of the story because Cook is an unlikable person doing a very annoying thing. 


I would also point out that social media are forming their judgment/conclusion on this story based on Cook's reputation and history. This is an extreme double standard. We get furious when police try to justify a shooting based on the person's past warrants and behaviors that the police didn't even know at the time. 

I know it's easy to see this story and feel Colie had a right to shoot Cook. My concern is that the threshold for random people to decide they are justified to shoot other random people is going in the wrong direction. Using lethal force in a scenario where you or others are not in imminent physical danger is wrong. Even if the person you shoot is a really shitty and annoying person. Even if 90% of the internet thinks the person had it coming."

Of course, I am not talking about people from 3rd world countries struggling to find food but unless you are one of these people life is pretty easy. To live a comfortable life only thing you have to do is not be incredibly lazy or stupid and you are pretty much set. Go to any college really spend a few months at maximum to find a job while probably either still living with your parents or in a temporary accommodation. Do not live above your means save a bit, take a mortgage buy a house, continue saving up a bit more invest just a little bit and you will be pretty much set. The struggle is only for a few years at the beginning of adulthood and even then you have millions of examples to look at. The people that life is pretty hard to are usually idiots that don't even finish high school or are just way too lazy or idiots that marry or have kids way too early. Just don't have kids and take on too much responsibility too early, don't be absolutely stupid and you are set. Sure, if you come from a background that is super poor you will struggle a bit more but that is not the case for the majority of people. Most people are just ungrateful assholes complaining about not being able to afford a luxury 3 week vacation to Europe.

  
In short, life isn't that hard and if it is, it is 99% of the time you fault, if you cannot buy a house move to another state you don't have to live in California or NY.

1,2023-09-30,"CMV: The (subset of) Christians who claim that Hell is eternal torment do not, in fact, actually believe it - given how lackadaisical they are about it.",u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16waaqx/cmv_the_subset_of_christians_who_claim_that_hell/,changemyview,"First off, I recognize that not all Christians claim that Hell is eternal torment. Some claim the afterlife for unsaved people is annihilationism, some claim it's purgatory, some claim something else altogether.

That being said, in the religious circle that I grew up in (charismatic and Baptist-type denominations,) this was by and large the default viewpoint that was preached from the pulpit - that those who die unsaved will burn in Hell. I attended a Christian college that required all students to agree with their 'statement of faith' which included a section that stated that those who die unsaved are in ""conscious torment for eternity."" And this viewpoint isn't rare at all; I'd wager that many millions of Christians - in America and elsewhere in the world - claim to ascribe to such an interpretation.

What always struck me as particularly hollow about this claim, though, was that **hardly a single Christian behaved as if this was real.**

Think about what the implications would be if Hell were *really* that - being tortured for eternity. It would mean something far *worse*, and *longer*, than being tortured for 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. Think about the agony that people in the World Trade Center who were in the inferno-vicinity of the jet-impact points suffered - for probably no more than a few minutes - as they were roasted alive in the flames on 9/11. Or think of the people who were immersed into vats of nitric acid by ISIS, or skinned alive in some ancient societies, or who burned alive in the firebombing of Dresden or Tokyo, or - well, really, the most horrific physical fate or gruesome torture you can think of. 

Now multiply that length of torture/suffering by *trillions* of years, and you haven't even gotten *close* to the length of time Hell is (according to such theology.)

Now, most such Christians don't believe in universalism either (the belief that all will be saved.) Indeed, it is a very common view of many Christians that relatively *few* people will be saved (they often cite the verse where Jesus says, ""Wide is the path to destruction, and many find it; narrow is the path to life, and few find it."") Let's say that ""few"" means 10%, and even that's considered generous by many such Christians. This means that 90% of the world's population is going to Hell - forever - the most horrific torment. And what this also means, is that **94 people in the world are going to Hell every single minute,** given the number of people in the world who die per minute. It also means your unsaved cousin, boyfriends, classmate at school, uncle, coworker, friendly neighbor, etc. are all at imminent risk of falling into torture that goes on forever and forever. I mean, all it takes is for a drunk driver to hit them at an intersection one day, or a heart attack. (Again, I don't believe this - I'm just saying, that's what many Christians **claim** to be true.)

But - *the vast majority of such Christians spend perhaps no more than half an hour every year in evangelism.* They live their lives as if people are **not** going to, in fact, be roasted, shrieking and screaming, in flames forever. They spend 99.99% of their time watching TV, working, having hobbies, fun, traveling, reading, etc. - like anyone else - as if they're totally chill and fine with the prospect of 270 out of their 300 friends on Facebook being sentenced to a fate so terrible that it's barely humanly imaginable. Sure, you see the occasional street preacher who shouts with a loudspeaker ""Turn and burn, you are all headed to Hell!"" - but that's the rare exception.

So, the only conclusion I can draw from such behavior is that over 99% of Christians who claim that Hell means horrific torment for all eternity do not, in fact, actually believe their own theology.

It's nuts because it's stupid advice that clearly only favors the woman. Obviously you shouldn't count down to the last penny. For instance when I took my girlfriend to dinner, the total was 70, I paid. The next time she paid, it was 40. That's fine. It doesn't have to be exact to be show you share. But then it gets to the point where men get taken advantage of and you tell them to suck it up 

It happened to my brother. Kind of.

They were both in college, so it wasn't like he was making a ton more money than her, but he did end up putting a bunch of her expenses on his credit card. Then, after they graduated and started working, ""the spark was gone,"" and they were on/off for a while until the final dumpage.

Its been like 5+ years now and I think he's still paying off his credit card from her.


You would never tell a woman to do this. So stop telling me to accept it."
1,2023-09-30,"CMV: I'm tired with ""AAA games are bad, indies are good"" statement in gaming community.",u/VitaFiresoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16wbkd8/cmv_im_tired_with_aaa_games_are_bad_indies_are/,changemyview,"I love indie games, but I'm really tired how many people in gaming community worship to indie games. I understand their feelings. When a big studio releases a long awaited big budget game, and it turns to be a crap, people get dissapointed. But people often forget that in medium more good AAA games are released each year than bad ones. And it's normal for every gaming studio to make at least one bad game at their lifetime. After all, humans are working in companies, and humans tend to make mistakes, learn from them and improve themselves.

Of course, we have many amazing indie games like Hollow Knight and Undertale, but they are just a drop in am ocean of badly made shovelware indie games. You can check Steam's list of indie games and you see that most of indies here are either trash, or just clones of popular videogames. And I'm silent how it's hard to develop indie games, and I heard many stories how indie developer sacrificed his health and money to make a game of his dream, and get dissapointed how his game isn't getting any popularity. I don't understand why people still want to become indie developers even after watching Indie Game: The movie documentary. It's not a romantical and fun experience. Also, being indie gaming fan means that you should have a lot of patience to wait for a full release of your beloved game from early access, which will take years. By this time you get a graduation in school, get old and have kids and etc.

I should to mention that indie gaming scene has many dramas and problems like AAAgaming industry does. Let's take, for example, Yandere Simulator drama, or vs Sonic.exe mod for Friday Night Funkin. Or just look how indie games becomed so much mainstream today that it's now more profitable to release roguelite games than somethinf unique and interesting. Instead of making for art, indie developers are now creating games for profit and popularity, and instead of making something for art, they started to use already proved formula aka Binding of Isaac inspired  roguelites.

If AAA gaming industry in crisis, and indie gaming does same, I believe more on AA games, aka medium budget games like Baldur's Gate 3 and Hi-Fi Rush. They made for more niche auditory, but they are fun."

With home shaving, there are fewer car trips, reducing carbon emissions. Plus, at home, an electric razor's occasional charge or a durable manual razor seems eco-friendlier than a barber shop's constant resource consumption.  
I'd reconsider if data showed that the eco-footprint of home-use products significantly outweighs barber shop consumption. Additionally, if barber shops largely adopt sustainable practices, like solar energy or water-saving techniques, it could be a game-changer. While I'm currently swayed by the environmental benefits of home shaving, I remain open to compelling, evidence-based counterpoints."

But what if others don't like it, what if there are some valid criticisms that one could make about said artwork?

Then it'll be pretty easy for others to just downplay it and invalidates their opinions because ""It's a masterpiece, so it doesn't matter what you say""

That's why whenever I hear people's opinions about an art being a ""classic"" or a ""masterpiece"", I'm not gonna just bow down and kiss the artists feet just because they made something that's others deem exceptional. I'm just gonna treat it like every other art and just judge it in my own merit

These are not punished. Hard credit checks are when creditors check it when you're applying for something. This is absolute horse shit. The only way to really know what interest rate you're going to get is when the creditor runs a hard credit check. So if you want to be cautious and responsible by only applying for a loan/credit which you can afford, you get punished for checking it. Especially if various creditors offer different rates and you want to check with all of them. The idea of getting punished for being responsible is dumb. 

While we're at it, paying off a loan early should not negatively impact someone's credit score either. Being responsible and paying off high interest loans should not be viewed as a negative.

Change my view. Tell me why exactly it's a good thing to punish people for hard credit checks and paying loans off early. I understand that it's setup for the creditors to profit, not the consumers. I want to understand the bullshit justification used for it. "

I am 16 years old and havent even kissed a girl yet. I know people say i am too young to worry about that but im sick of it. so many people have sex and date in their teens when they are around my age and when they are even younger. the average age here in the UK is just 16!  
and people all over other places like the usa also have sex and date and it just kills me to know that so many people are easily able to experience what I struggle with so much.  
I fucking hate it when family members, friends, and coworkers ask about who im dating. i hate it so much. I overheard 2 women in a store talk about their sons and one of them said their 13 year old son is a big boy and already has a girlfriend. fuck that just made me seethe so much with envy.

I hate having desires to kiss and date girls. if i could turn gay or get rid of these desires i would in an instant. so many guys seem to take it for granted. it seems amazing to be able to hold hands, kiss, and even have sex with girls. girls are just pretty.  
There was this senior girl I had a HUGE crush on. When I walked past her I heard her talking with a friend about her having sex with a guy at her house and how he said he loved her neck.

The dudes she slept with werent even anything special. They werent in some band, or in the sports team, nor were they talented or rich.  
yet this fucking loose, shameless, disgraceful, skank of a whore still chose to have sex with these absolute losers.  
as much as i wanna have sex with one, I would happy with just kissing and dating. some of the things i wanna do is take a girl out to a very fun place like a bowling alley, zoo, a carnival, or an aquarium and see sharks and sea lions or even take her to eat ice cream with me at a park. i wanna have fun and live a normal teenage life but i cant because the universe seems to fucking cuck me so much.

not only do i feel pathetic and less of a man and human being in general for not being able to do what billions of people have done and what millions of people, including teens are doing as we speak, but i feel like theres such a void in me that i cant fill. i just wanna cuddle and kiss with a girl who likes me back but none of them do.  
i dont wanna date and have sex when im older. it seems boring and much less fun because you have much less free time and grownups seem so miserable all the time. i wanna do it now that im still young and have lots of free time and energy.

1,2023-09-30,CMV: Unpaid internships should be illegal,u/LaserWerewolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16wg0hb/cmv_unpaid_internships_should_be_illegal/,changemyview,"The most obvious reason that unpaid internships should be illegal is because this violates the spirit of minimum wage laws, if not the letter. People should be paid for their work.

The other reason is that unpaid internships exacerbate inequality by offering people with no experience a way to gain a foothold in a given industry only if they can survive for the length of the internship without earning any money. 

For people who need to work so they can survive, an unpaid internship is usually not an option. And so these people are often caught in the catch-22 situation of needing experience so they can get a job, and needing a job so they can get experience.

If companies paid interns at least minimum wage, this would level the playing field considerably and enable more working-class people to gain experience in their chosen field.

To change my view, you would have to convince me either that unpaid internships do not exacerbate or perpetuate inequality, or that it is reasonable for a company to not pay a person for their work."

We used to be in more tribal groups where the loss/ injury of a person and the contributions they make were significant to everyone in the community, now even if you try your hardest, there is more of a chance of others having advantages or just outperforming you, leading to less recognition and appreciation (in general).

I think this will continue until as a civilization we span planets and maybe galaxies and then losing a person will be just like a dead cell on your body, or even whole towns will be like a large wound if something catastrophic were to happen.

I also think that as technology improves more and more we will continue to disconnect from each other making any appreciation or recognition less still."
1,2023-09-30,CMV: Venues stopping merch cuts would be a net negative to the consumer,u/midnight_rebirth,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16wgwng/cmv_venues_stopping_merch_cuts_would_be_a_net/,changemyview,"NOTE: I don't support merch cuts as a practice. My argument here is that because of where we're at with them being universal and a given, removing them now after so long would be negative for the concert-goers. 

With that disclaimer out of the way, let's get to the CMV. 

Live Nation recently announced they are [cutting merch fees for some of their venues.](https://mixmag.net/read/live-nation-criticised-over-new-on-the-road-again-scheme-touring-artists-news/) Most would agree that merch cuts are not fair to the band or the consumer, as it results in higher prices for the fans and the venue taking funds they arguably have no right to. 

But here's what I believe to be a big problem with this theory: whether we're talking about an indie band or a massive arena-touring act, one thing is true: fans are used to paying the prices that they've been paying. 

Thus I believe no true change is going to come of this. If tomorrow every venue stood in solidarity and agreed to remove merch cuts, prices would not come down. People have already been accustomed to paying $35 or $40 for t-shirts, in some cases more. Why would the artists choose to willingly lower prices when they know their fans will pay? Sure, I bet a few ones would either out of principle or respect. But I'd be willing to stake a bet that 90% would not lower the fees.

Additionally, merchandise is optional. You can go to a concert and not pick up merch. But the venues who are used to taking merch cuts are going to make up that revenue elsewhere. If it's a large enough venue to be using Ticketmaster, Live Nation, etc then the fees will go up. If it's a smaller venue, price of drinks could get increased or service fees included with the ticket may be tacked on to increase revenue to make up the costs. 

I don't see how at this point in the game removing merch fees would do anything but screw over the person paying for concerts in the end: the fans. Please, change my view!"

In particular I consider the game to more or less peak around the point you obtain the master sword, and rapidly fall off after the Arbiter's ground. 

The saving Midna sections are brilliant, but the lack of Twilight and Wolf Link segments makes it so you feel a lot less like you are saving the world. The Arbiter's ground is a cool break with the previously established formula that is fun, but it really feels like you've just already saved the world by the time you get there. Zelda's dead and Ganondorf is just kind of chilling in the castle doing nothing. Ilia's memory needs to be restored but that's kind of it. 

In the first three dungeons it feels like you saved the area from the twilight but there's still a corruption in place from the fused shadow in the temple. In the first the monkeys are being imprisoned and there's a poison in the forest, the second the volcano is disturbed and the Gorons are on edge, the third something is going wrong with Lake Hylia

Both were imprisoned until they turned 18, at which point, they were given new identities and allow to re-renter society.

Since then, Thompson has remained in therapy and under supervision, and to anyone's knowledge has not re-offended.

Venables, on the other hand, has been afforded multiple new identities, including due to him just telling people. He has also been arrested and imprisoned again multiple times, including on child pornography charges.

I believe that by all evidence, Thompson is rehabilitated, and the government protecting him from vigilantes for what he did 30 years ago makes sense to me. Venables, on the other hand, has repeatedly shown disregard for preserving his own anonymity, and has shown himself not to have become an acceptable member of society. I do not think the UK government should continue to protect him and provide him with new identities. He should be left to live his life now; he isn't 10 anymore.

Other kids will be ahead of your children, and they will trust their parents more than your children trust you, because of you. 

Age and subject matter, well, don't matter. 

If you are are not a bad and weak parent then you explain whatever and move on, because you don't control what exists and that is not scary and that is ok. That doesn't threaten you, observably, so your child grows more thoughtful. 

They move on and understand that the things that you knew were not important, well, were actually not important. You didn't make that true with words or volume, you just let them know. They learn that about you as much as what you were saying and are more likely to ignore you less often. 

You proved your value as a parent, one that helped them through their knowledge, contextualizing it in a way that held value with or without your opinions. 

They trust you more for helping them understand observable facts that exist when you aren't around. 

Alternatively you fail your child by trying to ""protect children"" by choosing to impose on their intellectual and emotional grown for your comfort. You force them to exist from behind. They know less than they could, and they are less prepared, so you did a worse job.

Now the first thing I noticed was despite the number of women saying hey this actually isn't what we want, the response is always ""women are lying"". Despite the truth presented through data, people won't be changed. 

Then I thought of religion, covid etc. Despite people pointing out the flaw in their thinking people will still go back to flawed thinking  even when they admit they know the thinking is flawed. 

It isn't that we should just educate the ignorant. Its that we can't help them. 

Now why I want you to cmv
I thought about people like drug addicts etc. Despite all the programs in more helpful societies etc  people know drugs are bad. It isn't for lack of teaching them that they do drugs. They know but still chose to do it. 

No amount of education can change an adult. I feel at some point most people will have solidified their thoughts  

now my cmv is also in part that we should target kids young. this usually gets people in a Tiffy because of course its hard to target kids and remove them from conspiracy nuts unless  we remove them from the parents entirely"

This is a common counterargument against people who argue that college should be less expensive, shorter or less burdensome than it currently is

* Most good jobs require a college degree

* Most people go to college with the intent to get a higher paying job than would otherwise be available 

* Most people do not have enough generational wealth to make a family or have a comfortable standard of living without a good job

* Many people would opt out of college altogether if not for the fact that many jobs require a degree, even if someone without a degree could do the job well


I understand the sentiment of the argument and the idea that college is for education and learning. But it ignores the reality that people experience in real life"
