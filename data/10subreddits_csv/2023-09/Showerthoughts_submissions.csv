A special current of natural ecstasy, that you can activate to flow to that organ or that also activates directly from it, is the driving force for these senses and is known as your most powerful ability to create, defend and control your life.  


  
It flows through the body via channels or meridians that connect all parts of the body and it can be easily activated and amplified through very specific breathing techniques.  


  
You can most easily recognize this energy within you through self-induced goosebumps from positive events/stimuli.  


  
Eventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps, feel it over your whole body and increase its duration, just like me and countless others have succeeded.  


  
It has been researched and documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pitī, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered with your help.

Therefore free will is who we are, we are the universe expressing possibilities and our choices are dictated none other but ourselves, which is the universe. Somehow the answer is both at the same time. But one thing is for sure, there is no externality in free will, its all filtered through our being, which is the 100% part of and made of the cosmos."

Etc. i think at the very end what matters is if the game mattered to you or not.

Let me explain. I payed a WIDE variety of games but at the very end, when i finished each there was only two types of games, ones that ended up mattering to my life and ones that did not.

What i mean by mattering: For example like a tiktok video, you watch it, scroll and just forget it ever existed. That is a thing that didn’t matter.

Games are longer than a tiktok video so you will not forget them like that, but

- There will be games that you experienced in the moment while playing but then kinda just was done with it when you finished it. And that was that.

- and then there are the games that you finish and actually feel like they were a part of your life. Something that made memories you reminisce. Kinda like your childhood memories.

Note that you can absolutely love both types of games, but not both will matter to your life by the end.

Heres an example from me:


- I liked tomb raider games,and replayed them, but when i finish a play-through I’m just done with it, no memories made, just an entertainment time passer for the present time i was playing it at.

- Compared to Skyrim. It feels like a part of my life, i remember many moments just like i remember certain parts of normal life, it felt like you actually lived through the time you played it (if I’m making sense)

Talking about skyrim, people often judge bethesda for reusing the same formula, but idc because it works at giving you that mattering experience in your life. (Also its like judging a painter or musician for using the same type of paint or instrument, We need to look past that in games)

Other games that feels like part of my life to me are: 
- Hitman blood money
- AC black flag
- Minecraft [ Immortal fantasy factions server, its dead :( ]
- GTA games (especially VC, SA)
- MGSV
- The Walking Dead

Hopefully i made sense to some of you. Its not the formula (Graphics, gameplay, etc) but the magic of the art behind it.

People who don’t enjoy skyrim for example, i feel like they are just trying to play it as time passer entertainment piece, instead of just relaxing and living in it instead."

My aunt offered to take me but I still had time left on my bus card so I turned down her offer. I procrastinated and left a little bit later than I wanted to. I could’ve taken the bus on cottage or lake shore and decided on lake shore. I was deciding on walking straight to the bus stop or turning at the corner to get a coffee. I chose to turn and bumped right into her, if I hadn’t turned I would’ve walked right past her and never realized that she was a few feet away or if I walked there 5 mins earlier or 5 mins later I would’ve missed her.

You’d assume it’s a specific type of conversation but it actually is a regular conversation between two people who are attracted to each other. For example: I personally have never flirted but I have a friend who’s really good with girls, he’s good looking and whenever we’re out he talks to girls who then he ends up going home with and stuff like that. But the content of the conversation is actually the same as what you’d say to say someone you meet at uni in class. It’s the usual where are you from what do you study etc. So what makes it flirting? Mutual attraction does. You can have two conversations with the exact same words being said with one being flirtatious and the other being completely platonic. Therefore flirting isn’t actually something that exists, it’s not something specific you can say or a type of conversation. It’s just a regular conversation between two people into each other."

But this doesn't take buoyancy into account !

Firstly, what being heavier means ? It's the same as weighting more, right ? That would mean being more difficult to lift with the same grip. It would also mean that something weight more on a weighting scale.

If we take into accound buoyancy and use metric for calculations : the displacement of air by 1kg of lead is 0.088 liters. This air pushes the lead upwards with a strenght equal to the mass of air displaced wich is 1.2gf per liter. So the air pushes upwards with a strenght equivalent of 0.105gf (0.088x1.2).

For feathers (made of proteins) we take a density of 1.35 wich is equal to 0.74 liters if we compress it to extract the air. The air pushes upward with a strenght of 0.888gf (0.74x1.2)

The difference by which lead is heavier is 0.783g (weighted) per kg (real mass). For one pound (mass) it is 0.000360 pound more on the scale."

She fulfills your every wish, gives you what you want whenever you want it. The other girl is also beautiful but has a playful and wild side. She can be chaotic, and her actions are unpredictable, keeping the nature of your relationship or friendship uncertain.

Which one would you prefer to have a deeper connection with? In which one do you think you'd have a more satisfying intimate experience? Now, let's switch genders. The same applies to men. Some are polite and genuinely good-hearted, speaking in a salesman-like tone. Others have a clear roughness about them, resembling unpredictable mountain bears, unafraid of losing and always outsmarting the smartest.

The reason even this [famous feminist woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yobRZGgeTEI) parted ways with the incredibly kind-hearted Chad is because, despite being a perfect 10 in many ways, Chad couldn't provide the same feelings in their relationship or sexual life as the less handsome but intelligent bad boy who doesn't give in to every whim. In summary: Why women might choose differently is evident once again. Human nature is fascinating. Maybe (controversial) the ""Why Women Deserve Less"" [book](https://www.amazon.com/Women-Deserve-Less-Myron-Gaines/dp/B0BVDSBZYK) Author was right."

This made me think of what it would be like for Voldemort to listen to stereo audio when he was on the back of that guy's head. Would he hear out of the guy's left ear or from his own left side?  
  
It's also trippy because I've seen some diagram of like the eyeball connected neurologically to the left side of the brain and also the image being upside down on our retina but being flipped. Maybe theres someone with a biology or brainology background to say if what we hear out of our right ear is actually coming out of our right side. It's kinda tripping me out thinking the symmetrical left side of our entire body is just an exact mirror image of the right or like one of them is virtual or if our right ear hears out of our left side. but then maybe we are just a virtual person cause we're just a mirror image of our birthers and so on."

It’s often thought that humanity is so insignificant in the scope of the universe, sometimes feeling like we’re not really making a mark at all. However, I recently have seen things in a different light.

The fact we have consciousness allows us to literately bend energy to our will and desire. That really doesn’t happen anywhere else if life doesn’t exist. 

The universe may be infinite, but there’s just so many things out there endlessly following the same routine or loop, with no sentient ability to feel, change, evolve, etc. Its just energy flowing on a predetermined path.

Considering how rare we’ve learned life to be, and how insanely complex our consciousness is, we should all feel much larger than we do in the scope of things.

Take this thought to sit down and realize how grateful you are for even the smallest things in life, because if anything, at least we have the ability to have emotion, love, and help make our own path."

Ironically, when we reflect on the memory of taking the photo, we will realize, that when we initially observed it, we were wishing that we were five years younger than when it was taken. We will look back at our happiest memories, and feel grief, because we are no longer engaged in them. Paradoxically, the happiest times of our lives, upon reflection, will make us miserable. And then, in five years from now, we will take another photo. And we will compare it to the photo we took five years ago, when we will be disappointed in what we have become. We will repeat this routine as we deteriorate. And we will never be happy. We will never enjoy the present moment, until we observe it in hindsight. And when we do, we will feel grief. When we observe our naive past self, we will not learn from the experience, to love and appreciate who we are in this present moment. And we will continue this self deprecating routine indefinitely."

You have a one month window for the mother’s egg, and then you are one of millions of sperm from your dad. If your dad took a slightly different action, then maybe the same sperm wouldn’t have reached your mother’s egg, and then you wouldn’t have existed. The chances of being born seems even lower when you think that everything in the universe had to play out perfectly for all of your ancestors to be born and then have their children. If one of our ancestors busted one more time over a thousand years ago, then perhaps we would have never existed. 

As an example, maybe you could encounter someone on the streets and unknowingly prevent them from meeting someone who they would have gone on to have children with. What if one of those children would have cured cancer? Or what if they would have been responsible for starting a war which would destroy the entire world? We will never know, but I find it interesting to think about. 

I suppose this means we’ve all been special from the moment we were born as our very existence will be causing events to play out differently. If you never existed, then the world thousands of years in the future would be completely different as different people would have been born into this world."

If you think about it infinity is a concept you can get closed to but you can never reach, but also if we can figure out a number that can be applied to the real world aka pi but the decimal goes on forever then infinity is a concept that exists physically while at the same time it is impossible that it exists as the concept warps the logic of space, Alas it also can be almost achieved reaching infinity but if it goes on forever that means in order to get a number close to infinity you need to also go forever which is the definition of infinity meaning you've reached infinity if you get close to it."

I wish it weren’t like this … what are your views? I always think of that scene in House Of Cards where the wife walks in on Frank jacking off to gay porn and it’s like nothing is even happening 🤣 I know they were making the point that it was a purely transactional relationship but I do also wonder how many couples are more toward the ‘no shame’ end of the spectrum."

The minute another person exists, your expectation of freedom should go down. The resources (the land) is now shared, and cannot claim it all without infringing on someone else's freedom.

So in a country or town where a lot of resources are shared, freedom will understandably be limited. Maximizing freedom without infringing on others is the best one can do, but an unrealistic expectation of freedom is going to negatively affect someone else's freedom.

In a household with housemates, or family, freedom is limited further. Resources like food, chores, space, sound, equipment need to be shared.
