Let's call it 'cam mark' or 'camark'

Can the video embed a 'camark' into it as an overlay which can be detected by camera of a mobile but not visible to human eyes ?

So if you are watching a TV which has such 'camark', you don't see anything on the screen apart from the program video. But if you point your 'regular' (currently available) mobile camera at program being played, the camera detects the 'camark'.

Is there anything in the camera that will make this possible ?
