1,2024-04-30,Question about double time pay in California,u/Gemini_Warrior,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ch818f/question_about_double_time_pay_in_california/,antiwork,"Hello everyone hoping someone can help me before I take this to my supervisor or HR and look like a fool üòÖ

So last week I worked a double shift from 3pm Sunday until 7am Monday morning thinking I‚Äôll get double pay after the 12th hour which would have been after 3am Monday but I got my check today and checked the paystub and I was only paid a regular overtime rate of 1.5x of my base pay for that entire shift. Now I‚Äôm left wondering if theres a loophole they could have used because it‚Äôs technically 2 separate days? Or did that shift somehow not qualify? I work at a hotel so there‚Äôs no special rules or anything like that if that matters. "
10,2024-04-30,Former superiors are upset over me reporting them and lying to everyone who tries to investigate. I'm getting paranoid about them potentially contacting my current job.,u/Sally_Throwaway_12,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ch8ljl/former_superiors_are_upset_over_me_reporting_them/,antiwork,"I was chatting with the friend from my old job today, mostly unrelated to work, but he ended up mentioning this at one point. Apparently, my former (and his current) superiors were made aware of my reporting them and found it very upsetting. I had reported them a few months ago to the institution which is above them and can potentially deal with them. My report didn't result in anything, as the superiors ended up successfully lying their way around it despite all the evidence. I had reported them to this country's version of OSHA, still waiting for the answer.

Since then, my former superiors have never tried to contact me, so I had no idea how very upset they apparently are, to the point that my friend (who is not in the management) knows about it. According to him, they feel betrayed and claim that they had always done the best for me and made sure I was doing well, even when having health issues at one point. And this is true, to some extent. I was repeatedly praised as a good employee, received a few awards and gradually got better positions.

So what happened? I was called in several months ago and called a terrible employee out of nowhere. They could barely find two examples of my supposed horrible work effort, one of which wasn't true and I could prove it. They also used my ethnicity against me, blamed the health issues I had mentioned above, and told me to never work in this field again. They were ""generously"" willing to keep  me at a single crappy position from which I was fired a few days later when I complained. I was repeatedly gaslighted, defamed in front of coworkers, ignored and eventually threatened with a bad reference.

The reports were the final step I could take to hopefully prevent this thing from happening any further.  They had done the same to other employees before me, but only I decided to first talk it out and then complain. And it led to the hostile reactions others hadn't experienced because they had left quietly. I don't blame them for it, of course.

I am not really sure how to react to this or whether to even do so. I'm not interested in trying to talk it out again, given how ""well"" it worked before, but it might be necessary sooner or later. I still have friends in that job and I sometimes go to the place as a visitor (for events), so I might encounter my former superiors again. As it also seems, anyone who asks them about me is being lied to, turning me into a horrible person. Even my friend had some doubts. I'm not happy about it.

Honestly, it's actually making me paranoid. I am taking extra steps to prevent the former superiors from finding out where I am working now (starting at a new position), but people are well connected in this city and Google isn't hiding things well either. I'm very worried about them finding out sooner or later, and lying to my new job which means a lot to me. What should I do? Stop reporting and hope for the things to cool off? Try to talk it out? Request them not to lie about me, likely risking another hostile reaction? I can't stop being worried."

The first 3 months have been a dream. It hasn‚Äôt even felt like work. It‚Äôs what I love to do. Planting, caring for plants, watering, moving, decorating, I love it all. The greenhouse opened on April 26th to the public at which time my lovely, flexible, trusting, boss had his wife come work. She is quite literally the complete opposite of her husband. She assumes the worst in everyone, trusts no on, is super strict and checks in on you to ‚Äúmake sure your working‚Äù. She sets people up for failure to make herself look better. She snaps on us and gets really short with us. She doesn‚Äôt listen AT ALL and just dismisses everything you say. She actually knows NOTHING about plants but wants to be the one to give people answers, and then will try to make you look stupid when in actuality she‚Äôs completely wrong. She gets jealous very easily and it‚Äôs palpable. She only planted with us for spring break since she‚Äôs a teacher and now she comes in during weekends and after school to work the cash register and be the ‚Äúface‚Äù so people around town know she‚Äôs the new owner(mind you the old owners usually were doing the important work like trimming and helping customers and checking plants for problems. But she just wants people to know she‚Äôs part owner). We have to deal with her way more now and it‚Äôs completely changed the vibe entirely. It‚Äôs gone from being a place I didn‚Äôt want to leave ever and truly caring about the businesses success to counting down the seconds to leave and wishing the business would go under. Tbh she just might sink that place anyway. She‚Äôs just as crass to customers as she is to us. I don‚Äôt understand why my boss is even with this women let alone allowing her to be apart of the business. There were multiple employees who didn‚Äôt come back this year because of how the wife treats them last year. PLUS now I just found out one of my coworkers grand child got home schooled the year after having her as a teacher because he started getting anxiety from her. He was a second grader! What can be done because I might just snap on this women and I actually love working there outside of working with her. BUT ITS HIS FREAKING WIFE! He of course must know this about her right? Don‚Äôt even get me started on the mother in law either (she basically acts as the wife while she can‚Äôt be there. But that‚Äôs awhile other rant and she‚Äôs not even as bad)   "

And they get away with it how? By paying off the authorities and government and let them turn a blind eye.

So the whole saying ""Eat the rich"" should also be expanded to ""Destroy the government and police force"" but that holds the problem of police having guns, the government having military, and realizing the people are uprising against the authorities they'll turn the country into a police/military controlled country (or state if it's only in some areas).

4,2024-05-01,I'm in a new line of work for me and it's making me question my abilities as an employee. Looking for perspective. ,u/littlebrigham,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1chd8u7/im_in_a_new_line_of_work_for_me_and_its_making_me/,antiwork,"Hi all, 

I started a new job at a community center as a garden program supervisor. It sounded like a dream job for me. There were red flags before I started working here that I should have listened to. A coworker of mine (who recently quit) told me that I should consider declining the job offer because ""there's something seriously wrong with this place"". I was halfway through the paperwork at the time she told me so I went through with it. 

I'm now a month into my employment and I dread the thought of going in. This workplace has a severe lack of communication and organization, and I was provided no training. During our discussions about what my role would be, we discussed creating a program for kids to learn about gardening. So, for the first 2 weeks I got to work on developing this program while also handling the logistics behind getting the community garden ready to use. After these first 2 weeks, it was apparent that nobody knew what was going on. So I chatted with my boss and she essentially said we need to steer away from any kind of formal program (contradicting our initial discussions) but instead just ""create community in the garden"". 

To this, I replied by saying I need her to give me more direction. I added that I've been working on this program for 2 weeks and ""I need you to elaborate on what you're looking for from my role"". By the time I left that meeting, I felt more lost than I did before. This meeting was about two weeks ago and I still have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. I'm not even being overworked, I'm being underworked. Which is why this situation is so confusing for me to process.

I can't help but think that I'm just not cut out for this kind of work because surely if I feel ""underworked"" I must not be taking initiative or I must be lacking the skills/intelligence for this kind of role. I have the financial flexibility to quit, which might sound like it would provide some emotional relief, but it's actually led me to wonder whether I'm just a stereotype of a young worker who doesn't wanna work once it gets tough. Every time I think about going into work, I feel depressed and unmotivated. 

I really don't think I'm the problem here but I can't help but feel this way. I don't feel like working in this environment is going to help me grow in any meaningful way but maybe that's just an excuse to not work hard. Can anyone provide some perspective based on what I've written here? I'm happy to add more context or clarify anything if this post is hard to follow. 

Tl;dr My boss has set undefined expectations for my position. The communication and organization of this place is abysmal, and I'm feeling like maybe I'm just the problem and need to just grow up and work. "

They told me they would have the applicants meet me so I could have some input on who they hire.

The industrial revolution took many of the poorest and turned them from subsistence farmers to employees, better know as wage slaves. Instead of being provided with clothing, food and housing, we were given tokens to exchange for these items. Often it was only at the company store where prices were very high so things were bought on credit locking you in to being a loyal and subserviant employee for fear of losing everything you owned since technically the company owned everything from your house, to furniture to the clothes on your backs. They still do this, but it is the banks that own everything. The more they can get you to buy on credit, the more hold they have over you.

We are still slaves to this day which is why health insurance is tied to employment. The banks own our homes if we are lucky enough to have one, or landlords own the homes we rent. We use credit to buy our vehicles, which are owned by the loan company, and the fear of losing everything we own keeps us chained to our jobs. Management are nothing more than the slave drivers cracking a proverbial whip to make us work harder.

Covid fucked this up for the slave masters, because a short 6 weeks without work made a lot of people find other ways to make money and when everyone went back to work many were either dead, employed elsewhere, self employed or realized it was more important to have one parent home with the kids than two incomes.

Now that we no longer have 200 people in line needing our job, we have the ability to stand up for our rights as human beings instead of continuing to be wage slaves and the slave drivers don't understand how to keep us under control. They are gojng to try and do anything they can to make us beg to keep our jobs once again.

Keep up the good fight. They are already trying to bring back child workers by reversing child labor laws. Like a cornered animal they will do anything they can to try and make sure they can make you beg to keep your job. They don't like it when their wage slaves have the upper hand."

I'm pretty sure no one I work with is on here, but I'll be a little vague just in case. For a while I've been working weekend late shifts, which means I pretty much work alone for the last two hours. Support staff leaves. It's an uphill battle to give good service. I keep asking for help, but I still don't have a busser/host/runner, managers hang out in the office doing admin, and sometimes I end up with ten, twelve tables.  


I took the shifts partly so there would be some proper service during this time (it's pooled tips so it IS in my best interest), and got to come in later... but lately there's a lot of talk about service standards that our higher ups want... but no follow through.  


So I finally said no more unless I get extra pay for this time period (this was originally the way it was done when I got hired). Nope. So now... one other girl took Sundays and says it's the same shitshow! Meanwhile they have to rotate people through Saturday doubles because no one wants the shift. Did I get a word of thanks for all the time I've done it?  


I never asked to be taken off the weekend shifts, just not to work the late. It's someone else's turn. But suddenly I have three shifts, not four. Yes, I have documented everything with HR.

&#x200B;

The good news? Went into a newer, nicer place on Monday, just straight walk in without knowing more than the menu outside. Met the director of operations and the only reason I wasn't hired on the spot is because he just hired a GM and wants to give him a chance to do the actual hiring process. Gotta call today but I expect I'll be hired by the weekend.  


Seriously, no loyalty and no appreciation. Young'uns, from a vet, don't go that extra mile unless there's something in it for you. It won't come back around."

3,2024-05-01,Upper management decided to send middle management to the bottom line. Us bottom-liners are paying the price. Job is now unbearable.,u/JinBu2166,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1chmkke/upper_management_decided_to_send_middle/,antiwork,"My company has been through several re-orgs this year, which has led to major upheaval that has made my job absolutely unbearable. 

I work as a sales & client facing consultant. For a while we only took requests from informed sales people. That is, sales personnel trained on the products that they sold in. After a re-org that took place earlier this year, upper management at my company, in an effort to avoid laying off the glut of sales *managers* they hired over the pandemic, decided to repurpose middle management into bottom liners. This would not be so bad if I still worked with the previously mentioned informed sales folk, but upper management has decided to go all in on the new middle-management staffed org. 

This change has led to the worst environment that I've ever worked in.

Middle management is good at one thing: escalating issues. They are incapable of doing the actual work themselves, or being told ""no"". Case in point, the number of times that I've had to work with an ill-informed client who was mis-sold a solution has increased to a point that I am now spending a majority of my time apologizing for sales instead of doing actual work. It has taken a toll on my mental health as well. When I say ""no"" to middle management, they have direct access to upper management from their prior jobs who can strong-arm my org into doing work that I have no business doing. The work itself is 90% ""I've sold them on something that may or may not be good for them, can you take the heat if it isn't?"" What's worse is there is no incentive for me to do what's right by the customer. Sales needs to meet quotas, and I am graded based on the volume of requests that I handle and not the value.

Many folks tell me to separate myself from it all. To accept that it's just a job, but it feels morally wrong to know that I contribute nothing more to the world than getting sales people paid. What's more, even if things do work out I'm effectively just making rich companies richer (my own company included). The thought of spending my life like this makes me sick. I am disgusted by the amount of money that comes through these companies that offer no value to the world outside of what it does for shareholders. I'm disgusted at the level of tacit acceptance that people engage in to continue getting a paycheck.

I need to get out. I know I do. I'm saving up some $50k as runway for half a year off. Will start over from scratch in a field that actually matters.

Big tech is not what it used to be. It used to be about advancing civilization by enabling humanity to extend themselves mentally, personally, etc. Now it's just a big business factory focused on getting away with as much as possible for as much as possible."

Since I started working, with my degree in engineering, I was put to do ""highly skilled"" white-collar jobs, aka ""sorting files out of excel files into other excel files for 9 hours a day"".
More often than not, due to the absolute idiocy of the tasks assigned, I found myself dealing with the fact of completing the tasks in very little time and having to decide whether staring at the screen for the rest of the day pretending to be occupied, or asking to my manager for other tasks (which were similar or worse then those already completed). It was degrading either way.
After having jumped through several companies and having lived, in my last and still current job,  through a ""personnel reduction phase due to economical crisis"" (all while managers travel business class and go to 5 star hotels), I feel that both my brain and my soul are completely drained out of any energy.
Fun fact: I once tried to apply to a blue collar job because I was sick tired of office 9-5 job. I got rejected because I was ""overqualified""..
So this got me thinking that my university degree was a total scam, because not only bounded me to shifty jobs, but also got me automatically discarded to even blue collar jobs (!!!).
I think and re-think many times about quitting and become an entrepreneur of some kind, but the stupidity of the ""skilled"" jobs that I do every day completely drained all my creativity and my imagination and I just go home every day with nothing in mind rather than the simple thought of ""I need to end this situation""...

Fast forward to less than 48 hours after he was born and I sent them a picture. My boss texted me and after a fake congrats asked me if I could work that day. Still hooked up to an IV line and losing my insides? No. Sorry. 

1 week after he was born I was asked to work again. At this point it's quite clear they never found coverage and were drowning. I explained that I have a 1 week old and a 1 year old and do not have any help until 8pm at night and the baby is still very demanding. No response. 

2 weeks later and I get a text saying ""Sorry it didn't work out. Please return xyz""

My coworker was also expecting and gets a 3 month leave paid. I get that I wasn't going to get paid for my leave but I figured after our first discussion last year that they would find coverage and my job would be secured until the basic 6 weeks. Guess I should've headed their GlassDoor reviews of ex employees. ""No communication. Toxic bullies.""

Just a friendly reminder that the ""work family"" is a lie and they don't care about you or your actual family. Fuck em."

&#x200B;

It had previously been mentioned to me, by my previous supervisor, that I needed to work on getting to the office on time and I had improved that a bit. After the previous supervisor left, and the new one had been in his role for a couple months, annual review time came around. It was then that more issues that were never previously mentioned to me were finally brought up: 

* Issues from two different projects that were out of my control, one of which wasn't even my project and I only volunteered 2 hours of my time to help out. The first project was about printers not being setup. I wasn't provided with any information about what printers would be moved to the new office and they weren't physically in place yet during the two days that I was scheduled to be onsite. The tech that was assigned the second project left a lot of things unfinished and didn't provide information about what was needed for which users. Missing ethernet cables, no power strips, etc. Even though this wasn't my project, I was blamed for the issues.
* A single issue with communication to a customer through a ticket. I was giving steps to try to fix the issue rather than being hands on. However, he was technically proficient. This seemed to be resolved during this first meeting
* ""Non-productive work time"" When there was down time with no tickets, or when I was working on something that didn't require my full attention, I would have a youtube video playing or mess around on my phone. One of my office mates apparently ran to the new supervisor (his friend) and complained. This led to having to find busy work to do, like organizing our equipment room, or cleaning out/organizing the front of our office and drawers full of random junk.

I was told that I was getting a verbal warning and if improvements weren't made it would become an official write up. Over the next couple months I was told that I have been improving in all of the mentioned areas. After these couple months the final annual review meeting takes place. (This was last Friday.) I'm told that because of last years review having a ""variable performance"" and this year having one as well, I am being put on the PIP. They don't have the PIP paperwork available during this meeting because HR still has to approve it. Then comes yesterday, the paperwork finally gets approved and we have a meeting to talk about it. More issues are added than previously mentioned and there was even something on there that was absolutely not true. New items/issues:

* Just before the meeting, I had a nose bleed because of the dry weather. So, I was 2 minutes late. I go into the meeting and tell my supervisor and the HR rep about it and the HR rep giggles about my nosebleed
* New issue on the PIP saying that there have been issues with my ticket notes and documentation. This has never been mentioned before and I'm almost always a stickler for making sure that notes are in place and up to date, because it drives me crazy when I have to pick up a ticket without information on it. 
* There are now two new non-productive work items. Sleeping and leaving the office during work hours. One, I have never falling asleep during work. Two, if I ever leave the office during work hours it is for work related stuff, when I have been pre-approved to leave early, or to go outside for a break or my lunch. (They acted shocked that sleeping was even on the list and promised to remove it)
* I have been told since the day I started that we get an hour lunch break. Suddenly on the PIP it says that it is a 30 minute lunch break. I had been told an hour by multiple bosses and supervisors. 
* Even though I was told in the original meeting that I was just being given a verbal warning, suddenly with this PIP, if I don't follow this huge list of micromanaging requirements for 3 months, my job is at risk. Completely skipping any form of write up.

During this meeting I mentioned how I could have improved on things more if I had been given adequate time to try before we had gotten to this point. The HR rep just said ""that's unfortunate"". So basically didn't care. I have sent an email to our ombudsperson (person for fairness and ethics) to schedule a meeting to discuss everything. I have also added my notes to the document after scanning it. 

So, I'm looking for advice on how to handle this whole mess. Do I wait to hear back from fairness and ethics? Do I go ahead and send the notes that I made to my boss, supervisor and HR rep? What else can I do here?

Thanks in advance for any advice you can give.

We're probably slightly past the beginning of it.,u/Kurt751990,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1chrcj9/alright_guys_were_in_a_cycle_were_probably/,antiwork,"Let me say this first as a disclaimer I am not a historian nor was I there but signs of the times are hard to ignore. Think about this. We are living in the beginning of some kind of serf, peasant, servant, slave, etc. cycle. Everyone who has enough sense to get frustrated with modern working environments and conditions you will play the role of the freedom fighter in whatever incarnation that may be. Now that means you're going to further the cause of freedom and fight for what is right but that also means it carries with it the very real risk of martyrdom at the hands of the masters or elites as we call them in 2024. 

Take note everyone who is complacent with their lives and positions is everyone unwilling to fight for freedom or is even able to see the complete horror that is the modern day plantation. Those people may be completely willing to go into shackles and chains but they'll end up dragging everyone else with them. I dont know what else to say about it. Dark times ahead despite the technology to prevent those times being available and completely possible. One has to wonder why does it have to happen. It can't be about wealth generation and resource gathering it's like is there a secret game being played between some people who secretly have fetishes to be servants and peasants and employees and the ones that dominate them? It just seems so unreal that people literally do not care about their own interests.

Let me say this political parties are clowns and circuses. They are worthless and useless in our times. Now with that said let me make an example that just happens to involve political parties and everyday folks. I live in the south in Alabama and I watch people vote republican and they have even started openly calling the other team ""communists"" out loud despite they dont even know what that word means. But when those people's kids get scholarships in high school for football they jump up and down and cheer and say things like this ""My kid earned that free college. God chose my child to receive the free college"" and if you mention ""See how great free college is. Don't you think it would be great if everyone's kids got to experience that?"" They just reiterate ""No. I wish it could be like that but it just cant. This is special because God chose my child."" It's gas lighting these people have suffered. Are they victims absolutely. They've been indoctrinated without even knowing it was happening as a result they are running someone else's ideas and programs as if they were there own. But even tho they are victims they are actively trying to stop others from refusing to be victims based on thoughts and ideas that are not even their own. 

I dont know what else to say about it. It's pretty bleak. What do you make of this? "

For the lords who lay ye low?

Wherefore weave with toil and care

The rich robes your tyrants wear?  


Wherefore feed and clothe and save

From the cradle to the grave

Those ungrateful drones who would

Drain your sweat‚Äînay, drink your blood?  


Wherefore, Bees of England, forge

Many a weapon, chain, and scourge,

That these stingless drones may spoil

The forced produce of your toil?

&#x200B;

Have ye leisure, comfort, calm,

Shelter, food, love‚Äôs gentle balm?

Or what is it ye buy so dear

With your pain and with your fear?  


The seed ye sow, another reaps;

The wealth ye find, another keeps;

The robes ye weave, another wears;

The arms ye forge, another bears.  


Sow seed‚Äîbut let no tyrant reap:

Find wealth‚Äîlet no imposter heap:

Weave robes‚Äîlet not the idle wear:

Forge arms‚Äîin your defence to bear.  


Shrink to your cellars, holes, and cells‚Äî

In hall ye deck another dwells.

Why shake the chains ye wrought? Ye see

The steel ye tempered glance on ye.  


With plough and spade and hoe and loom

Trace your grave and build your tomb

And weave your winding-sheet‚Äîtill fair

England be your Sepulchre."

Long story short, after about a year my team's contract with a client is ending and we've been informed that it's been decided to ""furlough"" all of the developers involved.   
  
No bench time. No severance. Zip.

Been working overseas for many years. Was referred for a job and accepted the offer with the stipulation that since my family was already living with me, they would continue to do so in an otherwise unaccompanied position. Management agreed and promised to get us into a larger place as part of my package. We spent six months in a tiny apartment with our boxes lining the walls until my predecessor's lease expired. Then, keeping their word we were upgraded to bigger space.

The guy that hired me was reassigned shortly after my start date. The new manager, Bill just couldn't be bothered with anything besides my time sheet which he was quick to remind me of if I were even a second late. It's relevant to note that I never actually met any of these people because I'm overseas and they're based in the United States. We had been living in our new place for a few months and were all settled in when we learned that the company lost the contract.

The new company began their transition in February with May 1st as their start date. Didn't send any of us overseas folks offer letters until halfway through April, (Bill and the rest of the home office folks were on boarded right away) and **then,** two days after I accepted sent one of the staff home and informed me I'd be responsible for all his duties. Bill claimed he had no idea it would be happening that fast and insisted he was operating in ""full transparency."" Meanwhile my lease is set to expire and I kept inquiring about the status to which Bill says ""what do you want me to do?"" I'm not the housing manager. I was taken aback, I mean I knew Bill didn't give a fuck about me or my family but its rare you get the quiet part out loud.

It's one thing for me to be getting dicked around but my kid just celebrated first birthday and my wife before meeting me had never experienced moving. Well guess what exactly **eight** days before my lease is up management informs me they won't be accommodating my family and I'd have to sort them out on my own. What's more, they forbade me from living off post and explicitly excluded my family so I'd have to live alone while renting somewhere for them at my own expense. Well I told them to fuck right off and am currently living in a shitty airBNB until I figure out my next move. Thanks Bill.

The boss has them all listed as 1099 private contract workers. They have 0 benefits/protections and have been asking to become W-2 employees for over the last year. The boss refuses to do this and his reasons are vague, claiming it‚Äôs a lot of work and they are a small start up, blah, blah, blah. Obviously, the real reason is that he doesn‚Äôt want to pay taxes/unemployment/workers comp etc etc. I know this is fraud, because all the ‚Äú1099‚Äù are clearly defined as employees by the guidelines.

This has all come to a head when my partner asked for 2 weeks off as they haven‚Äôt taken more than a day or 2 off in over a year. They gave a month heads up to the boss, and he is saying they can‚Äôt take more than a couple days, a week at max, because the company is way to busy right now. This is almost always the response when any worker tries to take time off. Mind you, they aren‚Äôt getting paid vacation for any time off and on top of that, the boss cant legally tell them when they can take off because they are 1099. We have receipts on all these conversations through email correspondence.

There was an expectation that my partner and others who started from the beginning would be compensated and taken care of as the company grew. It has grown and is rapidly expanding thanks to the efforts of my partner and their co-workers, but wage increases have been minimal and as stated they are still all 1099‚Äôd with no benefits whatsoever. It‚Äôs becoming clear to me that the boss is trying to expand rapidly, most likely so he can sell and throw all the people that built his company under the bus.

My question is how would one handle this? We could contact the labor board and other entities informing of the boss‚Äôs misclassification of his workers most likely due to committing tax evasion.  This is probably the right answer, but may result in the loss of people‚Äôs jobs. My partner is currently looking for other positions as they are over working for this piece of shit, but is a bit hesitant to destroy the company, because they are friends with many of the co-workers. They also don‚Äôt  want to lose the job/income until they find other work, but really need the time off for mental health, which they have directly stated to the boss. I don‚Äôt think they would have any sort of lawsuit against the boss, even if he would ‚Äúfire‚Äù them or say their contract is no longer needed if they chose to just take the 2 weeks off anyway. Basically, how do we fuck this dude over without fucking my partner and her employees over at the same time ?

3,2024-05-01,"""Time is money""",u/SafeModeOff,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1chu6er/time_is_money/,antiwork,"These are just some thoughts from my head, feel free to ignore, I just felt like people here might appreciate.

""Time is money"" is one of those sayings that lots of people know and say all the time. Your parents might have said it growing up in an effort to get you to get ready faster, it comes up in conversation with peers, etc. Basically everybody has heard it before. When it does come up with people I know, everyone who brings it up to me is legitimately trying to make a point of how your time could be freed from other pursuits and spent on making more money. It's a fair thought, but I always remind them that we aren't fully free to trade time for money, we can only do it in quantized amounts determined by someone else. So like yeah I do trade time for money, but only the amount of time and money that my employer deems appropriate. If I want to trade any other amount of time for any other amount of money, I have to get permission from the current employer, or go jump through a bunch of hoops at another to get hired. There are of course other options to making money, but I just mean the average hourly joe here. 

I do have an idea of what I value my time at, but my time isn't directly metered by money. If I decide to go sit in a walmart parking lot and do nothing for an hour, that is in fact an hour I could have used differently, but it is NOT an hour of money that I lost. I could not have chosen to trade that hour for money because my employer didn't approve it, and it would be shocking these days if I could get hired for any kind of job within that hour. Time outside of work can be spent in pursuit of money, so in that way you could say that time suggests money. But it is not a direct equivalent.

 I'm fairly sure the saying originated in a business context, and I could see how this applies more there, but not on a personal level.

The tl;dr is that time can be traded for money, but time on a personal level should not be valued in terms of money because most people don't make money on their own terms. I am doing my best to help my peers realize that."

I made about $2000/mo. Things were going great, I was breaking sales and engagement records that his PR team failed to reach before and received ample praise for that, but my boss kept complaining that he was having financial issues and may need to outsource my job, so I took a pay cut and started making about $1700 per month. 

Last week, he tells me that he needs to cut my pay again and take me off the Twitter team so I am now down to about $1200/month but tell him I need to renegotiate my commission rate because that is just untenable (I also live in a HCOL area). My boss then stopped responding to all texts and calls and today I wake up and find they changed all the passwords and took me out of the group chat. He still owes me two weeks of pay.

I feel so violated and humiliated and used. I‚Äôve been fired before, but never have I been literally ghosted.

Since I started working there, there have always been ""errors"" in my orders processed.
Of course, they have been going down as I gained more experience.

Now, errors are anything QC manager says. It can go from quoting an item incorrectly, to a missing hyphen.

Recently, my direct supervisor had a 1:1 with me advising my error margin should be maximum 5% (out of approx. 60 orders, that's like 3) he said ""work has been slow"" and now being ""too busy"" wasn't an excuse for me to not double check my work. I don't understand why the intake department has no responsibility in ""errors"" (since they take all the initial information to pass the order to me). I am loaded with work all the time, to be ""checking"" someone else's work. But then again, ""that is no excuse"".
They are going to be ""evaluating"" me until June, to see if my error rate has lowered. They insist I am making them ""lose money and being lazy"".

Management measures productivity through some software. I think it measures based on clicks and typing. The minimum is 70% well, now they are shitting on me because mine is marking 77% while it's usually above 80% (like???? Make it make sense).

I just can't, I cried myself to sleep yesterday. Yes, right now I ""don't have much orders as usual"" (since sometimes I have over 100) 
I have also been getting an insane amount of RUSH orders (orders that have to be completed the same day, yes or yes) that make me focus all day on one order and not pay attention to the rest.

Since I started working there, three people from my department resigned. They have not been replaced yet. No trainee lasts more than a couple of months (or less). Me and my other coworker are doing the job of two people. 

Going back to the meeting, my boss said they will start writing me up after June if my ""error"" rate doesn't lower. They are also offering me a $100 dollar bonus monthly if I reach this ""goal"". I don't know if I should maybe start looking for something else. Or am I exaggerating? Am I overreacting?? 

Today I have another 1:1 with another supervisor. 
I can almost hear all the shit they're going to say. "

0,2024-05-01,Is this controversial in this subreddit?,u/CyanCea,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1chvgds/is_this_controversial_in_this_subreddit/,antiwork,"I'd like to hear your thoughts. Please try to be generous about my intentions.

When i was a teenager I used to scroll this subreddit. I felt very strongly about work life balance, not emotionally investing or doing more work than required, and disregarding any emotional connections i may have, or inwardly respecting workplace hierarchies.

As i enter the workforce, I have to make a confession; I will always seek an emotional connection with my work and I will always want to do my best, in pursuit of excellence. I won't create a distinct separation between work and life, and I won't avoid emotional connections with my co-workers or supervisors, I don't care if I'm working in a coalmine for Scrooge McDuck in the flesh, this always \*\*has\*\* to be the case.

This is why: **1/3 of my life, 1/2 of my waking hours, and 100% of my most productive hours during almost all of my healthiest years will be spent doing jobs**

This will be meaningless to me? I won't respect hierarchies, that humans are strongly drawn towards? I won't try to do my best, which humans gain meaning and energy from?

It's always possible that i will end up in a dead-end job. I understand investing so much into a corporation only for them to treat you like a cog. I understand corporate corruption, and how a job pour over all other sources of meaning in your life, and how much capitalism is currently destroying and exploiting.

But I don't feel we have another choice except to get meaning from it, as long as we spend most of our lives working, which will be always, and needs to be always. Humans are designed to work towards goals and seek excellence.

What I'm saying is that if we throw the baby out with the bathwater, we will end up in a very depressed state, where the majority of our lives is spent towards something that we have deemed meaningless, necessarily, as if it's our moral responsibility, and forever.

I see the merit to antiwork but I also think that the energy should be in reforming workplaces, not being anti-work in general. I don't see it working out for anyone.

We don't have to love or accept everything in this universe. It can be horrible and cruel. Usually the cruelest part is that there is no boogieman, there is no entity or ideology that designed this suffering for us most often, it's just the way the world is and certain aspects will always be. I truly don't think we'll have the mental space to appreciate the beauty of it unless we accept that

I'll watch my sister slowly crumble due to schizophrenia, because someone harmed her when she was a child. My old friend will always have to reconcile with the loss of his whole family who died in war, and the loss of hundreds of thousands in his country. Tens of thousands of young Palestinian children will not be here to reconcile with the loss of their lives, which never had a chance to really start.

When is there ever a single ideology or boogieman we can point to? Capitalism alone? Yeah right. The pain is awful, it's crippling, sometimes it pushes me towards homocidal thoughts, but I feel that when you reach a certain point there's nothing left to do but accept it and stop expecting different, and try to find meaning regardless.

The beauty in the world is worth the worst pain, the corruption, the cruelty, and you can love gain meaning from something that is in other ways, cruel and unjust."

I said the same because I actually have more clients than Bob, or did at the time. Now it‚Äôs equal amount. Boss said: yeah you do so much on top of everything else. And as I walked away and heard that, she said ‚Äúsally heard that, and laughed.‚Äù I do a lot of work there too. 

Another example: one of our clients was needing extra assistant and the entire staff wanted to go, and Bob asked if I was coming to: I wasn‚Äôt informed they were ALL going to go and before I could answer, boss said ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt need to come she can stay here.‚Äù Huh???? Everyone else can but I stay here? 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. She is a very favored boss. 

I want to leave and give a month or two warning but I feel like she will fire me before I even get to leave. I‚Äôm giving that long of a warning because the termination process with clients is long and hard and I don‚Äôt want to up and leave because I don‚Äôt want them to feel abandoned. 

I‚Äôm scared I feel I don‚Äôt have a voice here and have no freedom to even say when I want to leave because I can get fired for it.

1,2024-05-01,Need advice on my job,u/catfarmer1998,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1chy4q1/need_advice_on_my_job/,antiwork,"Hi all. I‚Äôm writing with a tricky situation that I need advice on. I am 25 years old and have disabilities that include hydrocephalus, adhd, anxiety, (both of which I‚Äôm on medication for) type 1 diabetes, and I‚Äôm on the waitlist to get evaluated for autism. 
Anyhow I only had my first job this past year. For whatever reason every job and internship I applied to before this rejected me (either because I don‚Äôt have a college degree or people don‚Äôt want to hire people with disabilities). I ended up quitting it for mental
Health reasons and it seemed like my boss wasn‚Äôt too happy with my work even though I thought I was doing a good job. He was also making sure I checked in with him everyday. It was a remote job. My ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù job is also a remote job. I prefer remote work I think. 

I should make a note that both of these jobs I found on my own without the help of vocational rehab. I used the app for college students called handshake. It just happened that when I was in the first position my boss decided that he wanted to keep me on but since it was a start up he couldn‚Äôt pay me. So we went through vocational rehab and they paid me. I ended up not  finishing that OTJ training because like I said, it seemed that my boss was concerned I wasn‚Äôt working hard enough and also I don‚Äôt think fully understood my disabilities so I kind of had a mental breakdown of sorts and quit. (I was working between 10-20 hours. Since I have so many disabilities and hesitated conditions it takes a lot out of me so l really am not motivated to work but I also don‚Äôt want to just collect SSDI. Im hoping one day I won‚Äôt get anxiety over working a 40 hour work week but right now that terrifies me. I don‚Äôt even really like working 20.) 

Thankfully I was already in touch with the person at the next position because I was already looking for another position because the OTJ training was set to end in February. This is where it gets tricky. It is another remote job. I filled out the required work paperwork and I started to work but my boss told me he couldn‚Äôt pay me until he talked to his accountant. This kept going on for several weeks. Then he said that he would write a check to my parents (who I still live with) so I can get money without taxes. So he wrote a check and then my mom gave me the money. Shortly after this, he was supposed to send me another check but I went for a period of two or three weeks where I texted him and I didn‚Äôt hear back. Then I did hear back but he said he couldn‚Äôt send a check, not sure exactly why. Anyhow soon after this, I got sick related to my diabetes and anxiety and I felt bad for a week. Then on top of that one of my animals went missing two weeks ago and that spiraled me into a deep depression. I did hear from my boss saying that he would pay me if updated my hours but I was too embarrassed to say that I was sick for a while even though he knew about my disabilities and health conditions ‚Äî he apparently has another part time employee that can‚Äôt work sometimes due to their health so he told me he‚Äôs semi flexible. Anyhow, vocational rehab thinks that I should quit the job but also try and get the money he owes me from March and April. I‚Äôm not opposed to them talking to my boss but I am sort of anxious over them doing that. I have written a resignation letter but I haven‚Äôt sent it because I‚Äôm concerned about how long it will take me to find another job and I don‚Äôt want to lose out on the possibility of maybe getting paid by my current boss. I am also concerned that given my track record with these last two jobs the first being from June 2023-January 2024 and the second being from February to present, that I might not be the best at picking jobs. What if I get another job that‚Äôs a ‚Äúlemon‚Äù? Or what if people see my recent work history and ask why both positions were so short lived? I‚Äôm just not sure what to do and I‚Äôm very conflicted and anxious. I don‚Äôt even know if I should put this on my LinkedIn or not. 

I would appreciate any advice. Thank you."

I‚Äôm a firefighter city based employee in Texas. I have ran into an issue where I was threatened to have pay withheld (not to me but to other coworkers) as punishment and it happened twice. When I confronted my boss about it, he said it was an accident. The third time a coworker stood up for me and threatened them back that I would definitely go higher up and they would basically regret it. He was right. 

My boss (chief) never brought it up even though we made him aware and I asked him about it. He seemed very dismissive and was quick to say ‚Äúwe fixed it.‚Äù I also help a lot off duty (which I get paid for) and I told everyone I would refuse to help cover or help until the issue was fixed.

There have been many other issues but this was the topping that pushed me over. I‚Äôm not ready to let it go because I want CORRECTIVE action taken. Maybe I‚Äôm being petty, but I want people thrown on probation or fired for thinking they could seriously push me over like this and then have the audacity to say ‚Äúoh it was an accident.‚Äù 

I have someone within our city who wants to reach out to me to discuss this and other issues and although I‚Äôm concerned I may get fired, I feel like I‚Äôm in a safe spot because I have great reputation with our community, local businesses and hospitals, and my coworkers.

For the past two years I've worked in our two biggest money making projects, one of them wouldn't have gone out the door without me. Two people got promoted this year, one of them (lets call them A) under the guidance of someone who was literally telling them what to do but that A person got appreciated for showing such initiative and for the project I've joined, I told them how to do what I've been doing cause they didn't know how. The other person (call them B) literally doesn't meet deadlines but because they're such an attention seeker, class clown type, they're super likeable so another person is staying late to pick up after them.

8,2024-05-01,Post layoff PTSD and rethinking workplace relationships,u/roguebaconstrip,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ci1aqg/post_layoff_ptsd_and_rethinking_workplace/,antiwork,"During the pandemic, I had an awful experience working for a small business.

Fresh out of college, I was hired into a small company of six people doing consulting work. The owner  was ex-military, and so the structure of the business followed suit. Many aspects of the business were immaculate and well thought out, and I really admired the quality and high standard which was set for employees. On the other hand, I realized pretty quickly that there were a lot of subtle mind games and gossip that flying around. Also, everyone seemed to fear the owner.   


Long story short, I had a really hard time adjusting to the work and was given no support at all. My performance was poor (and I knew it) and I sensed things weren't going as the owner expected. I asked my coworkers and manager for feedback and as given the ""Oh yeah everything is fine, we will give you some feedback and things to improve on."" But sure enough, I was abruptly let go at 4pm on a Thursday. No performance improvement plan, no forewarning, nothing. I had never experienced anything so cold. I was pulled into a room with three people, basically told that I sucked, was coerced into signing a termination sheet, handed a two-week's ""severance"" check, and shown the door.  


Shortly after this things with my then-partner went south (my job loss almost certainly added stress to the equation), her dog was put down, and I found myself with a dwindling bank account (and a student loan). This was rock bottom for me.  


This experience really fucked me up, and allowed me to understand why there is so much anger/conflict between employees and employers. And it has completely made me rethink the nature of employee relations and standards employers are held to. I'd never understood how fragile daily life can be when your income is ripped from you without warning. It completely destabilizes your life, and outside of friends/family, no one (certainly not the business) gives a fuck.  


I am now in a slightly better place financially, have held steady employment for a few years, and have a new partner. My life feels good and stable again. But in the back of my mind I still remember how brutal the system can be, and it's really ruined parts of my once-idealistic self.  


I no longer seek out work friends (and definitely not a ""work family"") because I don't feel like I can trust anyone. I was lied to and stabbed in the back once, how do I know it won't happen again? Some days coworkers seem okay, but once promotions and incentives start flying around, the tribalism and gossip come out. I miss days when I felt like I was free to work hard and get ahead without fear of failure or betrayal from my employer and/or coworkers. I used to be an idealist, ready to give my best, level up, reach the next goal etc. I'm still trying to find that part of myself again and not sure when it will fully return.  


There are a lot of videos and posts online from others who've experiences similar outcomes...I know my experience isn't rare under the current economic system. But at some point it does beg the question - Isn't a better system possible? Can't employers be held to a higher ethical standard rather than be allowed to get away with whatever they want? It's almost as if the ubiquity of poor employee treatment is used to further justify bad employer behavior. ""That's just how the system is..."" seems to be the accepted norm. ""Time to grow up, you got fired, move on...""  


I believe strongly in accountability and wholly agree that terminating an employee for poor performance can be justified. But the means/method matter, and it seems that employers completely abuse their power in this context. I know that generationally speaking, political attitudes are beginning to shift in this area, but I'm not sure what practical changes will actually take place. I'm interested to see what the future holds.

I welcome any thoughts/comments....

You‚Äôll need to make atleast $250k a year to live comfortable on a once income household."

I did this in high school and wanted to go to school to be a technical writer. The median starting salary was $45,000. The longer you do it, the higher the salary. 10-15 years in the game could get you up to $150,000-$275,000 annually.



My Mom didn't support it at all. I was forced into picking majors to be a high school English teacher. I learned that I don't have patience for kids. (English teachers don't make jack squat.)



So I decided to go to grad school to be an English/Creative Writing professor. But then I encountered financial difficulties because the school jacked up my financial aid package. I wound up owing the school and they wouldn't let me start the next semester until the balance was paid, despite there being enough in my financial aid package to cover the $3,000 balance. The laws changed to where the balance couldn't rollover to be settled by my future financial aid award package.



So I quit to find a job. However, no one would hire me as a technical writer despite excellent writing samples, passing editing and writing tests, having a good resume and cover letter, and doing well on interviews.



I wound up picking low paying jobs out of desperation. Now I'm 40 years old with a six-figure student loan debt and STILL underemployed.



You can be the most talented, skilled person for that job. Even if you do as this short suggests (with or without the support of society, family, and/or friends), THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE HIRED FOR THAT JOB.



Most people who go to school actually do this to pick their majors. It happens in STEM all the time. Now there's too many people competing for jobs in those fields.



It's like people don't get that even if you do everything to ensure that you'll be employable, there are so many other factors at play that may foil those plans.



It makes me wish I'd picked a frivolous major. Because then I would at least have a tangible reason for my own failure."

0,2024-05-02,Is it legal for my store to give everyone a write up for one short register??,u/jaundicenapkin,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ci94t1/is_it_legal_for_my_store_to_give_everyone_a_write/,antiwork,"I work at a fast food place in California, and we have 3 registers in the store. There's one in the drive-through and two for the dining room. Everyone switches around between the registers, like when the person in the drive-through goes on a break another person covers for them until they get back. Registers are only counted at around 4 pm and when we close at 10 pm, so they're not counted each time a person switches registers. This, of course, means that when a register is short, it can't be traced back to any one person.

Registers have been short pretty often recently (which I have to pretend to give a shit about) so our manager said that if one register is short, everyone working that shift gets a write up. We're only open 11 am to 10 pm which is pretty much two shifts, so that's half the people working that whole day. If you get 3 write ups, you get fired. Our manager works with us in the front but I'm sure she's not gonna give herself a write up, even if it was her mistake, so it just affects the rest of us. It's also pretty easy to screw up at this job since the training is basically nonexistent, they just show you how to charge people and take orders and then expect you to magically know how to do the rest.

All of this means that if you're the most perfect little employee ever who's been working here for years and you're unlucky enough to be scheduled with someone bad at math for 3 days, you just get fired even though you had nothing to do with it. This absolutely does not seem legal to me, and there's other shady shit going on. Giving everyone a write up for one single register being short seems insane on its own, but our manager also said if we put our tips in the register she'll let it slide and not give us a write up. The tips part I'm 99% sure is illegal, I'm just not sure if the rest is illegal or legal but fucked up. Our card readers and POS systems are also constantly glitching out because our district manager refuses to replace all the broken equipment in our store so that might somehow be affecting it as well."

I am always told if I utilize time after my scheduled work hours 8-4 pm or if I have a meeting later than my scheduled work hours, I must ‚Äúflex my time‚Äù to remain in the 37.5 work week. 

For example, last week I had a 5 pm meeting which was after my usual work hours. So I informed my supervisor I would be flexing my time by working 10 am - 6 pm to accommodate the 5 pm meeting. The meeting ended with a number of high priority tasks so I stayed on until 8 pm to complete them. I would‚Äôve preferred to receive overtime pay for the additional 2 hours but I followed directives from my supervisor for the flextime policy. The following day was Friday, so to remain within the 37.5 hours for the week, I flexed my time from 8 am - 2 pm. I then received an email from my supervisor stating that I needed prior approval to work the additional 2 hours and to flex my time for Friday. By the time I finished the meeting, it was 6 pm and my supervisor was already offline. I didn‚Äôt think it would be an issue working on post work meeting tasks since they were high priority. Nevertheless, apologized and stated I would ask for pre-approval in the future. 

I spoke to my colleague about the flextime policy and she shared she only does overtime. I reviewed the employee handbook and there is no mention of flexing time, it does state that employees are eligible for overtime pay if working past scheduled work hours. 

So yesterday around 3 pm I let my supervisor know I had an impromptu meeting for 5 pm with a client as that was when they were available. Again this falls out of my scheduled work hours which is 8 am - 4 pm. I informed her I would end at 4 and log in at 5 pm for my meeting which would last an hour. She stated I would have to flex my time for Friday to remain within the 37.5 hour work week. I stated I would opt for overtime pay as I am working outside of my scheduled work hours and would like be compensate for the hour rather than flexing my time. 

I did not receive a response and held the meeting as it was already scheduled with the client. About 30 mins into my 5 pm meeting, I received an email from my supervisor with our director added denying my overtime. I don‚Äôt want to cause a stir but I think I am entitled to overtime pay for this hour. What can I do without escalating this?"

The plague of getting fired while on a freelance contract, in spite of having a single employer, is that you have 0 rights. No compensation, no notice ahead of time, zero. Well, I have a lot of experience in my field so I started applying to new positions. 

It's been more than a month now and I have applied to over a hundred listings. And let me clarify, I'm only applying to positions I have experience for after reading their listing carefully, not just blindly or randomly. I didn't apply to anywhere I was under-qualified for. Some of the listings were so specific that only a handful of people had applied. 

Fast forward to today, I get an offer for a free month of LinkeIn premium, so I utilize it to see what the recruiters and HR people where I applied were doing. Out of around a hundred applications, only TWO had even opened my application and downloaded my resume. Out of these two, I managed to even get an interview but have been ghosted since... 

So thanks LinkedIn premium for exposing the absolute total hypocrisy of hiring managers and big corporations in general. So I'd feel confident by now to say that we're no longer talking about ghost jobs, but rather banished jobs. Jobs that don't exist anywhere on the conceivable universe, nor in any possible reality."

I'm frequently exhausted by the lack of consistency with my check-ins, but particularly a piece of advice I recently received about going ""above and beyond."" I was told that I'm always doing what's asked of me and making sure I handle what I have, but essentially that because some other employees ask for extra work, that should be expected of me. This is tiring also because now our process for raises is dependent upon a new set of criteria, which includes this piece of doing behind what's expected. It's this constant battle of being told to pay attention to what's at our workload and maintain that, and being expected to do more than that effectively. This job provides me consistent pay and hours, and overall I can tolerate it. But I get so unbelievably frustrated when the supervisors who are supposed to be here to support continue to find any and every reason to nitpick my behavior when I'm one of the few people who is consistent with my performance and my time. 

I'm sure many will suggest finding a new position, but I just wanted to rant here. I don't plan on leaving as of now, too many bills to pay and moving pieces. Just endlessly tired of persistently being told to do more when I tell folks I'm already struggling with the current workload that isn't equitable.

This has always been the case, at any job I've worked . And to be frank, it feels like a micro aggression that folks are upset that I'm not kissing the ground they walk on for employing me. It feels like I'm expected to grovel, and I just resent the attitude that there is always more to do, always more to improve when I regularly communicate what I'm already accomplishing. I just feel like I'm losing my mind and I don't have the motivation or desire for any more of this continued frustration."

Okay maybe my manager is looking out for me. Maybe they just want me to do well. Maybe they‚Äôre just being critical because that‚Äôs their job.

Well this meeting was horrible and in fact seemed like the opposite. Essentially I was given a very minuscule per improvement point for things that I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm very good at in previous companies from not organising my todo items, to not knowing how to answer customer service emails ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù to apparently being too lax with catching up with my work. 
Bare in mind I‚Äôve been here ONE MONTH, there‚Äôs a lot to learn which other colleagues have said they are still learning and they‚Äôve been here a year. But I am already being told I am not working towards my manager‚Äôs expectations without being given any when I started. Once the old person finished training me, I was deep into it and the guides they have are not as clear cut as I thought when I started. 

The person I replaced had been there for a few years and knew the CEO very well and when I saw the way everyone interacted with them during my training, I saw they were favoured a lot and Omg I kept hearing ‚ÄúI miss them so much‚Äù just made me feel so shit. 

Maybe my manager is harsh because they had high expectations? Maybe it‚Äôs cuz it‚Äôs a small company so there will be more pressure? Personally from what was said, the company want a good reputation for the funders and my manager wants to look good in front of the ceo. 
 
I just feel hopeless and useless as if I am not good at anything. 
I‚Äôve had successful jobs before so I‚Äôm baffled with this feedback. "

I wanted to peruse more personal goals and help family.

So I ended up taking this job, we agreed that my availability with only for a certain shift that was open. Not something I had been used to but I agreed on it and changed how my life was around that schedule. Since I had experience in management, I took a paycut (which I'm not really complaining about because I didn't want to stay at the other job, way too much time taken away from me). 

The new hours was actually perfect, things felt like they were settling in. The ""training"" was mediocre, my credentials had my very simple first name spelled incorrectly, I barely had anything given to me so I can generate proper and accurate reports. Thank goodness my new co workers ended up passing me what they had (it was management's job to do this, not them)

So with some minor speed bumps work wasn't a problem.

Until one day the operations manager, if you can call them that. Decides to call me during my long commute and ask if I can cover another shift on short notice.

Sure, I can do that if someone decided to call out.

Nope, she decided to go behind my back and unprofessionally change my schedule to every but we agreed to. Using pathetic excuses on why it needed to be done. I was a manager myself, I could read the bullshit clear as day.

If they didn't change me back to what was agreed upon, consider yourself one less employee and I'll gladly take my free unemployment based off your horrible choice to try and pick on someone ""who is new""

Tldr: If you agreed on something during the hiring process, don't ever let incompetent people change what was set in place. This is how they test you to being the company whipping tool."

Hi all, I (29F) got laid off yesterday after working for the company for 9 months because there was a gap between expectations and deliverables. They said, ‚Äúyou have great energy and amazing ideas but we never got to see them executed‚Äù. 

Well, all my ideas were either rejected or i was asked to put them on hold until XYZ project was completed (it‚Äôs still not complete). My role was also set up for failure. I was reporting to A who was not a marketing professional, but I had to get approvals from B, the VP of Marketing, for everything that I wanted to do. I was kind of misguided about my reporting manager thrice. On top of that, my goals did not ladder up to anyone‚Äôs goals and I was even asked to see my own goals lol. At the end, I never had any goals defined. 

I agree 100% that that role was a shitshow and I‚Äôm glad to be out. I‚Äôm just upset how the process went and how I was never given any feedback or an opportunity to improve. I was never put on PIP. I was given tasks that I wasn‚Äôt great at and something I‚Äôve never done before (event planning, graphic designing, etc.) 

I feel bad and I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm so lost :( how do I deal with this?

The job posting was for a part time receptionist. When hired I was told many things, including that the job was more than happy to accommodate my school schedule, that I was to be paid $17/hour with the promise of 26 hours a week. I was also informed that I would be allowed to take a break whenever I felt I needed one. I was lulled into a false sense of security. It rather quickly became apparent that none of those things were true. After completing the training, I was told that I was going to be trained not just for the job of receptionist but every other job besides Doctor. They wanted to train me as a tech and an optician as well. I continued the training but after realizing they were serious about training for every other position in the office I made it known that it would be fine if they wanted to train me to do all of the jobs, however I would need to be paid accordingly. The training quickly stopped for the other jobs after that. Once I became trained for the receptionist position more things began to come out of the woodwork. A toxic and highly unsafe workplace emerged. There have been multiple incidents in which a fellow coworker has been blatantly racist to not only fellow employees but also towards the patients. The unethical behavior and practices are unacceptable for me. For the companies part one of my jobs as a receptionist is basically to harass customers by calling them multiple times sometimes a week for things the patient either already knows or already did. I also have observed that while there are times when I get the full 26 hours these times are few and far between. It‚Äôs either an all or nothing. Either they schedule you for close to 38 hours a week (the justification for this is ‚Äúit‚Äôs the busy season‚Äù) or they schedule you next to nothing. Recently, I was scheduled for 2 days the entire month of April. Management is unhelpful and even less responsive. I was also recently informed that I would no longer be allowed to take a break whenever I felt I needed one, this bothers me because it was one of the reasons I took the job. I have needs that require workplace accommodations and when I was told I could take a break whenever I needed this resolved the accommodations so I never felt the need to bring it up until recently. After we got a new manager, she recited the federal policy on breaks. I made contact with my personal physician to provide a letter for the workplace accommodation I needed. I never got around to actually going through the process of the workplace accommodations request. This was because according to the schedule I was not scheduled to work at all in the month of May. Once it became apparent that I would not be working at all during the month of May, I put in my two weeks notice. Apparently I am not the only employee who‚Äôs hours have been cut. Upon speaking with several of my former coworkers, it was made clear that not only has the new manager hired several new employees, this person seems to be playing favorites with hours and has cut everyone I came to work with significantly. All in all, don't do it. Don‚Äôt work for them if you can help it. They will find a way to extract as much out of you as they can for as little as they can. If you have to take the job, get everything in writing.

It's a pretty toxic work environment and everyone is used to being yelled at, degraded, and walking on eggshells.

The plant manager has quite the temper and when things don't go his way he takes it out on whoever is in front of him. Also he's never wrong, everyone else is wrong. 

When he yells at me I usually just stay silent until he's done and then continue working.

In the future, how should I handle his temper? My initial thought is to tell him I won't listent to what he's saying until he can talk to me with respect like a human being, but I don't think that would go over well and he'd probably fire me (he's known for firing people just because he's upset).

Corporate won't do anything to him because our plant has the highest production numbers so they just look the other way.

I know a lot of people will tell me to quit, but I'm just a few months away from being fully vested and I don't want to lose that.

Is there anything I can do or just keep silent and try to not let it get to me? "

When my business took off, I was both nervous and ecstatic to put in my two weeks. I asked my boss if she preferred a letter, but she said I didn‚Äôt need to, and that she‚Äôd cut my schedule off on my last day. I worked hard and even picked up extra shifts during my final weeks there, and she cut my days mid-week on the final week to the exact final day I‚Äôd given. (Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs a Wednesday, so my last day was Wednesday: hence, my final week was scheduled off from Thurs-Sun.) 

But then, on my last day, she put up a new schedule for the week following and my name was bloody everywhere. I was scheduled nearly every day of the following week, just under 40 hours. I told her that today was my last day, she asked me if I could keep working a few more weeks so someone could take a vacation. 

I said no. She said she expected me in. The day she wanted me to come in the next week, I got calls and calls and calls and calls. 

I told her I quit, that I wasn‚Äôt coming in and then she pretended that I never put in my two weeks at all. I told her that was tough for her, but I did what I was required and advised to do with a verbal notice that was witnessed by the entire team. 

Last I heard, she threw her phone across the back room in anger. Talked trash to my coworkers and my coworkers cut me off from there. I saw her years later and she asked how my ‚Äúlittle business‚Äù was going. I smiled and asked her to take my order. I don‚Äôt ever plan on using her as a reference, I have plenty already.

Now that I'm not part of the company, I'm obviously not attending said retreat, and when asked about reimbursement, they said that I could get a credit from the airline and use it for a future trip. This does not sit well with me. First, as I'm unemployed right now I am not going to be taking any trips soon, and second, it was $225. That's a whole month worth of food for me.

I did not lie about anything major. I worked at a small construction company for a year with two other women. They were complete bullies and I was fired without cause after a year. I know they fired me for personal issues with me. They did give me an insane severance package which tells me they know they were in the wrong. 

The thing is, the more time that passes only resume, the worse it gets. I haven't found a job after 5 months. And now there is a 5 month gap. I also feel that although I was fired without cause on paper, any job that calls to verify my employment will sense that they aren't happy with me.

And it makes me so mad. Anyone can say anything about anybody. I don't see why my skills need to go to waste and I can't support myself because a couple people in a grimy building didn't like me.

So my husband's best friend had me do some administrative work for him in the interim. Just little things, nothing full time and I do it for free so I can use the experience. 

I ended up getting rid of the other office completely and just subbing in my duties and tasks to his company, while also saying I'm still employed there. Everything prior on my resume is right. 

So far no one has called because they know it would be weird to call my current employer and ask for employee verification as they would know I applied for another job. In the off chance they did call, he will 1000% verify my employment with him and go along with what I wrote. 

I just had an interview. I feel terribly for lying. They were so nice. But I also feel like I have no choice. I'm getting looked over because of my resume.

My dilemma is that I currently have one offer on the line from a well respected company A but at the same time, I am much more interested about the role and company B I interviewed for today. 

Would it be unreasonable for me to email the recruiter and tell them that I already have an offer on the line and to see if their process can be sped up to make a decision? I am worried that I will lose both if I don‚Äôt deal with this carefully. 

For context, the offer only came through yesterday from company A.

- my job doesn't let us request days off in advance we need to put in vacation time ( witch apparently is common ,I came from a server background so this is weird )
( I was out from a bachelorette party witch was 400-600$ :( ,I assumed I could just ask or the days off )

It takes two-three months to be trained in my position .

856,2024-05-02,Flew out to interview for a position they already had filled (without telling me). Then they tried to buy the company I work for,u/jasonpbyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ciojml/flew_out_to_interview_for_a_position_they_already/,antiwork,"TLDR; Company flew me and wife out, gave us verbal and email salary offer, sent us with realtor, offer on house accepted, then said they can only pay 65% of what was quoted because position had been filled (before flying me out). Then tried to buy company I work for.

Received a call from a recruiter I had worked with before, she said she found the perfect position for me, but I'd have to relocate. She told me the pay was low 200s, so I said sure let me talk to them. We had a video interview and they loved me. Told me to book flight to come out to see them with my wife.

Within an hour the owner is texting me asking what my wife does for work so they can help find her a job, tells me I can use his condo which sits empty for 6 to 12 months if needed so we can get the lay of the land and find the perfect house.

Over the next week they email me their benefits package price so I can compare apples to apples. They tell me to figure out what moving costs would be and closing costs on my home so they can put together a relocation package. He also connects me with a realtor to show us some houses while we're out there.

So we get in town, go to a crazy expensive steakhouse. Next morning I meet the owners son (he's taking over the business) at the office, he goes over an org chart with me, tells me who will be reporting to me, takes me on a tour of the building, introduces me to people as ""he's going to be moving here and over all of the accounting department."" He takes me to a conference room and introduces me to the ""Current CFO"" (I assume the outgoing one who is retiring as he was recruiting me for CFO), but no , dude has only been there a week and lacks all of the experience that they were specifically looking for with me. Strange I think. I meet with the owners son again and ask him about their week old CFO if they were recruiting me for that, he says ""oh yeah we filled that but still want you probably as the VP of finance, we will create a position for you.""

He takes me outside where his dad is waiting to take me to the condo and meet the realtor to go see houses (realtor was picking up my wife at hotel to meet at condo.) I tell him I need a salary amount so I know which range of houses to go see. He says ""Your base will be around $200k and then $40k or so of bonus potential"".

We go see houses, put an offer in on one. Realtor says to call loan agent to get pre approved. Loan agent gets the name of the guy I'll be working for and says ""oh yeah he's my good friend, he was the best man in my wedding"". Asks if I have an official offer letter with salary, which I do not. He tells me to ask for one, but says he will call him as well. So I text the guy and he emails me a spreadsheet showing the salary workup he has, which matches the prior amounts. Loan guy calls back saying he talked to his friend and he confirmed the numbers, so we are approved for the loan on the house we offered on. 

Saturday comes and wife and I decide to go take in some tourist sites in the city. I get a text from recruiter asking me to call her. She says that I'm asking way too high of a relocation package (they offered to pay for full move and fees, I didn't ask), she also says I am being ridiculous expecting to use the condo for 6 to 12 months.  I indicate that the condo was offered to me within hours of our first call. She says ""oh thats not the story I got."" At this moment we got a text from realtor that the offer on house was accepted and he needs earnest money before we leave town.  Recruiter says she will circle back with the ownership and get an offer letter from them ASAP.

An hour later, owner son texts asking if he can call me. He calls and acts all weird, he says they can only pay me 65% of what they quoted, because the CFO role was already filled. I called him out on his BS and asked why they wasted my time bringing me down for that role if they already filled it with someone who didn't meet the ""required skills"".  So I told him thanks for wasting our time bringing us down with zero intent to hire us. And even a bigger thanks for lying about the salary so we could get our heart set on the perfect house for us, only to have to walk away from it.

I get home, send them my expenses so they can send me a check (they did send it), along with the biggest F\*\*\* you email ever. Basically told them that this is a Tommy Boy situation where the dad has built a great company and now silver spoon son can ruin it. I asked why they hired someone who had ZERO of the required skills.

He sent me a generic reply and stated that I lacked the necessary skills for them to have made me any offer. LMAO! Recruiter got a great laugh out of that.

So I figured I'd never hear from them again.... as they say on TV.... BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!!   
  
Flash forward 2 weeks and the owner of the company sends me an email that ""I just was contacted by a company in (region I had visited) and they want to explore buying the company"" (Owner is actively selling, has a few who will probably make an offer soon). I laughed and knew immediately who it was. Replied to him ""Tell them no thanks. They were recruiting me for their CFO and flew me down under false circumstances and lied to me all weekend, not an ownership group that you want taking over your business.""

I'm sure part of their reason for that email was to make sure I admitted to my boss I was exploring leaving. So I owned that immediately. He doesn't care, he's about to sell for millions and knows I need to look out for myself and my family.

Curious if I hear from them again or if they're really done being a thorn in my side."

I work face to face with the general public. I also serve food.

I have completely lost my voice, and still, I had to show up to work. I had called out 24 hours ahead of time after having worked a few days progressively getting worse. Nobody would cover me for any days, so I didn‚Äôt bother telling the manager‚Ä¶ until last night I got into contact with them, knowing my fate already.. I tried my luck...  BUT Since nobody would cover me again, the manager demanded I work. 

I kept having to race out the back and try not to literally cough up a lung and choke on throat mucus. I was having trouble breathing too. 

I feel disgusted and really upset. This isn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôve forced us to work. My other coworker had bad food poisoning and was still forced to come in. 

This manager is the absolute worst. They don‚Äôt do their job. I do most of their tasks as they‚Äôre too lazy to do anything. I have to been on their good side to get hours. 

The fact that I didn‚Äôt even have a damn voice, my throat was burning trying to form a slight voice for the customers to hear me‚Ä¶

As I get to place my order, another person enters behind me, and the single employee starts working on all 3 dishes (my bowl, his 2 orders) and then said the following:

""I can just get you both at once, since I'm solo here. And the big bosses are in, so maybe they'll notice my efforts, and multitasking skills! Probably makes me look pretty good honestly.""

It made me sad to realize that the only thing his efforts would make management realize is that they don't have to spend the money on extra employees and are more likely to push this one guy to always be ""multitasking"" just to protect their bottom line.

37,2024-05-02,Leaving your job? How about an exciting non paid exit interview!!! Don't sign the line!!!,u/SierraTheWolfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ciqpwb/leaving_your_job_how_about_an_exciting_non_paid/,antiwork,"Awhile back, I was wrongfully terminated by HR from my job due to medical reasons and ADA request. I've shared the story a few times on reddit, but my former employer doesn't seem to get it. Won unemployment against them and may look into an employment attorney soon as I can afford one.

 I keep getting various calls, email and texts from their HR to conduct an exit interview. To those who have never heard or done an exit interview, a company representative will reach out to ask you various questions and discuss an employee's reasons for leaving and their experience of working for the organization. They get valuable insight and are able to self reflect. You have no legal obligation to participate in an exit interview unless it in your contract. They can argue all they want, but I like to call out bluffs. 

The thing is that some exit interviews are an honest waste of time and you don't get paid to do them. Instead you are giving them free information. If you had a bad experience, it may be hard to keep yourself in control and say or do things that may not look good in the end. This is just one of many reasons why I refuse to do exit interviews. 

As I said, my former employer wanted to do an exit interview. At first, I ignored all attempts to reach out. However, I ended up answering a phone call thinking it was a recruiter or company wanting to hire me. Nope, it was my former employer and I am honestly not interested. The representative was friendly. I told them I'll never do an exit interview and to stop contacting me.

The second thing on my former employers docket was to have me sign paperwork. The thing is that I do not have any legal obligation to sign any paperwork that is given to me. Just like an exit interview, they can threaten all they want. It is just a bluff. The thing about the exiting documents is that they can sneak in obituary agreements that could harm you if any legal issue comes up such as a class action lawsuit. I learned this from experiance because a similar issue happened to my spouse. Don't sign on the line.

Anyway, I hope this sort of helps people out there and gave me a chance to share my thoughts. If anyone has stories of doing any of these please let me know. Like to read them if possible!"

This is after quarterly earnings supposedly saying about how much money they have been making and how well they are doing. She has worked there over 4 years now. They have consistently refused to promote he, despite being not only the most veteran and knowledgeable of the team, but even after training basically everyone, including her current manager. 

She has one guy on her team who has been there long enough now that he shouldn't be asking as many basic questions as he does. He has also screwed up several times and nearly cost the company millions. There is a who woman was basically only hired through nepotism and is delegated the least amount of work because of how slowly and poorly she works. Despite this, they refuse to let them go but are okay with not offering any growth to the people who actually work hard. 

One girl was hired as an intern with promise of fulltime after a probationary period. She recently finished that and they offered her a position, but only if she accepted intern pay. Another girl whom she has been directed to assist with on some projects is passive aggressive and toxic toward her, even making some semi-racist sounding remarks. The company turns a blind eye to this.

She is required to come into office 3 days a week, and yet half her team is remote because they already worked out of state when hired. But because she happens to be here, they enforce RTO. It is against company policy to have to any children around you when working and they state you must put them in childcare during your shift, as if no one in the company has ever had kids. They do not reimburse childcare, but they do allow you to pay it yourself with pre-tax dollars (oh boy, much help). They have even taken team lunch outings to save money, which never even occurred that often anyway.

Another employer actively doing everything it can to shit on the workers while reaping profits. I know, I know. She needs a new job. It is just difficult for her to look at other things right now since I am actively trying to find something new myself. Coupled with managing a kid alone while I'm away at the office and dealing with all of the above. Quitting is also out of the question as we can't risk it with a kid until I make enough to cover both our salaries. Anyway, pisses me off and just had to vent. Thanks for coming."

Worked so hard on mega million dollar projects I nearly had heart attacks. Constantly over my head making massive decisions, dealing with lawyers. Stress turned my hair gray early. Never did get any extra money. Eventually realized my partners we're never going to kick cash out of the company and sold my partnership back to them. 

Convinced I was going to make a lot of money I told the kids to follow their dreams, go to expensive colleges, I'll pay for it. Now I'm paying off that too. My bad, I admit it. Bad judgement. 

10 years away from retirement now and things aren't so bad but all my friends are way ahead of my despite I've worked harder my whole life. Should have my house and all that college debt paid off soon. I just realized I was led by the nose into hard work and debt believing it would somehow benefit me in the end.

I get paid very well for my area, $19.00 per hour. When I started I got told that our delivery routes varied, but I could expect around 40-45 hours a week. 30 minute unpaid lunch was automatically taken out of our time every day because we don't have access to clock in and out while on the job. At first this was what I got. I'd work from 8 to about 4 or 430. Some days I'd actually have to find some extra work to do around the warehouse to make up time to get a full 8.

All that changed around December. I suddenly started getting saddled with 10-12 hour days. At first it was a day or two a week. Then it was every day. Since January I've worked 10-12 hour days, 5 days a week, every week. I've started grousing. A lot. But our dispatch team just hits me with ""we know you're struggling, but stick with it, we'll hire someone soon."" 

My delivery area is Cincinnati Ohio, which is around two hours away from the warehouse. On any given day I could have 15-20 stops, sometimes more, scattered across Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky. I work all day until customer shops close, then I get to drive back. I'm usually still in Cincinnati by the time all my coworkers (including our lead) have already left. I always wait to take my lunch break until the end of the day so I can make all my deliveries, because if I miss any they make my next day even longer.

My entire life revolves around work now. My housekeeping falls by the wayside during the week, and I can't get any errands or chores dons. No time. I have to spend all day Saturday and Sunday recovering from the previous week and preparing for the next. I set out five sets of clothes, ready to go. I prep all my lunches and dinners so I can just grab and eat. 

But these last few weeks I've been trying to work out. I've lost a lot of weight, and I want to start adding muscle. But where do I fit 30 minutes of weightlifting, plus travel time, into my already cramped schedule?

Well...there's the lunch break. I don't actually need to stop for lunch, because I eat on the go. I've been using it to get some cardio and calisthenics in. But then I had an especially long and stressful day at work last week, and I still needed to go to the gym. So I skipped it. And I've kept skipping it for the last week. 

I feel disgusted. I've just paid my employer fourteen dollars a day. I've let them steal from me. And I'm gonna keep doing it, which is what hurts me the most. 

They know I'm trapped. I'm paying for very expensive medications, and I just found out from my doctor that I might have skin cancer. My employer knows I can't quit because I need their money and their insurance. I'm their slave and they know it."
1,2024-05-02,Should I start a new job without a contract? ,u/n0stalgicm0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cituqs/should_i_start_a_new_job_without_a_contract/,antiwork,"Hi, i hope this is ok for this space, because i don‚Äôt know where else to turn to right now. I am posting on behalf of my partner. 

Some facts to start: we are located in canada, they are here on a student visa and have a work permit, they also have a current part time job. 

Recently my partner got a retail sales position at a newer company and was told they would have a contract to sign this past friday. After some back and forth communication over email with the area manager, the only contact they have at this point, has still not received a contract because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre still working on it and talking to a lawyer, come in on thursday (today) for training.‚Äù Note here; my partner isn‚Äôt the only person to be working there who is not a canadian citizen and has a permit to work. 

Today my partner went in for training, here is what they said about the experience: ‚Äúthe people are nice but they still didn‚Äôt have the contract for me, I was told there are no set break times because someone always needs to be in the store. Including breaks for bathroom and hydration.  If i‚Äôm the only one there I basically can‚Äôt leave. They have already scheduled me 20hours with the potential to get up to 40hrs. Also they trained me on the procedure for opening the store, well told me what to do and said there was an excel spreadsheet if i need help. They gave me a key because they want me to open the store this Saturday.‚Äù

I was like red flag alert! We want to see what other people think about this experience. Should my partner return the key and wait for an actual contract to start? Should they just do it and hope for the best? 

Personally i think they should return the keys and run even though finding work is difficult because this no contract job sounds not ok.

1,2024-05-02,Homophobic Manager? Am I Overreacting?,u/ghost-bees,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ciugn1/homophobic_manager_am_i_overreacting/,antiwork,"I work in food service right now. I live in a small town where it's really the only place needing staff and I need to keep a job til September to meet my final financial goals for university. 

  
In our department, we have a calendar right below our schedule for people to write down if they need a day off or for important events to be written in (such as if head office is visiting one day so we need to be prepared or something like that). It is a typical calendar that has holidays, sometimes even holidays in other countries or provinces, written down on it. 



Today when I was closing, I saw it was still on April, so I flipped the page to May. I then realized that on the 17th of May, ""International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia"" was scribbled out with a big X through it as well. This was presumably done by my manager, based on the pen that was used (and opinions of hers I have heard in the past), but it could have been done by someone else. She is just who I almost fully believe did it. 

  
I am, as far as I know, the only LGBTQ+ person in this department. I haven't gone around saying this at all, but one person knows because her sister knew me in high school, and I suppose I kind of look the part, so people could suspect I am. I always have felt like I have been treated poorly and a little weirdly, but I chalked it up to me being new back there and everyone being a little awkward, or in some cases bitter, around a new person. However, seeing that on the calendar is making me quite nervous now knowing that some people know. I am not sure what to do, or if there even is anything I can do, because I don't know if just scribbling something out on a calendar counts as discrimination; it just makes me nervous knowing the opinions of the person in charge of my employment. For context, nothing else has ever been scribbled out like this on the calendar, so I have no idea why only that specific ""holiday"" (not sure how to call it) would be. We are also open that day, so it's not like she was trying to indicate we were closed... So now I'm just puzzled."

2,2024-05-02,Am I wrong for this?,u/99Direwolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ciukus/am_i_wrong_for_this/,antiwork,"So I work in an office and have had to make a few complaints lately. Basically where I work its in an office, a credit union. People come in and get signed into our lobby system and then an employee will grab them take them back to an office and help them with whatever they need. 

  
Lately most of the other employees were not working as they should and would just let people sit in the lobby waiting for someone else to grab them so they don't have to do anything for awhile. I would usually end up being the one to grab them so our lobby wait time doesnt go up too much but lately I've gotten tired of it and if I've helped people recently and other employees have been sitting around for hours not helping people I would refuse to grab them until they stepped up and helped and did their fair share of the work. 

  
This obviously didn't do much people would be waiting for forever now and our wait times have skyrocketed. Well I don't want to get in trouble for that so I made a complaint to management, management addressed it and things are a bit better now. Well very shortly after that I had another issue with a specific employee who would chew up office equipment, pens, ect or put that stuff to their body like pick their scabs or something with it just nasty stuff. I had tried to be really cool and not complain but we share offices and I have to use all that stuff when they are done with it and its nasty. I addressed it directly to this employee and they just laughed it off. and then keeps doing it. I keep going into an office and stuff will be dirty or chewed up and gross and I have to throw this stuff away wash my hands get new stuff. So I got upset about it and decided to send an email. I emailed the employee: 

""Please stop chewing on the pens, I have had to throw away a bunch of them. It's nasty when they are put back into the pen cup for members(customers) and other employees to use. Buy some Gum or something. Thank you."" 

and CC'd the manager to make sure it was addressed. Wasn't trying to be a dick or rude but it keeps happening and its gross to deal with. We are not in middle school and I have tried asking her nicely a few times to stop with no luck. Well today I get pulled aside saying my email COULD be viewed as rude. And that its being reviewed by my managers manager, her manager and HR. Basically saying I am about to be written up over making a complaint via email. My manager admitted when I said it verbally it didnt sound as bad, and also if I sent it only to the manager it wouldn't have been an issue. Well pretty much every time I fucked up doing something other departments or employees email me directly and CC my manager. Its the go to format for making a complaint or bringing attention to a situation that needs to be addressed. I even talked to the employee chewing the pens if she thought the email was rude or offensive and she said no. She only cared I involved management and didnt talk to her directly (which i tried before.) So now I am about to get a write up over something that MIGHT be considered rude or COULD be considered rude according to the manager. But wasnt rude when pretty much said the same thing in person. The directed employee doesnt think its rude, and I was trying to say please and thank you to crube any unintended meaning in the message. 

Was I wrong to even bring it up? Am I in the wrong for making a complaint? Or does it feel like I am being retaliated against for making the complaint at all? I feel like I am being retaliated against. "

I'm facing a bit of a dilemma at my job as an hourly technician at a car dealership, and I'm hoping to get some advice or insight from the community.

So, here's the deal: when I first started, I was given four days of training during work hours, which I completed without any issues. However, recently, I was assigned additional training, but this time, I wasn't given any time during the day to complete it. Instead, it was expected to be done at home, on my own time.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for improving my skills and knowledge, but expecting me to do this training outside of my regular work hours just doesn't sit right with me.

So, my question is: is this legal? Can my employer really require me to do training at home without compensating me for my time? And what should I do about it?

Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

Shitty thing is that I'm a contractor still, or was, and I was promised up and down at the start that it was a 3-6-month-to-hire position. Needless to say I've been extended there multiple times due to ""great performance"" but that was never enough for any of the higher ups to push the issue and get me and another contractor brought on.

It's not the first time something like this has happened to me, but this is the first time my family and I have had a house to ourselves (thankfully only renting) but now we're headed for homelessness if something doesn't come through in the next couple months. Not sure what's in my immediate future but I can't see us surviving to the holidays.

Of course on top of all of it, being a contractor means I've had no benefits to help cover the myriad of severe health issues I've had, and there's no chance of promotion as a contractor, so for 2.5 years I just kept my fingers crossed that I'd get the golden ticket to actually accessible healthcare for my family and I and a higher income too.

After the obvious murders of 2 whistleblowers at Boeing, can we please have one or several ongoing, high profile threads in honor of the people who were killed?  And I would also like to start a movement to warn current employees and those potentially thinking about being employed at Boeing about the risks.

**THERE IS A VERY STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE IN THE GOVERNMENT USED THOUGHT CONTROL ON THE WHISTLEBLOWER THAT SHOT HIMSELF.**

**IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY EXISTS, RESEARCH NEURALINK BY ELON MUSK.  IT IS MOST DEFINITELY POSSIBLE.  I AM NOT ACCUSING MUSK OF ANY INVOLVEMENT HERE BUT I AM USING THIS AS A SCIENTIFIC EXAMPLE OF HOW IT IS POSSIBLE.**  I am certain that this technology has been around since the 80/s and 90s.

Disclaimer

A.  I am **not** a targeted individual, I **do not** hear any voices other than my own, but I have done over a decade of research on this topic because it fascinates me.  I am a former amateur radio operator.  I am not crazy, I am not a survivalist.  I don't believe the government is controlling everyone simultaneously with this, but they have the ability to enter in to anybody's mind that has the chip, display visuals that look like daydreams, and can make them think or say potentially anything they want with or without the person being consciously aware of it.

B. I do not work for the government.  I am a civilian utility locator.

Theory 1 - The US government, possibly in conjunction with top ranking Boeing board members used the nation's thought control apparatus to torture **John Barnett**   possibly threatening his family with murder.  **OTHERWISE THE GUY WOULDN'T HAVE SHOT HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A COURT CASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** 

Theory 2 (I don't think this is as plausible as theory 1 but I'll bite) A government or Boeing assassin had him murdered.

As far as **Joshua Dean** and the illness, my guess is that theory 1 came into play, didn't work so well when the guy wouldn't kill himself and someone intentionally infected him.

PS, here is a potential (hypothetical) method for detecting these chips, assuming that the chip is constantly transmitting radio waves.

1.  Build a faraday cage.  It has to block ALL incoming radio signals.  MAKE SURE TO PUT IN METAL VENTS BENT AT SEVERAL ANGLES SO IT IS WELL VENTALATED.  RUN A BUNCH OF WIRES FROM BOTH THE VENTS AND THE FARADAY CAGE ITSELF.  THERE SHOULD BE NO HOLES IN IT OTHER THAN THE VENTS.

2.  You will need a radio spectrum analyzer ( rf spectrum analyzer ) **ON BATTERY POWER ONLY,**  **NOT THE CHEAP ONES THE WILL NOT WORK, YOU WOULD NEED ONE THAT GOES FROM 0HZ TO 828904830890423890423890823490850298 Mhz** (you know what I mean).  Because if my guess is right they are really really high up in the radio spectrum.

Place the spectrum analyzer inside the faraday cage without you in it and see if it detects anything.  Then step in to the faraday cage with the spectrum analyzer.  DO NOT HAVE A CELL PHONE ANYWHERE CLOSE OR ANY KIND OF WIFI DEVICE ENABLED, OR ANYTHING AT ALL THAT EMITS RADIO WAVES.

And boom, you just found the uplink frequency of the chip if it exists, but again **THIS IS ASSUMING THAT THE CHIP IS CONSTANTLY TRANSMITTING.**

Please, do not delete this and please tell everyone you know about this.  

THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL INFO ONLY, I HAVE NO PROOF THAT THIS IS WHAT OCCURRED BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY MORE PEOPLE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK FOR A BUNCH OF IDIOT BILLIONAIRES WHO WON'T EVEN ALLOW THEIR SAFETY PERSONNEL TO FIX FLAWS IN AIRPLANES!

A new manager was hired last year and decided to make all these changes without consulting anyone and without fully knowing what to do.

He wants to build up my skills to promote me to another position. This backfired hard as he had me stop sending a report I would always send because either he took care of it, or it wasnt needed.

I get called into another managers office over my poor performance and get thrown under the bus for those reports...so no raise or promotion.

I still have another task which he then takes over himself, fucks up and changes everything I spent weeks on. I stopped caring about anything new he gives me because he'll just change it.

Today, while preparing the employee tasks for tomorrow, I tell him what everyones worked on and numbers are low, so its best of they spend tomorrow just catching up on work...he looks at me nods and says he'll assign a brand new task instead. I told him next week's report is going to be bad due to the low production and he ignores me and assigns it to everyone. 

TLDR; I'm not getting a raise, getting tasks taken away from, got reprimanded and my insight on things go completely ignored. 

I never liked this stupid job but these last few weeks have felt totally pointless. Only reason I stay is because I can't find a job that pays the same."

With the rising cost of living, Gen Z is having fewer children, and as Baby Boomers and Gen X age, we're facing a potential demographic shift. Meanwhile, many traditional jobs aren't offering livable wages, pushing more young people toward alternative income sources like OnlyFans, sex work, Twitch, and YouTube‚Äîplatforms that can provide substantial earnings for those with significant followings or just not working in general. This shift raises concerns about future shortages in critical roles such as doctors, nurses, police officers, pilots, and engineers etc. Why does it seem like the government isn't planning for these long-term challenges, focusing instead on short-term financial gains?"
1,2024-05-02,Update on being called ‚Äúunprofessional‚Äù for submitting two weeks notice.,u/shepherdastra,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ciz53y/update_on_being_called_unprofessional_for/,antiwork,"So here‚Äôs the update from my previous post. For a little back history, I am 31F, my ‚Äúmanager‚Äù is 27M. He does not have a college degree (there is nothing wrong with this) but the position I‚Äôm in is degree required and he got into this management position by brown nosing his way upwards. Yes I did consider just dropping off all my equipment and leaving on the spot, but I wanted to see if I could get back in some way. I am in the anger stage of grieving, a lot of mixed emotions, and very bitter towards this place, and him.

After we spoke he sent an email stating ‚ÄúCan you please update your resignation to state the reason you are leaving is due to a higher salary?‚Äù. I sat on this email knowing due to his lack of experience him or my upper manager would do something I could use something against them somehow. Other than asking to update my resignation, Thursday and Friday were quiet. Monday comes around and manager above us takes some of my work away and asks my manager to complete instead. It was something I was more than capable of doing and had been asked to do in the past, except this time for some reason. So I was able to use that as my ammunition for retaliation. Afterwards I sent the below email and tagged our HR rep replying to the email asking to update my resignation:

Hello Manager,
As discussed on 4/25 with you, I provided ""better opportunity"" as a reason for my leaving, not higher salary offer as you are stating below. I will not be revising my letter of resignation also. I will discuss reasons and provide examples of why I am leaving to HR if it is requested by HR, as it is not due to salary. I will not be called unprofessional and threatened by management for submitting a two weeks notice also. I cannot and will not stay past 5/9 per your request even though as you stated ""this is causing an inconvenience to you"".
Hello HR rep,
My last day with this company is 5/9, I have already started to receive retaliation for submitting my notice from management since then. If this retaliation from management continues I will reconsider staying the full two weeks and leave earlier due to this. To my knowledge, I am not in violation of any State labor laws for submitting a two weeks notice and not providing a reason on the letter. Please advise if I am. Please let me know if anything is needed from HR for this transition from the company also.


That was Monday afternoon. Received a response from our HR rep saying not in violation and acknowledging my email basically Tuesday morning. I receive a message from my manager Tuesday morning asking if we could speak because he is confused on the email. We find a closed office and I tell him ‚ÄúI will not allow you speak to me that way again as you did last week. If you speak to me that way again, I will walk away immediately. Aside from all the events that have led up to this, that is the last impression I will have of you‚Äù he could barely look me in the eyes and gave a half assed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and ‚ÄúI had invested so much time trying to develop you‚Äù (his idea of development is micromanagement and I took a step down for this role). Management here is not used to be questioned or ‚Äúchallenged‚Äù, they want everyone just to agree with them and do as they say without thinking, so they don‚Äôt know what to do when I would speak up. I stayed firm and unemotional when explaining everything that he did and did not do, and of course he deflected or saw he did nothing wrong. I was confident in speaking, his voice was shaken. Basically turned into nothing more to say and walked out. Didn‚Äôt speak the rest of the day. But he got the message I hold the power now and do not mess with me.

Wednesday/yesterday I had my exit interview with HR. This conversation was actually very good and professional. I basically unloaded everything that had happened during my time here onto him and did state I am leaving due to management. Apparently the email I had sent sent off some alarms to HR. HR had asked what happened last week, I told him, and he said it matches the story my manager gave also and pretty much said ‚Äúyeah he shouldn‚Äôt have done that, I‚Äôm going to need to send him for training and we might reconsider his management position‚Äù. We talked some more and he asked questions about other events that happened here (a lot of ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt do that‚Äù, ‚Äúhe really can‚Äôt do that‚Äù was said by HR, he almost lost it when I mentioned they considered the girl who was promoted as a team ‚Äúlow light‚Äù), I kept it non emotional and had showed emails I have been documenting the past couple of months, and our rep said ‚ÄúI am very sorry this is how you were treated, I do not blame you for looking elsewhere‚Äù. He told me thank you for sharing and he said he is going to follow up with my manager, so manager is on HR‚Äôs radar.

So that‚Äôs pretty much the update. I do have my manager guessing if I will stay the full two weeks or not and to stay off my case. I still will leave earlier if he slips up even slightly. I have aired out my dirty laundry to other departments, so the rumor mill is churning. The internal people I worked with are upset with management since I am leaving since I was the strongest on the team compared to my peers. They are also happy since they could tell this place was affecting my mental health and people were getting concerned about me, but they did not know why and I still showed up to do my job. I‚Äôm not sure if anything will be done after I leave, but I think I did leave some after math damage. I do have some healing to do, this place killed the spark inside me, but I am excited for my new job (I will be making more than my manager also). Thanks for reading all this everyone, cheers."

11708,2024-05-03,Today I was interviewed by AI,u/over-sight,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ciznve/today_i_was_interviewed_by_ai/,antiwork,"In order to gain a real interview from a national grocery chain, I was required to perform a video interview with HireVue, an online, AI assessment tool. 

To prepare, I was directed to wear a suit with no tie, headphones were prohibited, volume at a decent level with no external mic plugged in and they said I should be in a well lit, quiet area. 

The system asked me 5 questions and I had a minute to read each one and ready myself mentally before answering in 3 minutes or less. The system does not allow you to delete your recording and make additional attempts. 

When answering questions, I was instructed to use the Situation, Task, Action and Result method, while maintaining eye contact with the camera, and speaking as if I was actually talking with a human being. The system recognizes the specific words you speak, how you say them, your facial expression and eye movement, which will all be assessed and the hiring manager will be made aware of your score. If your eye strays away from the camera too much or for too long, your score will plummet because it's been programmed to assume this action is the result of reading responses from printed cards or devices in the testers vicinity. If your score is above a certain number, real humans may review your recorded answers if they wish and you may be chosen to speak with additional members of their hiring team to continue the interview process.

But wait! That's not all!

After the 5 questions are asked I was given two games to play. The first game showed me a series of numbers and letters, which I had to memorize and punch in a digital keypad. They got harder and harder until they asked me to input the displayed numbers and letters BACKWARDS. As it got harder, I started to mess up.

After round and round of this game was played, I was required to play ANOTHER game which had me reviewing shapes and identifying which ones were the same. But not just basic shapes like circles and triangles, they were squares divided into 9 segments with patterns of circles and triangles inside them, and sometimes they were in varying positions or rotating. 

When playing the game, the player gets immediate feedback if the answer is correct or not, and the more successful you are, the longer it continues. 

This is what interviewing has become. It was ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT. "

# BOEING AND MIND CONTROL TORTURE; CAN WE HAVE A HUGE DAILY ONGOING THREAD FOR YEARS SO WE CAN KEEP THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE FLOWING???

**DO NOT WORK FOR BOEING!!!!!!!!! YOU ARE PUTTING YOUR LIVES AT RISK!**

After the obvious murders of 2 whistleblowers at Boeing, can we please have one or several ongoing, high profile threads in honor of the people who were killed? And I would also like to start a movement to warn current employees and those potentially thinking about being employed at Boeing about the risks.

**THERE IS A VERY STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE IN THE GOVERNMENT USED THOUGHT CONTROL ON THE WHISTLEBLOWER THAT SHOT HIMSELF.**

**IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY EXISTS, RESEARCH NEURALINK BY ELON MUSK. IT IS MOST DEFINITELY POSSIBLE. I AM NOT ACCUSING MUSK OF ANY INVOLVEMENT HERE BUT I AM USING THIS AS A SCIENTIFIC EXAMPLE OF HOW IT IS POSSIBLE.** I am certain that this technology has been around since the 80/s and 90s.

Disclaimer

A. I am **not** a targeted individual, I **do not** hear any voices other than my own, but I have done over a decade of research on this topic because it fascinates me. I am a former amateur radio operator. I am not crazy, I am not a survivalist. I don't believe the government is controlling everyone simultaneously with this, but they have the ability to enter in to anybody's mind that has the chip, display visuals that look like daydreams, and can make them think or say potentially anything they want with or without the person being consciously aware of it.

B. I do not work for the government. I am a civilian utility locator.

Theory 1 - The US government, possibly in conjunction with top ranking Boeing board members used the nation's thought control apparatus to torture **John Barnett** possibly threatening his family with murder. **OTHERWISE THE GUY WOULDN'T HAVE SHOT HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A COURT CASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Theory 2 (I don't think this is as plausible as theory 1 but I'll bite) A government or Boeing assassin had him murdered.

As far as **Joshua Dean** and the illness, my guess is that theory 1 came into play, didn't work so well when the guy wouldn't kill himself and someone intentionally infected him.

PS, here is a potential (hypothetical) method for detecting these chips, assuming that the chip is constantly transmitting radio waves.

1. Build a faraday cage. It has to block ALL incoming radio signals. MAKE SURE TO PUT IN METAL VENTS BENT AT SEVERAL ANGLES SO IT IS WELL VENTALATED. RUN A BUNCH OF WIRES FROM BOTH THE VENTS AND THE FARADAY CAGE ITSELF. THERE SHOULD BE NO HOLES IN IT OTHER THAN THE VENTS.
2. You will need a radio spectrum analyzer ( rf spectrum analyzer ) **ON BATTERY POWER ONLY,** **NOT THE CHEAP ONES THE WILL NOT WORK, YOU WOULD NEED ONE THAT GOES FROM 0HZ TO 828904830890423890423890823490850298 Mhz** (you know what I mean). Because if my guess is right they are really really high up in the radio spectrum.

Place the spectrum analyzer inside the faraday cage without you in it and see if it detects anything. Then step in to the faraday cage with the spectrum analyzer. DO NOT HAVE A CELL PHONE ANYWHERE CLOSE OR ANY KIND OF WIFI DEVICE ENABLED, OR ANYTHING AT ALL THAT EMITS RADIO WAVES.

And boom, you just found the uplink frequency of the chip if it exists, but again **THIS IS ASSUMING THAT THE CHIP IS CONSTANTLY TRANSMITTING.**

Please, do not delete this and please tell everyone you know about this.

THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL INFO ONLY, I HAVE NO PROOF THAT THIS IS WHAT OCCURRED BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY MORE PEOPLE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK FOR A BUNCH OF IDIOT BILLIONAIRES WHO WON'T EVEN ALLOW THEIR SAFETY PERSONNEL TO FIX FLAWS IN AIRPLANES!BOEING

I applied for a position as a candidate attorney at a law firm a few years ago. Initially my application was rejected, however I got a call the next next week asking me to come in on the next day (they phoned me on a Sunday). I got there and met with who would have been my boss (let's call him John). John's uncle is one of the directors of the firm (John got the job because of nepotism).

I met with the person who I would replace and she started showing me the ropes (let's call her Anna). After a few hours Anna said something along the lines of the following to me: ""Listen, I cannot let you work here in good conscience. You need to leave right now and never look back. This place has held me captive for almost 5 years.""

Accordingly to the laws of my country, you have to work at a law firm for 2 years and write the bar exams before you can become an attorney. In that time, attorneys basically just offload all of the worst tasks to you and pay you next to nothing, while taking all of the credit (Yes, I know that is just capitalism in a nutshell). They also treat you like trash at a lot of the firms. So they kept Anna there for 5 years and they refused to sign off on her articles, because they knew she would leave when she finally was admitted as an attorney by the Court. So she worked an extra 3 years and they refused to acknowledge that she possessed the necessary experience, skill and expertise that she had already accumulated 2 years in. She also couldn't leave because then she essentially would have wasted all of her time and would have to start over somewhere else where the same thing could easily happen to her. She was also quite poor, had no safety net and had to rely on the shitty salary to make ends meet (calling the salary ""peanuts"" is being generous). So she stuck it out and they finally signed off when she instituted a lawsuit against them. She obviously resigned just days after her admission was processed, hence them looking for new candidates (fresh meat). 

To nobody's surprise, she also told me that the staff turnover in general at that firm is through the roof. In addition to being sexist, the directors were apparently all extremely homophobic (Anna is gay) and Anna had to deal with horrible homophobic remarks and other abuse/sexual harassment for 5 years, which she could do nothing about for fear of putting her career at risk. Furthermore, the staff were expected to work 12 hour shifts (oftentimes a lot more) every single day and come in on some weekends as well with no overtime pay. Pure insanity. Sometimes the staff would just sleep on the premises.

Turns out they hired me because all of the people who they hired, left after the first day (5 candidates). I was happy to follow suit. It is also worth noting that they hired basically only women and then sexually harass them (I heard this from at least 4 of the women who worked there). It's a violent cycle:

Hire women -> Sexually harass them -> They leave -> Repeat

I regularly look up the firm's reviews on Glassdoor and the words ""abuse"" and ""crazy hours"" can be found all over those reviews. Sadly, yet understandably, Anna no longer practices law, but she is doing very well both mentally and from a career perspective.

94,2024-05-03,I'm burned out. They asked if they need to replace me,u/Individual-Topic-555,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cj6r1f/im_burned_out_they_asked_if_they_need_to_replace/,antiwork,"A little background: 

I haven't even been at this place for a year. I started early October of last year. I agreed, even though my intuition told me not to, because they offered me $5,000 more if I was a good fit after my 90 days. 90 days rolls around and Oops, I wasn't good enough. I was a few minutes late getting in and I was still trialing new formulations so I didn't deserve it. We'll try again in another 90 ü§°
As time has progressed, I have taken on more and more responsibility off my coworker who isn't very efficient. They were demoted twice and still kept the same pay but now their work is spread between 4 people, including me. 
I have a team member who has been calling off so the extra responsibility falls on me. I have been burned out for a long time coming. I go home, I'm too exhausted to do anything, I go to bed, I wake up exhausted, I go to work and survive off energy drinks, repeat. 
Anyways, my most recent formulation is finally working, no thanks to them or their outside help. I actually found answers from an unexpected colleague. They've all been ecstatic but I feel nothing. I don't care. They tell me how exciting and I just say yeah and walk away. 
Yesterday, one of the owners said I should be happy and I told him I was burned out. I'm exhausted. I just don't have the energy to be happy. I put so much pressure on myself go get good yields and tore myself down and I finally realized that the performance of the product wasn't a reflection of me. Well he went to tell the other bosses and they pulled me in for a meeting. 

The meeting:
They told me I haven't been myself and not happy when I should be, even though who are they to tell someone what to feel. I told them the same thing. I'm burned out. I'm tired. I've been running around with no support and I'm on autopilot. I get my work done pretty fast, even with the additional labor, but I never got a raise to do that. 
""Okay, well this isn't sustainable. Do we need to find a replacement for you because I'd rather do it now than when you put in your 2 weeks."" I was shocked and deadpan said I'm still here and will keep working here. 
They said ""well you have a review in October."" ???? Okay so no more additional 90 days, got it. I had job opportunities that I turned down for 20,000 more and less work with more support because I initially liked the company. They told me they couldn't stop me from taking those jobs if that's what I wanted. Glad to see I'm not that important. They said the company expects people to pick up the slack of others ""that's just how we operate."" Well that's how a company that has 0 accountability for their teams work ethic operates but Okay. 
I was then told I need to be happier because how can I motivate my team if I'm not. To be honest, I'm always happy with my team. I do like them. I'm just not happy here. 
Not once did they ask if I needed a break. Not once did they ask if I was okay. Only at the end did they ask how they could help. 
The place has been running for a few years but I'm not sure how. It's so poorly managed and no one has any accountability. 
I am exhausted. 
My coworker is off again so there's an entire employees job that need done and today, I'm not doing it. I just want a job that appreciates me and my hard work and doesnt punish their good workers, but that obviously isn't here.
Oh well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

It was a big drop in salary but I‚Äôm still making it by and my kids aren‚Äôt wanting for anything so I made it work.

I was told I would be doing a specific type of work which relied on lived experience and building a connection with the people we help. I was and still am excited and passionate about this work as I‚Äôve found that it feels super rewarding and I‚Äôm good at it. Unfortunately I joined the company during a shitstorm upheaval of disaster.

I should have known there was going to be an issue when I showed up for the interview and the person who was scheduled to interview me called out and didn‚Äôt tell anyone. I waited around for almost an hour before another person interviewed me. Shortly after I started, the team lead announced she was leaving (with no plans for a replacement) and that the lead for my area of work had left months ago and nobody had replaced her. Still I decided to make it work.

I got no formal training worth mentioning and had to piece it all together myself with little guidance and no structure. It got to the point where I had to complain to various people to get the attention of the program director to personally start training me about 3 months after I had already started doing the work. Mind you, this job is working directly with disadvantaged communities who deserve better than my half trained ass.

Now four months in and I‚Äôve been lied to, gaslit, blamed for systemic issues, and more so I found another job in a similar agency that pays more, has better hours, more structure, and isn‚Äôt just going through the motions. 

I‚Äôm waiting on everything to be completely done and ready before I give notice cuz I can‚Äôt afford to just peace out but I have run out of fucks to give about this place. They‚Äôre letting so many people down and I don‚Äôt want to be complicit in it anymore. Not sure how I‚Äôm going to keep a straight face for the next 1-2 weeks."

Last year just before I reached my 6 month mark at a ""reputable international school"" I was fired with no reason given and none of the procedures they claim followed at all by their new head of school. After reporting them to the labor bureau and education bureau of my city I did manage to get 1.5 months severance out of them but the experience soured me to put it nicely.

I was out of work for about a month and a half before I managed to find another job, although this is a bottom of the barrel type place to work, luckily low hours and an easy job but low salary and barely any benefits, anyway it tided me over.

I almost gave up talking to recruiters and HR from various other schools, I got strung along waiting weeks on end for little news or to be told they were no longer hiring or needed someone with different experience. Had arguments with a few recruiters who would ghost me or send lowball offers. Did manage to get a couple of offers recently but the salaries just were not what I have been earning up to last year. I have been completing an extra teaching qualification online to make myself a better candidate but I was wondering if all the good jobs had dried up.

Finally got talking to a very legitimate sounding school a city over, they seem to respect teacher's planning time, any overtime is guaranteed to be paid, have full medical benefits, housing allowances and such. They want a science teacher for middle school which is perfect for my experience.

After all I went through I was expecting a low ball offer or at least lower than my salary expectation but nope, they just gave me exactly what I asked for! I will be earning about 5% more than the job that fired me last year and this school has even better medical and other benefits. 

I finally feel like the fog of applying for jobs and dealing with these recruiters and non-committal places is over. Just keep at it, eventually you will find what you are looking for."

Now this place has what I feel are more extensive benefits (your classic 401k, dental/health vision and life insurance but also a health spending account, banking partnership with discounted home and auto loan rates, a wellness program, free counseling, tuition assistance and dependent scholarships) and it pays $7 more an hour than what I currently make. However it is NOT a union job and its reviews on Indeed are pretty bad, lot of complaints about management and too much mandated overtime (they did mention that shift covering was required in my interview due to it being a patient security job) and it would be much higher stress position as I would be security personnel at an involuntary rehab facility so a lot of de-escalation with people who are actively detoxing and absolutely don‚Äôt want to be there.

I purely look at work as a tool to make money and i am currently in middle management. The pay difference between my current job level and the one above is close to 40k. 

I am a top performer who has been awarded multiple times with recognition and have been given 5% salary increase this year which is apparently unheard of in the company. (I know this cause i am a visible minority and pay is openly discussed in my community unlike caucasians peers )

That being said, i am in a consultant type role where i have been assigned on a project where i have to optimize processes for a team that is filled with boomers who create road blocks for the dumbest reasons and the management of the team is extremely toxic. My managers are telling me to stick it out for one more year while fully acknowledging that the work place is toxic, that i am not being given a good environment to thrive while also acknowledging how i am the best consultant in his team. 

They threw a few awards at me in townhalls and gave me a 5% annual raise however every other request for greater flexibility with regards to working remotely, and increase in pay have shot down. While they always say that i am a top performer and have a great future in the organization and that there is talk of creating a new role for me, they scramble for answers when i ask them for a development plan / mentorship program which would help me get to a higher leves.

Should i bail on this department and find something else or should i stick it out for another year ? "
7,2024-05-03,I was fired this morning. Likelihood of approval if filing for unemployment?,u/mreJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cjbqpg/i_was_fired_this_morning_likelihood_of_approval/,antiwork,"So, this company I've been with the past 9+ months has been in the process of merging 4 companies into one to service the US, which was recently completed, and then the transition into a (horribly outdated) software for everyone to be in sync service and billinh wise, took place 4/1, and the remaining on 5/1.

Note: I was with my previous employer for nearly 7 years and maybe knew of TWO people being outright fired. Occasionally you'd hear of the professional leave to a new company. Fast forward, this company who recently let me go, I've seen between 5-10 people abruptly quit or be fired during my tenure, as if mgmt. does not want to retain staff at all. It was a mess.

Anyhow, I've been struggling the past two months+ and working a lot of hours from home as I was salary and felt obligated to keep up. Trying to keep my customer account flowing and happy with what tools and resources I had, while training CSRs and supervising them. (I was struggling because my first CSR put in notice and got the heck out of Dodge before the software merge mess occurred. Here come 2 replacement CSRs I had to train and guide the last two months. Mind you, I'm an account manager. I still do not understand why they have account managers training and supervising CSRs. I voiced my concerns about this.)

**Is filing for unemployment valid for me to do and likely to succeed? My manager and her boss never wrote me up for anything. I never received an actual disciplinary action made for failing to do something on time.**

Humorous part, when my ""manager"" (laughable) and HR let me go this morning, I asked if they have a list of reasons behind the decision, and my manager looked to HR for an explanation as if she would know! HR has no involvement in my daily activities. Like....you're my boss...didnt you base this off some actual situations to cite and boot me? Anyhow, HR who is a nice lady just said it was performance based, and I'm thinking sarcastically no shit?! I could give you plenty of reasons why performance may have been impacted.

Lol, at one point months ago my manager had two temps show up a week or two apart from one another and I had to train them on random shit with no heads up or anything. Situation was like, ""here ya go, surprise! drop what you're doing and try to get these this temp  stuff to do."" Wtf?! I swear when I told her there is a second temp here a week or two later, she was shocked as if she didn't even know either. So, I trained one, just to do it all over again a second time with another one to have them help us for like 3-4 weeks tops. So nuts!

Meh, I hate if this all sounds bitter, because I'm not. I was so relieved and happy they terminated me, but just feel bad for all of my team that is still there to suffer even more without me. They fired 1 of my 2 CSRs yesterday at 4 o'clock and she had only been there nearly 2 months! Like damnit, she was finally working on her own, meshing with the other CSR who started with her, and not asking too many questions from me!

TLDR - I need to craft the perfect text response to a low-ball offer sent to me via text. 

So all in all they rejected my first offer and is now offering a new one at $1 less, which is the ""highest we can go"" offer. I now want to rescind my original offer with a new one that's even higher.

I am absolutely not going to give in to their current offer.

We also just had our yearly bonuses delayed despite hitting our numbers. I'm not sure the company is doing well, and we're living in the unknown that a new dept. head could come in and blow up everything that remains at any moment.

Today a random coworker, not on my team or one I've ever met in person, messaged me to ask what I was thinking liking a competitor's LinkedIn post. I tend to appreciate good content no matter who it's from. I don't think one like is making or breaking their company. I tried to answer lightly but he kept complaining, so I let him know my personal LinkedIn wasn't his business and unfriended him.

17,2024-05-03,Are you being misclassified as an independent contractor?,u/Expensive-Sundae-859,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cjhj8a/are_you_being_misclassified_as_an_independent/,antiwork,"I made a post months ago complaining about my job and through some very supportive people in the comments (thank you!) discovered I was being misclassified as an independent contractor and I was actually an employee.

I recently just came across another post where someone else is also probably being misclassified so I wanted to make a post about some things I‚Äôve learned so hopefully you don‚Äôt get taken advantage of. *Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this only applies to US residents.*

1. Companies do not get to decide whether or not you are their employee. The relationship you have with the company determines whether or not you are an employee. 
2. If you are an employee, even if they said you‚Äôre not, you are still protected by employment laws. This includes wage laws, wrongful termination laws, taxation laws, etc. If you talk to your employer about being misclassified, they cannot legally fire you for bringing up those concerns. They also cannot legally fire you for talking to your coworkers about being misclassified (or talking about wages for that matter). Just because it‚Äôs not legal doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt fire you though, so be careful and make decisions that are right for you and your situation.
3. There is no set rule that determines your employment status, but it does depend on the ‚Äúeconomic reality‚Äù of your relationship to your employer. You have to be economically independent of the company to be an independent contractor. So, are you truly independent from the company? Are you able to service other clients outside of the company? How much freedom do you actually have to do the work? Who sets your schedule? Who sets your pay rate? Who is paying for the equipment you use? Are you providing work for the company that is core to their business mission? How you answer a variety of these questions will determine your employment status. If you‚Äôre questioning it, talk to the DOL, IRS or a licensed employment lawyer. But I can say that just being able to set your own schedule is not enough to qualify you as a contractor. What your pay is based on (hourly, salary, commission) also does not solely determine your employment status.
4. If you are being misclassified, keep track of your hours (all hours worked for the company, not just the ones they deem ‚Äúbillable‚Äù) and make sure you‚Äôre being paid minimum wage and overtime. If you‚Äôre not, you can have the DOL file a claim against the company so you can get your wages or you can contact an attorney. 

If you think you‚Äôre being misclassified, my advice would be to find an employment lawyer in your state and set up a consultation call. Most of them will do it for free for these kinds of cases.  They‚Äôll be able to tell you whether or not they think you‚Äôre being misclassified and what you can do about it. Sometimes you‚Äôll be able to get lost wages/benefits. Either way, you can always report the company to the DOL and IRS if you‚Äôre feeling froggy.

I hope this was helpful! Don‚Äôt let them take advantage of you."

Little background: I'm a salaried engineer, and I have a strong sense of fairness in the workplace, i.e., I'm a great employee, but I WILL point out when management is being stupid. I never tracked my time at this job, since we never billed hours. I've always been pretty flexible in work-time, working my full time, but knowing I'm salaried and nobody's work depends on me being at my desk at a specific time. So when I was working in an office, I may come in anywhere from 630-9, and leave anywhere from 5-8. 

Our management somehow got it in their heads that the salaried employees weren't working full time, so they put in a fucking old-school paper-punch-card timeclock. Whatever, it's stupid, but I know I put in my time, so, whatever. After 2 weeks, I got called into the CEOs office to speak with him and my boss. They had noticed that I rarely started at 8 (which had never been a stated requirement). I asked why it was a problem, and after a lot of discussion,  it really just boiled down to, 'We want you in here, ready to work, at exactly 8.'

Ok! Yessir! Can do!

So...I started coming in and clocking at EXACTLY 8:00. I never did any work before 8, even if I happened to beat traffic and get in early. I'd read a book until it was time to clock in. But that's not all. 

I also talked to the other salaried employees about this, and a number of them had similar conversations. I made the case that if they want us in at exactly 8, the other side of that is that we clock out at exactly 5. No more unpaid overtime from anyone. It was a small company, only ~20 salaried positions. But we ALL were on board. 

My CEO asked me about it in the hallway a couple weeks later. He said they'd noticed that everyone was working less hours, and asked me if everything was alright. I gave him a huge smile, and said, 'Yeah! Ever since we've been asked to start coming in at 8, we all started leaving right at 5. It's been a great change for everyone!'

No lie, that fucker sent out a company-wide email not 20 minutes later saying they were getting rid of the time clock and that we all needed to make sure we're working full time. 

I quit about a week later. I had already been looking.

19,2024-05-03,How Anti Workers Beat Management,u/Shovernor,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cjib0i/how_anti_workers_beat_management/,antiwork,"
I have a fun anti work story for all of you. Im gonna keep this super general cause I almost ruined it for the employees while I was there and I don‚Äôt want to ruin it for them now that I‚Äôve left. 

I used to work at an employer that had VERY high production standards. Definitely an 80 hour a week job. It was exciting and high profile so I loved it but then I had kids and needed more family time. A friend recommended a certain employer. We‚Äôll call employer B.

Now some important background about my old branch at Employer B is their management structure. First level management is far removed from the work we do. They look at numbers only and have very little interaction with us except for a once a month all team meeting.  Team leads, who are senior team members that are effectively unpaid first level managers handle all of the work review and assignment of work. There are about 120 front line employees doing my job or similar in this branch of the employer. About 16 of those are team leads and my team had about 12 on it.  Then we have 8 or so managers. 

When I started at Employer B I still had my crazy work ethic.  So I come in for my first week. I complete the orientation and training videos and then I‚Äôm given my first assignment. I finish it in about 4 hours and I email my lead what I should do next.  No response. Another email a day later. I‚Äôm just sitting in my office at this point watching esports on YouTube and getting increasingly anxious because I‚Äôm not getting work. I start documenting my attempts to get work in case they are trying to fire me. I continue emailing. etc. nothing. 

Eventually, my lead comes in super relaxed one day and says, ‚ÄúShovernor, it‚Äôs your first month. just take it easy while it‚Äôs slow and don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù  Ok sure. 

Then covid hits and we are sent to work remotely. I continue not having any assignments or maybe one or two. Working just a couple hours a week but I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs the chaos of Covid. Over the course of the first year I complete 32 of these assignments and work maybe 4-8 hours a week. I don‚Äôt know ANYONE in the office so I can‚Äôt approach someone and subtlety ask if this is normal. Im super scared they are gonna fire me. 

My manager does my annual review and this is one of the few times I‚Äôve spoken to her. She said great work and that my productivity was right at average level (this level is average? Odd but I didnt think much of it.)  Well, that‚Äôs no good I think to myself, I‚Äôm a go getter and I want to excel.  I ask her what the highest was and she said 44. 

So now I‚Äôm actively pulling assignments for myself because I want to beat that and get promoted and I have no chill. So in the first 6 months after my review I bang out 51 assignments. And still working maybe 20 hours a week.

This starts me thinking. What the hell is everyone else doing. Each of these assignments takes 4‚Äì6 hours tops and people are hardly producing anything. I kind of hint that I‚Äôm kicking ass compared to the numbers at a requested one on one with my real manager and she says a lot of these are harder than what you‚Äôre doing and take more time. 

So I double down. In my specific area there are about 300 assignments per year for about 12 people. I pulled another 50 and finished them without breaking a sweat. I did fully 1/3 of our teams work (I‚Äôm not complaining, it was so easy I don‚Äôt care). Still same response, some are harder than others. 

Now I start paying attention at meetings.  Every single person in my group is complaining about our workload. I thought they were just whiney but manager IS BUYING IT. She keeps promising new hires and then they hire more!!!

Wtf is going on?  Are these people lazy? Idiots? Both?  I start going back to the office and trying to bring it up with my team mates who are all ‚Äúslammed with work‚Äù and get weird looks that are making me uncomfortable. 

I feel like I‚Äôm being gaslit here. Eventually a really good opportunity comes up at a different employer. As much as it pained me to leave a job where I didn‚Äôt have to do much, my profession is one of those that if I don‚Äôt practice my skills I‚Äôm screwed. So I left. 

A few months later my lead calls me to gossip because there had been some juicy stuff with upper management.  Since I‚Äôm no longer there I finally say it straight out. ‚ÄúNancy, am I going crazy?  Are people really bad at this or lazy or what?  I never worked more than 20 hours on a bad week.‚Äù

And she laughs and says, ‚Äúyeah we have management thoroughly convinced our job is really hard because they‚Äôve never bothered to do it themselves. We keep complaining to keep the illusion up but we are all doing nothing and totally chill about it.‚Äù

I was being gaslit!!!!  Never have I seen a large group of people so united.  Completely amazing, brilliant, group of people. I can‚Äôt believe I thought they were idiots! And I almost blew it!

I don't understand how anyone can live all day knowing there's no money for retirement and that you'll be working the rest of my life just to get by. Ulcers, depression, disabling back pain, bunions, carpal tunnel. All this is from working and we're not getting ahead! Every time we get some money put away, something happens and we need it. Insurance keeps going up and with personal property taxes, I'm not sure we can afford to keep the things we have. And it's not much. Most of what we have is for working. 

I've always believed that if I keep putting one foot in front of the other and work hard that I'll somehow be rewarded. But I'm done with that notion and am ready to give up and get out. It simply cannot be more work to live off grid and haul water from the creek or whatever. At least I'd know I can feed us with a garden and a little livestock. 

I just don't get it. We are making what I thought should be enough money. We don't spend on ANYTHING unnecessary. Our vacations have been camping trips the last several years because we haven't been able to afford anything more and you NEED a vacation when you work like this. We save anything usable, repair instead of replace, have chickens and a garden and a pond to fish to supplement groceries. I've found cheaper alternatives for almost everything but we're still broke? 

I just can't be positive anymore. "

I work in a tiny company of three (my ""boss, my coworker and I).

Its a company whith a lot of turnover, workers staying only one year usually an ""boss"" decided some years ago to expand because we were willing to stay and she didn't have to worry every year for the next year staff.

Everything was fine until two years ago when said ""boss"" decided she can't stand my coworker and to start bitching regularly about my coworker or insult her.

Coworker failed to sleep at night, anxious about it and broke in tears in front of me a couple of times. In fact, one time she didn't answered phone calls and SMS, I started to fear she might have attempted to kill herself.

Until new year's eve, my coworker wasn't yet sure to stay or to leave and was awaiting to see if ""boss"" will grow up and acquire some maturity.

It didn't happen and coworker decided to resign. I convinced her to warn ""boss"" about her decision early and not to wait last minute, just so to ensure ""boss"" will not get anymore mad about her and won't be tempted to make moves to ruin her career after, by bullying her or spreading rumors to make her unemployable.

I thought I might risk to have my ""boss"" bitching more but that it might be worth it if said coworker was safe.

Holy s\*\*t !

I just have 40 minutes of my boss bitching and yelling at me and insulting me and calling me dumb and getting paranoid and I just have a phone call of her forbiding me to communicate with coworker, my friend, anymore !

Just because I speak to coworker while ""boss"" said previously that I must keep on talking to her as before to not make her uncomfortable.

To make you laugh :

* she's complaining that she hates my coworker because cocorker hates her while in fact she started hating her 2 years ago and this is why coworker leave (who, by the way, just doesn't to think about her and is just counting the days remaining before the end of her contract)
* she started last week to be afraid we might record her for my coworker and potentual trial while we took care since last october to not speak to loudly in office when ""boss"" wasn't here and to not leave SMS talking about our attempts to manage ""boss"" because we didn't trust her and we fear she might have try to hid mics 'I know she already have gone through my jacket's pockets before)
* she's bitching my coorker ""is the devil"" trying to ""destroy our company and our ""friendship"" (between ""boss"" and I)"" while said coworker just want to save her mental health and is really my friend while I hardly handle ""boss""
* she's trying to convince me coworker try to manipulate me to leave while we don't speak of work after work hours and coworker hesitated to leave because I said to her I dont want to be left alone with ""boss"" and while ""bos"" clearly try to influence me by telling me what to think and that, smart as I am, I just can't think otherwise
* she's regularly telling about it's not a question about her but about company while she didn't give a f\*\*k about efforts made by coworker for company even outside of work hours but had a doubt about coworker's state of mind when coworker gave her a birthday present
* she's been complaining she didn't sleep last week while coworker decided to leave because she broke in tears regularly for months
* she said she wasn't sure I was willing to stay while I didn't even thought of leaving before (being far too coward to get unemployed) but I must admit that I start pondering the idea when I am being asked the same question at least once EVERY F\*\*\*\*\*G DAY and I am insulted

-she wondered in front of me 2 times if coworker was leaving because she couldn't stand ""boss"" anymore but, as I guessed then, it was just at a subconscious level and she said it not to know the truth but only for me to say ""of course no""

I have many more to say about ""boss"" but I can't resolve to disturb you anymore so I'll just stick to the core of the crrent problem : I have until last day of June to stand this situation and to manage to protect coworker from ""boss"""

I wish it was easier to mentally opt out of the bullshit. I wish my boss didn‚Äôt treat it all as life or death. If I take a walk outside or leave my cubicle my boss will message me asking where I am or even call me. Feels like I can never relax. Have to cc my boss on every tiny thing. It‚Äôs just embarrassing.

Almost hate my free time because it‚Äôs just more time to obsess over my dumb job. Don‚Äôt want to do my hobbies, workout, or socialize. It‚Äôs like you get a few hours and then it will start up all over again whether you like it or not. And if my boss if unhappy with me I feel worthless.

I didn't think that references would be a sticking point when I've literally already been offered the job. It's being handled by a whole outside service and I have no idea what to do. I have no one professional or otherwise to list.

It was a good place to work and I learned a lot, but left after a year to move into commercial HVAC to continue earning and learning. They were willing to give me a substantial raise but not enough to pause my career growth.

They‚Äôre offering $33.50/hour for my old position, it‚Äôs been almost 4 months since I left and they still can‚Äôt find anyone! I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs unreasonable - I‚Äôm surprised they haven‚Äôt found anyone - but given how much they‚Äôre paying HVAC contractors, it makes SO much financial sense to just offer $38-40/hour.

After leaving, I created an LLC and got some business insurance so now they‚Äôre contracting some of their HVAC work out to me! I just have to beat their main HVAC contractor who charges $90/hour, so I charge $75/hour (I know most companies don‚Äôt openly charge hourly, but this is a close friend of the community). I do about 10-15 hours of work here a week, so if you do the math, they‚Äôre now paying me about the same as my old 40 hour work week for 15 hours of work! And I can‚Äôt even keep up with all of their HVAC work since I can only work on weekends and week nights after my traditional job, so they also pay their other HVAC contractor to help keep up.

With summer just around the corner, they really need to up their pay so they can find someone even though my wallet really likes the current situation lol but even once they do find someone, unless they‚Äôre willing to work significant overtime, I will still have work ready for me here

Why do they do this to themselves?

Some of them I have said while in the process of quitting, but I'm looking for stuff you said to your boss and kept your job.

I was working in a rent to own company, and while I was in the middle of whatever task I was doing, my store manager came over and asked me to do something. 

I looked him dead in the eye and told him ""you're not the boss of me""

He responded with ""oh, right, sorry"" and then he walked away!

I couldn't believe that that had worked! He didn't ask me to do anything else all day. The next day, I was in the middle of doing something, and he came over and asked me to do something else for him. I tried it again. ""Oh, right, sorr--hey, wait a minute... I am literally your boss!""

I then burst out laughing ""I almost had you again! I was wondering how many times that was going to work!""

I guess one is the magic number."

At the end of today's weekly meeting, my manager, who oversees the department's broader accounting department announced that a 3rd party contractor in India will be taking over the company's financial accounting day-to-day. Both me and my colleague were shocked because this came out of nowhere.

Of course my first question was what would happen to us. He explained that we would transition to another specialty (Auditing, Forensic, etc). At least that gave me some comfort in knowing that my job was still safe for the time being. Starting next month, I'll be tasked with training the 6 new contractors from India.

Now that I have had the time to process what just happened at the meeting today, I was wondering what everyone thinks. Would you start looking for another job if you were me? I also feel disrespected that this happened."

3,2024-05-03,I (25F) got fired from a job that I loved suddenly,u/Particular-Poet3750,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cjpnjl/i_25f_got_fired_from_a_job_that_i_loved_suddenly/,antiwork,"So just for some context, last summer I applied to work at this locally owned private gym that specifically caters towards athletes. 
I got an interview and the job sounded great. It was a position as an assistant coach who would help out around the gym with kids and team training. I was promised free education, training, ect. I had told them I did not have any former experience working in any similar environment, and I also was not knowledgeable about sports, however I am passionate about lifting and want to pursue a career in personal training. 
After my interview, they responded to me that although they decided to hire someone else to fill the position, they would hire me as an unpaid intern to see how the environment was for me and if I was fit to work there. They did not disclose how long the unpaid internship would last. I interned there for about 2 months before they decided to hire me for the position. One of the owners was my coach on the sidelines, training me for powerlifting.
In September, I started working there every single day except sundays. I did not take any days off unless I was seriously sick. 
Although it was difficult at first I started getting comfortable with my performance and abilities. 
The two owners would have monthly coaches meetings to discuss with the employees expectations as well as check in with us to see how we were doing. They would also do monthly one on one meetings individually with employees. 
Leading up to this, it had been mentioned in the past team meeting that they wanted us all to start working more on developing technical coaching skills. My one on one meeting last month seemed to go fine, although I had been getting bad luck and getting sick I had to call in sick a couple times to which they spoke to me about and said I was an important part of the team and they couldn't keep picking up the slack if I kept calling in sick.(which I believe I only did like, 3 times)  I don't doubt that they mentioned me working on developing technical skills, but I don't remember it having any sense of urgency. 
Now before I continue I wanted to bring back the fact that they had promised free education. This ""education"" was Crash Course videos on YouTube followed by a quick worksheet. They did not ever assign me any work on technical coaching besides send the occasional coaching podcast. 
Often, after working, we would have a short meeting to discuss how the shift went and most of the time my boss said it went well and that he had nothing to say about it and we would go home. 
I got along well with all my coworkers, and never had any sort of conflict with them. The clients seemed to like me and enjoy talking with me. 
Last Friday, I came into work for my monthly one on one meeting. They had my stuff set aside and I immediately knew something was happening and sure enough, they handed me a termination letter and told me that my technical skills and group management skills were just not developing enough for them to keep me on the team. I broke down and cried in front of them, asking if there was anything I could do to fix it, and if I could have one more chance as I really loved the job. They firmly said no, and I took my leave. 

I am suspicious, however, because they had an unpaid intern working there for MONTHS. Like almost the entire duration of me being employed there, they had this poor kid working without pay and did not disclose when he would start to be paid for his work. 
Recently, he excitedly told me that he was finally getting paid. Shortly after, my boss bought out the rest of the building to expand the gym. (they shared a building with another company) 
It seems to me as if they needed extra money for renovations and decided the newer intern was a better fit for the job than I was. 
I emailed them asking if they would kindly be a reference for me when I search for jobs within the industry, and after a week, they responded basically (in a more professional manner) that they would, but it may or may not be a good reference. 

Am I wrong to be hurt by this? Am I wrong to think that they did me dirty? I'm so confused at how sudden it was. 
And now I am thinking about how they used me and my coworker who is 17 for free labor, made empty promises, and failed to properly train me and then blame my termination on my technical skills... üôÉ "

I emailed in the morning I made the decision, and my supervisor asked how my workload would be handled while I was out. I didn't respond, but instead answered the other questions about what PTO I would be using for the extermination period until my short term disability takes effect, etc. My first day of leave was April 18th. Today I got an email with a written warning, outlying a number of grievances (most of which were management caused), including things that didn't fall apart until after I was already out.

I, who happened to be the only woman and gay, was constantly getting talked about, lied about, and treated poorly by some coworkers and the supervisor. I went to HR on multiple occasions trying to get the behavior to stop, but HR would not do anything about it. After it started affecting my physical health, I finally left that job and took a couple months off before getting my current job. I have been at this job since January, and although I don‚Äôt enjoy the type of work, industrial quality lab tech, my coworkers and supervisors are great. I was not planning on staying at this job long term, just until I found a job I really would enjoy. They have been interviewing for a quality control manager position, which would be my boss, for a few months now.

When I got into work today, night shift, my coworkers and supervisor immediately came to me and told me they offered the QC manager position to my old supervisor. 

Hearing that was like being hit by a bus. They know that the reason I left my old job was in part because of her, but I have not told them any details. She had been in that position at my old job for years, with the company for 30+ years. Apparently she had been demoted from her old position, which needed to have happened a long time ago, so she is leaving them. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Part of me wants to just leave this job to not have to be around her again, but I don‚Äôt want to leave without having something else lined up.

Also: The higher ups knew I left my last company for personal reasons and had an idea she was part of the reason, so they told the people at work today to tell me she was going to be hired for that QC Manager position. 

-I don‚Äôt live in a small town, so the odds of this happening were low.

TL,DR: The supervisor who bullied me out of my last job just got hired to be my new manager at my new job. "

I just received a business plan stating myself as the sole reason people work 18hr shifts because I cannot change my shift or am flexible enough. 

I asked to stick to these shifts originally and have done so successfully. But now they want me off them. The shifts still need covered but now everyone is to take turns doing them.  It was never contractually changed and so I now have to fight it. 

I‚Äôm shocked to find they have people working 18hr shifts. It‚Äôs not constant work and is more when someone shouts for help we need to log in and fix the machine. But to be ready 1pm until 7am seems excessive and also not my fault.  And quite frankly dangerous. 

I put in for flexible working to keep my shifts as it needs covered and is a business requirement. They just need more staff to get people off 18hr shifts. As it doesn‚Äôt look to change by putting me on day shift as someone still has to carry out the night shift leaving it in no better state. 

The business plan is like Swiss cheese. Stating factually I am the reason for these horrible shifts and then showing another night shift person not changing shifts and being untouched in these changes. Then to give an example of the rota and showing night shift work during the week being 60hrs a week. 

Not sure whether to laugh or contact acas.  They have no clue. 

I am waiting on a response to my flexible working but at this point want to make them aware of 18hr shifts being dangerous for the customer standing by these machines on the other end."

My boss has also 'suggested I seek assistance from occupational health ' because she has decided that ' I am stressed which could makee ill' which is absolute crap. I've had stress in the past and I know how bad it can get, this is not a stressful job. Gaslighting springs to mind. My boss is usually a lovely person but at a meeting with HR she mentioned it and HR suggested it. Long story short, I get pulled in for appraisal, all good apart from that. I'm rarely late, 95% of the time actually early because I like to beat the traffic. Do my above and beyond stuff, obey the rules and there's a lot of rules and am also always available. When I mentioned how serious this was (off the record) she made out like it was no big deal and they weren't trying to fire me. Trouble is I do a lot of research and have a lot more experience in other fields that my company doesn't know about, I just didn't tell them at interview. Bearing in mind I've been there less than two years, its a team of less than ten people and in that time four people have gone, two of my colleagues are also at the end of their tether and looking for something else. After my appraisal and that nice little bombshell I ended up with a job offer two weeks later but didn't take it, I didn't like the setup, very little H&S and an accident waiting to happen but it made me realise that my previous skills are required and I could make at least 15k more. Now I have a lot of shit going on at home again and about four months until my next appraisal when they could make it 'formal' if they actually want me out. By then I know at least one will be gone, they're applying for loads of jobs so I don't want to be going right when they're short staffed. But I know my time is limited there one way in or another. I don't particularly want to be working 'for' someone anymore again either. I don't fit in because I'm older pale male, less academically qualified, I find it difficult to take on bullshit without being a bit gobby but I have a shit ton of experience in other fields and took the job as 'something I could genuinely enjoy doing' the pay isn't great but it is local and more often than not a nice environment. However I've seen a darker side that has got me on the job search again. As I lay here watching the clouds go by the window Im thankful I'm not having to work weekends anymore and may have a load more time to plan other ventures and maybe time to study once home shit has blown over a bit."

A company approached me, I didn‚Äôt approach them. It didn‚Äôt excite me at all and after the preliminary interview I decided not to pursue it anymore and didn‚Äôt send in any of the documents they were asking for to continue the process. This was a couple of months ago.

Fast forward to today and I get a call from the boss of the place that they noticed they didn‚Äôt have any of the materials for my profile and wanted to know why. I was shocked since I assumed that I was already eliminated based on my refusal to send the documents months ago and stops contacting the recruiter. 

I decided(stupidly) to call back the boss who called me since I wanted to do so in good faith and possibly remain on cordial terms. However I was apprehensive. He asked why I didn‚Äôt send in the materials and I told him my circumstances at the time did not allow me to submit by the deadline given, therefore I didn‚Äôt submit after the deadline either. 

He kept insisting that ‚Äúthat can‚Äôt be all it was, what is it‚Äù, ‚Äúwas there something wrong with recruiting.‚Äù He kept being pushy and I told him the truth that I didn‚Äôt submit in time and I didn‚Äôt feel like the role was a good fit for me. I said I know that other candidates would be better for the position and I‚Äôm not familiar enough with their concept. 

The boss told me it didn‚Äôt matter what I thought and that I was making up my ‚Äúexcuses‚Äù and that he wished my name never landed on his desk. He then proceeded to say I was a ‚Äúwasted talent‚Äù and that I should be ‚Äúbegging for this opportunity‚Äù. After some more back and forth he said he‚Äôs putting me on a black list and no one will ever call me again for jobs in that sector. Then he listed all the affiliates he has and how I will never be able to work with any of them. Then he hung up. "

The reality is, with every decade that passes, we get exploited a bit more, so they can suck on our marrow a bit more.

We put up with it. It was a very bad deal for us, but we made it work.

Now we lose more than we gain.

And it's just not worth it, being THAT exploited.

Nobody wants to work anymore can simply be understood as - we got nothing left for you to take. There's no more surplus value to be exploited from the working class. You ve squeezed it dry. This is it.

‚ÄúIf I have one more ‚Äúpizza party‚Äù I‚Äôll murder someone‚Äù

Etc

In a world where the hardest workers are earning the worst and making the high earners look good, we are also the ones in charge of the lost property. As testament to how overpaid some people are, it always astounds me the amount of electronics that end up in lost and found.

Unique to my company, we have it set in stone, in writing, that if an item isn‚Äôt claimed within a month, it gets ‚Äúthrown away‚Äù we post every month, to everyone in the company what has been found, and then, we all gather round a wheel, with all members of my teams name on it, spin it, and whosever name it lands on gets said item.

I feel guilty, but I also have walked away with AirPods, public transport travel cards, and Bose headphones. 

I know that I work for children, or at least children with degrees, who earn way!!!! More than I ever will, but while I have to save ages for my stuff, they can buy it back in a heartbeat, I mean I don‚Äôt want them to write their names on their items, but it would make it som much easier, and have less guilt. If it was me, shoe on the other foot, if I lost something, iPhone, headphones, wallet etc, the world comes crashing to a halt, priority number one until I find it, it just amazes me, that no one claims these expensive items.

I had finally had enough and put in my 2 week notice. I was heading to a different job (different sector even) even if for the same crap pay, I wanted out. 

I had mentally clocked out well before my 2 week notice, but I was now doing less than the bare minimum during it.

I was saying bye to a few good people when my manager and an upper manager came out of their office screaming about how I would amount to nothing, I was what is wrong with people today, the upper managers face turned beet red in his rage. 

It didn't bother me at all. Seeing others workers befuddled was funny. Why is this guy screaming, everyone knew it was my last day for 2 weeks?  I smiled and made my exit quicker. Everyone saw this crazy from an upper manager and I knew I won."

But obviously this isn't what this is about.

Back in the beginning of April I ended up finding out a friend of mine unalived himself which, after given substantial information, it is believed that he didn't even mean to. During that time frame I was working for a local company Tuesday Wednesday thrusday 11am to 9pm doing deliveries for them. 

I reconnected with My buddy's gf(which makes this even worse because I haven't actually spoken to him or her since November because there was this huge fight and both parties refused to talked to eachother) and while in a state of shock and grief we have helped each other alot. The Monday night before I was supposed to work, I received a message letting me know when the funeral was going be at 9pm that might, which happened to be the next day at 4 to 6. As soon as I found when it was Imediately messaged my boss and told him, even offering to work atleast half the day. Let me also state that i told him i refuse to miss the funeral. I received no response, and even into the next day I still receive no response as I'm working.

That Tuesday I'm doing my job as normal and at around 1230ish 1ish after not receiving a response all day, I sent my boss a text message stating basically along the lines of ""I don't know what's going on but I'm letting you know that once I go pick my son up from school that's it for me for the day"". That sure as fuck got his attention.

He calls me maybe 10 minutes later completely bugging the fuck out on me telling me I was being unprofessional and that he's sick of his employees treating this job not like a real job amongst other things. After about 5 minutes of him just going off on me and not letting me get a word in he hangs up on me. Right then and there I was ready to quit, I felt highly disrespected, which would've been a completely different sentiment if he just called and talked to me, or ya know answering me that morning so we would have a plan set in place. 

I also wanna clarify, that I never try to leave work or anything without having a plan in place first, just how I am, I used to be a manager at gamestop, guess it's just a habit I never truely lost. But here's the thing, because of that mindset the thrusday before this incident, I completely wasn't there for my SO when she was brought to the hospital for both a miscarriage and a cyst bursting in her cervix. I wasn't able to find a correct person to keep an eye on my kids and you know be there for her during that hard time. The other driver kept dodging me all the way and it was a mess. So I got to spend the whole time with my SO in the hospital at an underpaid job because everyone refused to help me. 

Back onto the story, 2 of my coworkers when I told them what was going on was told me to just calm down and let my boss calm down because he normally isn't like that. So I tried that, I kept working like I would. TILL I received a message from him telling me the following:

""Well I can't find anyone this late I already try a few people.  So you might have to go and come back to work brother this last minute shit is unacceptable going forward if I don't know shit at least 2-3 days in advance then consider it a NO unless is an emergency with your immediate family like your girl last week.  You let me know what you want to do.""

That's what completely made me finally say fuck it. I tried to explain to him, I wasn't TRYING to do anything last minute, I told him as soon as I found out and the way he went about sending this message to me rubbed me the wrong way. What's even more fucked up is, if approached a different way, like without the phonecall earlier, I would've did this no problem. But his mannerisms and his attitude towards the situation really bothered me and again I felt disrespected. I tried to convey convey how I felt and received this in response:

""Yes this is a last minute stuff. if you were working at GameStop and you were the manager you couldn't just close the store and go to your friends funeral. "" 

Which finally was the last straw, your incompetence to running a business isn't my problem so I responded with this: 

""You haven't had anyone kill themselves have you? Specially someone you were really close with? That's what happened, he was my brother and I absolutely refuse to miss his funeral. I told you when I found out, that's all I could do, and as for your statement about gameatop, here's the thing when I was at gamestop IT was my job to find the coverage which i did time and time again. The amount of funerals and other such things I dealt with I found the coverage needed to be able to do what I needed to do cause it was my job. I'll be honest,, I like you as a person, you've been nothing but chill to me since we've met and I've never had any issues with you, but I don't think this job is for me. I already paid you for the food I owe you, and effective immediately, I terminate my status as an employee with you. I appreciate everything you have done for me and I won't forget my time within yiur business. Thank you.""

Inwhich all I received was: 

""Ok. I see how it is.  No prob.""

I WORKED AS A BOSS, and I had employees who would do anything for me because I was sympathetic towards whatever situation they brought to me and I helped them out and in return they helped me back, which is how it should be, he don't know how to be a leader or keep his business running the way it should and a lone driver isn't going to break everything, specially when you have someone, WHOSE AT THE RESTURANT AT THAT EXACT MOMENT, who can cover for me. I cashed out went home and the very next day I had a different job at a different pizzeria making the same amount if money, working 4 days a week 11 to 5.

I don't dread my shifts because I ain't there all damn day, not allowed to eat, amongst other things and if something happens they give me the time I need to figure out what I need to figure out and guess what? In return I will stay longer as my time allows and they don't just expect me to do what they say. Plus they have proper coverage! It's been great all things considered.


Fast forward to 2 weeks after I quit and things have kinda settled I'm enjoying my day off from work and I get a call from one of my old coworkers asking me if I can cover that day for them because the other driver just had a heart attack. What's funny is I was actually willing to do it but my SO was out and I had my kids so o had to wait till she came back before I could do anything. Which I said that to them. My old coworker was understanding and outta curiosity I asked him if the boss knew he was calling me and he responded telling me that it was the boss idea. The day after, one of the other guys that helps run the place basically then tried to guilt trip me into covering for the other driver till he could come back to work which I didn't exactly shut down but I was playing stupid.

They tried to talk this big game that there's someone to always replace a drivers spot but when push come to shove, they still don't have me replaced and only have fill ins till they can find a permanent driver, even going as far as to have one the kitchen staff driving only paying him the money from deliveries instead of his normal wage. Last I heard that same kitchen staff is currently on suspension cause he had a meltdown and trashed the restaurant. 

I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna day the whole situation was all the boss fault because the way I handled it I feel like I could've did 20 tines better, but also given the fact that I was grieving a friend who unfortunately I never got to reconcile with before he died, I don't think I could've handled it any other way. So yeah, that's my story of the last month.


TLDR: Quit my old job because boss was a dick about my friend committing suicide and now they're trying to be slick to get me back. "

Last year before winter a landscaper came to the property I managed and I befriended him. Early this year he reached out to me to see if I would be interested in helping him for the season. At this point I was really stressed about finding my own jobs plus some personal life things, I decided to take the job for the sake of not needing to worry about any of the ""business"" aspects of the work I do. 

The first month was pretty great to be honest, I love the work and I even got my friend a job who has always had difficulty with employers. BUT there have been random ""red flags"". I always thought he was just a little out there, but as soon as my friend started he started acting weird immediately, he insinuated that my friend put a PILL IN HIS COFFEE on his first day (I've been best friends with this guy since childhood and he would never do that. Also what?), there have been times my friend and I would be talking and laughing and he'd get weird then ask if we were talking about him, he has insinuated that he pays me too much (I make significantly less than normal but settled for consistency). The list could go in but I didn't really think too hard about it.

So this is why I'm here. Last week all of those ""quirky"" things quickly became red flags, my ex wife went to the ER during the weekend and I texted my boss that I needed Monday off to figure what was going on with my son's care (keep in mind I never have called out, I stay late, I'm on time). My friend couldn't go in because I'm his ride. On Tuesday when we went in this dude was hounding me about my ex wife's situation. He didn't believe it at all and I'd set boundaries to not yell him the full story because I DON'T HAVE TO. He then made a comment about how fast he did the day my friend and I were off work, after the fourth time of him bringing it up I said ""well at that point do you even need helpers?"" And he said no and proceeded to go in about how he can find people who want to work. At the end of the day after asking me invasive questions about my ex wife he then told me that he felt like my friend and I were conspiring against him. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY WE WOULD DO THAT.

So I already have work lined up, I have a great reputation with what I do and I don't need this job, I just wanted it and I feel like this guy doesn't realize that. I have a few people I've done work with who have called me back. I want to just leave especially after the comment of finding people who want to work (That's a solid no when people say that). But I'm afraid if I quit he will fire my friend and I don't want to then have my friend stuck with no job last minute. I've reached out to people to see if I can get him some work but nothing concrete. 

Thank you for letting me vent. "

They recently alluded to a man‚Äôs worth being defined by his job (not his work, labor, vocation, or life mission, ‚Äúhis job‚Äù), and stated that there were ‚Äúonly two things that mattered in life‚Äù: ‚Äúwork‚Äù, and then they got distracted and later completed their thought and added ‚Äúoh and family and faith too‚Äù. This individual never actually worked a day in their life and has coasted of privilege and bullshitting their entire life, I am disgusted.

It is beneath me to condemn this rhetoric, but I had to say something about it.

I quote:

Commited to a life of slavery
In the factories our own hands have built
Where we must work twice the graft
Before gaining the goods we've already slogged to create

To consume all things material
Stands above human compassion
As we compete with our fellow man
In the bid for a stronger position

In our ruthless search for prosperity
We become the tools of our own oppression
Forming the backbone of a society
That thrives on mass division

16,2024-05-04,New boss is always testing me,u/Visual_Bug_5392,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ck36x6/new_boss_is_always_testing_me/,antiwork,"So I got this new bitch ass boss 3 months ago‚Ä¶And within her 1st month she fired 2 people who were doing a good job but not enough to ‚Äòtake the company to the next level‚Äô‚Ä¶I work in marketing and she is goddamn out of her mind. 

I noticed she is always trying to make me feel stupid? It‚Äôs like she WANTS me to make mistakes‚Ä¶Here are some examples of the ‚Äòtests‚Äô she does: 

- She asked me why I wasn‚Äôt asking people when to send the newsletter when a new product comes out. As if it was my job to ask that around and it was my responsibility. It is not.

I told her it always used to be my boss who gave me the go, since the launching dates are always changing and my boss is supposed to know that info before me. She said ok. 

- She asked me to notify her when a newsletter is ready to be sent. I always do, and idk why this time she asked me that. I already did notify her, and I even sent her a screenshot to prove it. She apologized. 

- I was supposed to receive lists from one of our vendors, but I didn‚Äôt know what they were, like what type of contacts and if I had to create new lists or incorporate the contacts to existing lists. So I asked the vendor, and he didn‚Äôt know. 

She told me I should ALWAYS come to her for questions. Not other employees. Like wtf, if I need to ask someone a question, I don‚Äôt have to run everything by her.

Her micromanaging perfectionism is giving me so much stress, but I‚Äôm smart and when she criticizes me I always somehow have valid points, but her attitude is so TOXIC. 

I feel like she is out to get me, criticizing my every moves and I now do my job in fear. She is just a fucking ill-intended maniac. It sucks because I love the tasks but she is ruining it by trying to nitpick at everything I do. We are both smart girls, and I think she feels threatened by me and it‚Äôs so EXHAUSTING having to report to her every single fucking detail. I don‚Äôt want to quit, it‚Äôs a great job, but I have to endure her and idk how much more of scrutiny I can take.

She does not have my best interest at heart at all.

The best time to vote third party was 2016, and the second best time is right now. This election is already a wash, as it is clear that no matter who wins, we will continue to see the destruction of our world, our cultures and safety from imperialism.

If we hadn't fallen for the stupid Hillary campaign in 2016, then we would've had a wildly different election in 2020. Possibly, it could have been as different as both parties having to get their asses in gear and run real candidates.

The right thing to do for the interests of workers will always be framed as the wrong thing to do by the protectors of capitalism. That includes the TV, the democrats, and anybody who urges you to listen to messages from either.

The solution won't be televised or sponsored by any major news outlet. It will feel uncomfortable and uncertain to make change. Deeply enfranchised owners of capital will use their resources to make escape from their rule feel as unsafe as possible. You must realize this is an effort to scare people back into obeying their rule. We must resist. It will take strong, internal, personal resolve not to fall for the tricks and lies that will come as they attempt to frighten us back into line."

The admin of my department has a problem of sticking her nose where it doesn't belong. She will be at her desk and openly eves drops on a conversation from across the room. She has to put her two cents into every conversation that is being had in the office. This admin has called me on my work line saying, ""Hey so I was just listening in on this conversation and I think you should do XYZ"" I've only been here for ten months, but for some reason no one tells her anything, but only complain to each other about her. She can be pretty intimidating which I think is the main issue.

A couple of days ago, I asked the facilities manager to proof read an email I was about to send out which involved him. The admin said, ""He can't do that, let me do it."" I told her no thanks and that we've got it covered. For the next 30 seconds, she kept asking things like, ""But what is it?"" ""Does it concern me?"" ""What's it about?"" I kept saying that if it did concern her, I would let her know. I was physically blocking my screen while facilities read it. Once he walked away the admin said, ""I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that, it wasn't my place."" But she always does this. She'll butt in then apologize afterwards.

We have a policy of speaking with the person first, before speaking with a higher up. I have no problem telling her anything after this incident, because I made it very clear to her it was not her concern and she continued anyway. But she obviously knows what she is doing and I think it's time to bring it to her supervisor. 

What should I do? Should I talk to her first or tell the boss?

PS: If I were to tell her, I would say something like, ""You're very smart and your opinion is valuable. However, too many opinions can be overwhelming for some people. You know that not everything in this office is your concern and you don't need to worry yourself over everything you hear. You apologize a lot for your actions, but I am not seeing any change in behavior. That change means more than a ""seek forgiveness, not permission"" type of apology.

Hey folks,

I wanted to chat about something that's been on my mind lately. You know that feeling when you're between jobs or struggling to make ends meet? Society tends to slap the ""unemployed"" label on us, but honestly, that's just not the full picture.

We're not just sitting around, waiting for someone to throw us a bone. Nope, we're **striking**!

Think about it. Our work isn't just about earning a paycheck. It's about dignity, respect, and getting treated fairly. And if our jobs aren't cutting it in those departments, why should we stick around?

So instead of seeing ourselves as ""unemployed,"" let's recognize the power we have as workers. We're choosing not to settle for less than we deserve. We're standing up for ourselves and for each other.

Whether you're currently on the job or not, you're part of this movement. Every time you speak out against unfair treatment or advocate for better conditions, you're striking a blow against the status quo.

So, next time someone asks if you're unemployed, tell em the truth. You're not unemployed ‚Äì you're striking. I believe we *could* make a difference.

Peace"

44,2024-05-04,The U.S. labor market is shifting toward skilled labor as white-collar hiring slows,u/richardlentrup,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ckah49/the_us_labor_market_is_shifting_toward_skilled/,antiwork,"On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the latest monthly payroll data for the U.S. economy. Total employment rose by 175,000 in April. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.9% from 3.8% in March.

That came in below estimates of **240,000** jobs for April.

The softness in the jobs report was greeted with some positive reactions.¬†[Stock futures jumped](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)¬†after the news. Concerns about the U.S. economy have been focused on overheating ‚Äî whether¬†[inflation](https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/inflation-tracker-how-much-prices-rising-us-consumers-n1296378)¬†will continue to rise and force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher in an effort to¬†slow the economy and bring rising prices under control.

Jason Furman, who served as President Barack Obama's top economic advisor, said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that it was[¬†a ""goldilocks"" report](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-is-a-soft-landing/), showing an economy that could be headed to the soft landing of reasonable inflation and low unemployment.

‚ÄúThe bottom line is this report is quite reassuring,"" said Furman, who now teaches at Harvard.

It's not that America is only ‚Äî or even mostly ‚Äî producing low-wage jobs. The health care industry continues to lead the employment boom, with an approximately 4.5% gain in payrolls over the past year, equating to some 750,000 new jobs. Other industries seeing strong growth include government jobs, certain sectors of social work, travel, tourism and the arts ‚Äî¬†alongside some manufacturing sectors.

But the overall labor market remains at something of a standstill, as seen in a report earlier this week showing the hiring rate continuing to drift sideways. At the same time, the rate of workers quitting or being laid off is also not showing much change. Economists led by Guy Berger at The Burning Glass Institute research group call it the¬†[""great stay.""](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/job-market-right-now-the-great-stay-layoffs-and-resignations-decline-rcna142220)"

The driver was never hospitalized and another passenger was discharged within an hour. 

She however, is extremely and traumatically injured. 

They were in sand dunes. She was laid out with multiple massive lacerations, in sand with a broken femur, broken nose and more for over an hour until an ambulance arrived to drive her an hour and half to a hospital where X-rays and Catscans were taken. It was determined that this hospital could not perform necessary surgery. 

She was put on another ambulance, not given pain medication, wounds still wide open, bones still broken with blood in her eyes and driven for 2 and half more hours in excruciating pain to another hospital. 

She arrived at this second hospital around 2:30am Thursday morning. 


Surgery was done to repair the broke femur, and do an initial cleaning on the open wounds around 10am Thursday morning. 

Doctors told us that without her helmet there is zero chance she would have survived. 

Without the slightest bit of hyperbole the lacerations on her legs would hit the all time top posts of /r/medizzy if I had a picture of what I briefly saw pre surgery. 

Infection is now the biggest concern. There is a second surgery planned for Monday morning to clean the open wounds a second time since she was laying in sand, without medical attention for an hour, then those wounds werent cleaned until 10am Thursday morning. 

She may not be able to walk for a LONG time. 
We are still waiting to even know the full extent of what is needed for the open wounds. 


Her company has offered to help multiple times. 
We allowed them to pay for our hotel stay and have told them that other than that we are focusing on the present moment. 
Myself and my mother in law are here, trading off sleeping in shifts at this hotel and staying with her in the hospital. 

We have signed nothing. 
We do not intend to. 

We both have a healthy distrust of any large company doing the absolute best/right thing for any reason other than to cover their own asses and ""protect their assets"". 

We are not the type to be frothing at the mouth for a payday over anything, but as the reality of this trauma continues to settle in we are also reminding ourselves that WE DO NOT KNOW THE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS OF THIS TRAUMA YET. 

She is a social media manager. She's not Travis Pastrana, she's not Johnny Knoxville she's not Rod Kimble. 

She's a single mother who gets paid less than 60k a year to manage social media accounts. 
She would have absolutely NEVER EVER been in this situation if her job didn't PUT her in this situation.

Furthermore, why wasn't she careflighted out of what was essentially the desert? 
Why was a social media manager allowed to lie in the desert bleeding, broken and screaming like a military man in a foxhole for hours under the supervision of this company? 

Why was she transferred to multiple hospitals in her condition via ambulance WITH OPEN WOUNDS AND NO MEDICATION while under the supervision of this company? 

Why was no one at this company able to contact me or provide me with contact info for anyone at the scene?

Why was the only person at the scene who actually came within an inch of death, and may never walk normally again, the one who had to call me, screaming bloody murder, broken and bleeding to tell me where I needed to be? 




I realize this probably got more emotional as it went on and I apologize if it was a little tangential. 
I'm exhausted. I've slept about 6 hours in the last 72. 
It's been the worst 4 days of my life and I feel selfish even saying that considering I'm not the one in the hospital bed. My legs work. 


The bigger point here is, as we are able to slowly separate ourselves from this trauma and focus on next steps, it's clear to us that we need to be absolutely certain we don't allow ourselves to be fucked any more by this than we already are. 

My partner enjoys her job, she doesn't necessarily want to lose it and isn't opposed to working from home. 

But also we don't want to risk them providing the bare minimum for the next few months, then letting her go, leaving her and I holding the metaphorical sack of life altering, traumatizing dog shit that they are absolutely directly responsible for in every conceivable way. 

She's an empath to a fault at times, as am I. But the more we're able to unpack this the more it's apparent that this is a company that is directly responsible for almost destroying the lives of my partner, myself, her child, her mother, her brothers etc. 

And as I said before WE STILL DONT KNOW (and may not for years) THE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THIS TRAUMA. 




Which brings me to the real question at hand and the reason for this post: 

What's the best next move from us here? 


Any help that can be provided here from people more knowledgeable than ourselves could literally be life saving or at the very least dramatically life altering in a positive direction. 

We're throwing hope to the wind, or in this case, the Internet, and hoping for the best. 


Thank you to everyone in advance. 

Once this post is up and approved I'll loop my partner in so she can help with any questions or details I'm not aware of."

31,2024-05-04,Lost promotion for doing supervisor's tasks,u/Hot-Conclusion6886,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ckbta4/lost_promotion_for_doing_supervisors_tasks/,antiwork,"Last year I was working finance for a company and while I was pretty comfortable in my job it became apparent to me that I was being underpaid compared to similar jobs at different companies. I very quietly started applying for and interviewing for positions at other companies. Some doing the exact job I was currently doing, some branching out slightly. (There are different types of finance for those not in the know).    
    

I got offered a job that paid over ¬£2 more an hour and came with clear progression through the company. It was an attractive offer and I decided to approach my department manager. I explained that while I liked the company I was at I felt underpaid, undervalued and as though there was no career progression. I gave her the appealing aspects of the job I was offered and asked if she was willing to make any changes to entice me to stay. After discussing it with senior management she offered me a pay rise and promotion starting three months from that date. I weighed my decision but felt staying with the current company was the right decision given the offer.    
    

Unfortunately not long after I caught covid for the first time. Having underlying health conditions I was extremely poorly, I'm talking hospitalisation poorly. I ended up off work for three weeks and it was discussed by my supervisor and department manager that I would work from home for a few weeks after that to make sure when peak season hit I was healthy and available to be in the office more. Every single part of my job could be done from home except one weekly task (that took me about an hour  hour & half once a week). I spoke with my supervisor and we decided that she would take over that one job and I would take on two of her ""supervisor"" tasks and would train to do another one.    
    

Two and a half months later my department manager and I had a meeting to discuss how things were going to change - my pay rise and promotion was finally going to kick in!! The meeting did not go as expected. My department manager told me that given my time off that they were concerned I wasn't yet capable of being promoted to supervisor, I hadn't even been able to complete all my regular tasks and I needed to be in the office more. I was livid. I explained that while I was recovering yes I had given one of my regular tasks to my supervisor- at her suggestion - however I had taken on two of her tasks and that I was now in the office as per my normal schedule (which means I'm in the office more than any other department colleague!). She didn't care for my ""excuses"" so I did the only thing I could think of - I quit.    
    

Right there on the spot I gave her my resignation verbally, walked back to my desk and immediately sent her my formal written resignation. Everyone in the company knew about my upcoming promotion so when I was upset after the meeting people were curious and I was very honest with them. There was a lot of fuss from people, it turned out I was liked more than I thought! In the end my notice period let me leave mid-peak season and 3 other people resigned in the days following me. Its been 5 months and they've only just found my replacement.    
    

I've since realised that no company has loyalty to an employee. Heading towards self-employment. I may not get paid when I'm sick but I won't get punished for being sick either!!"

I take my breaks, and when I clock out I leave work behind me. 

The office is clearly understaffed and I believe my coworkers are being exploited because most of them are in their 20s and choose to do this even though they are not asked to do it. The office will never be fully staffed if they keep willingly doing this, because why hire more people? 

There is a weird vibe I can‚Äôt put my finger on. People are curt and look miserable. They constantly bitch about how ‚Äúother people‚Äù don‚Äôt know how to do their jobs and absolutely lose their shit whenever anyone makes a tiny mistake. 

There is a new manager who got hired right before me who is very driven and has an aggressive, drill sergeant vibe. Because I‚Äôm the newest person I‚Äôm basically her project and I don‚Äôt really like it. She alternately ignores me and micromanages me. 

I know all workplaces have their shit and it‚Äôs always hard adjusting to a new place, but I‚Äôm too old for some of this stuff. I‚Äôm in my 40s and I have a life outside work.

5560,2024-05-04,PSA: Mike Rowe(Dirty Jobs) is running antiunion and antiworker ads,u/IndividualRough2837,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ckdz15/psa_mike_rowedirty_jobs_is_running_antiunion_and/,antiwork,"People on here might be more familiar with this than me, but I wanted to try and get this out there so more people can be aware of it if they weren't. Links to everything at bottom.

To understand why Mike is garbage person and what he is talking about I'm going to give a little background on who and what.

Mike Rowe the ""Dirty Jobs"" guy that a lot of us grew up with is a dirty person. He is a conservative, which isn't inherently bad, even when it mostly is. He is staunchly antiunion and lobbies for antiunion practices, so also inherently antiworker. He also believes that when you work for a company the company should come first, you and your feelings along with your needs and wants shouldn't get any consideration. The worst part is he is anti safety, he specifically thinks your safety is only your responsibility and not the company you are working for. You can find everything is feels a employee should be at the link below that takes you to the SWEAT Pledge.

The PRO Act is legislation that amends the National Labor Relations Act, and it has passed the house and is apparently actively being looked at right now hence the ads. Its legislation that will give workers and unions more collective bargaining power, a example is in right to work states where unions would be able to protect employees from being fired for no reason(if you don't know what right to work is google it, Its bad. [cont. at bottom]). It also reclassifies what a employee is, to my understanding if you work mostly for the same company and they tell you what to do and you don't regularly contract for other companies you will be classified as a employee of said company. Those are the small tidbits to just frame this.

This is the part where I trash Mike. He is running 10 min long ads on YouTube preaching that the PRO Act is anti independent contractor, and will harm innocent people that don't want to be bothered. I assume most of the people here are aware that some independent contractor positions are scams, depending on the field most of them can be scams. Such as most truck driving positions, where companies have scammed people into becoming a ""independent contractor"" to avoid both unions and that person being classified as a employee. If you weren't familiar now you are. The PRO Act amends a part that specifically targets contractors that work for the same company almost exclusively. There are multiple criteria that one must meet in order to be classified as a employee, its the ABC test. If there is any independent contractor that solely relies on a single company they aren't independent, they are a employee. When you only work for one company and not as a freelance contractor which does have benefits, being classified as a employee gives you more protection. If you aren't making enough money to make up the difference that being a employee would get you, then you are being scammed. There are costs that you have to specifically cover, normally a employer helps you cover most if not all of these things aside from taxes. To make up the difference to get even with the company you have to fully cover your own insurance, every kind of tax, retirement, buying and maintain your tools and equipment. That's a lot of money, insurance can be 400-500 alone. 

This might be poorly written and I might have used wording that could be changed, but I'm sick right now. I was in bed watching YouTube when the ad came on and it pissed me off. Mike is a douche and the fact that he was railing against a piece of legislation made me google it. Turns out from what I read, which was not the entire bill, its pro worker and pro union. There is probably more in the bill that could be considered bad just like omnibus bills but the only thing being reported on is the these few worker aspects. So I wanted to let people know and try spread awareness that Mike is a colossal douche and that this bill is good, even if its only good because Mike doesn't like it.

Regarding the right to work and what I know and my opinion on it. Its legislation that would passed by companies lobbying that give companies the ability to fire anyone for no reason, not any reason. There are still protected classifications that you cant put on the you were fired for, such as the color of your skin. But that's the point of the bill, it lets them just say your fired and you have no recourse. It works the other way to, which is where the mostly came from. It allows you to just walk out of your job regardless of reason and they cant do anything unless you broke contract or a law.

Ps: Most of this is either stuff I looked up and am parroting and/or know, so there is probably things I got wrong and/or partly wrong. The point still stands and do your own research if you want more details.

27,2024-05-04,Company is not realistic,u/AnalysisNo4295,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cke70e/company_is_not_realistic/,antiwork,"I work for a company that they derive hours given to their cashiers based entirely off of the amount of people that their cashiers sign up for the discount emails they give out every so often. My percentage hasn't been that great lately because, every customer has said ""no"" to me. I used to get about 30 hours per week. Now I'm getting maybe 1- five hour shift per week. I asked why and the management told me that the amount of customers I had signing up for the program was ""less than satisfactory"" and that in order to get more hours I have to show ""improvement in getting customers signed up that are eligible to be signed up"". Our schedules go out nearly 2 and a half weeks in advance. For the next four weeks I am expected to work one short shift and ""meet satisfactory"" on ""how many people I can sign up"" or I'm assuming this means my hours won't be reinstated. 

I don't see how the scheduling manager can sit there and say that makes any sense at all. I spoke to the manager and they said that they don't change the schedule. I can ask other associates to cover their shifts but, ""I don't change the schedule. Once it is up. The schedule is final."" 

Am I wrong in thinking that this is not just the stupidest reason to lose hours but, it's also unrealistic expectations? How am I supposed to get almost every other customer to sign up for emails? I'm not going to push for information people don't want to give me.. "

I got laid off last September from my remote technical writing job. The job itself was very dull and not enjoyable for me, but I loved working remotely and the pay was decent. So when I started looking for work again, I kept applying for similar jobs with similar pay (or higher pay because I have more experience now) and have only gotten rejections and ghosted (so cowardly rejections).

So I've had to keep lowering my standards, and I'm just applying to whatever I feel I can feasibly do without going crazy, and it just feels so bad. I have one prospective job right now, but the pay is much lower, it's just a three-month contract with no benefits, it's on-site, and sounds boring as hell. 

I feel like such a failure. You're supposed to keep climbing up and making more money with experience, but instead I keep having to downgrade, and I have a bachelor degree and I'm in my 30s. Why is this happening? I have worked my ass off at every job to the point of burnout and it's like I'm being punished for it. I have hated every job I've ever had and felt so miserable when I had to get up every morning for work. I'm not even excited about this job. I just really need the money right now, so I guess I'll downgraded once again. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm depressed just thinking about having to take this job."

1,2024-05-04,Is this wrongful termination?,u/stitchbitch420,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ckhgbh/is_this_wrongful_termination/,antiwork,"Today I got fired over the phone and the more I think about the reason they gave me the more annoyed I become. So this is the timeline of the last week and you guys tell me if what I did was a fireable offense. 
(Using fake names but important people of note are Jenna; the host; Craig ;one of the managers; Serena and Jill; two other servers; and Katherine; the owner of the restaurant)

Up until this past Wednesday I would have said I was becoming pretty good friends with Jenna. On Monday before the shift started she told me that Craig had asked her out (she is 20 he is 40). Not illegal but a little strange. Later on in the shift Serena and Jill were complaining about Craig saying he was being passive aggressive and pissy bc Serena didn‚Äôt reciprocate feelings for him (or that‚Äôs what she says). At this point in time I considered myself friends with them so I contributed to the conversation that I heard from Jenna that he asked her out. In retrospect it was rude of me to share her business behind her back and I should definitely have kept my mouth shut. HOWEVER I did not expect Serena to go directly to Craig and tell him that I told her that and he needs to be more careful or something. Things are fuzzy after this but what I think happened is Craig went to the owner Katherine to squash the ‚Äúrumor‚Äù that I had supposedly started to save his job. They called Jenna in as well and obviously to save her job she backed him up that it was a lie and I made it up and told everyone. Which I did not I told 2 people. And they spread it around with my name on it. 

Onto today, Katherine calls me and gives me very little time to explain which did not help my case at all as I got very nervous and then fired me over the phone.

And apparently at the meeting before today‚Äôs shift she stopped it to tell everyone that the reason I don‚Äôt work there anymore is because I admitted to starting a rumor‚Ä¶

I live in NH so I know that I can be fired for any reason but I also don‚Äôt feel I did very much wrong here aside from share something Jenna told me in confidence. And I don‚Äôt see how that is a fireable offense. "

I just started a new job recently and it us very demanding because of coperate.  Which in returns makes our managers mean or stressed etc. We are suppose to meet a daily quota ,but personally I find it hard to care when I make minimum wage. There are way too many rules and the task need to be timed. The guy at work had a crush on me ,but I don't care to date right now and I only date to get married these days. I am trying to keep this job long term . It just frustrating because my manager is younger then me and will  freeze and text in the middle of store with customers around lol. I guess I just find it very hard to be okay at work and be Friendly when IRL life stinks n dealing with my toxic negative mom and no support , friends or car etc.  It kind of sad because no one ask me anything so it get kind of draining trying to be friendly etc. F 28 I literally have a different name for work so I can try to decompartmentalize. Plus I can't even have random accomendation like using a notebook.  My managers is suppose to write My reminders for me ,but I am suppose to remind her to do that lol . Considering she doesn't have a good memory either ."
26,2024-05-04,"Suspended from work for  3 days, maybe fired for arriving at work 5 minutes late",u/dizzdafizzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cki9bx/suspended_from_work_for_3_days_maybe_fired_for/,antiwork,"Back in March I got hired at an event working at a warehouse off of my local airport, but after that I spent weeks waiting to actually start then weeks in computer based training, upon completion the manager I had said he was moving in and there was going to be a new manager, I then spent a week waiting to receive my airport badge so I can start my first shift but when the new boss seemed incompetent I just went to the badging office myself and I got it that same day.

Not long after I started working in the warehouse I knew there was going to be trouble with this new manager, the place and previous manager actually seemed to be very laid back before but this individual was a boomer aged individual who wore cowboy boots, was bald with a long white beard. First in the meeting he bragged about making an entire work team clean toilets and sent them home early because one of them supposedly had an air pod in one ear, yesterday when I approached the door at roughly 12:05 but no later, the manager who's new blocks my path from coming in and demands I give him my airport badge, I look at him in a bit of confusion and he looks at me and says ""you're late"" ""I need people who come on time"" I mention that I likely haven't used up nearly enough points yet to be terminated and that I still have until the next minute to punch in according to company policy (the clock in machine isn't far away from the entrance) I ask him if I can come back tomorrow he just says no, there were two other coworkers behind me, he asked for their badges as well and told them that they were suspended for 3 days, I'm not entirely sure if that applier to me as well or not and I don't care to call and ask him, I've been late about 8 or 9-ish minutes a couple time before but this was my Monday so I can't be for sure if he started doing this just because of me or not.

A big part of the reason why I've been late before is I live pretty far away from the workplace and I have to take the interstate to get to it in good time but there's frequently hold ups both on the interstate and roads that lead up to it, there's also a traffic light that comes up as soon as I take the exit to get to work that remaina red for 5 minutes at a time, secondly even if I tough it out and just leave very early in the morning compared to what I've done before I feel like someway or somehow I'll just wind up late anyhow or I'll eventually slip up and leave to late, so what's going to happen again then? Will I just be suspended for 3 days or even a week all over again every time this happens?

As soon as I got home I got a call to come in for an interview for position at a Walmart that's just 5-10 minute drive away from my place vs 35 min- 1 hour with my current job. The reason why attendance at Walmart is more lienant even if it is considered a notorious place to work by many  is because over there I can clock in up to 9 minutes late and even if after I can either compensate with PTO minutes or just adjust my clock in time, it would be easier overall to maintain this job over the other, But my concern is I'll be moving down my wage from $17 per hour to $14 per hour and the airport  job could give me more accessible opportunities in the future  because it involves working on the airport ramp but at the same time I fear that I'll if this guy is sending people home for showing up 5 minutes late to work I'll just get fired one way or another and be left with no job at all and it's all because of this culture's boomer generation and their trivial over emphasis and unreasonable standards regarding attendance, so I accepted the job at Walmart. Is this a bad decision? To me it seems I'll benefit from the job I can actually remain consistent with."

I'm an Italian guy that got his 2nd degree one year ago about Food technology and science, with specialization on food innovation and treatment. 

Sadly after the degree I took 6 month of relax for myself and gather some info about find a job correctly and such and then finally back on November a big italian cheese company known well in Europe too ( so a very large group) , called me for a job that I applied myself on the packaging area, where the welcoming was fine at start , the boss after 2 months called me in his office for telling me about many replacements that the quality laboratory were happening at time since many were close to retire .

Turns out that after months of wait until this month , I kept working there doing the lowest , unskilled and boring works possible only to find out that all the lab personnel have been replaced only by women that in best cases have just one degree or they have a diploma from scientific high schools.

I'm so infuriated about that even the boss doesn't have the guts to look me in the eyes now and I think on half of May I will leave the place , hoping to find better ...

Working on italy is basically BS"

8,2024-05-05,"Job hired me for part time and set expectations on hours, went an entire week without work",u/KolMan2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ckiwqi/job_hired_me_for_part_time_and_set_expectations/,antiwork,"A few months back I had walked out of a job at a food chain because a manager was being incredibly lazy and the company refused to let us schedule more people so I was having to face very unhappy customers waiting over an hour for what should have been carry-out. I was there for a year and a half and was easily the best service worker they had, but for some reason was so frustrated at that moment that I threw it away. Next job I go to is a moving job, I won‚Äôt say what company but they‚Äôre pretty big in Florida. I‚Äôve never been the most physically built person but I have good endurance for carrying things within my physical capabilities. I was hired to the job under the expectation I would be working 25-30 hours a week at $13/hour + tips which they claimed were usually $200-300 per week. Not great but I couldn‚Äôt really find any better at the time with how terrible the job market here is. There was some assessment things you could do after a bit to get a few hourly pay increases. Now much but it was something.

I went in to training which was the typical giant packet of safety stuff for company protection and noticed there was a lot of people there for training, like 8-10 people, I can‚Äôt remember. Figured ‚Äúeh they just do it in large batches since it‚Äôs easier.‚Äù Later I learned that this number of people in training is literally a weekly occurrence because of how bad their turnover rate is. 

The way their scheduling works is you‚Äôre expected everyday, except Sunday, to be fully available from 8AM-whenever PM unless you request off since it‚Äôs obviously entirely random how long the jobs last. You have to call in to a phone number after 4:30 and listen to a recording to hear if you‚Äôre coming in the next day. But here‚Äôs the kicker, just cause you come in doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre working. You have to go in to the office, a 25 minute drive for myself, wait for them to read off the list of jobs with fingers crossed that you would get a job that sounded decent, and if you weren‚Äôt you were paid a single hour of wage and put on-call. Being on-call meant you had to go home and then be available should they need you for the entire rest of the day.

Needless to say I was heavily discriminated for not being the most physically fit person there and was called in maybe 3-4 times a week and worked once a week at most. The jobs could, however, range anywhere from a small storage unit move that took maybe 2 hours tops to a full house move that could take 8-10 hours. You‚Äôd never know so you‚Äôd never be able to make plans. Also not being tipped was painfully common no matter how polite you are or how hard you work. Moving costs are already so expensive that people often don‚Äôt want to even give you a few extra bucks for your effort. You‚Äôd never know so you‚Äôd never be able to make plans. 

The worst of it was when I thought they silently fired me because I didn‚Äôt hear my name on the list for a 10 days straight. The only reason I stuck around and kept checking the list was because the job market here is so bad that I couldn‚Äôt get a single other job for well over a month despite trying desperately since maybe 2 weeks after I got the moving job. I was barely making enough money to buy groceries, let alone the $2000+ a month I have to pay for rent, car payments, insurance, dental bills, etc.

I live in an apartment with my GF of 4 years and we split rent and expenses. We were faced with the very real situation that she would have to leave me if I wasn‚Äôt able to support myself financially. I nearly lost a relationship, an apartment, and was unable to afford to live because I was fundamentally discriminated against by my employers. I went to the manager and explained how difficult of a situation the job had put me in and how terribly it was ruining my mental state and relationship. They essentially just told me that they want to make sure that they always have the people they can trust to do a good and quick moving job to be the ones they send on jobs. I understood that, but if I was such a bad fit then why did you bother even keeping me? 

I asked them that they see if there is a better fit for me somewhere else within the company, even a scheduler job, taking calls and setting appointments. The workplace seemed very sexist-ly built, with all the schedulers being women and it seemed like my request to be considered for the position wasn‚Äôt taken seriously. I even applied online to the position I saw open at the company and never heard back despite having years of customer service and call center experience. 

I turned in my uniform a week later after I had finally found another job. I spent a month of my life wallowing in depression because a company physically refused to either fire me or give me an actually job that I could live off of. The turnover rate at the job was atrocious and I was one of the few people who stayed more than a few weeks. In the 3 months I worked there, I made a total of about $800. I made less than a typical 2 week paycheck at god damn McDonalds over 3 months while being expected to be available 6 days a week with no schedule. It was easily one of the lowest points of my life and it is still affecting me months later as I‚Äôm still unable to afford many of my basic expenses. 

TL;DR Company hired me for a part time position, I nearly became financially destitute because I was discriminated against and made less than 2 weeks of normal pay over the course of 3 months."

Oh, I can do better ..

Example:  
Lets dream big for a moment and imagine, we're making $100k per year at some job (most of us don't have that luxury .. I sure didn't).

Then, we'd have to work for 10.000 years - without spending a single dime of it - in order to become a billionaire (not calculating taxes).

If you wanna be a hundredfold billionaire ($100 billion or more at your disposal), you'll have to work that $100k-job for at least 1 million years .. also without spending a single dime.

Any hundredfold billionaire, who wants to tell me, they've ""earned it and saved up"" instead of ""inhereted it"", are liars and I dare them to prove me wrong.

It started with me waking up from horrific nightmares in the middle of the night every night. I haven't had a goodnights sleep since. My heartrate and blood pressure have also skyrocketed which I've gotten an EKG for and it came back normal, they said it was most likely caused by stress. I feel dizzy and nauseous literally every single day.

I don't even have a stressful job, I work in a factory where once my shift is over I shouldn't have to think about it until my next shift but it's still the thing I think about the most. I called out sick for a day last week because the nausea was so bad but I think that just made things worse because I just lost out on a day of pay.

My work hours are from 8 am to 1:45 pm. I started working at this place 3.5 years ago. When the place was founded, the original hours were from 7:30 am until 2:30 but they got approval from the government to work from 8: am until 1:45 but we still get paid for the duration of 7:30 ro 2:30 and that approval was made 10+ years ago. 


Everything was fine when i got hired until maybe 9 months ago. The previous GM retired and no other person got the new job title. The board then assigned one of the GM vice presidents to a temporarily GM role lets call her S. Thats one I will talk about here. 

Nobody liked her when she was vice president and when she got the temporarily GM role she got a huge ego boost. Our workplace was invited to participate in an event ouside the country so she assigned me to make the necessary purchases to properly represent ourself . Note that the money we spent is owned by the government and is subjected to strict rules and regulations. Violations will result in huge fines which will slow the work. 


She makes unnecessary requests and ai refused to do them based on the regulations and she wouldn't acknowledge she was wrong. I complain to the legal team and they were helpful and backing me up. She wanted to buy water bottles that are paper based and ship them to another country. Water was provided for free from the sponsor and shipping cost is 3k+ thats why i refused. Thats my issue with her, she is pissed at me for following regulations 


Fast forward few months later, many complaints against S as she takes too long to approve things or sign papers so she retaliate . She fired few managers, and rotated all managers in the workplace. The HR manager suddenly became financial manager and the labs manager suddenly got transferred somewhere else and so on. This slowed down work a lot. All computers needed to be moved and usernames changed. All employees complain again

Her next retaliation pissed off everyone and the males even more.   So the approval to reduce the work hours we got 10+ years ago, she stopped it . Now everyone is expected to work from the full hours from 7:30 until 2:30 . She knew we can't complain about this becasue the 1 hour reduction we got 10+ years ago was a bonus . 

Now out workplace is top 5 lowest paying places among the government entities thanks to her decisions . Other similar places get paid at least 1k $ more per month so thats 12k per year and the other places get more bonuses as well. She canceled them all because we complained she slows down work . 

She can't be fired or moved back to her vice president role until a new GM is found. Job title was posted everywhere and we are waiting for someone to apply so that S can go back to her old title or get fired"

I am from a very financially weak background and as well valueswise i did not receive any hard core good values to fare well in life.

the thing is it is often thing at my place where we see ""worK/employment/job as a way to uplift life, since childhood I saw the things same way, I thought if i work hard and gain a good  ""job"", i will have opportuntities to improve my life, but since i eneterd my late teens , it became more and more hopeless and gloomy to have any good chance in life, as if everything is stacked agaisnt me, in my country you are supposed to privileged in some or other way, like have generational welath, or be born to educated parents etc, to be pushed into professions where you would dignity and opportunities to imprive life financially.

I choose my field to be IT at 16 beucase i was out of options but sooner i came to know that does not matte rwhich field you choose, you get bad work-life balance (6 day work/50-60 work hrs/week is a norm on salary in which you can only afford to live in a hostel type accomodation , not your own apartment), it becmae a thing in my mind, i see a lot of people here talking about "" be successful"", ""work hard"", ""become top 1percent"" , "" beocme rcih type of advice"", we have no unions , no labor laws, no enforcements to side with labor in face of onslaught on it, as a result the abusive circumstance prevalent here is too overwhelming to talk about.

Feels as if labor is becoming increasing nonprofitable for workers, the idea that you will get to improve your life through work seems a distant dream.

I don't know what to do, i thought of moving abrpad to countries with good labor laws, but capitalist in those countries are far more tempted to outsource most of work back to countries like mine, where exploited worker can compensate wealth of people in those countries, i don't know how it affects workers in those countries and i am  not here debate anything, but the 1st world-3rd world  apartheid will hurt workers anywhere.

ask labor right and loose your job is norm at my place, sure it might become a thing in richcountries as well, but i don't know, maybe it is more bleak here.

so do you have any advice for me, like how should i see work , how should i go about my career (fields where outsourcing is not posoibel and the work is profitable for worker) , I am unable to determine for for myself where to make sacrifice and where to not take load becuase it si nothing but just abuse.

I'm a ESL teacher here in Brazil, and have been since 2021. I got tired, is too much work without the proper recognition or even proper payment, so this year I started looking for new jobs.

Thursday I got an interview and in the same day got the job to be a Bilingual Receptionist. This job would be registered, whereas at my current job I work as a SP. Because of this, the money I get from teaching now is less than I would get from this new job, so I scheduled a meeting with my coordinator on Friday (following day as I got selected for the receptionist job) to tell her I would be leaving.

When I told her that next week would be my last week with them, she got shocked and tried to talk me into staying with ""there isn't anything we can do to make it better for you?"" Like, girl, you could pay me better from start but too late, sorry. 

The problem is, I have some anxiety problems and I was holding my breath basically so I wouldn't cry out of anxiety. I think she noticed this, bc then she started saying things like ""leaving at this period of the year is complicated to us, we won't have a teacher to replace you, the *coordination* will have to do your job!"".

I felt guilty. I really did. But I was stronger and could say ""I know, but it's been really hard for me, I will do what I can to help you, but I'm leaving"".

And she kept talking as if it were my fault that they don't have a substitute teacher ready, they don't have the means to hire a new teacher, like omg it took me 2 days to stop feeling guilty and start seeing it as what it was.

I'm happy to leave!"

Minimum wage hasn't changed in 15 years. Many people live in a state which has their own, so I assume that's why there is less interest in protesting a minimum wage for all americans, because some americans (in their state) already got theirs. It's just kind of weird because a lot of other protests dont' disciminate based on what state you live in. They protest for all black americans, or all of this group, not just ones in certain states. There's probably about 6 states (mainly southern) that don't have a minimum wage and maybe like 4-5 others with pretty low ones."

Nah,  I think almost everybody wants to work.  I think people naturally want to spend their time doing something useful or meaningful or challenging.  I look at my friend's list and see people writing novels and playing music, doing art and making stuff, gardening and cooking and canning and pickling food, restoring old cars and houses, volunteering for a hundred different causes, contributing to dozens of open sourced tech projects, teaching, raising children, and doing all kind of work that benefits themselves, their loved ones, and their communities.  

What we don't want is to sacrifice all of that to ""earn a living"".  We don't want to spend 40+ hours wasting our lives for someone else's benefit just to prove that we deserve to survive, while all of the important work goes undone because it can't be squeezed for profit.

We were told that one of the perks for our job was unlimited paid sick time. I had a year where I had norovirus (stomach flu) twice in the spring, then threw out my back really bad in the early summer. I went to the ER one of the times I had noro because I was so dehydrated I almost passed out straining to throw up and needed IV fluids. When I threw out my back I was on an opioid pain reliever and powerful muscle relaxer because of the amount of pain I was in. I walked with a cane for a few months because I didn‚Äôt have the strength in my back to support myself fully while upright and had months of physical therapy. 

When I got to my mid-year review, I was told I needed to work extra hours in the second half of the year to make up for all the sick time I had used. I was young and dumb and probably should have gone on FMLA when I threw out my back, but my manager had not mentioned to me that all the sick time was an issue until that review. 

I told my manager that I thought we had unlimited sick time. He said we do. So I asked why I have to make up the time. He said because we have to maintain a minimum average of 38 hours per week. 

In 26 weeks, I had missed about 4 weeks of work (one week each time I had noro and about two weeks intermittently with my back including the first week I was out and then PT and follow up doctor appointments. I rarely needed overtime to meet my deadlines for my work (I was a salaried exempt engineer, so no financial incentive for me to work extra), so I didn‚Äôt work any overtime that year. 

I told him that if I have to make up sick time, I don‚Äôt actually have unlimited paid sick time. He then argued that we do, I was allowed to have that time off and it was paid, but there is still an expectation of averaging at least 38 hours per week. I said that isn‚Äôt unlimited paid sick time, that‚Äôs flex time, which is a different and worse benefit than the advertised unlimited paid sick time. He has no argument and just kept repeating himself. I ended up walking out of that meeting with no real resolution. I never made up the time and had no real punishment besides only getting an average performance review and pay raise. The only way to get a higher than average performance review and pay raise was to be up for a promotion. If you weren‚Äôt up for a promotion that year, you could only achieve average. That was our managements‚Äô strategy to sell upper management on promotions for people."

So I work in the mental healthcare field. I am included in various group text chats, Google chats, email threads etc. I am constantly getting messages and whatnot from work, including my off time. I have muted all of my chats during off time, which has annoyed management.  Recently got an email saying I needed to sign some OJT paperwork, for a job I've had for a year and a half. I've signed this paperwork 6 times now. (I work with different individuals so I need an OJT for each house) But several houses I have signed the paperwork several times and they keep losing it. 

This upset me because they said I have to come in on my off time to sign it, even though they keep losing it. I'm not really upset, and it won't take much time at all to do it, like 15 minutes, but I feel as though my time is not being respected. I called HR to see if I could get paid for that time since they keep losing the paperwork and I was annoyed. They refused to answer. I asked them if it was legal for me to do work off of the clock and they literally refused to answer. I eventually got a supervisor, who only reiterated that they wouldn't answer the question and didn't want to argue about it. I asked my supervisor if they could bring me the papers at work. They said no. I asked if they could email it to me. They said no. I have to come in on my own time. It's ludicrous.

The main point here is that HR is not on our side. It is presented as such, but they are nothing but a shield for the company. I could have resolved the issue in three seconds by just saying to clock in when I get there, and I asked them if I could and they gave me the runaround. Our time away from work needs to be respected. I see gradual change coming, so I'm hopeful for the future, but man is this system broken. 

End rant/ thanks for listening! "

2,2024-05-05,Manager told me I made her hire me.,u/robbinfromstatefarm,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cl06pi/manager_told_me_i_made_her_hire_me/,antiwork,"Yes, the title is correct. No. I obviously didn't. Honestly, I'm kind of pissed, but that's because the situation was so recent.

 Today I went to put in my two weeks. The work culture was absolutely horrible at that place. I'm talking about yelling at employees, public shaming, and 1-day brain mesh training. (plus much more) I just couldn't take it anymore, and I worked 5 hours a week, once a week, at minimum wage. It just wasn't worth it. I had multiple people telling me to quit.



I waited until the end of my shift and asked her to come to the back with me because, even though the managers at that job seemed to be into exhibition, I wanted to be professional and keep it cool. I told her I was putting in my two weeks. And before I even got to the why (which was going to be some shit like ""career changes"" or whatever), she cut me off and said, ""Why did you make me hire you.""‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶.confused asf. I almost started to look around, because, huh? Was she serious?



I said the obvious thing, like ""I didn't,"" and then she's like, ""Oh , this is the most you said in months."" Now this may be where I spoke too much of my mind, but I said, ""Um, why are you mad?"" CAUSE I WAS VERY CONFUSED?!! Like y'all, I swear I didn't even say it in a rude way. I was just trying to understand. She's like, ""I'm not mad. I'm just asking you a question and want an answer,"" so I say, "" I didn't make you hire me,"" and she's like, ""Yes, you did when you called me that on Wednesday."" . Mind you, she was talking about the ONE time a week after the interview when she said she was going to call me to tell me if I had the job or not. And Wednesday, I called and checked because, in that same interview, she said she was going to be busy and might forget, but she ""liked my vibe"" and was ""probably gonna hire"" me. 

Anyways...

I said something like, ""No, I didn't; I just called to check on my interview. But either way, I just wanted to put in my two weeks or quit."". She asked for my apron, and I left. I'm glad that's over, but it's just so weird that she said that. Am I missing something?



(PS: I only worked there for MAYBE a month or two, and since I worked once a week for 5 hours and had 1 day of cram training , I didn't speak to her much because she kept getting mad at me for things I had zero clue about in front of customers. I'm talking about things like sales we had going on and being behind the counter 2.5 seconds after a customer left. I'm so serious. The customer was literally still there when she got mad at me. This lady talked like an abusive mother \[and a little girl, to be honest; she talked really badly about a lot of people with her favorite employee\]. It was emotionally draining and completely unnecessary. On my first day, she was like, ""Hey, what did you sell today?"" It was retail, selling a lot of things. I said, ""Wdym!"". She said, "" NOTHING. NO \[product that had sale at time\]"" I thought she was trying to set up a joke , but it quickly became apparent working there that she was just extremely critical and demanding. And her criticisms were always in front of customers. I had to start taking Tyeloenl because I'd get a stress headache every shift. (So yeah, I didn't want to talk much.)

.

.

TL:DR: The manager got mad at me for putting in my 2 weeks, made fun of me, and told me I made her hire me."

Washington State code says that employers must provide a restroom but there can be reasonable restrictions like if you're an essential worker or on a line you have to get coverage for your spot before you can go. 

My store recently started locking our bathrooms because people were doing drugs and stealing a lot. We had a key that was accessible to employees. 

They didn't tell us the reason why but they just took it away and only managers have a key now and you either have to search them out or page them.  

There are two main assumptions at this point. Trying to find internal theft or micro managing because when someone goes to the bathroom it gets obvious because customers get mad there is no one to help them since of course they are operating on a skeleton crew (side note the company did over 4 billion in PROFITS) last year. 

I've been trying to find if this would be considered a reasonable restriction or if this goes against anything like Americans with disabilities acts etc?"

He seemed to understand perfectly fine. I had an interview with the store manager there today, and I explained the same thing to her. For context, this job starts at 8.50 an hour. After I explained I was waiting to hear back from a gas station I applied to, she looked a bit angry and said ""so we're your second option?"" I figured she was asking that as an explanation and I figured that if she doesn't understand what I mean from my explanation then I'll just say yes, so I said ""I guess so."" She wrote down ""second option"" on her notebook and underlined it. After the interview I told my friend I don't think the manager likes me, and my friend said that the manager thought it was rude I called this job my second option and I said I never even said that, she said it. So basically she was trying to put words in my mouth because she's upset I'm not jumping for joy at the opportunity to work barely a living wage. I'd prefer at least 10 dollars an hour and I'm going to wait to see if the other job that I'm interested in pays that much. I don't really get what's hard to understand about that. "

‚Äê-------------------

THREE RIVERS, Mich. (WNDU) - Three store owners in Three Rivers are facing charges after they allegedly labor trafficked a woman who was brought to the United States under the auspices of marriage.

According to our reporting partners at WTHD, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced the charges on Wednesday.

Nessel said 40-year-old Ikbahl Machhal, 67-year-old Katar Chand, and 66-year-old Shila Devi were each charged with one count of human trafficking forced labor, and one count of human trafficking enterprise. Both charges are 10-year felonies.

Police say they began trafficking the now 33-year-old woman back in 2012 when family forced her to move in with the three suspects who were her husband and in-laws.


The victim alleges they forced her to work at the Broadway Market in Three Rivers eight to nine hours a day, seven days a week against her will and under threat for eight years while never getting paid.

Machhal and Devi were arrested on Monday. Their bonds are set at $1 million each.

Chand has been charged, but not arrested, as officials say he fled to India."

If you have a casino near you, I highly recommend applying for table games or slot attendant.  Tell them you will work full time and do it for a month or two until they like you.  Then say something came up, and work 3 or 4 days a week.  Both jobs at both casinos were 25+ an hour starting.  I hope this helps someone."

Although I'm fairly certain I didn't forget, I had to sign my first write-up today for forgetting something very minor. At first, this sounds pretty normal, but afterwards, my location manager told me that, because of this writeup, he would be putting me on a performance improvement plan. I didn't even know that Chipotle had performance improvement plans for their employees. I was shocked and confused as to what I had done wrong to deserve this. My mind raced with thoughts of potential consequences and how I could possibly improve my performance to meet their standards. I didn't even know Chipotle even used performance improvement plans; they must really want to fire me. Is there anything I should do that is beyond the obvious, like looking for a new job? I'm already on that."

I have nothing to hide, and I don‚Äôt create bogus meetings, but I feel like this is a form of micromanagement. It feels like he wants to control the prioritization of my meetings, so that he can schedule meetings on top of others that he views as less important. I also have various health appointments on this calendar (so my coworkers know I‚Äôll be out of office) and it feels like a breach of privacy to have that information shared.

My perspective is that I‚Äôm either available or busy, and the details shouldn‚Äôt matter. Is this even a fight worth fighting, or am I just being unreasonably stubborn?

I did it mostly because they hired a guy 6 months in who was receiving obvious favoritism like he knew somebody (via better shifts and not having to do the 1 dish shift per week even though I had seniority and superior experience).

Fast forward a month and I'm fired pretty much out of nowhere, using made-up pretexts about coworker conflicts, even though there was never a conflict, no warnings, no write-ups, and no paper trail, because the dude worked opposite shifts to me until a month ago, when one guy quit and another reduced his hours.  

Filed for unemployment after being fired a few weeks ago, and the employer has fought it tooth and nail, and two days ago announced they will be closing permanently halfway thru May.

I like to think they couldn't hack it even a few weeks without me. Big win against a stereotypically corrupt local ""mom and pop"" that people like to give lip service for, but who are, in reality, more corrupt and nepotistic than corporate chains. "

9,2024-05-06,I got out!!!!,u/caffinated_engineer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1clk92m/i_got_out/,antiwork,"To start- I‚Äôve never posted my own thread on Reddit,  but I feel it‚Äôs necessary due to how much this particular thread has helped me. I‚Äôd like to try and provide the same now. 

For nearly 3 years I was in a a demanding, toxic, and overly taxing work environment (both to my mental and physical heath). I loved my team members but my direct supervisor was very critical. I honestly liked her as a person separate from work, but as a leader not so much. The job itself was too demanding and everyday was a work emergency. If I didn‚Äôt have an update for each task everyday, I was off track (because again, EVERYTHING was an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù and high priority even though nothing I worked on was life or death. It was just imposed this way.)

I work in engineering and always had impossible deadlines, had to work odd hours to reach unrealistic expectations and because I worked with my time zone plus others. I always received critical feedback and rarely any recognition. Any work I got done I always had more. One time my work was stolen right in front of me. I Started my day with 10 tasks then ended the day with 15 more. Had insufficient training for any new tasks yet was held wayyy overly accountable for mistakes when I am new to any tasks- this fostered a huge fear of mistakes and perfectionism (therefore fueled my anxiety)



What did this job do to ME? Well , here‚Äôs a list:

1) I had started therapy shortly after starting this job

2) I had to go on emergency medical leave due to anxiety and panic attacks on the daily (my Apple Watch literally recorded a time my heart rate went up almost 40BPM at RESTING RATE because I was in a meeting getting belittled 

3) Gained weight, so much stress eating I didn‚Äôt even realize

4) Loss interest in so many activities I used to enjoy just because my work was always in my head. No, it‚Äôs not that easy to just separate work and personal when you know stress is just going to be right around the corner

5) Had too many nightmares 

6) Quality of sleep was terrible, I‚Äôm constantly not wanting to sleep early because I know what‚Äôs waiting for me the next day, but at the same time I developed insomnia because I keep waking up in fear that I did something wrong 

7) Developed huge anxiety and perfectionism 

8) Developed a habit of stress shopping and impulse purchasing to make myself feel better (I honestly did not realize this habit until my wallet felt it and I couldn‚Äôt take another large purchase)

9) Developed stress acne (I‚Äôve never really had trouble with acne even as a teenager. The only times I really developed a lot was during finals in college, so constant acne was a big tell)

10) Developed overall DEPRESSION 


I recently , FINALLY got another job that was in my field and a little higher paying. The difference is night and day. It is so much more laid back, people are not stressed, there is amazing work life balance, and actual training. I‚Äôm a little traumatized from those years and am waiting for the other shoe to drop but so far it seems much better. 

There were so many times I almost just quit but finances wouldn‚Äôt allow me. It‚Äôs not as easy to say ‚Äúhey if you don‚Äôt like your situation then just change it!‚Äù Because that‚Äôs not how life works. I‚Äôve applied to probably a thousand jobs in the last couple years. I‚Äôve had a few interviews and even almost got out much earlier but it was always something (someone hired internally, position cancelled, I would need to be onsite far away that the drive and pay cut wouldn‚Äôt be worth the risk)

I came here to share my story in hopes of helping someone out there with some hope as this thread has validated my experience more times than I can thank. Patience was the worst, pushing through was the worst, but I promise that it doesn‚Äôt end there. 

I will say one good thing about this terrible experience though- it toughened me up and helped my fear of confrontation. I had to become more assertive to survive. It‚Äôs not ideal obviously but I‚Äôm trying to see the little positive that came out. They say you learn through hardships.

For everyone out there feeling stuck, I wholeheartedly feel for you. Please- when the opportunity finally does arise, take the risk. What‚Äôs the alternative? I was too afraid the new place will be just as toxic but how much worse can it get? At least I know I could handle the toxicity now at the very least. But taking that leap opens up the possibility of a much much better environment, and once that comes it will be a large breath of the finest corporate quality air lol. 

Wishing anyone who is stuck now the best."

He has an extensive work history in hospitality over the past 10 years in West Africa.

The company he is working for here is the same international corporation that he worked for in his home country. What he's found is that the hotel in the US has much less respect for employee time than the one in West Africa. They deviate the scheduled work hours nearly every shift, often cutting scheduled 8 hour shifts down to 6-7 hours on the day of the shift. They also provide no time off for the first year of employment (which is illegal according to state law).

Now the really frustrating thing is that his supervisor came to him and asked what the working conditions were like in West Africa working for the same hotel line. After explaining some differences, his supervisor said ""well, in the United States it's not like that and you're going to need to get used to it"".

It's pretty wild to me that a US employer is telling a worker from one of the lowest GDP developing nations in the world that he needs to lower his expectations for how he is treated at work because the US has worse rights for workers (in certain aspects) than the country he is from."

I've been at my current job for over 10 years now. Started at the bottom and worked my way up near the top. But, things have seemed a bit stagnant for a couple years now. They keep giving me more responsibility, work and more people to supervise, but my pay has not gone up since pre covid. I make $30 an hour, which equates to $62k. However, I tend to make more than that with annual bonus and overtime. Last year I made just under $70K. I graduated with a degree in accounting and had accounting responsibilities when I started but as I moved up the latter, I was shifted more towards operations, leadership and client engagement. I was given more responsibility over the last year on top of what I was already doing and now it feels like I am working nearly a 2 person job. However, there is more promotional potential for me here and more pay potential but I might have to wait it out for a bit longer since it is depended on our current owner aging out and passing down the reigns to the company's #2 who I am close with. However, a part of me doesn't want to be here anymore. Don't want to get stuck in a low paying job with little opportunity for pay growth.



Anyways, I was never actively searching for a new job but I kept my eyes and ears open and would pursue an opportunity if it was there and felt right. I was talking to someone whose family owns a local business. They are looking for someone to fill an accounting position. After some conversations and then a couple interviews (Phone and then in person) they offered me the job. They then sent me over the proposal and it doesn't look good. It definitely is negotiable but by how much and is it even worth it? Below are the details:



Salary offer: $75k (when interviewing they said the range will be $70K to $85k.



Probationary period (No PTO and no benefits): SIX MONTHS!! yikes!



PTO: FIVE DAYS per year! another yikes.



What I really liked about this position is that it shifted me back towards accounting and advancing my knowledge and experience in accounting. Something I've been wanting to do more of. It was going to be a challenge but felt like it was going to put me in a position to build my future since I still have like 30 more years in the job force. And of course what's great about this position is the pay is higher than what I am currently making. I am sure I can negotiate up that $75k to $80. However, isn't 5 days of PTO per year horrible? With my current job, I get 18 days of PTO per year and I have a lot of flexibility and freedom since I am in a management position. So I am thinking my current pay (High 60's after OT and bonus) with this PTO and freedom factored in is better than 75K with 5 days of PTO. Heck I think it is better than $80K with 5 days of PTO. Don't think you? Also, 6 months of probationary period? That's just not doable for me.



Also, i am not sure if I can negotiate up PTO. But even if I can, how much would they go up? Probably like no more than 10 days per year. That's still insanely low isn't it?"

I believe in ethical capitalism. Where things go wrong is when management gets lazy, and hires crappy people into jobs of any power and is so afraid of unemployment claims insurance, they won‚Äôt fire them. I am currently a manager with a good (not great, actually pretty solidly underpaid) salary and mediocre benefits. The only thing that keeps me from quitting multiple times a day is my mortgage and my kids. My boss is a f-ing psychopath. I say that and I mean it.. look up psychopaths in the workplace and you will know exactly what I mean. All leadership in my company knows she is a serious issue and won‚Äôt deal with her. She causes way more problems than she is worth, but instead of firing her they just muddle along. Why? Female and over 50. The cost of firing her would be astronomical. What they won‚Äôt calculate is the cost of keeping her. How many managers out there should be shitcanned and just aren‚Äôt bc of the cost? They are allowed to just stay and make everyone miserable? Work isn‚Äôt bad in and of itself. It‚Äôs people who shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to hold say over other people but are empowered by those that don‚Äôt have the will. I used to not believe in unions, that they only empowered and enriched the people running them. I was a union member in my younger years and it did hold me back from advancement at the time, so I have a basis for my thought. Now, at the current place of employment, seeing the management here, I would gladly aid a union coming in here. If for no other reason than to see the person that has no business being in charge of other people‚Äôs livelihood get stuck with that."

A few days ago I went and left a never negative review of the store, and included some details such as ""owner emgaged in wage theft"" and ""didn't pay out my insurance or tips"" and within am hour I got a very nasty next from them threateneing to sue me for defamation.  They used a lot of fancy terms, and it was clearly meant to scare me more than anything, and included threats such as suing my current employer.  And accusing me of something to do with their Amazon account and being given location notifications?  Not even the slightest clue what thst was about.

The thing is I have emails from them, including one that just straight up says ""yeah, I docked $XXX.xx from your final paycheck for an airline ticket"" but the department of labour refused to take action on the technicality that I didn't ""work"" those hours, and thus it isn't wage theft.  But I have an email from them just... Saying they took the money out of my check.  So I am curious, has anyone else had to deal with this kind of crap?  Being threatened by former employers, and also legally having money stolen from you?

I want to believe there's some legal action I could take in retaliation, but sadly I am still broke as hell, it took me a year and a half to get out of debt once fired and left holding the bag."

I was so insulted that I wanted to go into my boss' office and scream about it, but I did not.

Does anyone think I could file a lawsuit and win any money back? I feel this was discrimination against my age and gender. I was a female age 50 at this time, and he was a male under the age of 40.

Seeking support,u/spicyfrog1111,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1clt3xi/i_got_discriminated_against_at_work_so_i_walked/,antiwork,"My job, despite not facing civilians, used to be 3x per week in person but got bumped up to 4x per week in person soon after I started the job. Our union allows supervisors and employees to work out flexibility but u didn‚Äôt know this so I talked to HR about my sleep disorder which makes it harder to be in person more. We are the only location of our government entity where this rule was enforced.

I made an ADA request. HR got annoyed and forced the head of our office to speak to us about enforcing 4x per week in office because people were making medical requests to work remote more often. This violates our contract and our contract enforcer told me to report this as harassment/retaliation from HR so I did. I am speaking with the CDO.

Flash forward: the VP is granting people flexibility to work remote more in front of my face, yet I was forced to use sick leave for an hour long far away doctors appointment when I could have worked at my parents‚Äô house remote. He told my supervisor that because I requested ADA (separate issue) and that it was denied I‚Äôm not permitted any flexibility like every one else. These are two separate things. I feel isolated and excluded from this privilege. And feel like it‚Äôs my fault that my supervisor is afraid to be flexible and that the spotlight is on me that I tried to do things the official way and am now being punished in multiple ways. I feel excluded. I have to take a sick day for an hour long doctors appointment when I can work outside of our office? Really?

Is any of this illegal or unethical? I had a panic attack and went home. I need support."

Things started out okay, but after 2 of my coworkers (on a 3 person team) quit within 6 months of each other, I knew there was a big problem. That problem is my manager. She is a huge micromanager with expectations that are completely unhinged and unrealistic. She is extremely rude and demanding, and creates an very hostile and stressful work environment. I somehow managed to fly under the radar and just keep my head down and get my work done without being too triggered by her micromanaging tendencies. Our relationship was good, we were friendly and I could come to her when I was overwhelmed, and she would be very understanding. 

Something changed recently. She has completely flown off the handle, and I can see that this is following the same trajectory as what happened to my previous coworkers that quit. I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt eat, I work nights and weekends‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt take it anymore. The pay is really good and I have a wedding coming up. The job industry is messed up right now, and the thought of wedding planning and job searching and not having an income is too much. But so is staying here and losing my sanity. 

I‚Äôm almost 30 years old and have made so much progress in my career. I‚Äôm so scared that I‚Äôll be taking a giant step back by quitting, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. For context, I work as a Project Manager in Los Angeles. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm seeing advice or just here to rant, but I‚Äôm literally so close to losing it. I have a decent savings built up, and if it wasn‚Äôt for my wedding, I would quit without a second thought. Has anyone been in a similar position with a crazy manager? Our company only has 6 employees total, and our team is only me, my manager, and one other person. I know they would be completely screwed without me, so I wonder if telling her I‚Äôm thinking about quitting will help or if it‚Äôll just make things worse. 

If you read this, thank you! If you have any advice, huge thank you!"

They now offered me a director position and invited me for a meeting to discuss the position.
The meeting was with the ceo, who introduced herself, i introduced myself (again, they still had all the paperwork from last time). 
Soon she told me she considered me too young for the position (yes i am only 28, but they should have known that as THEY offered the director position. It was HR that called initially for the offer, but the CEO called me afterwards to schedule the meeting).
We talked about all the responsibilities etc. She kept repeating that she thought i was too young, so after aprox. 30 min i thanked her for the meeting and wished them all the best looking for a suitable candidate.
She suddenly looked surprised and asked me why i suddenly concluded that (yeah no, if you repeat elaborately, multiple times i am to young i get the message). So i told her I can‚Äôt change my age and said they could contact me in the future.

Sidenote: the team leader function is still not filled. 
Afterwards i maybe should have inquired if i missed other necessary qualifications for the job, but as she only kept repeating that my ahe was an issue.

Sidenote 2: i am about to start a team
Leader function at another company closer to home and was quite honest about it.

So why did they even invite me?"

1,2024-05-06,Salary overtime situation,u/TheBurglarOfTurds,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cltonb/salary_overtime_situation/,antiwork,"Story time:



I work as a salaried ""manager"" in a restaurant of a single owner company that has roughly 20 locations. I use quotations because while I am a manager, I pretty much only work in the kitchen since Covid. This is great for me in the sense that I have all the benefits of management, without having to deal with the management BS (call outs in other areas, customer issues, making schedules, etc...). Many of the stores within this company are seasonally busy. Salaried managers are required to work at least 55 hours, and in the summer many routinely work 70-80. I've seen that the Fed is raising the amount at which a salaried employee is eligible for overtime pay, which will be just above my current salary. Last summer I averaged 65 hours in 5 days, and the summer before I averaged 75 hours in 6 days, and worked 80 hours both years during the week of July 4th. There is absolutely no way that this company will pay me $40 an hour for 25-40 hours of overtime a week. So when the new year comes rolling around they will undoubtedly bump my salary up to just over that OT threshold. My questions are: can I legally decline such a raise? If so, can they legally without my consent switch me from salary to hourly? In reality I have no desire to work the overtime and would rather stay at my current salary and just work 40 hours. Any insight would be appreciated. "

The problem is that almost all the veteran employees of that specific team have left. The team last lost 95% of their veterans (only one plans to stay) and a few of the trained replacements have also jumped. The team basically has to start from the ground up again.

Let me put it this way for how dumb of a situation that is for the company. If they had treated the OG workers better, or at least offered the better pay rather than dicking around, the majority would have just stayed.

After working there for just one week, she started nitpicking every single thing I did and would pull me aside for long lectures about how I don't care about my work, how I'm creating more work for others when I should be helping them after all that they do for me, how I need to listen to her because she's my manager, etc. She gets on me for things that literally NOBODY else has had a problem with, and claims I should know better than to be doing... whatever it is I'm doing. She legit gave me a grammar lecture today because I said ""can"" instead of ""may."" She's made vague threats like ""I'll give you one final chance to get this right"" that I imagine imply she wants to fire me.

Performance review 2 - You are on a PIP.

Just a timeline -

Friday - completed work. The mentor asked me to put one screenshot of an image and I did and submitted the work. time = 6:45 pm (already discussed for 45 min). I was already on overtime of 15 minutes (and not getting paid for it).

My mentor asked me to think about the screenshot, I just asked them how to make it work since it doesn't make sense with my current work. Just explain to me how make sense to integrate it with the present work. He couldn't explain to me and asked me to think. So, I thought about it and submitted the completed work according to me.

(Wasn't picked up calls after work )

Leave - 5 days Monday to Friday

Monday to Thursday - nothing crazy happens

Friday - HR (WhatsApp messages) You aren't taking leaves for the upcoming week. I said no.

Saturday - HR & Owner checks my linked profile and sees that I am applying to other jobs.

Monday - Suprise (we are conducting a performance review) - YOU ARE ON A PIP.

and had a discussion with the mentor about the previous work (last to last Friday's work). Still can't provide me with a clear resolution\\explaination as to why I should include the wrong image to make the report higher and that person complained to the manager that I wasn't listening to him and picked up calls after work or during work.

This makes me question - if you are curious and ask the mentor to explain a particular stuff but he explains a whole different stuff and you correct him to explain that particular stuff... i guess that puts you on PIP and you won't be getting paid while you are on it.

I guess they own you for 15k in DELHI... huh

I HAVE A DEADLINE FOR THIS MONTH(MAY) ON PIP - SO BYE-BYE COMPANY?"

2,2024-05-06,Confused,u/tjmcmannus,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cm096s/confused/,antiwork,"I work in healthcare and was told today that I am no longer allowed to pick up extra shifts, despite always being short staffed and being asked by multiple members of management if I can pick up, to which I usually agree to pick up because living is expensive and I generally like having extra money to save away for an ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù fund.
Well, last pay period I had over 120 hours within 2 weeks, average 60 hours a week give or take. Today, when my supervisor was approving time cards, she called me into her office and told me that I would no longer be allowed to pick up extra shifts indefinitely. My problem with that is I genuinely do enjoy my job and haven‚Äôt had too many issues with management in the past, usually things that are quickly resolved. This however feels like a punishment. They said they appreciate how flexible I am and how I‚Äôm willing to pick up any time I‚Äôm needed and available, and how they appreciate the extra help I can provide, which makes them telling me I can‚Äôt pick up even more difficult to really comprehend.
I guess my main thing I‚Äôm wondering is can they even do that? I know I had a lot of OT (over 40 hours in 2 weeks) but how can they go from praising me one week to what feels like punishing me the next? I guess I‚Äôm lost. They say it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre worried about me getting burnt out, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like they just don‚Äôt want to pay OT anymore."

I just had a ü§° conversation with manager that I thought you'd find amusing in this sub. (I'm in the US so I won't need any specific advice on sickness, etc, but thanks!)

Situation:

I've worked at the company for three years in a team with a specific skill. Since starting there, the company has been restrictive, controlling, the rules ridiculous. For example, one employee was given a warning because they had their jacket on their chair. Another employee because they were on the bathroom 2 minutes 'too long' (It isn't even legal in Europe to track toilet times, but whatever...).

The company kept placing more and more restrictions on us in terms of what we could access on the network (currently, not even Google) and it wasn't great working there to begin with. An employee's task at this company is literally to sit and stare at the screen, where 99% of the time nothing is happening. I am not exaggerating when I say this. The job depends on customer interactions, but there are very few customers, so, an employee might receive one interaction per week or less. Some have received none.

All of this is just prelude. I could go on and on and on about other shitty behaviour, like racism, sexism, the constants threats of being fired if we are sick, the ridiculous rigidity with which we are treated, like criminals.

The reason anyone's stayed is the money, which admittedly is very good, especially for doing nothing at all.

On to the kicker, the reason I'm here, posting this:

Sickness.

In my team (specific skill), there are currently 20 employees. Of these 20 employees, 13 are sick to various extents. This can be long term sickness (about 5-7 employees currently), short-term, or some weird thing where you call out one day, work one, call out again the next, continued. Or, you're sick every other week, or twice a month. Now, this is not new. The sickness pattern has been bad (but not this bad, I guess) since shortly after the project started (2 years ago) and it is not just my team, it is every team in the project with about 50-70% illness rate constantly. A few of the managers even called in sick before anyone else started and were gone for months (they started a few months earlier than us regular drudges) with burnout, even though there wasn't really even any work back then. But I digress. You get it. The situation is pretty bad.

We (the grunts) saw this coming for months. We tried endlessly, again and again, to make management aware of WHY people are going on sick leave and what would happen in a few months if things don't change (basically, what would happen NOW).

  
Now, shit has hit the fan, and the company's client (whose project this is) is losing trust in the company being able to handle the project.

No shit, Sherlock.

  
Today, then, I was talking with a manager, because I too had to call in sick. This manager asked me WHY OH WHY is everyone calling in sick, especially in my (specific skill) team.

My response: We told you why over the last few months, and we told you how it would escalate, even predicting what would happen NOW and is happening NOW. Here are some reason: (I listed a few of the worst ones... like we are unable to use our PTO at the moment due to shitty system and shortages... salary is often wrong, like we don't get paid what is owed us for working night shifts...)

Manager: No no no, that's not right. WHY IS EVERYONE CALLING IN SICK?

Me: Ok, well, since you don't believe us and never have, even when we predicted what would happen and it' happened exactly how we said it would, why do YOU think everyone is sick?

Manager, ignoring the question entirely...: Ok, can you write down why you think everyone is sick? (Which I did like... 5 mins ago, this was all in a text chat, scroll up dude...)

Me, at this point more exhausted even though I'd intended to call in sick BUT offer a solution that might work to get me back to work sooner... (which would basically be changing my shift to one that is less noisy/busy/full of internal BS): Ok, I will think on it.

Reader, this is it. I will not make a list, because hundreds of lists have already been made by us grunts, and always been ignored. I will not argue any more, I will just stay on sick leave until I feel better, no questions answered if they come with more stupid shit.

What do you think? They're just willfully ignoring all warnings and advice, and then wondering WHY OH WHY things are happening exactly as everyone but them could see they would.

This isn't even real any more at this point. ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°"

After this my manager told me that things are moving slowly because of me, if I wouldn't have gone for a break then things would have been moving pretty fast.

I worked in a corporate environment and the pressure and stress took a toll on me. I was already struggling badly with anxiety and I decided to quit and take a break. However, I am starting to look for jobs and I am dreading returning to a corporate environment again. I wish I could just not work but I know that‚Äôs impossible. 

I tried to manage my anxiety by setting boundaries in my last job (for example not replying after office hours), but it made people think I was weird or strange, and I could tell that many of them disliked me. In all my previous jobs before that, I was an extremely hard worker and I often stayed beyond office hours, mostly because I was afraid of what people thought of me. However after my anxiety worsened, I decided that I would care less and I stopped putting in so much effort at work. Although I tried to care less, I still felt very anxious. 

I‚Äôm so afraid of returning to a corporate environment again. I think what makes me anxious the most is that work never truly ends, and I feel like I can‚Äôt  ‚Äúswitch off‚Äù once work ends. Although I technically can if I set firm boundaries, but I find that many jobs make it extremely difficult to do so. My mind just keeps running thinking of all the incomplete work and what I need to do the next day. I know that employers don‚Äôt care about you and I should not care as well but my anxiety is terrible and I still find myself struggling so much. I was thinking of looking for a job that doesn‚Äôt require work to be brought home in a sense, but I feel so lost and stuck. 

What can I do to manage my anxiety? How do I deal with being expected to give my entire life to work? "

I work in a city that's about a 30 minute drive from the city I live in, more or less depending on the day. The only reason I work far from home is because my stepdad also works at this place, so it's easy to carpool to and from there.

This year my stepdad has been missing a lot of work for one reason or another, but that's a gripe for another time. He still drives me in the mornings and most days will pick me up.

My end time is NORMALLY at 3. However, I work on a factory. and they seem to love to decide last minute if they need people to stay over or not. Thing is, when I'm getting picked up, my ride is already halfway here when they usually spring it on us last minute. So either I'm forced to stay and my ride just wasted time, gas, and money to get here. OR I leave and risk getting fired. It's literally lose lose for me.

Today I come in and I was told this morning that actually they needed me to stay but they never got to tell me because they got busy around the end of the day. Why are you waiting until THE END OF THE DAY to tell me??? Because it's putting me in a rocky situation. Because my ride is already almost here at this point, are you gonna pay for the gas they just wasted?

Like if I could drive then this would be ENTIRELY different, but I can't. So my stepdad or occasionally my mom comes to pick me up at the normal time, 3:00. I need to be told at LEAST BEFORE 2:30 so I can tell them I'm staying after. I don't feel like I'm asking too much! But when you spring it on me in the last ten minutes, I'm gonna be letting SOMEBODY down.

There are so many things factories do that I hate, I wanna get out of here so badly. The mandatory overtime, the STRICT AS HELL attendance policies, all because they can't keep people so they just try to work the workers they can keep to the bone. Or they just refuse to hire more because it costs them more money, and the higher ups are hurting for money!! Can't you see?! You selfish poor people! (This is a joke obviously.)

Anyways this is just a vent. My life sucks rn and I'm looking elsewhere but I don't know how lucky I'll be lmao."

To be clear, according to standard socialist theory, CEOs are NOT exploited just the same as any other worker is. They don't receive a salary the same as any other worker while the people who have an ownership stake in the company profit off their labor. 

CEOs don't work 100x harder than other workers so they don't deserve their wage. They convince shareholders to pay them a lot by corrupting them. Even if shareholders can fire CEOs instead of paying them a lot, they don't. Ask why. "

The past several years our pay raises have not been keeping up with inflation. HR thought it was a good idea to mass email everyone with a data claiming that things such as Employer Costs should be considered in our total pay. They considered PTO, employer medical contribution, 401K matching, unemployment insurance, company taxes, etc are added to our compensation. With all of those added up, it makes nearly 40% more than my income before taxes and employee costs.

This email has now become demoralizing to everyone in our company and has left many people angry. This sounds like an attempt to softly tell us that there will be no cost of living increase this year. I am already in the bottom 5% when comparing my position and pay to others in my region. The owner of the company is an old boomer and thinks we receive high pay but he compares our wages to that of the 80s when he made the company.

Over the past few years; the company has eliminated bonuses, restructured salesmen‚Äôs compensation, increased product prices, lost business due to poor upper level decisions, and hired useless unqualified people.  Due to this, sales have been decreasing, future business projects are being rejected by the customer, and no one is being held responsible since it‚Äôs a privately owned company.

The zoom interview was on Thursday. They said they'd make a decision early-mid this week. She ended up calling me back Friday morning (earlier than expected) asking for references. I'd actually never had them ask for such specific references before (that they had to both be my previous supervisors) so I needed a bit.

I said that in order for me to start with this company I would need three weeks a year starting that same year because I had planned trips with my family that I would need covered.  They agreed and wrote it into my offer letter that I would receive 3 weeks vacation time at the end of my 90 day probationary period.

Once I was in the position my vacation hours never showed correctly in the app/website we used for requests off and sick days etc.  I asked my supervisor about it and he said not to worry about it, it displays incorrectly for most people and to just take the vacation time I know I have, track it myself and it would be approved.  Which I did, no issues using my 120 hours in 2022 and 2023.

This year my company is switching apps to a new one and sent me a breakdown of my hours and how they were accrued/used that showed I would only receive 90 hours this year.  When I asked why HR told me that because I was hired in April I used more hours than I had accrued.  I explained the situation about hours never showing correctly and that my offer letter AND supervisor confirmed I should have 120 hours.

This was forwarded to the head of HR and after some back and forth she sent the following:

""(Arkavien),

I understand your concern regarding the vacation policy, and I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this has caused.

Upon reviewing your attached offer letter, I acknowledge that it indeed states you are eligible for three weeks of vacation at the completion of your probationary period.

¬†
I appreciate that you verified the details with (Supervisors Name) for clarification. I apologize for any miscommunication or inconsistency you may have experienced regarding your hours and vacation entitlement.
¬†
To ensure clarity and fairness for all employees, our vacation policy is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how vacation time is earned and utilized. While your offer letter specifies the entitlement, the policy elaborates on the process of accruing and utilizing vacation time.

If you have any further questions or concerns regarding the vacation policy or your entitlement, please feel free to reach out to me directly.

So today I see that they posted the job again. Why the fuck did they lie to me?!? I'm an adult; I can take rejection if it isn't a great fit, and that is fine. It just pisses me off.

Coworker saw an invoice they weren't meant to see. Did some digging and found a couple more. Basically, the owner of the company is charging customers 20% gratuity and a separate service fee, but we are not getting the full 20%. 

When my coworker brought it up to the owner, they doubled down on it. Saying that ""they have to get paid too."" But charging $2000 just for grat and only giving the team $1000 for tip pool? What the hell?

My thing is even if they're only planning to give us like 1000 for grat, fine. But it should be invoiced that way. The customer thinks we're ballin out here but we're not.

Yesterday, I was sent an email asking for availability to help in the same 2 cities and I suspect this is a back handed way for my management to add these locations to my work load.   While I don‚Äôt mind helping as a one off trip, I am staying firm that I am not going to absorb any more of GA.

- That it was extremely unprofessional of me to ask her to try to avoid last-minute newsletters for next time. And that when her boss asks her for last-minute tasks, she 'rolls up her sleeves and just do it''. 

- That I should think before asking her questions because often the answer is easy (no it's not), and that it was taking a lot of her time to find the answers for me

- That I should be  an 'investigator' and 'dig deeper' instead of being just an 'executant'. For example when writing a newsletter about new website functionalities, that I should ask other employees to make sure that the information is not just passed on, but full-blowned detailed. (as in, long-ass company emails that no one reads entirely)

When I asked if I they were considering firing me, she said NOT FOR NOW, but I could do much more. She said that it was obvious that I preferred having answers from her instead of 'investigate by myself'. She added that this attitude was the opposite of OWNERSHIP. 

The icing on the cake:

SHE SAID THAT I WAS DOING A GOOD JOB, BUT NOT TAKING IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

This is the exact same reason she fired my other 2 coworkers.

So, I'm starting job searching NOW, but also,

I‚Äôd be up until 2am doing AP Chemistry lab prep homework once a week. I worked in the summers mowing lawns and doing other outdoor maintenance. I didn‚Äôt have many summer ‚Äúvacations‚Äù in high school. 

In college it was more of the same. I majored in biomedical engineering and completed a 5 year masters program. I worked every summer doing my maintenance work so I‚Äôd have some money in my bank account.

When I graduated college at 23, I got a good job. I worked a lot more than I needed to, thinking it would help climb the ladder. I aggressively paid down my debt and car loan. I got 3 weeks off a year. 

Now I‚Äôm 28. Debt free, good start on savings and retirement. Probably around top 10% for my age when it comes to finances. I did everything ‚Äúright‚Äù, but I‚Äôm totally burned out. In the last 12 years I sacrificed all that time to get a helpful degree and get myself in a good position financially, but I‚Äôm already ready to be done. I have so many working years ahead of me and I can hardly come up with the bare minimum day to day effort needed to do my job at this point. 

Sometimes I fantasize about just quitting and letting myself actually live for a little while. I could probably go 6 or 7 years before I run out of money. Even 1 year off doing what I want to do feels like it would change my life. But I feel like I need to just keep grinding and building so I can retire at an early age. 

Then I take 10 big steps back and realize how fucked this all is. From the time I was a young boy I was told doing what I‚Äôve done will make my successful and lead to a happy life. Sure I may be ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù, but I rarely have the time or energy to do what I want. That‚Äôs not a life. "

So I was on a work trip out-of-state with upper management (C-suite, department heads, executives) and my colleagues (middle management). No one lived at the destination, so everyone had to either drive or were bussed into the remote town. The SVP is also from my same city, so theirs and mine (along with the colleagues from my city) all bussed to the airport and flew out the same day when leaving the remote town days later. I mention this early on because I want it to be know that we were all around one another, not only during the trip but upon leaving as well. 

The first night in the remote town, we had a happy hour/meet and greet. The SVP, a colleague, and my self were all chatting and catching up. The SVP mentions an irritation on their chest - it was visibly red and appeared inflamed. They were clearly very uncomfortable and itchy. I happened to pack a prescription hydrocortisone cream because you never know I guess (I have it for a couple of sensitive skin reasons).

It was understood that I‚Äôd get it to them following the event that night, and it would be returned to me before departure from the remote town. Not only did this SVP not proactively communicate that they got the tube (which I did my best to slide under their hotel door) but they didn‚Äôt return it to me before departure. They did eventually thank me, but not of their own accord. Only after I had asked if they got it. There were ample opportunities to not just show gratitude but to return the cream; we have each others cell phone numbers, so out of discreetness I text them while on the bus saying that I do need the cream back and I hopped it helped. 

This is a brief version of course but the fact that it‚Äôs been a month since departure and I still don‚Äôt have the prescription back says SO MUCH. My husband asked me why I‚Äôm so nice to people (this person hasn‚Äôt impressed me with their entitled nature on prior engagements) and I just can‚Äôt help helping someone in need. Lo and behold I had to get a refill. Thankfully my dermatologist just called it in. Oh yeah, the tube was barely used too so I basically bought two tubes back to back. 

I mean, I don‚Äôt care if you are above or below me on the corporate food chain. What they did is downright wrong, but especially so because they‚Äôre at the top!"

Im 23, i work in sales for a corporate company. I spend 10hrs, 6 days a week, 290 days a year hunched over a computer screen. What for? I make 4 dollars per hr.

Obviously i dont live in the US, but nor do i live in a third world country where 4 dollars per hr is reasonable. What i make is bare minimum, no its just below bare minimum of what i need to live.
After rent, cell service and transportation, im left with barely enough money to eat.

I dont have a social life, the work place is toxic, everyone is underpayed and poverty makes people do whatever it takes to survive. I dont have friends outside work because i moved to a different country recently (hoping to get better pay).

My mental health has been a wreck for the past two years and i dont even have any goals anymore. I live because im not dead yet and id prefer not to do it myself.

There are things that i used to do by myself but i dont have the time anymore.
The commute to and fro work takes up two hrs and i work for 10. Im left with 12 more hrs and i need to sleep for at least 6.
I take meds for insomnia, its hard to fall asleep but when i do, its harder to wake up.
The remaining 6 hours i lay down in pain scrolling through my phone and maybe getting some chores done.

I failed as a friend, i failed as a lover, im a bad son and a bad brother. Im just a burden on my parents who've put up with me so much.

Im thinking about disappearing, moving back to the third world country and starting a new life where im not a corporate slave, nor a burden on my family. One man doesn't need much to live. My experience and qualifications would be obsolete where i plan to go. I have a very particular set of unofficial skills that will help me survive that place. 

Only thing holding me back is the potential aftermath of my absence, it would be hard on my family. Going with their blessing is ideal, but very improbable.

I imagine a life where i dont have to work with shackles on me, tied down to corporations and capitalism gnawing at me. I dont wanna make some douche bag rich anymore. I wanna work for myself no matter how little i make, ill make do with it and improvise. 

Away from the cities and towns, in a secluded rural village, ill build my own.
Or atleast thats what ive been thinking.

Gtg ive got work early in the morning."

So, by now, most everyone knows about Noem, Governor of South Dakota and her new book coming out, where she talks about how she shot her 14-month old pointer. Now, the story itself is bad enough, but her defense of her actions is honestly worse.   


In the excerpt I read, it talks about how she saw the dog having so much fun chasing after birds instead of pointing at them, and she was furious and decided to kill it. In her follow up defense, she takes care to point out that it was a WORKING dog, not a pet, and it wasn't doing the work it was trained to. I would personally call that a distinction without a difference, but the point is that for Noem, she saw a living thing having fun instead of working, enjoying life, and her first reaction was anger. So much anger that she decided to shoot it in the face instead of literally anything else. 

&#x200B;

Noem tries to spin it as ""making the hard choice"" but honestly, it was the quick and easy choice. She already stated how much she hated the dog, and so the HARD choice would have been retraining it properly, you know, putting in the actual work. But because the dog was happier doing anything other than what she told it to, it had to die. I can't help but feel like this is a window to how she sees people. If they aren't working, or happier doing anything OTHER than work, then they're worthless and deserve to die. And this is a woman who wants to be vice president."

1,2024-05-07,Boss sits me down for chat 6 weeks after the issue‚Ä¶.,u/gatsbied,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cmjlj2/boss_sits_me_down_for_chat_6_weeks_after_the_issue/,antiwork,"I need to rant so strap in for a long one. TL;DR at the end.

So for context I have a protected disability where I am living/working that requires the company make reasonable accommodation for me when needed. My management team are all aware of this, and in the past accommodation has been made when I‚Äôve needed it.

In February/March I experienced a really bad flare up. Because of this I was working on switching medications and generally not doing too hot. I was very up front with my management team about what I was experiencing and made sure I documented everything and had the proper signatures from medical professionals. Over the course of 4 weeks I ended up taking 4 sick days‚Ä¶2 one week, then nothing for 2 weeks, then 2 the 4th week. After my second round of days off my manager said he‚Äôd like to meet with me to discuss our attendance policy. He also arranged with me to meet with HR independent of him which I thought was strange.

I should at this point add that I had plenty of sick time to cover my absence. I have been at the company for over 5 years and accumulated almost 100 hours sick time in my tenure. We accrue 80 hours every year so while I have used sick time since being here, I still have plenty.

The meeting with HR was fine. They basically looked at what I had on file and confirmed they saw no issues. I also reaffirmed with HR at this time that there was no stated attendance policy, which there is not.

I get my medication figured out and the flare up goes away so it‚Äôs back to business as usual. The meeting with my boss never materializes, but he‚Äôs a blow hard who likes to swing d*ck sometimes so I figure he‚Äôd moved on.

This morning I get a teams message to meet my boss and supervisor in a conference in the next 5 minutes. I know what this is going to be so I‚Äôm shaking before I even get in there.

He starts by insisting I‚Äôm not in trouble but as my manager he needed to ‚Äúhave a conversation about March‚Äù. A lot of reassurances I‚Äôm not in trouble and I‚Äôm a ‚Äújoy to have on the team‚Äù. Talks about how I‚Äôm a top performer and they don‚Äôt want to lose me, but keeps sliding back in to basically that wasn‚Äôt cool bro. He mentions pulling my login data for my laptop (we work a hybrid schedule, don‚Äôt have a punch clock) and stops just short of telling me why but it‚Äôs obvious. He wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt committing time theft the days I have been wfh.

So instead of accommodating sick time for me when I needed it, he was looking for reasons to fire me.

The kicker is when my manager explains he ultimately decided to hold this meeting because my 2 coworkers complained back in March and he promised to talk to me. These are people I‚Äôve worked with for at least 4 years and people I considered personal friends. Boy, was I wrong. I didn‚Äôt get the specific of what the complaints were, but the only thing I can think is that they had to come in office to cover for me, one each week that I was sick. So to clarify they each were forced in office 1 unscheduled day in this whole 4 week period to cover me.

I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶gobsmacked. Obviously I‚Äôm updating my resume and starting the search but like‚Ä¶since the meeting I‚Äôve had my headphones in and buried myself in my work. My one coworker tried to strike up friendly conversation and I just smiled and put my headphones in. I may be acting unprofessional and I feel bad for that but really. I‚Äôm out.

TL;DR: boss gets mad at me for taking available sick time to manage disability. Coworkers complain and boss looks for reasons to fire me. Waits 6 weeks after the fact to ‚Äúhave a chat‚Äù. Death of a productive employee.

17,2024-05-07,"Found out my underperforming coworker makes $3/hr more than me. It's her first job, I have ~10 years of experience.",u/doggy_brat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cmleau/found_out_my_underperforming_coworker_makes_3hr/,antiwork,"Started a new job two months ago in after school childcare with a well respected national organization, hired at $17/hr. Not much, but I need to pay my bills somehow, and I had been job hunting for six months.

Yesterday my coworker (20 y/o, college freshman, graduated last June from HS) was saying she didn't get paid enough for this job because $20/hr is too low.

I have been in childcare or another field working closely with children pretty much since I turned 18. This is reflected on my resume, it was brought up in the interview, etc.

She said that was what she was offered, she didn't negotiate it at all, they just gave her that on hire. 

It pisses me off to no end not just because she has no experience at all, not even babysitting or anything similar, but because she is HORRIBLE at this job. She is constantly checking her phone, she swears around the kids frequently, she spends most of her shift complaining about nonsense to me instead of watching the kids. She doesn't even know how to make sure a document is the correct size before printing it, every time she tries to print a coloring sheet out for a kid I have to take the computer and do it myself because she will just print it out even if it comes out the size of a quarter. I have tried to show her multiple times how to resize something, but she just will not pay attention.

Not to mention that she is constantly late, and never tells anyone that she's going to be late. Two weeks ago she came in nearly 2.5 hours late to a 3.5 hour shift (2pm to 5:30PM scheduled, she showed up at 4:20pm), and had the audacity to ponder if she should stay an extra half hour or if she should just leave in an hour when she was scheduled to be off. 

Our supervisor had called out that day, my only other coworker that was there was off at 5:30. I had to tell her that she HAD to stay the extra half hour (all of our kids are gone by 6pm when we close) because otherwise I would have ended up alone with a child at the end of the day, which is super against company policy. She spent the whole 1.5 hours she was actually there just complaining.

Yesterday she pulled something similar, coming in at 3:30 and leaving at 5:30, despite being scheduled to start at 2. My supervisor had no idea if she was coming or not, because again, she hadn't bothered to tell anyone she was going to be late. 

I genuinely think the only reason she hasn't been fired is because we don't have enough workers. Her and I are the only two consistent staff at our site, not including our site lead/supervisor. 

Oh, and this is the same job which gives every staff at a school site (we operate like 10+ different site with anywhere from 3 to 10+ staff per site) exactly 0 breaks for our entire shifts. 

Yes, you read that right, none of us get breaks, ever. Super illegal in my state, where if we work 3.5 hours or more (""A majority of 4 hours"" I think is the law) we are required to have a 10 minute break. The only time anyone gets a break is if by some freak chance they're working enough to be required by the state to take a lunch, which doesn't happen pretty much ever to anyone that isn't HR level or above, because the longest shifts any of us are scheduled are 5.5 hours once a week when we're there 12:30  - 6PM at most, and most people don't work that full shift. They stronghand you into signing a lunch waiver to waive a lunch if you're between 5 and 5.5 hours of a shift upon hiring, by saying you still get a 10 minute break. Even our company manuals say we get breaks, because that's the law.

Genuinely sick of this, but can't leave unless I find another job, and I can't find another job that's local enough for me to be able to walk there that actually will even interview me because of how bad the job market is right now, hence the 6 month gap between this and my last job. "

Ironically from a manager who is known for having an attitude. I thought I was forced to work, not work and be gleeful about it. I have also been called into the office and told that I need to ""smile more"" and ""act happy"", cause fuck actual morale boosting. Fuck wondering ""hey are we the problem?"". It seems like they just rely on the fact they have a lot of applicants as a retail store, so they don't really have to care who they burn out or how toxic everything feels.

Doesn't help I feel like I'm doing way more work than when I first started. And there's been no change to pay or position, still getting 20 cents above minimum. But they can also cut entire shifts while making almost a million dollars in a week just for our store alone. 

Our scheduling is so bad, one call-out can screw everything, and it's already bad enough without them. I can't be in the bathroom for a few minutes without getting a call to do something cause there's apparently no one else.

It seems like the store manager always attempts to guilt people and make them feel bad about it, which is likely why a lot of people call out before he would arrive. But now they also try to make people who call wait for him to show up if he's not at the store yet, even if waiting till then would be considered too late to call.

And they wonder why our turnover is so high and everyone is stressed the hell out, on drugs, or both."

I'm not against colleagues going to upper management and advocating on their own behalf.

Had i known I would've objected to this person taking credit for leading when they don't actually do any leading.



This coworker intentionally obfuscated this proposal so when the decision came out it appears to originate from the higher ups, not my colleagues original idea. To me it seems a bit subversive and covert, kind of untrustworthy and not a team centric approach, and not a great precedent to set. 

 

How would you respond to finding out about this proposal? Should I confront this person immediately and tell them to not speak on my behalf or adjust my title without my knowledge. Or should I let it slide and let my work speak for itself? Or should I approach the higher ups? "

We see a ton of problems with literacy, general competency, motivation, and punctuality.

About half of the company is constantly turning over because we have some decent positions like the one I'm in, there's some 'lifers' in the bottom rungs, and the rest are constantly quitting and being hired with a revolving door of trash.  I make no exaggeration when I say I include ""You are not allowed to piss in garbage cans, nor are you allowed to shit in a shower drain and stomp it down with your feet"".  Again, that's not a joke, that's been an ongoing fucking problem.  I've had these guys no-show their first day because for some reason they expected someone was going to come pick them up and drive them to work every day.  Everybody is allowed to eat pork on their lunch break, no we do not have a segregated lunchroom for ""Halal"" or whatever lunches to ""protect you"" from bacon.

What's the company's solution?  ""Just OJT bro"".  Fuck off, almost every single person who shows up is totally unqualified for the position they're in, and half of them are untrainable.  So I've just stopped, unless they show a basic level of initiative and competence.  I'll let them just make asses of themselves infront of clients, piss off other contractors who then complain up the ladder, and hopefully get that solved.

Having dealt with some decent managers and some horrible ones I've tried to apply those experiences, along with lessons from this sub, to my own management style.  At times I catch myself wondering if I'm being too lax or not taking enough intiative and I wanted to reach out to others on here in a similar position and see how they're doing. Am I using the excuse to be a ""better"" manager in today's world to avoid actually managing? I believe employees are adults and at least somewhat qualified for their positions and don't need a babysitter.

Some highlights:

* I never question or deny an employee if they have to leave early, arrive late, or take days off. Taking time to deal with a child or partner, no hesitation, do whatever you need.
* Similarly, I had an employee need a week for bereavement. The following week they said they were sick and asked if they could stay out a few more days. I said yes but I found myself thinking, ""Is this person taking advantage of me/the company? Should I push back?"" Then I realized I've been in similar situations and there's nothing urgent enough to demand they come in or even work from home. I felt vindicated when they said they appreciated having that time without being hassled about it.
* When it comes to our annual reviews I try to keep then as positive as possible. I've found these kinds of things are largely pointless. I also want to ensure they get as much a bonus and annual raise as possible.
* As long as work gets done and things are handled, I don't feel the need to check in all the time. I probably should be more involved than I am, but not to the extent we have one on one meetings every week. Maybe at least once a month? If they have any sort of problem or question I'm always quick to respond and help them out."

When I brought it up again, the manager seemed concerned but took no action. Now, they're changing the forum structure, reducing reps and forbidding discussion on employee morale or company satisfaction.

The company I work for has a monthly employee forum in which you can talk about things your department thinks might make their jobs easier, better, more efficient, etc. Problems raised are aimed to be fixed by the next meeting. Each department has a representative, with some larger departments having a few.

I was the representative for my department and had been for the past 5 months. In one of the meetings, I mentioned that people across all departments don't feel valued by the company. They feel pressured and underpaid, and don't feel the benefit of the ""this is an employee owned company"" line. Representatives from three other departments agreed with me and said they noticed the same thing. A couple days later, like a scene from ""Clich√© Things Bosses Do"" boxes of chocolates appeared in the staff room.

Within a week I was called into a meeting with a company director who told me that what I said went straight to the Employee Trust board and the Company board. He assured me that staff happiness was at the top of his priorities. I asked if the chocolates were because of the points I raised at the forum, he said that they definitely weren't ""that was in the pipeline already"". 

Next month, the forum rolled around again. At the end of the meeting, the manager who leads the meetings went over last month's points to give updates, ask if they were fixed or need more work, etc. 

*""So last month, staff morale was brought up. As I'm sure you've noticed, for a week now we've been leaving out chocolates and other nice treats in the staff room. Has everyone had a chance to grab some? How is everyone feeling now? How are you departments feeling? Happy?""*

She went round the room asking each representative. When she got to me I said that while I haven't noticed things getting worse, I definitely haven't noticed them getting any better. Her face dropped. She said something about needing to look into it again and that was it. 

Until a couple weeks ago when they notified us out of the blue that the way they run the Employee Forum is changing. The 20 representatives were being replaced by 10 representatives would be voted in. It would apparently run very much the same as before, except with one key difference.

360,2024-05-07,I hate how in order for you to keep your job you have to be likable,u/kelpkelpers,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cmnxyk/i_hate_how_in_order_for_you_to_keep_your_job_you/,antiwork,"I've noticed for the interview process, for potential raises and promotions, and even hours and job security, you have to be likable and it's fucking draining. The interviewer cares less about how skillful you are and more about how likable they find you. If they don't find you likable your chances of getting a job are slim... and as someone who is ugly, has anxiety, avoidant tendencies, and is generally mistrusting of people... im not the most likable person and this has affected me in every job I've had

Usually it would start off with complaints from coworkers to managers saying they didn't want to work with me because they didn't like me even though I was respectful to them I just don't try to open up as much out of fear of being seen as annoying or being bullied so I stay to myself and get my work done and if someone needs my help I'm open to helping them

But this would make mangers schedule me less to the point I was barely on the schedule. New hires who were better looking and as a result more likable were promoted in a couple months... while I wasn't even considered 

I often fear losing my job due to not being seen as likable enough by coworkers and managers and it adds an extra level of stress to my life because it makes it feel like as if I not only have to do the job I was hired to do to a phenomenal degree, but I also have to do a job I'm not even paid to do which is make people LIKE ME ... and that shit is soooo hard and draining to do because one minute someone can like you and the next day they aren't feeling you too much .. so I generally always found it better to only talk to people who talk to me and mostly stay to myself... but in the work world that's seen as such a problem 

I hate how having a job is essentially high school all over again and about who is the most likable "

Before this I was close over the limit of having call ins until I checked all of them & seen my manager made false claims on days I worked that I supposably wasn‚Äôt there when I did. I reported to hr & they fixed it and told me I was at a lower number of occurrences. 
All of a sudden I‚Äôm over the number of occurrences. I‚Äôve had bullying issues at that job & have had issues cause I‚Äôm quiet person that keeps to myself. 
I am a single parent living only on my income.  I am filing for unemployment but in the mean time, I‚Äôll be applying for jobs.

I was so unhappy with the way i was treated in a previous position, i started looking for a new job, uploaded my resume and got an interview. The guy interviewed me and i was very honest with why i was leaving my previous job, i told him about the way i felt disrespected, he was so kind and understanding, said that he had been treated badly before by a boss and even got kind of emotional during the interview saying that i would never have to worry about being treated that way.

Fast forward to me actually starting, i was so excited. Then he tells me i have to earn my full access into the system to make sales, that i will not have the access everyone else does, and only am able to do the bottom of the barrel stuff, he says i can have access when i ""deserve it""

I start talking to some of my coworkers after frustration was building, they started opening up to me about how the boss is absolutely terrible, that he calls to harass them almost everyday, he cusses and demeans them and even makes sexual comments to one of my female coworkers, making her so uncomfortable she refuses to go into the office for any kind of meeting

Now the harassing started with me.
Constantly calling me on my personal phone telling me how useless i am because l'm not making him enough money, i told him i really need full access to do more and he tells me i don't deserve it, he calls 5-6 times a day just to berate me, now he's threatening to fire me in these calls, i started with a group of new hires and am the only one left. He fired all of them, and every time he fires someone he sends an email out to the whole office about it and says terrible things about the person fired.

I also have a medical disability, he‚Äôs pushing me so hard it‚Äôs starting to affect my health and he literally told me he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt give a shit what‚Äôs wrong with me‚Äù.

My coworkers have all told me they have similar conversations where he berates them and tells them they're worthless, that he does off the deep end and starts acting erratic, i just cried today after he called me, i feel so stuck.
I realized i have never once in my adult life had a boss that was kind to me. That has ever said a kind word or been supportive to me. It makes me start to have really depressing thoughts, i feel worthless and so stuck. My partner has such a wonderful boss who is so kind and supportive, they've had their differences but has never been treated the way i have and can't even begin to understand.

I'm not even sure why im writing this, just feel so stuck and burnt out. "

I suffered a mental health crisis that precluded me from work for two weeks. I won't go into the details of that, just that medication wasn't available in conjunction with personal issues. A perfect storm. During this period, my employer directed me to file a leave of absence with Sedgwick, the third party that handles these things for the company I work for.  
I filed the requested documents, and fortunately, had an appointment with the VA so I could get my PCP to sign off on my condition that is covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  
I called today to check on the status of my claim, and was told it was denied due to not having corroborating medical documentation.  
My case worker has not contacted me. This would be the same caseworker I had asked be removed and have me reassigned as I found them rude and dismissive. I requested that weeks ago.  
While I can appeal, after I discuss this with the caseworker, that still gives me 30 days during the appeal process.  
I'm requesting documents from my previous PCP that has my diagnosis well documented.  
As my caseworker has not contacted me, I don't know what other corroborating documents they need. The only thing I can think of is that they weren't able to get in touch with my VA PCP to verify the info I submitted.  
I don't know what to do. All I know is that I need to find a new job in 30 days. Suing wouldn't really help in the short term with rent and various other bills, and it's a major corporation so more than likely doomed to fail if I pursue that course of action."

That puts a huge dampener on quitting. You have to find a job that's ok with you not joining immediately. 

He recently joined a smaller company. Said company didn't have ten layers between him and management. He was happy. Everyone was promoting the ""we're all friends"" vibe. 

Since the company is small, they get kicked around by their clients unlike bigger firms. He was concerned they weren't doing enough to keep their clients happy. As a client manager, he'd seen almost all the clients he managed be unhappy with their services. He had brought this up to leaders but was ignored. 

Well, you saw the title. He was fired. The company recently started asking people to fill out time sheets. He hated it from day one. Always said you can't gauge how useful an employee is by how many hours they've charged which is true. And besides, everyone lies on time sheets anyway.

Recently, his biggest client disengaged and demanded a refund due to how unhappy they were. That's because of a terrible contract they signed that wasn't clear on what they were getting. Not his fault. But because of it, he found himself unable to charge hours anywhere. He brought this up to his manager and asked to be assigned more work. Never tried to hide it or anything. 

Instead, what did they do? They went through a restructuring which is just another way of saying a new boss came in to cut costs. And what do all new bosses do to cut costs? You guessed it, let's fire a few people. They went through the time sheets and picked him because he wasn't charging enough hours. Because *they* screwed up a contract. A contract that was signed before he was hired.

He was called into a meeting and informed. Wasn't given a chance to defend himself in any way. Management had already made their decision. They needed to find a certain number of people to fire and he was caught in the net. He was told at around noon and his access was already deactivated by 5 pm. Funny how different it is compared to the one month he would've been forced to work if he had chosen to quit. 

Let it never be said that incompetence and idiocy is restricted to huge firms with a dozen layers of middle management. This whole experience really soured him on joining a small firm ever again. He's now even more sure he wants to quit working for firms asap and strike out on his own. "

Mainly because it is a direct service practice working with marginalized communities, and the workload can sometimes get extremely excessive. I have to travel all throughout California and sometimes the East Coast. I‚Äôve interviewed for various jobs and have been offered various positions. The most recent one I was/am very interested in; I understood it would come with a pay cut and a learning curve. I‚Äôm waiting on an offer, however I learned today this has no WFH option and no opportunity to for an Alternate Work Schedule: 4/10 or 1 day off every other week. Quite frankly, these are the worklife balances that I need. 

This new position would be one that also is working with marginalized communities however it is a voluntary not mandatory program so it appears the stress levels are much lower. I‚Äôve had three interviews and I‚Äôm at the last step before an official offer is presented so I‚Äôm trying to make final decisions. My husband agreed it would be a huge change with no WFH or AWS. We have a 1.5 year old puppy and this would mean doggy day care which would cut further into my pay cut. I can‚Äôt see myself being at the office 5 days a week and then not having a flexible schedule. 

My thoughts: While I am unhappy right now I don‚Äôt want to jump into something I am already feeling hesitant about. Right now aside from the traveling I can WFH, I am off every other Friday and have an awesome supervisor. I am feeling I should hang in there and wait until something with more flexibility presents itself.

I just ignore it and go to change the trash, now obviously there is garbage in it because it hasn‚Äôt been changed, she then proceeds to tell me this is unacceptable I need to be changing this everyday

Again no big deal I let her know I do change it everyday and this is the only time I‚Äôve forgotten, as this is the only incident with this happening 

She then asks if I ‚Äúwipe my butt everyday‚Äù so I turn to her and tell her I don‚Äôt like how she‚Äôs speaking to me

She then asks me if I‚Äôm going to cry about it, so I just drop everything and say you deal with it I‚Äôm going home

She then is yelling for me to come back here and that we are going to the office and I just say nope I‚Äôm going home

I leave and she calls me while I‚Äôm driving and I just ignore her

We‚Äôll see how this plays out tomorrow when I go in"

My coworker has no idea what we talked about. Well she said I was busy getting all sad with HR to get people's approval once I got my medical leave which she claims I get every year for the summer LOL. It did happen two times but first of all that's none of her business but also the last time I went was due to surgery. I don't know what her problem is but she's lunatic. Last week she even told me ""It's my turn this year. We know you go every year but im going this time"" and I was like, I don't go every year? (I've been there 5 years now) She stubbornly said I did even though that's bs. I told her whether i went or not is unrelated to her she is free to get a medical leave if she needs one and that I encourage her to go if that's the case. What the HELL is her problem with me? I understand there is an element of jealousy here obviously, but why is she suddenly attacking me like this over something so dumb. Nothing happened between us, we've been close (or so i thought) for a year now. I confided in her several times and now she's using my mental health issues as a weapon for no reason. Like i dont care, go on your medical leave. Go get it sis I'll be damn happy you're not around to shit on me.

I‚Äôve been working at this marketing agency for almost 4 years, and to say that my boss was a micromanager would be the understatement of the century. Constantly breathing down my neck, expecting immediate responses to emails no matter the time of day, and moving the goalposts on every project. Oh, and let's not forget the unreasonable deadlines that would leave us all working late into the night, basically giving up our personal lives.

Recently, he announced some absurd new policy where we had to be available on Slack even during our lunch breaks. Apparently, our ‚Äúclients need us 24/7.‚Äù As if our lives revolved around clients 24/7. I confronted him about this, and he shrugged it off, saying something like ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs going through tough times, and this is what it takes to keep clients happy.‚Äù Like, I‚Äôm sorry, but ‚Äútough times‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean you get to exploit your workers, especially when the guy is rolling up in a brand-new Mercedes AMG GT the following week.

After months of putting up with his BS, I had enough. I wrote my resignation letter and gave him my two weeks‚Äô notice. The look on his face was priceless. He couldn‚Äôt believe it, kept saying things like ‚ÄúBut we need you here!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe can work this out!‚Äù Like, no man, you don‚Äôt get to disrespect people, use them like workhorses, and then expect loyalty. I‚Äôm not your loyal steed.

His final attempt to convince me to stay was offering a raise, which was like a slap in the face considering he knew I was being paid way below the industry standard. When I turned it down, he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making a huge mistake, and you‚Äôll regret this decision.‚Äù Maybe in his twisted capitalist world, where workers exist only to inflate his wallet, leaving a toxic job is a mistake.

Now, two months later, I‚Äôve found a new job where I‚Äôm respected, paid fairly, and not treated like a disposable cog. It‚Äôs a stark reminder that sometimes quitting is the best thing you can do for yourself. Life‚Äôs too short to put up with bosses who think they own your soul.

Anyone else got stories of bosses losing their minds when you finally stand up for yourself and walk out the door?"

I am laying in bed thinking about my job right now and how I need to let this off of my chest. (Anxiety) 

I started working for a clothing company in January. It‚Äôs quite high end. Suits range from $1,500-5,700. But we mostly sell shirts and jackets. 

This store is a few months old in the state I‚Äôm from. It first opened interstate over a decade ago. 

I thought I‚Äôd get back into fashion sales, I was offered a management role, was excited, yay. 

Monthly budget since I started in January was round 80-100k. 

If reached, I would receive $500 commission including two other staff members excluding one because apparently she‚Äôs a contractor even though she generates great money. 

I tried hitting targets, I was close, 77k out of the 80 that month. All stores were making less than half a month. (Including flagship)

Last month I made 90k out of the 98 budget. We Made more than two stores combined. I said budget is too high, was told it‚Äôs not. 

I am feeling cheated, it‚Äôs not a busy store, it hasn‚Äôt been marketed and I am trying my best for a boss that is stingy af. Once the boss visited recently I was gifted a shirt that was from one of the collections 10 years ago. 

We‚Äôre constantly being watched on cameras also, I don‚Äôt know about ya‚Äôll but that freaks me out. I am being controlled with how I should speak to staff, insisted to be added into a WhatsApp group between staff and I‚Ä¶. This boss has screenshot the store and sent it to us because we didn‚Äôt add a sign on the door that we will be back. 

I have no authoritative relationships with my staff because he controls the whole joint ( I only started doing rosters recently)

On Sundays I work alone (take a guess why) boss gets annoyed that the shop is closed for lunch break. Most of the hours in the day I‚Äôm alone, working, bored.

A system of unjust abstraction, oppression, and legal fraud, by which the most useful classes of society are drained of their wealth, and consigned over to eternal toil and never-ending slavery.


It rings as true today as it did 200 years ago.


Getting a job is seen as one of the highest goals in life. We prepare our kids (if you can afford to have kids) to spend the majority of their waking hours in an undemocratic institution where they serve and are accountable to a master.


Work is good for you - that's the hegemonic common sense that is touted by conservatives and liberals across the whole spectrum.


Insofar as we're talking about wage labor, that's like saying slavery is inherently good for you. Subjugation is not healthy, no matter how much we're told it is.


Work is not good for you. It's a necessary function in our society one has to perform in order to survive (at least those not born into the rentier classes). No one, if they had the choice, would spend several hours travelling to work every single day, waking up at ungodly hours, to be told what to do by a boss all day long while they sit in a cubicle listlessly staring at the same four corners they've seen for years on end performing stressful or menial tasks. Renting yourself to sell your labor is always out of necessity, not choice, even if our schools and culture continuously tells us otherwise and is trying its best to condition people into becoming pliable, productive workers at the expense of their humanity.


---------------


What's actually good for you:


- Cultivating healthy and authentic human relationships
- Being creative and ""working"" on something that genuinely means something to you
- Having a routine that's under your terms and can be flexible to accomodate your life
- Mutual collaboration without rigid heirarchies
- Being spontaneous and having novel experiences
- Being in control of your life and choices
- Having shelter and your basic needs met


If you are lucky and in the small minutiae of workers you may find a job that fulfils some or all of the criteria above. However, being at the mercy of finding a good employer in order to live a meaningful life is not a healthy or functional system. Especially when the system promotes selfishness and ruthlessness. Sometimes the state will step in and ensure that some of the above needs are met, however that's not a guarantee. It's especially not a guarantee in a system where capital and the rentier classes bribe politicians, fund think tanks to set the agenda, and own the presses in order to police the spectrum of what kind of ideas are acceptable and newsworthy.


What work actually does:


- Isolates you from your purpose and meaning in life
- Perpetuates the unfair conditions of the rentier system one was born into
- Dehumanises you into a performative role that's often lacking genuine human interaction
- Promotes and strives for endless productivity increases which is at odds with a finite planet and contributes majorly to global warming and biodiversity collapse



At the best of times in a Capitalist system - when the labor movement is strong and has momentum - a job can afford you a house and some tangible long-term stability at the expense of your dignity. Over the last 50 years, that's collapsed, and starting a family let alone affording your own home seems like a Utopian pipe dream to many in the West who live paycheck-to-paycheck in extremely precarious positions.


It's little wonder that so many people, as a means of trying to avoid the ""grind"", choose to work for themselves and it's culturally recognised as something that is admirable and good. Working for yourself means you have flexibility in the hours you choose, you have choice in the kind of work you do and ultimately you reap more of the value from the labor you sow. The problem is, under capitalism you ultimately do this at the expense of other people. Selfishness, competitiveness and a lack of empathy are traits that are oft encouraged and can propel you to the top of the pecking order - as witnessed by CEO culture - while cooperation and empathy are snubbed.


You may disagree that wage slavery is truly subjugation - that it restricts your freedom and democratic rights because ""you can just leave your job if you don't like it or negotiate better conditions"", which you can, of course, at the expense of risking homelessness and starvation - but you can't deny that it is exploitation. If not in the Marxist sense via the siphoning of surplus value you produce by your employer, then at the very least by perpetuating a system where the wealthy elite continue to accumulate more and more wealth whilst the rest of society has less and less of it.


Our workforce is the most productive it's ever been - and wages have been stagnating or declining for decades. More and more of what we once owned is now rented and public wealth private. Global inequality is at an all time high. Does this seem like a ""good"" deal for the working classes? To be working harder, smarter and outputting more for continuously less and less? It begs the question, whom is the economy for? If it's for meeting basic needs, enabling decent lives, and allowing human potential to flourish then it's failing on that account. The global economy is organized in such a way that roughly half of humanity is left unable to meet basic needs. Just take a look at a chart of the growth of foodbanks in the UK for instance or the rise of malnutrition in the last decade. 


And what about sustainability and keeping our only planet habitable, when yearly GDP growth - another hegemonic ""common sense good"" - can be matched up with raw material consumption as our planet warms to dangerous levels and so much of the natural world is dying that we named the sixth largest extinction event on the history of our planet, the Anthropocene extinction, after ourselves? As Jason Hickel puts it:


""There is no scarcity. Rather, the world‚Äôs resources and energy are appropriated (disproportionately from the global South) in order to service the interests of capital and affluent consumers (disproportionately in the global North).  We can state it more clearly: our economic system is not designed to meet human needs; it is designed to facilitate capital accumulation. And in order to do so, it imposes brutal scarcity on the majority of people, and cheapens human and nonhuman life.  It is irrational to believe that simply ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù such an economy, in aggregate, will somehow magically achieve the social outcomes we want.""


And indeed what about sustainability and keeping our only planet habitable, when yearly GDP growth - another hegemonic ""common sense good"" - can be matched up with raw material consumption as our planet warms to dangerous levels and so much of the natural world is dying that we named the sixth largest extinction event on the history of our planet, the Anthropocene extinction, after ourselves?


When wage labor first emerged during the industrial revolution people at the time saw it as no better than chattel slavery - something we see as so obviously heinous today. 


The Journal of the Knights of Labor, a union of 19th century America, held as its main slogan:


""When a man is placed in a position where he is compelled to provide the benefits of his labor to another, he is in a condition of slavery"".


------------------


It's a sick society that we live in where your basic needs being met means giving up on some of the very essential things that make us human whilst disproportionately enriching a small minority of the population. It's a system no better than feudalism. Below Chomsky writes about how even classic liberals like Wilhelm Humboldt - who inspired John Stuart Mill - arrived at rudimentary theories of exploitation and alienated labor.



""Man never regards what he possesses as so much his own, as what he does, and the laborer who tends the garden is perhaps in a truer sense its owner than the listless voluptuary who enjoys its fruits. And since truly human action is that which flows from inner impulse, it seems as if all peasants and craftsmen might be elevated into artists, that is men who love their labor for its own sake, improve it by their own plastic genius and invented skill, and thereby cultivate their intellect, ennoble their character and exult and refine their pleasures, and so humanity would be ennobled by the very things which now, though beautiful in themselves, so often tend to be degraded. Freedom is undoubtedly the indispensable condition without which even the pursuits most congenial to individual human nature can never succeed in producing such salutary influences. Whatever does not spring from a man‚Äôs free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very being but remains alien to his true nature. He does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness. And if a man acts in a mechanical way, reacting to external demands or instruction, rather than in ways determined by his own interests and energies and power, we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is.‚Äù


""For Humboldt then man ‚Äúis born to inquire and create, and when a man or a child chooses to inquire or create out of his own free choice then he becomes in his own terms an artist rather than a tool of production or a well trained parrot.‚Äù This is the essence of his concept of human nature. And I think that it is very revealing and interesting to compare it with Marx, with the early Marx manuscripts, and in particular his account of, quote ‚Äúthe alienation of labor when work is external to the worker, not part of his nature, so that he does not fulfill himself in his work but denies himself and is physically exhausted and mentally debased. This alienated labor that casts some of the workers back into a barbarous kind of work and turns others into machines, thus depriving man of his species character, of free conscious activity and productive life.‚Äù

The ultimate question:


If wages are an unfair system of bondage, why do we allow it to go on?
 

Answer:


Tl;dr: My theory is that the system is designed to perpetuate itself. It's miserable and hard on you. Strenuous enough that you don't have the mental capacity to even envision a different system in your free time off work. But not hard enough to warrant an overhaul of the system. There is some comfort in it and some of our basic needs are met.


40+ hour work weeks are just short of driving us to insanity, but that is the very reason they're still around. They keep us people in the labor pool in check. One of the most compelling concepts that Karl Marx proposed was his theory of worker alienation. This regards the largest portion of the employed population (especially those in, for instance, the service industry): those that work jobs that they don't care for. One turns up to their job almost every day, they complete strenuous, menial tasks with little-to-no stimulation, deal with shitty customers and colleagues, and because they don't own a share of the company, or the end product, they're essentially wage slaves. The only thing that keeps them there is the money they receive. They'd rather be anywhere else but at work, yet they have to turn up, in order to ""earn a living"", as the euphemism goes, or in other words, to receive money to continue to merit existing. The 9-5 is quickly becoming obsolete, in technological industries especially, where people can do most of their work in the matter of a few hours yet they have to sit there and look busy for the rest of the day. This helps encourage a culture of consumption. When you're fatigued and traumatized from spending the entirety of your waking days at work, straining to occupy your mind with your boring, superficial job, what are you going to do when you get home with the little time you have left? Go to the gym? Pursue fulfilling, creative hobbies? Go to the park and enjoy nature? Meet up with friends and socialize? Healthy, fulfilling habits like these are out of the question, for most. It's far easier to order a pizza, crack open a beer and put on Netflix -- douse yourself in stimulation to feel good again until it's time for bed and then the cycle repeats. Pretty much every one I know is or could be on a 12-step program to cut-down on something. We are an overstimulated, addicted, depressed society of consumers, and because we've been broken and conditioned and have become dependent on our wages we can never really meaningfully protest the system we live in, or have the leisure time to think about, research or engage with it. The fact that we have all of human knowledge at our finger tips - and that even with all the advances in science, technology, economics and philosophy in the past millennia our existence and place in the universe have only become more infinitely complex and intangible - doesn't help. We are bombarded with so much information we can not make sense of we stop caring. The plight of the worker is an isolating, alienating existence and looking at the world through a Marxist lens does at least shed useful light on the situation. We know the wage disparity between the elite and the workers is reaching unprecedented levels. The rich aren't hiding their attempts to dismantle our education systems, public services, environmental programs any more. Most people are too traumatized and occupied with survival to care and the 40 hour work week maintains that status quo.

It's more likely this is a business that's hurting for sales that's hoping to poach some good sales reps so they can steal their contacts.

She was hired by her current employer by letting him know that she was affected by BPD and was smoking marijuana everyday after work (Supported by pee test)
About three months ago, she advised her bosses that she wasn't able to work 12hrs shifts and instead proposed to work 8 to keep her mental health stable. This was also after she went to the doctor's to get a medical bill to support her demand.
They agreed to accommodate her and found her a position in one of the operational centers.
In the middle of March, they proposed ""mental help"" by sending her to see a private psychiatrist. That person classified her as a weed addict since she smokes weed everyday, even when it does not prohibit her to satisfy her normal obligations and her work. She does not smoke before, at work or at any time if she has to drive or has anything to do.
She contacted her union and they advised her that they had no right to send her see any health professional.
They have since placed her on paid administrative leave until they are satisfied.
She spoke with her t doctor today and she informed her that apparently in their work code they have a rule that prohibits employees from drinking or smoking marijuana the night/day before work
But their ultimate goal is to fire her, despite the fact that they knew everything about her situation beforehand (she was rehired after quitting 3 years ago ) and used her desire to help her mental health to lure her into that trap.

Is there anything we can do?

Yes it was a risk, but it was getting to the point of constant physical health problems, and mental health problems that were getting to a point of high concern to my providers. A lot of this got drastically worse under new management in the company that I co-founded.

I made a couple really good friends out of my staff, especially one of them who is a good enough friend that he's on my list as a groomsman should I get married. We've known each other for almost a decade now, and he's proven to be trustworthy outside of the office. I was planning to go visit them/him next month outside of the US, however they just let me know that's when this new manager may be visiting.

I've made strides in reversing burnout and these health problems. I still have one procedure to go, and my doctor is doing it to rule out that the problems were the result of job stress (just to put it in perspective). I'm starting to apply for jobs again, with sincere effort. I'm thinking of other business ideas. Everyone has noticed I'm much happier.

I really want to visit this friend/former coworker but I'm very concerned about the risk of running into this guy. I have a few reasons to believe he'll be unavoidable, and he is extremely...persistent. It's not as simple as ""how big is the city you'll be in, there's no chance you'd run into him.""

Is it worth the risk?"

To answer any first questions, I can‚Äôt appeal. And, I‚Äôm broke and have no idea how I‚Äôm going to survive but I‚Äôm here. 

I was on a working test period. My work has been phenomenal, my boss said repeatedly. My supervisor was both lazy and awful towards me and the fact I was disabled, but I did what I could with it and moved forward. I‚Äôm autistic, I‚Äôve offered trainings to multiple coworkers and staff and offered people ask me questions or clarify things but no one really has. 

Yesterday my boss let me know they were ending my probationary period and firing me. Said my work was excellent and beyond great, but they‚Äôd had people complain to my boss about some interactions with me. I said no one had talked to me about anything, so I wouldn‚Äôt know I was doing anything wrong so I wouldn‚Äôt fix anything. She suggested people were ‚Äúscared of me‚Äù and that‚Äôs why no one talked to me. I said if that were the case, she should‚Äôve had any conversation with me before now rather than just collect complaints and do nothing with them. 

I‚Äôd also like to say that one complaint was that my coworker gave an internal presentation and told us to please add information and ask questions as much as possible (it was labeled a competition). So I did. And apparently I asked too much?

Anyways, she made a point to let me know she‚Äôs ~here for me~ and ~I have her personal number~ but then didn‚Äôt ask if I was okay or needed anything. But texted me incessantly as I walked out the building to demand my badge back. "

I have an issue and I'm not sure how to handle it, so I'm looking for any advice people can offer.

I work for a distribution company and have been an employee here for 20 years, but only a department manager for 6 or 7 years. We've only ever operated with one shift, the day shift. Up until about 3-4 years ago, with our product being in such high demand, we had no choice but to start a second shift. The second shift DOES have an Operations manager and an assistant manger with around 60-70 employees. MY department on 2nd shift has a ""lead"" but no management, but this department only operates with around 4-5 people. 

My problem is, is I'm having to manage the workload for 2nd shift which includes, getting product on site, getting all materials needed, being the liaison with all communication with sales, sales ops, etc, and making sure any materials needed are being ordered. This is extremely frustrating, b/c when I've asked for a raise for handling all of this extra work, I'm told, "" you're the dept. manager. It's your department and we're not giving you a director title if that's where your head is at.""

Currently, I make 74k a year with a holiday bonus at the end of the year that is NOT included in my yearly salary. Am I wrong for wanting at least a 8-10% pay hike for all of this, or is my operations manager in the right, with telling me it's my department and I should be responsible for it?

Sorry this is so long winded, I'm just on the verge of exploding. Thank you in advance for any advice offered!"

4,2024-05-08,Job tries to get away with not paying me and then lies.,u/Mirandlethal,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cn7xth/job_tries_to_get_away_with_not_paying_me_and_then/,antiwork,"So I have two jobs, one for a small private organization and the other for a large bank. I was originally just working at the first job but took a job at the bank recently because I needed the money. You see that first job pays 10 months out of the year as a 1099 with zero benefits and an abyssmal paycheck. They get away with low pay and no benefits because it's a line of work where people are passionate about what they do and will make compromises. The place is a mess, paychecks never go out at the same time each month, things are mismanaged, and every expense that you try to get reimbursed is met with disdain and skepticism. So I work at the bank on the weekdays and work the now side job in the evenings and on the weekends. I'm passionate about what I do there and I'm happy to stay involved when they're paying me like they should.

So paychecks for the now side job were supposed to come in at the end of the month and mine didn't arrive. I waited a day or two because I'm used to them being terrible and still nothing. I reached out to my boss and to see what's going on and he tells me don't worry and that I'm being impatient because fucking of course that's the answer. I reach out to our payroll guy and ask where my paycheck is and he asks my boss if I still work there and what I do, I know this because my boss told me this immediately after he heard from the payroll guy. I reach back out to the payroll guy and ask if I can get my paycheck direct deposited into a new account and he asks me to text him my routing and account information and that he can't pay me until May 10th of this week until he can ""confirm"" my new account information. Mind you that's over a week after my paycheck was due. I got told that my last paycheck didn't go through because my old account was closed and I hadn't informed the payroll guy.

The thing is that my old account wasn't closed at the time that he claims to have tried to pay me, I purposefully left it open so I could continue to receive that paycheck with minimal hassle. He's just lying to avoid admitting that he either forgot to pay me or tried to get away with skipping my pay.

I fucking hate this shit. I hate that the reward I get for working a second job that I'm passionate about even just as a side gig gets met with shady assholes trying to fucking take advantage of me with no fucking consequences. I feel like I'm going insane with how much blowback I'm getting just to receive the pay that I'm contractually owed.

I have a fucking masters degree, I'm insanely experienced in that line of work with a great resume, I literally work in a bank now and deal with accounts and direct deposit information on a regular basis. These people still are tying to pull one over on me for some god forsaken reason. I am so tired of this shit, and nothing will change anytime soon because the people in power don't give a flying fuck if employers pull this kind of thing. 

All the fuck the guy had to say was that it was a misunderstanding and that he thought I was no longer working with the company. I would've been frustrated but at the very least I could've chalked it up to incompetence and moved on, but instead I have to listen to some bullshit because the guy can't be bothered to tell the truth. How am I supposed to give the benefit of the doubt to the guy after he lied to me?

So after I get my paychecks for April, May, and June I'm fucking gone. I'll stay at the shithole because I'm passionate about the work and I love my coworkers. I even love my boss as a person because he has consistently been a tremendous mentor to me  and has helped me/stood up for me on numerous occasions. I just can't fucking justify to myself or my husband staying at this place while they pull stunts like this. 

Tech industry by the way."

One and a half of that was as a Department Supervisor. This was also the first management role I've ever had. I thought I did pretty well as a manager when it came to getting along with my peers. Most everyone seemed to like me.

Recently I got into some really hot water with upper management, which I won't go into here, that made me decide I should step down from my management role.

I'm guessing word got out that I was stepping down. And on the day that it did the fire I saw in everyone's eyes took me by surprise. The other DS's avoided eye contact. And everyone I was over gave me death glares. A couple of associates started speaking among themselves knowing that I was in earshot how ""sometimes people just have stuff going on in their personal lives. But how would I know? I'm just a newbie."" They asked me what I thought as they glared at me and I was speechless. I spoke to one associate whom I thought I was close to in order to ask what was going on but he made it clear we were never close. That he could ""have made so much money off of punching me at least 200 times"" and ""his son could have easily shot me if he wanted to and it would have been fine."" But still, apparently I'm a ""good guy"" so keep my head up.

After he said that I left. I walked out, sent my supervisor an email that I quit, and I'll never step foot into that store again.

I had no idea during my duration of manager that everyone hated me so much. I guess I hadn't realized they had no choice but to act like they liked me just because of the power I held. I'm not the type of person to love power. I was just in it for a pay raise. I would have been fine if people stood up to me and told me how they really felt. Wouldn't have written up anyone because of it since they would be honest. I figure that type of feedback would help me be a better manager. But I suppose that's not how anyone sees it.

Is this just me or does this happen for almost everyone else who would step down?"

Quick update just to say that the wage stealing management company has almost completely been run out of the county. They still exist in other parts of the state. Cant be everywhere. 

Long story short,.. this company was a carpet bagger company that swooped in when a lical company that covered moat of the county ran into hard times when the principle owner/operator had health issues. The local company was sold off and revamped by two prior employees of local company and now the local company is back in the driver seat. Thank the good lord above!!

Kid has made out. Now hes hired on with a significant bump and theyre letting him actually deal with hiring rather than dealing with any joe off the street as with the carpet baggers. So good stuff all around. "

My colleague is driving me nuts but there seems to be no recourse for it. UK btw


Let's call my colleague Sarah. Sarah is a salaried worker while most of the others are zero contract but she's technically not above us in any way, just acts like it. Here are some of the things she's done just recently:


-Left me by myself during the lunch rush while another colleague was on a break to manage FOH to go on a half hour smoke break. I was literally having to run from the pass to take out food to diners, back to the till, and making coffees at the same time, with a massive queue. She comes back for ten minutes then disappears somewhere again once the other colleague is back. Smoke breaks aren't a part of her contract 


-Leaves 15-20 min early every day but reported me for arriving 5 minutes late 


-Reported me for not saying good morning to her happily enough 


-Eats off of customers plates BEFORE they go out 


-Signs off on things she didn't actually do on the task sheet, but told others to do


She's very two faced, and gossips with everyone about everyone else. And is very friendly with the manager and constantly reporting back to them. Everyone is waiting for her to leave the entire shift since she only ever opens, yet she expects everything to always be perfect when she comes in when there's 10x more things to do on a close than when she opens as we are often busy until the very last minute 


Honestly, she is making me dread coming into work, but the spot I'm stuck in at the moment for uni has very few students jobs and I desperately need the money. Is there anything I can do or am I just fucked?"

We relocated for work 2 years ago, we bought a house but we realized pretty soon we dont like the area plus the cost of living is higher. We relocated because of my work required it. I mostly work remotely so when I think about it it does not make sense we relocated but the company wanted and I thought I was going to be dedicated to the local site. Instead I find my self supporting remote sites mostly than the one I am physically located.

Several times I have requested my managers to allow me to work fully remote since it does not add any value if I am here or not and also because my family is not happy and wanting to move back. Even when they acknowledge the job can be done mostly remote and that my presence in the current location is not critical they dont allow me. I am getting tired and almost about to move without telling them. My managers are in Europe, they dont even know if I go or not to the office. I know my company allow workers from that state since there is a small branch, so taxes and that kind of stuff is not a problem.

I have been for more than 1 year actively another remote job with no luck, still I am willing to take the risk to move without telling them. My older son is starting university in that state/city next year.

Sorry but I dont know what to do, I feel desperated since I feel I have used all  my options with my managers. Thinking about contacting HR locally to ask about it but very likely they will tell me is my manager's decision. Not sure if it is wise or not to contact HR.

It is so frustrating how all this corporate trash affects workers well-being, just because they want to fill their freaking buildings."

Several years ago I met my girlfriend working for the same company. For the first 5 years, the company was great, very mom and pop oriented, no drama, an actual great place to work. I honestly love the business and intended on spending my life in the industry. But then‚Ä¶ The company decided to hire a new projects manager about 4 years ago. Without a doubt he is the epitome of a Narcissistic Self-Indulging Weenie on top of being a sexual predator. He portrays himself as a ‚Äúman‚Äôs man‚Äù. The guy has comepletely turned what was once a great company to work for into a corporate nightmare.

Here comes the ‚Äúreal bad‚Äù‚Ä¶

 My girlfriend made it to a prominent position within the company and he was very hands on with the position and really any female at the company he is very ‚Äúhands on‚Äù with their position. He started making inappropriate comments to my girlfriend about her appearance and making suggestive comments between her and I as it was no secret we were dating. She had asked him 2 times to stop with the comments. He obliged and then took it a step farther and began hugging her from behind and pulling her in for hugs without consent. My girlfriend once again asked him to stop and went to her supervisor who played off the situation as nothing. The last straw was when he was having a meeting with a group of clients and and she was in said meeting and he popped off with ‚ÄúWow you look sexy today‚Äù. She took it further this time and went to the owner of the company. The owner brushed everything under the rug as he typically does showing that his behavior is acceptable. 

Thankfully she had had enough and moved on to a better company, but here I am still stuck here. I chose to go the proper route and not handle it how I wanted to handle the situation because really no one wins. I end up in jail and probably being sued and this self indulgent weenie walks free to continue his rain of sexual misconduct. She filed a labor board claim with the state we live in and will be going to mediation in the next few weeks for a settlement. 

But yesterday everything changed. I got a phenomenal job offer and I happily accepted. I am the warehouse manager for this company and not a single person in this company knows how to do what I do. I‚Äôm torn about giving them 2 weeks notice or just cutting the cord and being done with it all. I‚Äôm happy to be closing this chapter of my life and starting anew."

He got evasive, talking about the ""opportunity"", the ""culture"", the ""close-knit team"".

Honey. I am in my 50s. I have extensive experience and education. I also have no patience for bullshit. Sob I asked again.

""Um...what hourly rate are you looking for? What kind of scheduling?""

I told him $28 - $30 hourly. Monday - Friday, 8A - 5P. Unlimited PTO or a minimum 5 weeks of PTO use as sick or vacation time.

""Oh.""

He has ghosted me.

Dude. The only thing different from my current role is that I added what I SHOULD be earning if fucking shareholders weren't pandered to at the expense of paying the people doing the actual work. 

I'll stay put until someone will pay me what I'm worth. I'm not willing to compromise. Fuck you. PAY ME."

I make on average every 2 weeks 2k and my next paycheck is gonna be around 4k because of overtime and all of the gratuity. I work as a server at the buffet of a hotel. They hired me at the same time with another guy who took the supervisor position. Well he can't get any of the gratuity or credit card tips and he has been pissed about it. Especially after finding out that I make more than him for less responsibility. He still wants cash tips and sadly I have to split that and he helps anyways. 

But now he wants to hire 2-3 people which means that I will have to split everything further and my income will greatly decrease. We need 1 more person but that's it. But it seems he wants me to definitely make less than him since he asks me income related questions and always tries to say that they pay him a lot and he has a lot of overtime."

Background: I‚Äôm just graduating high school and want some money to buy a computer before college. My robotics coach shared me a listing for a summer internship, and I applied for it in February. Mind you, I‚Äôm not one to brag but I have three years on the robotics team programming, I taught the new members, and I have been using CAD software for three years. 

It took them until April to contact me for an interview. I didn‚Äôt do my best, but it was my first time. About two weeks go by and they offer to do an intake call, and then two weeks after that I do another interview, which was today. The hiring department sent two different links to two different teams meetings in their email and me and the manager I was talking with had a hard time getting connected. The hiring ladies are not very good at contacting me.

I am probably overqualified for an entry level job and have went out of my way, waiting to organize my summer schedule until I know whether or not I‚Äôm hired, and they haven‚Äôt given me a definitive answer. If I have to do another one of these interviews and they don‚Äôt offer me a job I‚Äôm about ready to tell them I‚Äôm no longer interested. The only reason I‚Äôve kept going is because my dad works there (has been for 20 years), the pay is good, $15/hr, 40 hour week, 8-10 weeks (not confirmed though), and I‚Äôd much rather do this than work at McDonalds, because I have skills to do more than that. 

Anyways, that‚Äôs my rant. I‚Äôm mad that they tell me nobody wants to work, and then take up months of my time to just see if I can get the job. I‚Äôm worth more than this, I‚Äôm a smart kid, and I‚Äôm willing to show up on time and get the work done right. "

I got on a call immediately to ask what it was about, but he wouldn't go into detail. I suspected that they were setting up to go to HR to start a case against me without ever talking to me first. That night he agreed it made sense to discuss his issues informally before going to HR and promised as much.

Monday comes along and we meet, he presents me with a 6-page document of things he claimed were performance issues and rushes through them all in about 20 minutes before saying he was sending them to HR despite promising not to. I was confused and a little bewildered because nothing on there was worthy of a write-up and some things were just flat out false.

A couple examples:

\* Committing code to a main branch without peer review. The only time I did this was for a solo experimental project that wasn't in production and had no path to production. Not an issue or risk at all, and very standard. Some teams in my company don't even use source control so this is beyond weird.

\* Having a short 30-minute meeting with another leader in the organization to understand project requirements better. He claimed this was an inappropriate attempt to influence the organization, but meetings like that were part of my job description.

\* Many more, but similar examples. Over-all most were petty or wrong.

In that meeting I let him know the items he wrote up weren't very compelling items to write anyone up to HR for and asked him to explain what was really going on, but he wouldn't talk and we ended the call.

He then went to HR and claimed that I was being combative. I was certainly confused, but not combative. HR got on a call with me (my first interaction with HR) and said I could either resign or be terminated, those were the only options. They made zero attempt to understand my point of view. I said I wasn't resigning, and I asked for them to investigate my manager's behavior and motives and they agreed to. My company network access was shut off moments later and the next day I was placed on administrative leave for the investigation.

While on administrative leave I see a job posting come up for my replacement, however they had lowered the compensation range about 80k and modified the job to make it hybrid in-office instead of fully remote.

After 2 weeks of hearing nothing HR comes back and terminates me citing not one but now several examples of combative behavior, including to HR themselves. Not once did they talk to me to investigate, and they refused to discuss any specifics.

Weeks later employees are still reaching out just figuring out that I'm gone. They claim that HR used the ""he was combative"" rationale to explain when they asked. 

Do I have any recourse in this situation? It seems like this was a targeted hit-job coordinated by my manager and HR, and I can't really ascertain the real motives. If I had to guess they were trying to avoid layoffs or paying severance, so they first cooked up a fake performance case and when they realized it was weak they doubled down by cooking up a fake behavior case. Since this happened, they have moved some employees from remote to hybrid with word that more of that is to come.

My team and I have done this particular type of project every year and know well how to break it down and get it done efficiently. 

We have a new division manager who has never worked in our positions and doesn't understand our jobs in the slightest. My team and I were well underway on our project and we're on track to complete it. 

Our division manager decided he was going to call all the teams in for a virtual meeting so he could berate everyone all at once, whining and complaining the entire time before setting minimum task completions for each team. 

These minimums were well below what we were already doing but he's complained every single day, reminding everyone of these requirements, so our team has scaled back and gone to only meeting these requirements. We've been pushing to unionize for some time and this may finally be the straw that broke the camel's back. 

TLDR: A Manager who has no clue about the work he is managing, complains it isn't being done fast enough and sets forth expectations and requirements well below what is already being done. But, since he continues to complain, teams are slowing down to meet these expectations.

I occasionally read posts here as they show up in my feed, and so far I've seen a lot of great tips here. 

I need your advise this time.

My wife works in a mobile pet grooming place, and she is driving a company smart car daily to pick up and return dogs to their homes. This smart car is literally a zombie on a road, that still works on holy spirit alone. It has a lot of issues, including transition, wheels and so on.

Recently she find out that her turning signals are not working. She asked about it other employee who was driving it the day before and he told her that he was pulled over by police the other day because of this. Police officer notified him that his turning signals does not work, and issued a warning on a car, and said that next time they will issue a ticket and add 4 demerit point to the driver.

My wife went to business owner and told him that she refused to operate car, until signals are fixed. Stating that she don't want to get demerit points and it's simply not safe. They had a heated argument, where her employer said that she is refusing to perform her duties.

Now, I'm pretty sure that's a work safety violation, but I'm not sure which one. I couldn't find any proper document to refer to. Or maybe there's any legal charge that can be made.

It's all happening in Ontario Canada. 

I would greatly appreciate your help.

When I started with this (national USA) company last December, the job listing on Indeed included the phrase, ""$6000 hiring bonus"" *(for people who met certain criteria, which I did)*.       

In the offer letter, that was changed to a _retention incentive_üö© paid in installments üö©: $1000 after 1 month, $2000 after 3 months, & $3000 after 6 months... of FTüö© work.   (So there's 3 changes.)      

FT work only starts after training, which was supposed to be a month üö© (or less) of PT classroom & hands-on specific to the job.       
Some people hired _after_ me did achieve that; I didn't.  (4th change)  I think there's at minimum some favoritism happening there because the trainer inflated their training hours (in the records).      

**Anyway...**     
The first paycheck after I've been working FT for a month is this Friday.  (Actually, it's already pending in my bank, which is good.)  

I contacted HR, who put my query (basically, ""it's on this paycheck, right?"") through to the person who handles pay for my area, who says it's done at 3, 6, & 9 months üö© of FT work!       
(5th change)    

Plus HR sent a pdf of the offer letter, with my signature, that has 3/6/9... but I strongly suspect shenanigans.  Either she altered the text or put the signature block into a different document.  *(This HR has also lied to me, saying there's a hiring freeze, but new people are still showing up & jobs are posted on Indeed.)*    

When I contacted corporate HR VP, this was the response:        
""Hello [name], bonuses are on hold at the moment while the company goes through some restructuring. As soon as the pause is lifted, we will make every effort to pay bonuses to the employees that qualify.""      
(6th change)    

I know they've been in financial trouble because basic safety maintenance is ignored, and the quarterly safety bonus was stopped at the start of 2024, and the commercial motor vehicles we operate are very unreliable (breaking down frequently).    
Customers are mad too.     
So yes, I've been looking for different work as well as upgrading my skills & licensing.

Now ya may wanna check my math here. But by those figures 990 of those people would have to pay 1$, 1 guy would have to pay 990$n, and the remaining 9 people would have to pay 1$ each. 

Why is the government bothing to spend time and resources for my hundredth of a penny?

It's a waste to tax the bottom 99%."

Yes, but only because my manager has been wanting me to stay at this job ever since I told him I had been struggling immensely mental-health wise and other-health wise. I was told by other higher-ups that if I‚Äôm struggling, the best thing I can do is call my manager, telling him I might not make it to my shift, and my manager can tell me that we‚Äôll ‚Äústruggle through the day together.‚Äù At first, I thought it was a really kind sentiment, but after a couple months, I realize that I don‚Äôt just dislike my job because I‚Äôm going through something, I dread it because of the job itself. 

I‚Äôm a college student, and I work(ed) part-time on campus. The job was fine at first. It‚Äôs a somewhat physically demanding job‚Äî carrying things, repairing things, doing general maintenance, cleaning out urinals, all that for an hourly wage of $16.25. Again, it was fine, but I soon realized how strangely I was being treated since all my coworkers knew I‚Äôm trans (ftm)

For one, going into the men‚Äôs bathroom/locker room (I work at the campus gym) is awkward enough since I know I don‚Äôt pass incredibly well. I‚Äôve been called out once before, and looked at strangely every time I‚Äôm in there, but we have so many duties in that space that I cannot just refuse to work there.

Also, my manager, while I do think he is a kind person, does treat me strangely. If I do something that frustrates him, (for example, my radio dies when he‚Äôs trying to call me) he misgenders me for a while the next time I see him. He never misgenders me otherwise, only if he‚Äôs noticeably irritated. Additionally, when he‚Äôs delegating more physical tasks, I‚Äôm often paired with a female coworker even though I‚Äôve done the same tasks with male coworkers out of my own volition. I was warned during my first day or two that he may treat me strangely.

Also, by the way, because of the job being completing monthly/weekly tasks, we run out of work to do often, so people calling in sick does not interrupt workflow unless there is an emergency, but that hasn‚Äôt happened for the entire time I‚Äôve been there.

I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm looking into things too much, or like I‚Äôm complaining, or justifying my no call no show with the reasoning of mental health issues, but I haven‚Äôt known how to feel about this job but now doing this, I don‚Äôt really feel that guilty‚Ä¶.?????? I also have a job already lined up that pays more and panders to my interests, so‚Ä¶. I guess that helps with the guilt, somewhat."

I fail to see how my work life is any different from the schooling system. As I walk and wind through the urban jungle of Uptown, I see droves of sameness, people pursuing the same vanilla dream with their lives. 

‚ÄúWay to kill that credit presentation today Kevin‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou really took it risk on that one John.‚Äù- said in the same conforming blob of a fucking voice that everyone of them sounds like, including me. 

But back to the school thing, it really feels similar. You get two report cards a year, your attendance is tracked, you have to maintain a dress code. And then you get let out for recess. It‚Äôs cliquey too. The jocks get all the attention on the sales team and get sent out to go win against the other banks and go win the day for morherfucking Wells Fargo or whoever the fuck. ‚ÄúTHIS IS WELLS.‚Äù It‚Äôs so stupid. Then you have the nerds. These are your back office or credit people. The ones who are competing with each other for the best grades in the class. They want to be seen as the smartest boys + girls and get an A+ on their test so mommy and daddy will love them the most and they‚Äôll get their very special golden sticker. 

Then you just have your weirdos. The ones who work in some quality assurance or random back office support role. They‚Äôre doing dime balls in the wellness rooms. Nobody really knows what the fuck they‚Äôre doing and I don‚Äôt think they quite do either.

Now that brings me to the risk people. These are your savants with some serious school shooter energy. You‚Äôre not quite sure if today is gonna be the day they snap. You wonder how they are able to recall information from twenty years ago at the drop of a hat. It‚Äôs because they‚Äôve been watching you sleep since you were 12.

Lastly, let‚Äôs not forget about lunch. The holiest of holy periods. The cliques merge and discuss the beef of the day. The boys + girls go get their little fit and active salads while Sally from Bank of America sends Kevin from Truist some serious sex eyes as she checks out at the register with her cold-pressed spinach and carrot juice and her feta goat cheese salad. Before they know it, Pavlov will be ringing his bell in their unconscious minds and will have them rushing back to take their seats back at their desks, wiping the fresh drool off of their freshly steamed Nautica dress shirt they just got at the Rack.

Last year when this happened i got venmo'd my money (i had enough money in my account to cover whatever and i didnt look right away to see that it hadnt cleared but it got taken care of quickly). This time i got my check, deposited it and paid my rent right away. The next day i casually looked at my account and the check was cancelled and i was in the negative. thankfully i had cash off to the side and i took care of it before i got dinged with charges, but because the owner was is in fucking ARUBA i wasnt able to get a check cut until he came back the next week (i didnt want to deal with Venmo and getting charged for an instant transfer, it just wouldve gotten me my money a day sooner in the end, so whatever) 

Im going back to school in the fall (the whole staff knows but not the owner yet) and i was on the fence about working part time/full time between semesters but fuck that, im not going back there. 

Paychecks came in today and i had a new check cut for last week and a new one for this week. theyre both deposited and im going to check to see that they clear before i go to bed and before i go to work tomorrow. these checks dont clear im walking the fuck out and going straight to the department of labor. 10+ years of service industry work and i am fucking done and ready to put it behind it

My sister was offered a job as a flight attendant. Flight attendants are not allowed to have visible tattoos. I can‚Äôt remember the exact details, but I believe they do some sort of body inspection?? Either way, she had to get the tattoo removed  (tattoo behind the ear) before she started and didn‚Äôt have time to get laser removal. She literally got it CUT OUT OF HER SKIN. As in, went to a doctor‚Äôs office, they removed it, and pulled the skin back together. The job was rescinded while she was in the 30 day flight attendant training school.

I was offered a job which requires security clearance (USA). I had to take a polygraph AKA bullshit anxiety measurement test. I have awful anxiety and knew my palms would sweat, therefore I would be marked as ‚Äúdeceptive‚Äù despite being truthful because that‚Äôs just how I am. The sensors your palms measuring sweat are the extremely sensitive. I got Botox on my hands to stop my hands from sweating just to cover my basis. 50 needle injections in each hand and $1,500 later- I still didn‚Äôt pass (never lied either) and the job was rescinded.

We both got literal BODY MODIFICATIONS for jobs we had but didn‚Äôt even get in the end!!! 

Granted, no one asked us to do these things but we both really wanted the opportunity. "

We've vented to each other and got along well. Ive been at the business for 5 months, she had been there been there 3 months.  We work at a small thrift shop that has a total of 5 employees at one store and around the same amount for the other store.

My boss regularly takes mission trips out of the country, leaving 5 employees to run the store were at in combination. If you need to call out my boss understands if you can't get coverage, as long as it isn't excessive. Our job is a easy sit down job, we put items in the computer and ring up customers. We aren't rushed. She treats us pretty good, were understaffed but she doesn't blame us for consequences of that. 
. 

A few days ago, my boss didn't pay us on payday. Payday was on May 3rd, and she instead paid us on May 4th. This was not usual for her, obviously at least to me being a once in a blue moon event. And it was early in the month and not close to rent being due so I didn't mind. I was at work the day we were paid, a few hours before, E texted me saying 

""Hey honey I'm not coming in until *bosses name* gives me an update about pay and when it's coming. I already let her know about it. ""

I was a bit bewildered, i waited it out because my boss is pretty reliable, 2 hours after her shift started we got paid, and her still not coming in. I texted her asking if I should text our boss to find coverage for her, she responded saying that was between me and our boss. I ended up closing early because I had plans after work and no one could cover.

A few days later I noticed she was taken of the schedule for the next month, I asked her if she quit and she said no and she figures she's fired. I don't approve of my boss yanking her off the schedule without firing her in person, E said she texted her and got no response. But quite honestly I don't know what E was thinking. I feel like she created a immature power struggle causing My boss to lose money. Pick and choose your battles

My boyfriend disagrees, saying that E could use for retaliation, and that my boss shouldn't expect people to work when not paying them on time. 

What do y'all think?

Now having moved to the PNW, I can‚Äôt find any of the latter types of work and resigned to another bakery job.

I worked with this chill dude who worked there for 20 years, close to retirement in like 5 to 10 years and he literally went through hell and back working for that company. We talked for a month and had lots of conversations.

The trucks turned into ice skate floors in the winter and were rolling toasters as he called it (imagine doing having to deal with that for about 4 months every year or more due to the season). He said he almost twisted his ankle lots of time in the winter and had back surgery due to the load of mails he had to carry out of the truck onto your front door. He also said that company was the worst thing he has done in his life due to how bad the management is there for every UPS (he worked at 3 UPS warehouses in his lifetime), he only worked there due to having 3 daughters. He had the strength of an ox to work there and was pretty much the nicest guy i've ever met too, considering every other driver was usually either pissed off like some fedex transfer dude who I worked with or quiet. The only tips to survive that toaster is carrying a large container of water but not too much since the company monitors you if you take too many pee breakers like Amazon.

Not to mention that you had to keep the doors open to keep a fast pace and due to the AC only working for heat (some trucks had a very small fan for the driver not for their buddy though sadly), it didn't help much since you literally turned it off a few seconds later to deliver another box. The doors being kept open is dangerous but is still being used today, when I worked there most of the building still used old trucks from the early 2000s with stick shift.

It's a completely hard job, i'm telling you guys now it paid $14 per hour for newcomers, the work is very uneven you are either scanning inside which is a lot easier, scanning outside in 100 degree trailers or doing the heavy mover for the same pay. I was a heavy mover guy and I was shouted at by a boomer saying ""FASTER, WE HAVE TOO MANY, FASTER!""(While I was getting my feet cut up due to my boots and dying from the heat, pushing large plastic carts filled with packages). The union didn't help either since they didn't care about working conditions as long as the company gave you a little sheets of rules it was okay (They don't like you doing proper knee lifting though since it takes too long). Not worth it at all considering people sitting at their desks at the warehouse are getting 100k per year/more while the other half (the drivers) are getting 100k a year with a chance of almost dying every summer due to heat stroke. I've also heard that being a supervisor of the pushers or scanners you barely get a pay increase too and you get the most hate.

Don't even get me started on the hiring process either when they hired me that was also a nightmare. I'm pretty sure I was payed the wrong amount due to not getting the right punchout clock id, the machine not working and the hiring manager glossing over it. There's so much miscommunication it's not funny.

This was also during whole mask mandatory wave so it was extra brutal.

Not to mention now that it's freezing cold in the UPS trucks and you could easily slip on the sidewalk. Plus the people who you deliver to are even more annoying and frustrating, legit had a few aggressive hood people in a bad side of town get upset if you even don't give them the package on time while you have a few dog owners say ""hE DoEsN'T B1tE"" then have the dog look at you growling. Not worth the $14 an hour or less considering I heard UPS wanted to lower wages after COVID restrictions had ended.

The only good thing from working at UPS is that it made me go to trade school.

This was almost 4 years ago (I worked with him on seasonal and got a hourly job there for 2 weeks then ditched) I still remember it like yesterday...

I‚Äôm ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to be at each house for 15-20 minutes and they advertise that as soon as the route is done you can go home. Every day there are guys that get off at 12:00, 1:00, and even 2:00. They compensate by having pay per yard model, and you can earn a fair bit of money on low hours.

WHAT I HAVE ISSUE WITH is that my routes are:
- very big mansions and estates
- very detailed so I have to be extra thorough  - are fucking far away from the office 
I‚Äôm usually not back at the office until 4 or 5 most days because I have to drive through heavy traffic. I‚Äôm not even home until after 6pm due to heavy traffic.

 I honestly wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that they‚Äôll cut me off at 37hrs and tell me not to come in. If that‚Äôs the case, I don‚Äôt get the pay per yard which is only 16/hr. If I do get pay per yard, it‚Äôs less than my projected overtime and they‚Äôll try to make me take it unless I bring it up with them. So they‚Äôre essentially milking me for labor so they don‚Äôt have to fully pay me.

 Which has me fucking furious because I‚Äôve seen my stats and I‚Äôm one of their top performers.  I get good reviews, I complete my jobs within goals, my resprays are low/zero, and once again 20 yards a day. I know the moment I lower my standards and do shit jobs they‚Äôll be all over me like ‚Äú what happened man you were doing so good‚Äù acting all shocked. Management tries to be all buddy buddy and I hate it; very manipulative. 

Actively looking to leave and will say fuck em in the process. But it‚Äôs hard to plan interviews when I work 10hr shifts and can‚Äôt afford to just quit and job hunt. "

It's bad enough that my consultant C-suite (yes, you fucking heard right, my C-suite except for the owner are fractional C-suite that paid more in a week than I make in 2 months) does nothing but create more and more meetings. But they willingly have said he following:

1. Everyone who isn't C-suite/director their or above is a ""whining child"". I was part of a meeting where one member flat out said this, about his subordinates, to a fucking vendor. Seriously, I'm right fucking next to you. 

2. Overpaid useless twats. These fuckers are the definition of ""weaponized incompetence"". They only have their jobs from their boomer friends and shuffle around to other companies draining resources. They can barely operate a computer and every single fucking time they give an order it's always the same thing ""it's it just a button you push to spit out a report""? NO YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE. THERE ISNT A ""BUTTON"" FOR EVERYTHING. Fuckers work 3 days a week, get company cars, all expenses paid and just bark orders. 

3. If you fuck up, your ass is gone. We are now in an ""SOP"" creation timeline. Basically, so many people quit or were 'not a cultural fit"" that the remaining people are overworked, underpaid and are scraping by. Basically, ""write your job duties and how tos because everyone is leaving with their knowledge"". Also, fuck you to any new hires, it's sink or swim

4. Fuck AI. Seriously, it's bad enough these boomer fucks can barely hunt and peck type, they are creaming their fucking pants over AI. They don't write any emails or do shit, ""have an AI do it"". Newest initiative, everyone has to have performance goals and ways to streamline business. If you don't, ""AN AI will make one for you"".

5. What's the fucking point. I'm trying to ""work my wage"" but they keep making the mountain taller. If you fuck up or do bare minimum, well, consider it ""not part of the company culture"".  

6. If I hear one more time that ""I made half of what you did and put 3 kids in college and bought $30k of Bitcoin"". I'm gonna lose my shit. Mother fucker, you are a CFO, DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND FINANCE OR INFLATION? Oh I forgot, your 20k roof you didn't pay for (the company did) didn't hit your ledger. The iPhones that all C-suite AND THEIR SPOUSES AND KIDS get is all company paid for. Meanwhile, the last two people to ask for a raise had to go through 3 interviews and got 2 other jobs dumped onto them

I'm so fucking done with work. I just want to run screaming into the woods and let nature take it course.  I've seen this across 5 companies and it's the exact same shit, play by play, every time. 

Yes, I'm looking for a new job but shocker, it's not easy.

2,2024-05-09,Advice Needed: Navigating a Pay Cut and Transition to Part-Time,u/Meeshable,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cnzf7o/advice_needed_navigating_a_pay_cut_and_transition/,antiwork,"First off, I am in Minnesota - USA. I've worked for the same company for 15 years, and recently my employer asked me to switch to part-time, presenting it as a positive change since I have two small children and could spend more time with them. However, this adjustment came with a 50% reduction in pay, reducing my work hours to 20 per week. 

I expressed my concerns to my employer, noting that it's challenging to compress 40 hours' worth of tasks into just 20. Additionally, I explained that this pay cut would significantly impact my ability to manage finances, particularly with childcare expenses. I asked why she wouldn't simply lay me off if she didn't need me full-time anymore. Her response was that there was still work to do, leaving me feeling uneasy but not officially accepting this new arrangement. There was no formal documentation about my new part-time status or reduced salary.

On April 1st, my employer unilaterally cut my pay and informed me that I would now be working part-time, with no obligation to be in the office. This abrupt transition caused immediate financial stress as I struggled to cover my bills and keep my kids in daycare. To cope with the reduced income, I was forced to cut my children's daycare hours in half. Now, they stay home for part of the day while I work the remaining hours for half my previous salary.

It's been about a month, and I'm feeling increasingly trapped. I need a full-time job to support my family, but this new arrangement doesn't offer me the financial stability or flexibility to look for another job. I'm hesitant to quit outright because I fear losing the security I have left, especially given my employer's history of contesting unemployment claims with her team of top lawyers. Being on the leadership team, I've seen firsthand how vigorously these appeals are fought.

My question is, would I still qualify for unemployment benefits if I decide to quit, given that this transition was forced upon me? She has already made the change - is there a time limit to which I should act? I'm conflicted because staying feels unsustainable, yet I'm deeply concerned about providing for my children if I quit and face an uphill battle with unemployment. Has anyone faced a similar situation or has advice on what my best course of action might be? "

10,2024-05-09,I got put on a PIP that was supposed to end mid-April... it's May. Why am I still here?,u/rgnkge66_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cnzvpq/i_got_put_on_a_pip_that_was_supposed_to_end/,antiwork,"To keep it brief, this is my first time working in an office and it's in the running for worst job I've ever had. Everything and mostly everyone here is so ass backwards I don't know how anything gets done half the time. Communication is pure garbage. Many of my coworkers are openly racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, and just awful people in general. HR is completely useless if whoever you're putting a complaint in about brings in revenue or has an important position that they don't want to deal with finding replacements for. Turnover is very high as well, especially in departments like mine, probably because we're treated like shit by other departments (mostly sales) because they know they can get away with it.

As someone who's never experienced this all at once at a job before, this shit really got to me after a while. Around the end of last year I was so dissociated and fucked up mentally that I was incredibly careless with my job. I know I shouldn't have let it get to that point and I regret it because I know it could affect my job search. I guess I thought I could handle it until it was clear I couldn't.

This resulted in my boss surprising me with a PIP in February. It was supposed to end mid-April. I put a lot of effort in at first to make sure I did my job well but she's always trying to find things to criticize me over and when I meet those criticisms with questions about how I could do better and improve, she won't give me straight answers, sometimes avoids them altogether. It's pretty clear now that the PIP's purpose was not to actually improve my performance... especially since I saw they posted my job on Indeed over a month ago. 

It's now May. This shit was supposed to be over in April. No changes have been communicated and I sure as hell didn't meet their expectations to pass based off of what I mentioned earlier. I don't understand why I'm still here.

I'm assuming they're holding onto me until they find my replacement (good luck to them considering how awful their employee reviews are). I don't plan on leaving until I've found another job (which I think I have, just waiting for an offer and applying to others as a backup) or until they've fired me. I just find it really weird. I'm chilling and doing the bare minimum until something happens. 

Has this happened to anybody else?"

Yet, no one wants to hire me. I literally do not want a specific job and am open to pretty much anything related to my degree to just get experience. I have applied to / had contact with about 20 jobs and they all have excuses not to hire me. 

Job 1: clients are too far away (okay fine, but your main office is fucking closeby) 

Job 2: had 3 interviews, they said i would be a good employee but suck at 'selling myself' to customers (good catch, cant deny that, but why would an employee even be expected to get a new gig themselves?) 

Job 3: had an interview in person, never heard from them again. 

Job 4: ghosted

Job 5: they found someone with experience and said they thought i would be bored within a year (why fill that in for me? I just want experience, i dont care my degree seems overkill) 

Job 6: they didnt have ""time and resources"" to hire a starter, they only want employees with experience

Job 7: they contacted me, had an interview, they didn't see it happening due to my degree not matching enough for their liking (bro, you knew that cause you fucking contacted me) 

Job 8: had an interview, not hired due to me not knowing which direction i would want to go to, finance or more IT (ridiculous, cause the only IT thing they could base it on was a traineeship that contacted me, nothing else)

Job 9: had an interview, again clients would be too far away (again, their main office is closeby) 

Job 10: had an interview with a recruiter, recruiter didn't want to send me to the job interview because i don't know what i want exactly (bro, i am 21, how am i supposed to know what i want for the next 50 years) 

Job 11: recruiter contacted me about a totally different job that doesn't match my degree in the slightest

Job 12: they thought my profile was not enough for the position (funny how one company says my profile is too overkill, and this one said the opposite) 

Job 13: ghosted

Job 14: ghosted

Job 15: ghosted 

Job 16: worst one in my opinion, they contacted me, had an interview with them and she didn't even explain the position cause she just ended the interview when i had difficulties answering questions and honestly admitted that i didnt have time to prepare (there wasnt even anything to prepare, she didn't send me the position details or anything, she just sent me a message with 5 bullet points in her introduction message on linkedin which was some general crap like ""good benefits"", she didnt even seem interested in the interview to begin with. She said she understood i want a job but blabla)

Every employer expects you to have been dreaming about working for them since you were 6. They act like they are the first company you apply to, they are just a number, just like i am a number who applies to the job. No, i do not have specific reasons for applying other than wanting a job and needing the experience. No, i do not know where i see myself in X years. I cannot fake any interest to save my life. No, i am not happy searching for a job, knowing this is life, working for 50 years 5 days a week. Fuck this shit"

The pay was nearly double what I had been making doing basically the same work, it was a no-brainer taking the position. My work was always good, and when they had problems I would work hard to correct it and get above and beyond the new standards. Actually the past few months they were extremely happy with the quality of my work and said as much to me about it, so I know I wasn‚Äôt fired for that. 

As the title suggests, I am neurodivergent. I‚Äôm absolutely on the spectrum, and I also have ADHD. This never really hurt my actual work as my field is one of my special interests, but I suppose I‚Äôm not what you would call outgoing or extroverted. I can talk for hours about certain topics, but small talk is just something I have never truly been able to grasp. Most of my coworkers were almost the exact opposite though- neurotypical, outgoing, very social people. I usually preferred to do my work with headphones on so I could just zone out and focus on my work, and I rarely attended work after hour events (work ends at 4:30, why would I want to hang around till 7 or later drinking light beers or white claws, especially unpaid??), and I absolutely refused to work on weekends. 

Now all that said, I have never been unfriendly, rude, etc. and I do (or did) make an effort to talk with coworkers during breaks, lunch, etc. and hell I even went to thanksgiving at my bosses house, and went to their Christmas party! But at the end of the day, it was just a job. It‚Äôs what I did to keep my family fed and housed and to support our lifestyle. I enjoyed the work, but it wasn‚Äôt my life, and I wasn‚Äôt willing to sacrifice my time with my family to that job, outside of the expected mon-fri 8-4:30. 

Well, yesterday I get called into a meeting and they tell me they‚Äôre letting me go, and it‚Äôs not working out. I was surprised honestly, as I said above my work has been nothing but commended by supervisors recently, so it felt really out of the blue. I did always feel a little like ‚Äúthe black sheep‚Äù of the workplace due to my social awkwardness, but I just assumed that was me overthinking things‚Ä¶ I guess I wasn‚Äôt. 

After I was fired, a coworker relayed to me that our boss apparently reiterated to the rest of the team that they need people who are ‚Äúbought in to the company and have drank the koolaid‚Äù (I feel like they don‚Äôt really understand the implications of that statement, but I digress). That to me paints a clear picture that my firing had nothing to do with my job performance, and everything to do with me just not being a social butterfly who lived, slept, breathed, and ate my job/company, and was obsessively dedicated to it. 

They of course didn‚Äôt say a damn thing during my exit meeting explaining the *why* of their decision, but I mean if my work is good, why else‚Ä¶? 

Anyways I find myself half relived, and half shitting myself in a panic at the moment. On one hand, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve had that stress removed from my life, but on the other hand, now I have to scramble to find a way to provide for my family ASAP which really fuckin sucks. I already have some leads, so hopefully I won‚Äôt be unemployed for long. "

There is this one new person at my place. Been here 2 months. She was very nice and friendly for about a week, then she has shut me down completely. Will not look at me, will not speak to me, but will sit around my area and chat with co-workers at long lengths like they are BFFs. Even closes doors to avoid looking at me if we are in the same area. Really fucking cold. 

To make it perfectly clear I have done nothing terrible or offensive to her at all, no sexual jokes or innuendos, no highly personal questions, no asking her out (she's not my type anyway, and way too young) Just the ""average"" co-worker talk until she went silent to me. I really cannot fathom what I have done to her to deserve this treatment. She makes me very unfcomfortable when she comes around, and I haven taken to leaving the room to stay away from her. 

I'm pretty sure I could ask my supervisor if she has said anything, but that just opens to door for more gossip and bullshit around the office, and we have enough of that as it is in this place. Unfortunately we are going to have to interact at work as she is in my department, but I really REALLY don't want to at this point. Should I just wait until we are expected to do something together and just tell my supervisor how I feel? 

I don't know what to do other than just avoid her like she avoids me, but it's starting to make me feel bad and unwelcome. Every time I see her I just want to give up and leave work. I don't have many friends, and was hoping to have at least a few people at work to talk to during the day so I can feel more like a human being. This has become rather upsetting for me, and I don't know what to do."

I need a little perspective. I work for a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù organization. I am a Christian myself. I am the receptionist, therefore I hear about everything that happens in the office, and sometimes people will rant to me on the phone about things that I probably shouldn‚Äôt know about. 

I had a phone call today from a girl who was fired, and she was looking for her last check. Apparently my supervisor has been giving her the run around and said ‚ÄúI will give you your money when I feel like it.‚Äù (According to the girl on the phone.) She asked for the executive director, and I told her he was busy, and she proceeded to tell me her story, in hopes of getting me to him and not his voicemail (at least I think.)  

To my utter shock, she said that she and 5 other women were fired for reporting sexual harassment. They felt unsafe in their environment and left work early, and were technically fired for attendance. Like, what? This made me so mad that I wanted to get up and walk out right then and there. I called my dad and he said that I need to give it some time, and then act. My pastor and husband said the same thing. I need to calm down and think through this before I just up and quit. I am pregnant, and my emotions are all over the place anyway. Is this something that you would quit over, or am I just being an irrational pregnant mess? 

Also‚Äî I believe they fired the person the women accused as well. "

I completely understand the restricting on advocating for the police. The restriction on landlords seems like an off-topic tangent, but it's understandable too. It's the employers bit I don't understand.

Are we forbidden from discussing how a morally/ethically good boss should act in the situations people post about.?

ESOP's are business run by employee's. Are we forbidden from encouraging them?

At the present moment, I need to buy food and groceries from somebody in order to live. It would be Kinda nice to identify some places I can spend my money those don't treat employees like garbage.

Actually advocate it Wrap your mind around this real quick. Remember this is state government work not corporate. I would assume some corporate folks may feel the same.

For example you and the colleague working from home are in similar roles, working for the same agency, but face different conditions and requirements. The fact that you have to commute to the office, dedicating more time and incurring travel costs, while your colleague works from home with more flexibility and no commuting expenses, creates an unequal situation.

This inequity can lead to feelings of unfairness, particularly if you feel that your work and contributions are comparable to your colleague's. The extra time and expenses you incur may impact your work-life balance, productivity, and overall well-being.

P.S. this post did not bode well in Jobs subreddit. Most people said it‚Äôs part of their compensation package when it‚Äôs not. The union would of negotiated something for all units if it was. We are all paid by rank. You only get raises for time served per year. I work in state government and not corporate. So we do not negotiate ‚Äúpackage deals‚Äù for compensation or work from home deals. Some units allow all workers to work from home while others don‚Äôt. I for instance wake up at 6am and do not get home until 6pm. That means I dedicate 12 hours of my day to work. While others wake up 5min before work and log off right at 5pm while in their living room. I might be crying a river but, damn 4 hours of extra personal time instead of commuting adds up.

These boys 11-15 are part of the State's underbelly. I get paid $11 an hour to be with these kids, and the atmosphere is rough. I'm the only young white girl apart from the tired old black ladies. 
I don't know how long I will last. 
 My first week this woman got me to take off my other job early, I agreed to pick up her shift. When I got there, she did not leave. I sat as a background person for hours. The night shift came and I clocked out, she said you can't clock out without my consent, ""I'm assistant manager!""
I wasn't supposed to be there. 
That was my first warning. 
For Easter she made me cook deviled eggs and then threw me under the bus for bringing the items. 
Yesterday she publicly humiliated me by saying she is the only one doing her job. She roped the nurse in with her and said now I have a witness.
Then she and her left me with the kids and they descended upon me banging on the table calling me a wh0re. 
She stayed on the phone for hours calling coworkers and friends, loud capping everything and said it's her entertainment. To have the kids bully me to was a different level of hell. I'm told to watch these kids at all times where they are locked in this house in the ghetto. 
It's worse than jail. In the meeting I was accused of not watching the ""consumers"" enough. 
I felt so angry.

2,2024-05-09,"I hope this is okay to post as I needed to get this off my chest somewhere. Job coach is out of contact, caf√© I finally got a trial employment still hasn't provided a contract and yesterday friend of the boss, coworker essentially called me stupid.",u/zauraz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1co8855/i_hope_this_is_okay_to_post_as_i_needed_to_get/,antiwork,"So I have been unemployed for a while, everything from housing to general life is sorta falling apart without income including student debts from a programme I am stuck on my bachelors following covid and a series of life crisises.  
  
I finally got a shot at a caf√© here in town, they basically ran me straight to a trial employment. But were really scarce on the information.  
  
I worked last week and asked for a contract, a written one and my boss promised it. Nothing. I brought up my job coach and the labour organization/insurance needed the contract. He insisted on calling my job coach directly and did so. Apparently they had a conversation talking and saying it all would be fixed, but my coach has said squat to me and I am realizing he is getting paid for getting me into a job. Not what it entails.  
  
So I have been waiting till friday to see what their talk is about. Hopefully it resolves but I preparatory applied to join the union.  
  
He tells me during the shift that ""You need to stop thinking these weird things, we are a serious place"" and again ""it will be resolved, don't think about it."". Fyi Restaurant and Service is known to be among the most exploitative branches in general here.  
  
So well apparently ""don't be concerned"" is a valid response? Its my first job, a review of the place was really bad but I also have seen how it works and I see signs of issues. Sadly I really like the place and the caf√© environment.  
  
Today I learnt my boss is sexist, complaining that he ""hates working with women"" as his wife was coworking and he generally hates ""simpleminded questions"" or anything he considers ""too basic"". Having worked earlier on demand in service it's always varied what is okay and what isn't and I have seen people do basic things and get chuffed out at because it wasn't okay there.  
  
Enter yesterday, first time working with a coworker I have only ever seen around. He starts asking about the shift the day before (we survived, it was a bit stressfull but understaffed). When the first order comes he asks me to make a coffee and I reply honestly I don't know if I can. Nobody has truly explained the coffee machine to me. I have observed it. Watched closely as others use it and tried sometimes but I haven't caught the drift of how to use the steam for the milk. Also people keep telling me ""don't"" if I try or ""I will do it"" and I don't want to waste resources. So yeah no I haven't learnt it. He asks me how long I have been there. And then scoffs and tells me ""a week and you don't know how to use the machine? What have you been doing?"" And goes on a longer tangent that ""I can't rely on my boss to explain it to me, you need to learn that yourself."" And asks me to check TikTok/Youtube and self learn. I will admit I can be too passive at times or not consider things, but I always try to do over and do better.  
  
I tell him I will and thanks him for the advice but he isn't done. He proceeds to keep going that ""why haven't you done this by now, you should know this"" etc. This will become a theme, because no promise of change or acknowledgement that I did wrong and I will fix it changes his stance. This becomes a recurring thing, if I do anything small wrong, if I ask something he doesn't like, if I help him with something its always ""you are doing it wrong"". ""You need to be more independent."" ""You should know this by now""  
  
When my shift replacement comes in as I am about to sign out the first thing he does is tell her how ""<Me> is unskilled, they are a white belt. I am a black belt"". And basically never crossing the line smack talks me. She is clearly not that positive about it all. I clear out, throw some boxes and then sign out. My shift is over.  
  
As I am about to leave he meets me in the corridor. I tell him I signed out and about the boxes.  
  
And now it comes, again with the full ""you should know the coffee thing"" to ""use youtube and tiktok""(4th or 5th time he repeated the same thing during the entire fucking shift. I am basically just replying ""yes you told me and I will"" and he seems to take that personally. He motions me to join him in the kitchen. Idk why I did, courtesy?  
  
I think he noticed I was clearly fed up with him because he began with a ""you need to stop assuming what people think before once, fucking again talking about things he had brought up earlier that I did wrong, some more serious than others but nothing life ending. As I said here I even accept that I could do better but this entire time its been clear he does not care about that. He wants to make some point or another.  
  
In a lot of ways he reminded me of my bully from grade school.  
  
So following pointing out my mistakes he asks me how old I am, I reply and he scoffs when I tell him I am 26. Immediately he begins with a ""you are 26 and you know nothing."" Honestly I don't remember most of what he said but ultimately he says ""look at <coworker>, she is 17 and knows all this, and you? 26 and you know nothing at all!"" And then goes on a whole rant about ""this job can't do with a mentality that is like ""wake up at 8 and come in at 9"" ""you need to prepare physically and mentally and tbh I fucking lost where he was going with his point. He kept me over almost 10 minutes just ranting (he was supposed to work). At the time my emotions ran high and ultimately I told him I had signed out and I was leaving. He did a random brofist as if he said something friendly.  
  
Ultimately I was too off guard and ended up crying after leaving with how target it all was.  
  
I was unprepared then, I won't be again. I tried to think if there was any moral to this story or like him trying to give some valuable info. I could see some but nothing about how he told me it was constructive. It mostly felt from tone of voice and all like a ""you are useless and dumb and you should feel bad.""  
  
At least I found out he had done no preparations so my boss was irritated as hell today. Similarily at least he always arrives 2 - 5 minutes late and generally did a lot less work than me. Mostly hanging around a way younger woman that it was clear was no relative or similar.  
  
Doesn't help most caf√© staff and coworkers I have skew 17 - 19. And mostly women beside him and my boss. Me being trans puts me in limbo for them but at least correct gendering is common.  
  
Sorry for the rant. I just needed to get it out :/  
  
I hope I get the contract as I really need the job. But idk what to do if not. I also need to be more assertivr in demanding it and at least I can threaten union if nothing.  
  
Its clear my jobcoach shared some personal misgivings I had with my boss so I feel my trust there was broken. I am mostly tired.."

Many years ago I worked in a main dealer (stealer) chain. Ford to be specific. Ford had plenty of dodgy dealings but this is about our used car department who had the right to buy and sell any brand. 

Enter Citroen people carrier. Semi auto. High buy In price. Ever dropping re sale value. Lots of expensive work required...

I can't remember if we bought this from the auctions or it was a trade In but either way the owner saw the writing on the wall and knew things were about to get expensive so we ended up paying far too much for it. 

Pre sale all cars were inspected for work that would affect re sale value like worn brakes, tyres, scratches and missing trims etc that customers could use as a bargaining point. We. It was portrayed that we did it as we only sold ""quality cars"" but it was just a facade for maximum markup. That quality joke still runs to this day. Unlike the sold cars. 

This citroen was obviously traded in as the semi auto box was on its last legs. They shift slow anyway but this thing practically buffered between gear changes and then the bloody clutch slipped. Other highlights were well worn tyres an brakes on the limit of acceptable for sale. 

The work order gets sent through with marked issues and parts and labour cost well outweighing the estimated profit margin so we expect it to go to the auction in hopes it will re coup some purchase cost. 

Nope. 

C A P I T A L I S M Ensues.

All work gets denied and the car lands on the pitch with all of the above issues and a hefty price tag. The sales tech queried why tf are you selling that with the shagged box and gets told its fine. It's been sold by another site...

I'll never understand how or why people buy without test drives but our unfortunate victim walks in. Picks up the keys and heads on home with his family. 

Except he didn't make it home. 

The vehicle returned on a low loader the next day and was abandoned in our doorway with an unsurprisingly very unhappy customer in tow. Turns out that almost buggered semi automatic gearbox was now totally buggered and wouldn't drive anymore.

We were now on the hook for a clutch pack change amongst other things and this is my favourite part.

Customer rips into Sales manager  and then he comes down kicking off we should have seen and reported this etc. He's quickly shut up by the still unprocessed sheet of paper listing all found faults with his signature of denial of work on it.

He then let's slip they had made ¬£1 on this sale. That's why he denied that work.

That was it

That was his justification. He stood to make ¬£1 on a car almost guaranteed to come back.

And he made those 100 glorious pennies. 

It then cost him north of ¬£3500 to have that transmission removed and rebuilt along with some other customer issues they basically had no choice but to accept repair costs on under fear of the ombudsman getting involved.

Best day at work ever watching them lose almost ¬£4,000 over the need for ¬£1 in profit.

2,2024-05-09,Underpaid Mandatory Meeting,u/mxjxs91,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1co971q/underpaid_mandatory_meeting/,antiwork,"So real quick, context of the job: I'm on the road. I get paid 1 unit per job which usually takes 45ish minutes each to do, 30 units is full time. 

I have a meeting coming up, it's mandatory, and expected to take 3 hours long but only pays out for 1 unit, which is 45 minutes worth of my usual work. It also happens to be on a day where I'm an hour away from the meeting location and I'd have to cut my day at least 1-2 units short just to make it there on time. Plus I'm usually done with work by the time the meeting starts so not only lost units and more driving (which they will pay for the mileage for the drive to the meeting), but now they're also eating into 3 more hours of my day plus the drive home. 

Does anyone know if I have any legal grounds or any legs to stand on at all to argue this or is this acceptable since it is technically a ""paid meeting""? I'm going to bring it up one way or another, but any insight that anyone has that could help my argument other than the obvious ""you're paying me for less than an hour for 3 hours plus missed jobs"" would be appreciated.

Worth mentioning I've been at this job for about 8 months and there has been absolutely zero things to complain about, they've been wonderful so far and the work-life balance has been excellent, but this one stand-out thing just seems like complete bullshit.

The recruiter at my temps calls me and tells me they want to pay me $70K and full benefits. Well, that works pretty well for my circumstances. l pretend all week that I know nothing about nothing or a job offer in the works. It finally happens. I‚Äôm ready to jump in the air. 

They slide a paper to me with $42K written on it. ‚ÄúThis is all we can afford.‚Äù I‚Äôm probably the lowest paid in the company. I was so stunned in a bad way that my people pleasing ways activated and I only asked if there was a chance I‚Äôd be able to earn more. Omg. 

It‚Äôs literally a dollar more than I make at the temps. I get a few benefits that I didn‚Äôt have, so technically it‚Äôs a step up,
but wow. I‚Äôve never been so unenthused after coming up with innovative, efficient ways of doing this job and taking on extra duties. 

I can still walk away, of course. Are the people worth it? They are the nicest I‚Äôve ever worked for. I suffer from CPTSD that was largely work related. So, that‚Äôs worth something? 

I don‚Äôt even know. I had plans for that hike in pay that is really basic.  I feel like a turd just fell down from the ceiling and said, ‚ÄúThe good news is‚Ä¶perm job offer with full benefits. The bad news is that I‚Äôm a turd and will be sitting in the next cubicle over for the duration of your time on the job.‚Äù Meanwhile, my supervisor got a promotion. She likely deserved one. She just built a brand new home. Guesses as to where that difference in my pay went? Augh!

Back to square one of the job hunt. My recruiter isn‚Äôt answering my texts or call. Thanks, Dipshit. "

[https://youtu.be/RMgooUIWiy4?si=D0pIMdmeeFmsVboG](https://youtu.be/RMgooUIWiy4?si=D0pIMdmeeFmsVboG)

One guy ended up getting arrested for possession of a firearm because he disarmed a man that pulled his gun on a group of people-- likely as retaliation for not being nice & cordial to the cops.  Anyway, he talks about businesses seeing that on his arrest record and thinking he's a criminal.  

Why aren't all arrest records expunged when the charges are dropped or you're found innocent?  It's always been crazy to me that simply getting arrested for something can haunt you when our system is based on ""innocent until proven guilty in a court of law"".  SMH"

Quit the job same day",u/Luigisa,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1coa43l/new_hire_promising_job_boss_and_i_got_on_well/,antiwork,"I'd been out of work for a month, was desperate for work,  and had accepted an interview with a small 3 man company. And no, Im prejudiced to company sizes, but in this case, it proved to be a great tell...

All three of them at the interview, opposite me, and the questions fly. I say this with levels of modesty,(at the age of 23) that I must have impressed them because the boss asked when I could start. I said immediately after the interview as I had questions as well. I asked the ones relevant to my ""new position"" and I started an hour later after I was handed a server, raid card 8 drives and told to use the best of the drives to build a raid 5 for use on an exchange server I would now build. I was warned I had til end of the day - 4 hours - or I fail.

For context, I've build a myriad of servers, but never, at that time, the softwares on them. In my old job We had whole teams dedicated to the systems, and our team was the baseline team.

Anyhoo - on to the story -

Step 1 - I message a mate on installing exchange, easiest steps to get it up etc, written notes if he could (yes, methods to my madness).

Step 2 - while I waited I quickly rebuilt the server components, making sure all in it's lovely new home.

Step 3 - start testing drives of same capacity, find them 8 in short order. Install the drives and connect to plug in raid controller.

Step. 7power on and start working on the raid setup. Everything goes 2ell,up til time to apply rhe config and boom, no error, but config is gone. Cutting it short, I spent the next 30mins try different config with2+ drives, same result. So I tell the owner raid card is potential dud, does he have another. He huffs at me for my audacity, but gives me another card. 2nd one in, build the raid config in 5 mins, and wham! We good to go.

Step 8 - installed windows server in quick order, couple 1uirky changes if my own input/configed, and then open my phone for final step

Step 9 - exchange installation - well, my mate came through with the list of all lists in fucking powershell... üòÇ So, yeah, off I head into this marginally new side of doing it, but was done in record time, in my books, with an hour to spare. 

Rebooted the server for final test, and all seems good. Open exchange, setup dummy domain, blah blah, and do external testing to validate, and it's working.

Head to the boss, tell him it's done, working and running fully through Internet. He frowns at me, shakes his head, and sighs as he gets up to check. Once he's happy, he sends his 2IC into validate. He's quicker in testing but happy, even gives the impressed look.

Now to the part that made me say nothing but walk out of the job after 5 hours - owner calls his 2IC into his office to get him to check the raid car that ""I"" said was faulty. The dude checks it out on his custom bench, has same results I got, tells the boss the card is a dud. Owner said ""but it was working a year ago when..."" I walked out the door, started my bike and left.

About 3 years later, found out the company closed for nefarious workmanship at clientele. I worked with a colleague and we picked up 60% of the dropped clients. Made huge killings repairing what had been done."

It's easy shift for the most part and used to be somewhat stress free with lack of "" supervision "" whatever that actually means because most jobs dont have eyes on you for 8 hours no matter what you are doing except amazon but that company is actually comparable to satan.. anyways. Even JOBS that DO have strict supervision and camera do not stop people. It doesnt stop people from making mistakes or doing wrong on purpose. I.e. police officer or amazon employee stealing and going to jail.

The current manager for this place is rancid. Gone bad. Sour. Its obvious to me their only goal is making friends with employees, jokes, and inappropriate work place conversation about ex lovers, alcohol, and violence. if you arent friends or coming in extra you are a target. And I cant understand why but the place has seemingly givin them full access to the camera system which they use freely regardless of incident or reason. 

I really cant comprehend how a person is paid salary and just gets to sit comfortably and spy on footage of work with no real rewards or benefit the next day seemingly. They will take screenshots of things or mops that look dirty and try to say they skip refilling it. We are dilligent we get our stuff done we never even steal soda from the drink fountains or even touch one of the 1000s of employees personal items.. we are constently critiqued about things they know nothing about like how we look like we arent listening during our daily meeting LOL as if they know on camera when lead is talking about mcdonalds off topic or when hes talking about how theres nothing interesting for 2 min and to have a normal work day. Yea totally didnt pay attention and if lead feels that way he could tell us not manager from orbit lmao.

They also try to enforce time limits on certain tasks but tell me one restroom in the entire world that gets the same exact amount of use and dirtiness every single day, public restrooms too. They are trying to be amazon manager for the janitors its so cringey and dishonest work to judge us only by footage especially those of the opposite gender (me) that they admit they cant check our work in person if they wanted to which is BS take 30 minutes before 6 am to check a restroom and put a do not enter sign...

Anyways since starting here ive had no positive feedback (in ~1 year) and only critique of how things look on a camera screen 10 feet in the air.. For a cleaning labor job... ive been given repetitive lifting tasks involving lunch room chairs that almost injured my wrists and elbows because im not a ""complainer"" when complaining about this pain they asked if it was pulled muscle when i was specifically explaining to them my joints and nerves were hurting. Ive been written up twice for essentially messing up my time clock first time purposefully second time i basically had to stop working because i got sick but didnt tell anyone till next day

Ultimately I dont know what to do I am on final notice. Any day they could probably get rid of me but I have noticed its hard for them to hire new people often taking months at a time, and I do a lot of the heavy machine type work that others cant and I have the largest restroom in the building 50 toilets so I cant imagine them wanting to remove me just keeping me in control I guess.

i can walk right to save my life and still have loads of pain. will need more work on my body when im ready. back surgery and my pelvic rami bone grea back deformed and will have to be fixed at some point.

Schedule A occupations are pre-certified and thus employers do NOT have to prove that they first sought American workers for a green card job.

From Tech Target:

""The proposed exemption could be applied to a broad range of tech occupations including, notably, software engineering -- which represents about 1.8 million U.S. positions, according to U.S. labor statistics data -- and would allow companies to bypass some labor market tests if there's a demonstrated shortage of U.S. workers in an occupation.""

Currently the comments include heavy support from¬†[right-wing think tank Cato](https://www.cato.org/blog/dol-must-update-its-schedule-shortage-occupation-list-streamline-green-cards), and[¬†the American Immigration Lawyers Association.](https://www.aila.org/aila-files/04031D46-F246-470F-ABE0-A6ADEAA21342/24042403.pdf?1713977695)

The San Francisco Tech scene has been riddled with CEOs whining over labor shortages for the past few months on Twitter/X amidst a sea of layoffs from Amazon, Meta, Google, Tesla, and much more. Now, we know that it's an attempt at influencing the narrative for these rule changes.

Stem graduates are having a hard time finding a job, now, with many submitting thousands of applications to no avail. This rule change will only make things worse.

1,2024-05-09,I think they're trying to make me quit,u/greee-eee-easy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1coblwi/i_think_theyre_trying_to_make_me_quit/,antiwork,"Crossposting this:


Hello, I'll try to be concise here. 

I work at a regional financial institution in USA where I was hired almost 18 months ago as a hybrid employee. The job is an hour away from me, but since I would only be expected to be in the office twice a week (and was unemployed at the time I was hired), I took the job. 

My performance has always been great. My boss had even been talking about grooming me for an open team lead position in the department. My most recent review was right before I went on 8 week paternity leave in February, and everything was great. I met or exceeded expectations in every category. 

My wife had a very difficult pregnancy, during which my manager was very flexible about me working remotely more than the expected 3 days a week. Since the baby came, I was expected to go back to 2 days a week in the office, and even though I had specific days (that I decided up front) to be in the office every week, my manager was flexible about it since my wife has been struggling with a few health issues after the baby. Their stance was always that they were flexible about which days I came into the office as long as I made every effort to switch or make up the days. I specifically asked about this to get ahead of it in case they wanted documentation for my wife's medical conditions, knowing that exceptions had been made for other employees in the past in similar situations. I was told something akin to ""documentation to work from home? Haha as long as you're working and not exhausting your pto and making the effort to switch your in office days we can work with you. If you need to miss time and use all your pto then we can talk about accommodations or FMLA."" 

However since returning from my leave about a month ago, things have changed. My manager told me that my first day back had to be in the office since my access could only be restored on site. Unfortunately my whole family got a stomach bug the day before I was set to come back, so I called out early that morning. About an hour after my shift was to have started, my boss calls me and berates me about why I haven't logged in yet. I said I was sick with a stomach bug and that I was under the impression that my first day back from leave had to be in the office otherwise I would have logged in from home. They told me I was wrong, that it was just encouraged that I be on site first day back, but either way I either needed to log on immediately or get a doctors note for the absence (company policy is typically that a doctors note is needed only after being out 3 consecutive days). I got the note, in which my doctor said I should be excused that day, and be able to work remotely until I was better for the next few days. 

Upon returning to the office the next week, my manager joked that they were more pissed off at me for that than they had ever been at someone on their team, but that it was a misunderstanding and water under the bridge. 

The following week and last week saw me rearrange my in office days due to my awful allergies and my wife's medical condition, but I still did my two days. My boss responded to one of my requests last week saying ""I need you to be in the office two days a week more often than not,"" so I made sure to do that. 

Now this week, my whole family is sick with an upper respiratory virus, so on my first usual in office day yesterday I asked to work remotely since I had a fever, to which my boss said was fine. Then today I called out because not only am I still sick, my infant son is really sick and was up all last night and I needed to get him to the doctor. So my boss calls me later this morning to tell me that they think I'm taking advantage of the work from home accommodation, that I haven't been in the office on my assigned days or two days a week since I've been back from leave (not true), so they're taking the privilege away from me for the foreseeable future until I earn it back, starting next week when I'll be expected to be in the office every day. I bring up the conversations we've had as recently as a couple weeks ago about the flexibility they have knowing my family situation, but they tell me that I never give notice and that it's creating issues with team (99% of my job function can be performed remotely). So moving forward if I need to take my kids to the doctor or I have an appointment or my wife has one I have to use my PTO instead of being able to work remotely as usual. Too sick to come into the office? I have to take PTO instead of being able to work remotely. 

Every way I look at this I feel like I'm being pressured to quit so they don't have to fire me or lay me off. The company has not been performing well for a while now and lots of people have been let go in other areas. Everyone else on my team is allowed to remain hybrid including a few who are fully remote (one being remote because they live an hour away, per my boss). Exceptions are made all the time for other people on my team if they need to switch in office days or work remotely instead all the time. The hardest thing about this is how this will impact my family dynamic with small children and a wife with medical issues, not to mention the increase in gas money to drive 2+ hours daily I'll be spending with an already tight budget. 

I did speak to HR about it today, but they're waiting for me to advise them if I want them to really get involved, but I'm not sure how to proceed. I'm supposed to have a one on one with my boss on Monday since they won't be on site until then. I had yet to have received any warnings about this until today, but I feel betrayed. I've really liked working for this manager and company in general, and this completely feels out of the blue. Any thoughts on how to proceed? I have a friend who is a manager at a different company who thinks I need to get HR involved ASAP before I have my one on one next week, but I'm not sure. 

TLDR I think I now have a target on my back and should probably find a new job sooner than later. Unfortunately my company has a policy that if I voluntarily leave within 120 days of returning from my parental leave (which ran from February to April 2024) that I have to repay them the money and insurance costs from when I was out on leave, so this puts me in a difficult position.

Am I being screwed? 

Update: followed up with HR today, asked them to intervene ASAP and to start the FMLA process based on advice in r/jobs. When asked what my ideal resolution would be, I said to find out why this is being done to me so suddenly without warning as well as why I'm being treated unfairly and retaliated against, and to be allowed to resume my normal hybrid schedule or everyone else on my team should lose the ability to work remotely like me.

I've been working in a corporate office job for nearly a year, when it comes to Friday I'm mentally exhausted from either the overload of work, cleaning up messes or being so blisteringly bored I will scroll on my phone for hours rotting my brain, making up useless spreadsheets, trying to look busy. For the amount of work that actually gets done, ideally I really only need to maybe be working less than 6 hours for 3-4 days a week. Instead I drag myself out every morning to get sit at my desk in a windowless office and dissociate for sometimes 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.

I'll say it's extremely preferable to working in retail, but it's draining regardless. It comes to the end of the week I just wanna knock off and fuck around. I don't believe this makes me irresponsible, I actually like working when I'm doing absolutely meaningless tasks and trying to fight through the last 30 minutes of the day. But most days I feel like calling out sick or even rocking up and just leaving midway through. Not because I can't be fucked, but because I want to go do something fulfilling to break up the monotony and drivel of being a desk jockey. I'm too tired by the weekend to do anything, so I rot in my bed and go through the continual cycle of burn out. I would think it be more efficient for corporations to not want people in an office for 40 hours a week, but here we are. 

I know I perform way better when we've had a public holiday and I only have to do 3-4 days. I literally get more done. Being an adult feels like a joke and autonomy is conditional. Idk maybe I'm too young to understand."

They destroyed a stable schedule, actively work to get people in trouble/fire them, make horrible decisions for the people we take care of. It is so disheartening. They have done some seriously sketchy things that I cannot even act on because I am so pregnant and need to protect my income for my child. 

The tipping point beyond all the terrible shit they do was my one boss calling me the wrong name multiple times after working with me for 5 months closely. Think ‚ÄúKara/Sara‚Äù or ‚ÄúChelsea/Kelsey‚Äù type of name mess up. I can‚Äôt wait to get the fuck out of there. "

- **Senior Employees Leaving:** These policies especially cause senior employees to leave for larger competing companies
- **Effects on Companies:** This outflow of experienced staff can indeed hurt a company‚Äôs productivity, innovation, and competitiveness

I complained to my manager about her last week for the first time. My coworker asked me one day if I ""forgot to take my meds"" because I'm not a chipper person in the AM. Now...I don't take meds and she knows that, this is one example

Highly unlikely they'll fire her since she's been there for 1 yr and she's retired so this is her ""fun"" money job

Today she tried to throw me under the bus to my manager. There's this whole situation with a clients appointment today, it's not covered because there's limitations being set by the insurance. I tell the client why. My manager tells them she'll write it off and the client leaves. We're all discussing it and my coworker pipes up and goes/states ""and there was no reason in the pop up side section?? you immediately delete those without reading them"" I replied that I NEVER immediately close them and I always read them, I just read fast

I sent off a email today for a client and I forgot to add something in as a attachment. The place emails me back asking for said attachment, I IMMEDIALTY reply, apologize and attach it, I then delete it.  4-5 hours later and its slow, my coworker asks me if I sent the attachment off.

Me & my mom think she doesn't like me cause I'm not trying to be ""buddies"" I'm slow to warm up and honestly, I'm here to do a job & not make friends. If we get along then great!

Throw me a bone.

First off, when a company sets mandatory office days, it shackles you to a specific location, even if showing up in person makes zero sense given the nature of the work. This flies in the face of true flexibility where you should be able to knock out your work from anywhere.
Then there‚Äôs of course the commute. Say your company decides to up and move or shuffle around its office locations. What used to be a quick 20-minute drive can suddenly morph into a grueling two-hour marathon. Lovely.
Lastly, shifting sands. Even if your company currently only asks for moderate in-office attendance, who‚Äôs to say they won‚Äôt crank up the number of required office days out of the blue? This kind of flip-flopping makes it tough to believe that your work-life balance is safe from future upheavals.

So, are we really talking about flexibility here? Or, maybe, is it just old-school office-therapy wrapped in a shiny new package."

You go into work daily not knowing if you are going to be involved in fights. If some spiced up gang member is going to attack you, and always awaiting the dreaded alarm on your radio.
(spice is a common drug in prison)

The job had so much more bullshit involved.
If you put hands on a prisoner. Paperwork. If the hands on prisoner isn't justified. Investigation.
Also the longer serving staff have basically become almost numb to everything, like someone could die right in front of them and they wouldn't even flinch.

I finally found a new job and went straight to my supervisor with my resignation.
I gave 4 weeks notice. But my boss said
""Our week starts on Sunday, so your last day would be that day'
This meant it would be 4 weeks and 5 days notice.
I said ""OK, not a problem""
(Bearing in mind weekends are worse because less staff and more work)

So I finished my shift that day. Called in sick the next and never returned. No one called me. I didn't hear anything from HR or my boss.
Still got paid for the 4 weeks as normal pay (as UK sick absence laws are very lenient in government jobs)
Left with my head held high.

This job taught me that it's more important to do a job that is at least satisfactory and that it isn't soul crushingly depressing.

Just by that I will use more than 1 hour and it could lead to a termination. 

I think it's absolutely INSANE that a company is allowed to tell an employee how much time per week they are allowed to use the bathroom for. It's completely inhumane and insane. Further, I was told it used to be 5 minutes a day, I would've quit on the spot after hearing that.

I work for a charity supporting care experienced children and young people. I work specifically on one programme usually as a Programme Coordinator. A colleague had emailed everyone asking if someone experienced could support 2 young people (both over 18, with one young person older than me) on a residential for a youth leadership camp. I replied over email and said I‚Äôd never been on a residential with young people before but had supported on overnights with the seniors and was happy to help if needed. This colleague is not my manager but a manager on a different programme. She didn‚Äôt know many details about the camp but told me what she knew. In the lead up I was then was put in contact with the organiser of the camp itself and began talking directly to them but passing on any info and questions I had to the manager of this other programme at my work either in person in office or online depending on where we both were. We even sat down together and completed a Risk Assessment about the residential and the 2 young people I‚Äôd be supporting. Then the organiser messaged me about sleeping arrangements for the camp, asking if I wanted to share with the young person who is older than me and with the other young person too or whether we‚Äôd like to all be split up. This was over WhatsApp and naturally, I asked the manager, word from word from the text how I should respond as I had been doing with my other questions. She said it‚Äôd be fine for us to all share and (from memory) she raised her eyebrows at why they would want to split us all up. I do want to mention that this manager‚Äôs partner had also v recently had a bad accident and so she may have been distracted. This was all in the office so unfortunately no paper trail. I went on the camp, came back & I thought all was OK. At the camp there were other organisations whose staff were also sharing rooms with young people. Fast forward and yesterday, I had a meeting with our safeguarding officer and head of programmes and was told this was a severe breach of company policy. 

It was raised as the young person who is older than me had complained that I hadn‚Äôt participated enough at the camp (which was dismissed as the other young person and staff at the camp had thought I was an asset to the camp). I explained everything in this meeting as I have above and when talking about how I had checked with the manager first about sleeping arrangements was told that it would be okay to share rooms, they expressed surprise as she is clued up on safeguarding etc. and was the one who raised the concern (this manager has been working there for 10+ years whereas I have only been working there for almost a year). To me this felt like they were making me out to be lying that we had had that conversation in the office. They emphasised that I am not being suspended for this (and implicated that I should somehow be grateful for that), however cannot work one to one with young people for the time being until I complete more safeguarding training, read over policies, and they can ensure I can work safely with young people, which to me makes me feel like a predator or something. I felt I had done my due diligence by asking the manager these questions and by doing a Risk Assessment with her as I knew I wasn‚Äôt as experienced (where she did not once raise sleeping arrangements and where it is mentioned to discuss this in company camp protocol (which I was only sent after we had completed the risk assessment)). At the end of the meeting nothing about my well-being or anything like that was discussed. I feel as if I am the only one to have faced repercussions even though I felt I had done my due diligence and had gone out of my way to support on another programme that is not usually my line of work - it just really feels like a slap in the face and I don‚Äôt know know how to move forward from here. Does anyone have any advice? I should mention that in the past few months I was rediagnosed with severe anxiety and depression (mental health issues known to my manager) and this has severely impacted on my mental health to say the least to the point I am feeling suicidal. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep all night and am unsure if I can work today. I am also seeing if I can book into see a GP today (who has been offering to write me a sick note for the past few months)."

It's the least of my issues now but just to provide context, the role was advertised as clerical work and it is not, it's factory work lol. I also got sold down the river by my bosses surrounding a promotion that I earned and am now jumping through hoops like I'm in the fucking circus to get, I got forced to relocate and am now commuting for 3 hours a day, the office is in the back of an industrial estate and I don't drive. There's not even like a corner shop within a 15 min walk and no vending machines in the building so if I forget my lunch I just do not get to eat.

The people I work with are beyond incompetent, everything you hear about civil servants is true, there are insane levels of bureaucracy the likes of which you've never seen before. I'm also autistic and it's a very loud and bright environment and spend my shifts being overwhelmed the entire time.

The only reason I've stuck it out is bc my promotion is to a technical role, I have an ordinary bachelor's degree in maths and computer science and having done a couple of tester days up in the office I know it's a better fit for me, plus it's hybrid working so I'll be at home 3 days a week once I get it. Not to mention it's a 7k payrise and I've only ever really worked minimum wage, it would be so nice to have a little bit of a cushion financially for once.

The issue is that I'm cracking up waiting for it, I interviewed and found out I passed in August and I'm still stuck here waiting on it. I have to get an assessment done by the internal  doctor which is probably going to take weeks, and I'm kinda at my limit. I know I should just stay and grin and bear it until I get the promotion but my mental health is destroyed, I can't really function anymore either at work or outside of it and even though it may just be weeks left til I get promoted I don't know if I can last that long. I've already started applying for jobs elsewhere which I probably should've started doing the second I got this job but what can ya do. 

TLDR can anyone give me ways to cope with working a job I hate with people I hate in an incredibly overwhelming environment that requires hours of commuting?"

It‚Äôs not common to see someone frowning at the French revolution or other insurrections that lead to positive change in the future, but the idea of destroying things or people that harms us nowadays seems distant from reality.

We have been brainwashed to care more about materialism and private property than human rights and morals. Everyone loses their mind if students broke some windows or furniture while protesting a genocide. 

My opinion about why is that we‚Äôre educated by media, society and authorities to think everything is solvable through diplomacy alone. Thinking like that makes recursion to violence seem unnecessary, and organizations that make rational use of it would be seem as wrong no matter what benefits their actions may bring.

A great example on how this stigma impacts the way we deal with problems is climate change and the way we‚Äôre dealing with it. It is something that‚Äôs projected to affect millions of lives in the future and solving it through dialogue alone doesn‚Äôt seem to be working a whole lot. Yet the organizations and people who dedicate themselves to combat it do it in a way that negatively impacts more the average person than the ones actually responsible for it. People often criticize those peaceful protests, but it feels like our values restricts them to those fruitless actions unless they want to be seem as barbaric and inherently wrong.

From Tech Target:

""The proposed exemption could be applied to a broad range of tech occupations including, notably, software engineering -- which represents about 1.8 million U.S. positions, according to U.S. labor statistics data -- and would allow companies to bypass some labor market tests if there's a demonstrated shortage of U.S. workers in an occupation.""

The 'new experience' is so infinitely, obviously and demonstrably watered down on every conceivable level and it's asking for a higher retail price and expecting micro transactions. All of these mega corps games now are demonstrably, impossibly worse than their own previous products... and you can go and see it. Which is why they want to end digital preservation of these games so people stop using them to expose how shit they are now but that's never gonna happen. Just like you're never going to stop piracy, emulation, modding and hacking. It is simply an inevitable fact of life.

  
That wouldn't mean much though by itself but the corporations... are further exposed by the very thing they have weaponized against us for decades: Capitalism. May the best product win. And when one passionate developer, not even a rockstar developer but just someone dedicated enough, is able to outsell a behemoth like Call of Duty... it's a little challenging to keep up the facade and explain why you have to pour millions of dollars into failing products that often struggle just to break even. And that is how it all comes home to roost. This isn't like other older industries where the mega corps have had time to deeply ingratiate themselves on a celluar level to them and dominate the entirety of them from within. They may yet have a strong hold here but it's a far cry from the power they hold in other industries because they have not been able to find a way to shut out the competition.

  
There are countless options for players outside of the mainstream titles and we are seeing more and more these titles taking the mega corps over their knee and spanking them with consumer friendly practices and pricing with quality products that don't sell as lemons and make you pay for fixes. In an ironic sense the gaming industry as it stands a perfect duality of capitalism at its best... and at its worst. And above all is gives the lie to the corporations for all their supposed power and wealth. They have tried to infiltrate journalism to affect this perception but gaming journalism is one of the most mocked and belittled field, save maybe Alpha Male Boot Camps and Crypto Bro schemes. The fraud is so obvious and in your face even the average Joe consumer can hardly be swayed by it.

  
The longer this goes on the worse it will be for these corporations. Things like the PSN mandate for Helldivers 2 demonstrates just how frail and weak these corporations are, that they can be forced to eat shit by a united community all in a weekend's time. And the more this continues to go on the more likely consumers abroad are going to begin connecting the dots here to other industries and realize just how weak and frail these corporations really are. Because for all their ego, pride and vanity they are only as powerful as the people allow them to be and the gaming industry is the most compelling argument to the case that we can make these 'corporate gods' bleed.

I was working 12 hours lifting sodas off the pallets getting the actual stuff that people want (That they put on the bottom of the pallet of course) and putting in all back on the pallet because it doesn't go out.

  Not being able to use an electric jack on bare concrete floors in supermarkets? I did that for two months straight and my knees are hurting and I can feel them scrapping bone on bone. The organization of the company was Cleary made for only medium to small cities and they need to split larger ones into two offices. This was just the tip of the iceberg, I could literally go on for hours and probably write a book of grievances and how to solve them, but that would be a snore read.

2,2024-05-10,Turning down increased responsibilities without hurting my relationship with management?,u/Sentientsnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1coshqq/turning_down_increased_responsibilities_without/,antiwork,"Hello, I‚Äôd like some input for an issue I‚Äôm facing at work where I‚Äôm being asked to pick up a hefty chunk of responsibility that I didn‚Äôt sign up for. Preferably from people who have any experience in management as that‚Äôs who I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm about to piss off.

I started this job about three months ago, but I‚Äôve been in the industry for 7 years. My experience got me hired and in my interview they asked if I had ever worked in a leadership position, which I have not and I said so. I moved through training quickly, and at the end they asked if I would be willing to work as a back-up Lead. I made my hesitation very clear, I told them it made me nervous and I was hesitant to agree to anything. That kind of got laughed off, but they did acknowledge my reluctance every time they brought it up after. I was given reassurances that it wouldn‚Äôt be bad and they trusted me to handle it.

Yesterday my manager called me and told me that starting today, for the next month I would begin training for the Lead position. Not to take it over, but just to be able to cover in case I‚Äôm needed. The way she rushed through the reassurances and phone call let me know that they are aware that I don‚Äôt want to do this.

As I‚Äôm going over what my new responsibilities are (managing work flow, ‚Äúbabysitting‚Äù by making sure people are actually working, figuring out break schedules, and more all without supervision or management present as I would be doing it on the weekends) and then finding out I‚Äôll need to be doing this in addition to my typical job responsibilities instead of in place of them, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not willing to do it. None of this is in my current job description, and the compensation they‚Äôre offering is no where near where I would consider appropriate (+$1/hr).

Outside of this issue, my employer seems to like me. I work hard, I was given a glowing review at my 3 month check-in, and all my coworkers say good things about me. As for myself, I know I could handle it, I know I‚Äôm competent enough, but I‚Äôm not willing. I left my last job severely burned out and I don‚Äôt want to be driven to that point again.

I plan on sticking with the training for another week to show that I gave it a chance and also so I know exactly what I‚Äôm turning down, but I‚Äôm not sure the best way to refuse the job duties. I think I want to say something like ‚ÄúI appreciate that you considered me for this position, but I‚Äôm not willing to take on these additional responsibilities right now,‚Äù but I‚Äôm not sure if that will totally turn them off to me. Any advice on how to approach this is welcome.

Additional info: I am a part of a union and my management is not. Tbh I‚Äôm not worried about being fired, even though I am technically still in my probationary period. I have not even been told by management what the compensation will be, I had to ask other co-workers who are also trained as back-ups."

21,2024-05-10,Pregnant wife fired today,u/EscapeSolution,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cp27kh/pregnant_wife_fired_today/,antiwork,"Hello,

Like the title states my wife (31) was fired today. She worked for progressive insurance as an auto repair rep. She was on restriction/light duty since December due to pregnancy health complications. In other words, She had been bed ridden until the end of Jan. She followed her supervisors orders and he took her ‚Äúclaims‚Äù away and gave her side tasks that assisted with reports and she was fully wfh per doctors orders during those times. Come March and present day, she‚Äôs been on light duty, but still wfh. Her supervisors boss, had ran a productivity report and saw during the months she was on heavy restriction it appeared she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt working.‚Äù Meaning filling her role as a field rep. So he reported her to HR who then saw the report showing she was not in fact in the field. Well, as stated before she wasn‚Äôt supposed to be in the field during those months she even followed every single supervisor order. Turns out he was wrong in informing her what to do and she was able to fight that. From there HR and the manager did a full scan into her work habits and saw the one thing that they could fire her for and that was timecard inaccuracies where she would log out at the time she was off but not report overtime and considering CA is an at will state I suppose that was their reasoning for immediate term. I‚Äôve filed a lawsuit against them for her regarding this issue for unlawful retaliation for her being pregnant. Not sure it was gain any head way, but as a husband I felt it was my duty to try every avenue. We own a home here with a 3k month mortgage, have a baby daughter on the way in 2 months, have considerable debts (student loans, cc, car, ect.). I just want to know what would be your first step if this were you? She has a side business selling crystals on live sales, but it‚Äôs hard to get any traction doing that nowadays and she‚Äôs hoping to go full time with it now given the circumstances. Any advice even if it‚Äôs just silly would cheer us both up

A little about me, I work in software and make about 100k+ a year. She was making 75k. Her crystal business brings in little pocket cash here and there. "
44,2024-05-10,Your employers do not care about you,u/firefly11_11,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cp2ap8/your_employers_do_not_care_about_you/,antiwork,"I‚Äôve worked with this guy, V, for over four years. I‚Äôve watched him grow and learn our work at an exceptional rate and he has risen to a recognized figure in our field. He is currently on a work visa to the US and English is not his first language, but has consistently demonstrated a very proficient use of the English language, as our work involves a significant amount of writing. In the four years I‚Äôve worked with him, he has never taken a vacation, rarely calls in sick, takes on additional assignments and other tasks, and has been instrumental in helping train new employees. He has obtained the highest certification you can get in our field (I have it too - not many in our office have it and it‚Äôs extremely hard to pass) and he holds a doctorate level degree. Additionally, he holds the most internal ‚Äúgold stars‚Äù (recognition from other people in our organization) and these are highly regarded. He‚Äôs held this record for years as he provides exceptional service to our stakeholders.

Today he announced that he‚Äôs leaving our department for another department in our organization. I was absolutely shocked at this news as he is one of the leaders in our department. He called me shortly after the announcement to tell me how much he‚Äôs enjoyed working with me and to thank me for all of the training and guidance I‚Äôve provided. So, I had to ask: why are you leaving? The reason: our department told him that they will not be  sponsoring his work visa again. *Not the organization, our department.* V is transferring to another department in our organization and they have offered to sponsor him for permanent residency, which is a path to citizenship - something he has been trying to accomplish, but our management would never facilitate.

I cannot fathom why such a dedicated worker, proven leader, and well awarded employee would not be deemed retainable by our department, which is significantly understaffed as is. I‚Äôve watched our leadership steadily decline over the past four years. We used to be a ‚Äúfamily;‚Äù that turned into a soulless, uncaring, ungrateful department led by management who honestly does not give a sh*t about anyone.

Our VP tells everyone in staff meetings, ‚Äúmake sure you‚Äôre using your vacation time, because you‚Äôve earned it and we don‚Äôt want you to get burned out.‚Äù When my coworker, V, requested his very first vacation (he wanted to travel back to his home country to see his family who he hasn‚Äôt seen in five years), management denied his request. He had requested to take four weeks; this is not an uncommon request as several other people in our department have done similar vacations (including the VP), as we have a very diverse office with people from all over the world. 

V is a person who has worked extremely hard to achieve everything he has. He just bought his first house last year. I am still sitting here, completely dumbfounded at the actions of the leadership in our department. They constantly complain that we‚Äôre understaffed and can‚Äôt achieve our metric goals, but they will allow a top performing employee to leave because they don‚Äôt want to pay the ~$3k needed to sponsor his visa?! We work for a multimillion company that has vast resources and deep pockets. 

So yeah, I‚Äôve been searching for a way out, but this event will expedite that process immensely. 

Your employers do not care about you."

Empires fall because their systems fail to adapt to newer generations. The new generations silently protest this system, and through years of attrition, the system collapses... taking the light of their empire with it.

Hello revolutionaries,

It has come to this. After examining the triumphs and downfalls of previous empires, I‚Äôm excited to share The Light: a visionary economic model that utilizes augmented reality (AR) to facilitate a multifaceted supplementary economic system. This model encompasses specialized currencies designed to foster personal growth, community engagement, gender understanding, and support for family life, all within a framework that promotes economic equity and community development. Yes, designing a holistic solution is incredibly difficult and is potentially impossible to implement, so feel free to post any thoughts, insights, or feedback.

**Overview of the Economic Model**

This system employs an AR platform complemented by publicly owned semi-automated infrastructure to manage specialized currencies, each serving unique societal functions:

Personal Growth (Red) Currency: Earned through activities that foster personal development and health, focusing on demonstrating the application and recall of skills and knowledge. Spent on food, drink and equipment that further fosters personal growth (ie. dumbbells, books).¬†An extension of this idea is that if you complete some schooling (like let‚Äôs say you finished secondary education) then you will earn a base amount of red currency every month.

Community (Green) Currency: Acquired by contributing labour to public and community projects, directly improving individual living standards and enhancing community infrastructure. This currency is spent primarily on personal accommodation and home maintenance expenses.

Family (Pink) Currency: A more experimental currency (curious about your thoughts on this). This currency promotes self-gender understanding, opposite-gender empathy, and supporting family life, which is earned through participation in gender education, childcare training, and related programs. This currency is primarily spent on child and baby supplies and certain reproduction-related products. The design north star of pink currency is to promote higher birth rates and greater cohesion between the sexes.

In this supplementary economic model, members will be able to convert some amount of their currencies from this¬† system into cash but not the other way around. This is to prevent exploitation and to preserve the integrity of the system. Under consideration is whether there should be caps to currencies and if users should be allowed to go into debt.

AR System

The AR (Augmented Reality) system at the heart of this economic model is an advanced, interactive platform that integrates digital information with the user's real-world environment. It is designed to enhance individual learning experiences and community engagement through a range of innovative features.¬†

Essentially, the AR system gamifies the living world into a massively multiplayer online game that encourages personal growth, interpersonal trust, community improvement, and even exploration! Engaging tasks are handed out by virtual avatars of prominent local figures, allowing members to engage with figures of their community's history and also giving them a new avenue to preserve their legacy.

The AR system should be designed with robust security protocols in mind and have analog backups in the case of technological disruptions. Also to prevent ‚Äúcheating‚Äù significant events and tasks (such as an Education Recall Assessment to earn Red Currency) should be done in person. Under consideration is that The app should need to stay open to record task progress to discourage users from cheating and/or potentially to curb social media/phone addiction.¬†

Integration of Publicly Owned Automation

Automation plays a crucial role in producing essential resources, ensuring that technological advancements benefit all community members equitably by providing necessities like food and housing materials. We can already automate the production of crops and plant materials; harnessing the power of publicly owned agriculture automation, we could ultimately give away free locally produced food and use plant materials as renewables. It is not at all beyond our capabilities to create fully automated greenhouses. Products created by these greenhouses can be sold for red or green currency.

Community Profiles and War Simulations

We want people to better associate with their local community to prevent issues such as social stratification and globalization.

Community Profiles: Enhance local identity and pride by allowing communities to create profiles showcasing their history, achievements, and cultural values. This will make community participation much more engaging. Community members can vote on slogans and mascots, allowing people to emotionally invest in their local community.

War Simulations: Competitive events that mimic historical or hypothetical conflicts, designed to foster teamwork, strategic planning, and community cohesion. Territories and resources won in these simulations are periodically reset to maintain fairness. Real Conflicts between neighbouring communities could potentially be settled by these war games.¬†

Enhancing Independence and Competence

To ensure that our community members are not overly reliant on technology, we propose integrating more traditional, hands-on methods of learning and crafting:

1. Local Workshops and Fabrication Labs: Establish centers equipped with tools for woodworking, metalworking, and other crafts, offering hands-on training and preserving traditional skills.
2. Material Banks: Create repositories for storing materials like wood, stone, and metal, sourced from local environments, promoting recycling and sustainable use. These materials can be purchased locally for cheap using Community Currency.
3. Tool Lending Libraries: Implement lending programs for essential tools and machinery, ensuring access for all community members.

Education and Training

In this era of technological uncertainty and inequality, we must put greater focus on creating well-rounded generalists. Specialists will still be highly in demand in the age of AI and AGI, but this system is not focused on creating specialists due to social stratification issues.¬†

Ultimately (like way down the road) we want to create a program whose teachings will produce constituents that (if absolutely needed) are capable of handling all their needs themselves. I.e., they can comfortably house themselves, feed themselves, and maintain themselves if they ever find themselves stranded in a forest.¬†

Some additional program workshop examples:

Vocational Training Programs: Expand offerings to include both modern and traditional construction techniques, fostering pride and a sense of accomplishment. Continually educating citizens in construction, maintenance, and safety inspection could bring countless new benefits and freedoms.

Mentorship Programs: Connect novices with experienced craftsmen for skills transfer, extending beyond crafts to include life skills like gardening and cooking.

DIY Workshops: Regularly scheduled sessions empower individuals to manage their own projects, reducing dependency on external services.

Geographic Expansion

We propose expanding these initiatives into less populated areas in North America, such as northern Canada and the inland USA. This would alleviate urban housing issues and promote economic diversity. Under consideration is capping the number of members in high density urban communities to incentives constituents to migrate to less populated rural areas. Imo pressuring migration can be really good but I‚Äôll leave it to Economists to prove this.

Seeking Your Feedback

Community Engagement Features: How do you feel about community profiles and war simulations? Do they add value to community and individual engagement?

Pink Currency Initiatives: Given the focus on promoting gender empathy and supporting family life, how can we ensure these initiatives are inclusive and effective?

Reducing Tech Dependency: What are your thoughts on our strategies to balance technology use with traditional and manual techniques?

Geographic Expansion: What implications and potential benefits do you see in expanding into less populated areas of both Canada and the USA?

This proposal is more than just an economic alternative; it‚Äôs a blueprint for a future where technology and community values synergistically improve quality of life. I look forward to your insights, critiques, and suggestions on making this vision a practical reality.

Thank you for your engagement and may The Light forever shine on our Empire!"

It has been two months since I was promised that the raise would take into effect, but I have still yet to see the money. Upper management said it would be coming in ""two weeks"" about 3 times, and when I asked them for a further update they said that the organization is facing a cash flow issue because one of the city-level organizations that gives us funding has not registered the contract. they allege that we will receive ""back pay,"" but I do not trust them given their previous deceitful communication about the pay raise. 

I am tired of the uncertainty and of doing twice as much work at my old position's pay rate, so I was wondering if there is a way to recover the (increased) pay they owe for duties performed according to my new role. do I have any recourse to that money? I have the new job description with the increased salary amount in writing and I also saved all communications with members of upper management about the raise."

190,2024-05-10,"I have a meeting with my boss after she fired someone for complaining about, and declining, going to a scientology ""training"". What do I even say? ",u/CEOofWhimsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cp4xw5/i_have_a_meeting_with_my_boss_after_she_fired/,antiwork,"Recently, the small veterinary practice (sole proprietorship, 30 employees, California) i work for had us all do a ""business training"" that was just scientology. 

I, and 2 other people, expressed our displeasure and wrote emails, so it's in writing, that we are declining further training like this. 

One of the two was quite vocal about it and was telling everyone what it was and that we can't be forced to do it. No one else declined, but it caused quite a stir. The executive team (dr. Owner, dr. Owner's Daughter, the technical manager and the practice manager) called a meeting, doubled down that their HR company agrees its secular. Then the employee that spoke out the most got fired. 

Now my dilemma:

I love my job. I have advanced very far in my career in the  2 years I've been there. I started a a receptionist at $18/hr and now I have my own office and make $25. I have a good thing going here. And I very valuable to the company, a lot fell apart when I was sick with covid for a month last year. 

I genuinely did/do like the executive team people. I trusted them and considered them friends. I knew the  practice owner/matriarch was a little questionable, but was assured the rest (a younger generation, taking over in a few years) were on my side. I was OK just being dismissed from the trainings and moving on until she eventually retires. But they took her side in the meeting. I get that is just them protecting themselves, they have families and kids, but it still hurt. 

But they way they handled it and fired him is absolutely outrageous. If one of my friends was telling me this was happening and her work, I'd be sending her links to what laws they are breaking and helping her find a lawyer. 

But because I know these are good people at heart, either being conned or just trying to get by, and because I have SUCH a good career path here, I am trying to find a way to be OK working there. 

I told them I am taking some sick leave while I figure out what i am feeling, then I will have a meeting before I return to work. I know they want to talk to me, but dont know much else. I have heard they are not mad at me and dont blame me for starting it, but i dont know who to trust. I do have some leverage I think, maybe I can get something put of it. Or maybe I really do just need to walk away.

1,2024-05-10,I got PIP‚Äôd; can I ask for more severance?,u/ta-chrome-cowboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cp892c/i_got_pipd_can_i_ask_for_more_severance/,antiwork,"and I have a choice to make next week: take the 4 week PIP with no severance should I fail or 5 weeks of severance. I worked there for less than a year and they overhired last year, and I‚Äôm the one with the biggest salary. It‚Äôs clear they want me out. 

A lot of the PIP completely misconstrued my performance, but some of the comments were flat out lies:

Example 1: I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfinish‚Äù my onboarding for example when my manager has slacked me that the onboarding courses I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfinish‚Äù actually are empty modules in our learning platform

Example 2: I presented other people‚Äôs work as my own for a project when there‚Äôs literally version history showing in the only one in the file

Do I have any leverage to ask for longer severance? The HR rep said I could send over a write up or however I want to make it to contest the PIP (after my manager left the call) but I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs saying that because I cried on the call and he wants to placate me.

Also, I was given a poor 6 month review (at my 3 month mark, I literally missed the deadline to not have one by a couple days) which also misconstrued my performance. He did say at the time of presenting that I was ‚Äúalready improving‚Äù. My boss said I should do X, Y, Z things that I already was doing. Every other coworker loves working with me and we collaborate well, so I was completely blindsided by that first ‚Äúreview‚Äù. He would tell me I could ask for help and then he weaponized the one time I did ask for help in my review.

I never got a verbal warning that I could be PIP, and I‚Äôm not sure if that 6 month ‚Äúreview‚Äù could count as a written warning.

Anyways tl;dr: 4 weeks of PIP OR 5 weeks severance. Do I have any leverage (or is it common) to ask for more severance or am I fighting a losing battle?"

We spoke about the state of the job market, the difficulties associated with seeking employment, and so forth. Then the subject changed to the most recent interview I had with a company and how they were overall impressed by my background, but concerned about the tenure I had with my past companies, many of which only spanned 1-2 years and the majority of which were contracts. I had explained the reasons why the duration was relatively brief, typically either the contract ended, or I found a better opportunity that was more aligned with my skills and experience, or in one case I was converted from one agency to another at a significantly reduced salary and lost all my benefits.

I expressed my frustration, because at my current position isn't a great fit and which I reluctantly accepted because my contract ended with my last role which was misrepresented to me as a contract-to-hire position that the recruiter emphatically assured me would lead to a permanent position, but ultimately didn't pan out due to ""budgetary constraints"". This new position I've interviewed for, is one that closely aligns with my skillset and background and offer a number of benefits that would lead to greater professional development and better future job prospects. I find out that the director I'm interviewing with had a mutual connection with my former colleague, I then inform my colleague the day before my interview and evidently, the two did have a brief conversation and the colleague told me that based on their interaction, the director vocalized his concern about the number of jobs I've held, which I later clarified the day after during our interview. I then have a private conversation with friend and colleague and I mentioned that while I do understand their reservations about potentially hiring a candidate who from their perspectives, seems untrustworthy due to their track record of moving on every one to two years, it was for the reasons stated above. However, at the same time, I think it's quite ridiculous to expect company loyalty when the bulk of your employment record consists of what are essentially temporary jobs, most of which did not lead to permanent positions.

Knowing this, my friend suggests that I go ""above and beyond"", strive to be the ""best"" one on the team, to take on extra projects, to increase my workload and work overtime. He insists that I take the initiative and that and be proactive and create innovative solutions to common problems. He recommends that I take some courses to acquire knowledge and skills that would enhance my career. Now, I will preface this by stating that none of this poor advice in and of itself.

However, I do take umbrage with the notion that all you need to do is ""work hard"" and ""be the best at what you do"" and exceed the expectations of management and the organization in order to achieve some hypothetical reward of a conversion, a promotion, a salary increase, etc. The problem, of course, is that I've already done this with two companies in my past. I did anything and everything, I worked diligently, I did overtime, I worked on weekends and holidays, I took on projects and what did it lead to? Micromanagement, threats to be written up for asking a question by my team lead, constant abuse and harassment via electronic communication by my team lead and field analyst. Nothing good came from it, no promotion, no raise, no permanent position.

All it did was enable management and co-workers to exploit me more easily. The conversation then turned to a skill that would immensely aid in my career goals and I acknowledge that it would be a valuable skill to have, but that my approach to learning required a more structured setting as it would be more conducive to my approach to learning and he just told me and I'm paraphrasing, that it was ""Just an excuse, and that he went to the library and learned all this himself, and if I really wanted to know it, I'd make time and put forth effort to do so."" Which, I suppose is true, however, what I am skeptical of is, is having this skill really going to give me the job I want or is he merely appealing to it based on his own anecdotal account of what lead to his own individual accomplishments?

How would any of you respond to this? What are your thoughts? Thanks."

but i eventually figured out the leave so now i have job protection at least. but i dont qualify for disability from my job bc my boss hasn‚Äôt given me enough hours in the past months. i‚Äôve been scraping by paycheck to paycheck but i was already pissed about how few hours i was getting beforehand, even more so now that i can‚Äôt get paid because of it. i have to go thru the state for disability and they will probably pay me significantly less than my stupid job did. i‚Äôm so pissed off. all of this bc my boss doesn‚Äôt like me i swear. fml. i don‚Äôt know where to go from here. tomorrow i‚Äôm gonna try and figure out state disability but if my mom is right then i‚Äôll only get 60% of my regular wages which is barely enough for rent, not counting bills, food, cat food, etc. this shit sux"

I remember while working there I didn‚Äôt sleep much, hair was falling out, had 3 cellphones constantly going off for work, broke out in hives, gained a ton of weight, had numerous health conditions, was constantly stressed and snappy. Stress is a hell of a thing.

I was dumb and devoted all my time to that job, context I was second in command from the CEO. I still recall she handed me a lawsuit that she had received 2 weeks ago- handed it to me 24hrs before she left on vacation and told me to figure it out. I saved the company from a $750k lawsuit and got a gift card for $40. 

When things got shakey because she was a control freak about peoples schedules, we had so many staff quit, I tried my best to mitigate. When I would work remote she would call my work phone 8 times an hour. Because she thought I was slacking off even tho we had a project management tracker. She ended up blaming everything on me because I was head of operations, I was dumb and signed the paper because I was so mentally checked out.

I checked in on my computer the first day of vacation to find my manager scheduled a meeting for me that day. Umm no I'm on vacation. Checked in the next day to find an email saying ""since you didn't show up to the meeting, I'm cancelling your vacation,"" and she did, in fact, retroactively cancel my time off. So I replied to the email basically saying, this was pre-approved and I'm not accessible during this time, bye."" And of course, resubmitted my time. I assume she's trying to force a situation of job abandonment. How is this shit legal?

Bit of backstory: she's been out for my blood ever since I reported her for some stuff, and HR is in line with her retaliation. Can't say too much for another couple of weeks, but can follow up if interest demands.

I asked to be converted to hourly instead of salary, add to this, my manager kept giving me reasons not to do it, and explain to me, that if I was on hourly, I would not be working as many hours, as I am now.

Because of the schedule, I am working and how much I‚Äôm getting paid I had been casually applying to other jobs, and actually landed an offer.

This is not one person, he does this in every resign occasion it's like shaming the resigning person for resigning in front of everyone and trying to hold back the resigning person, possibly using them without paying them in their notice period.

The manager gaslights that the resign party is a form of respect. maybe my other colleagues that resigned had no choice so they went along, but I can't be driven, I'm the driver. Okay he pays for the meals, but then everyone has to say something about their impression on the person that resigns and he wants the person that resigns to also say something back in front of everyone. To me, that is (or can be) humiliating, this can be perceived of something good by other people but I see it as ""See, I'm a good manager because I'm giving resign parties to people and I'm going to make all of you feel bad for even thinking of resigning even though I'm not evaluating my own competence"" kind of behavior.

On my first day of the job, it was also the same day this one person resigned, of course there was the party. I already thought about the point above since that day but ignored it and tried to think positive about it.

They loved me so much they made a position available for me after the one I initially applied for got filled internally. I already feel so welcomed. They‚Äôve been sending me emails of menus and asking me to pick something out for my lunches next week. They are so transparent and have sent me a full itinerary for my orientation‚Äî*down to the hour*.

Im just so impressed. Coming from the most unorganized mess of power hungry leadership, this new job *literally* feels like I‚Äôve lost 100 pounds. It‚Äôs out there guys. It‚Äôs a hard and unfair grind, but goddamn does it pay off. "

12,2024-05-11,How I was fired from my first job!,u/Flynnr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cplyjd/how_i_was_fired_from_my_first_job/,antiwork,"Preface: this is an old story, but I still get a chuckle every time I remember it.

Got my first job at a local convenience store back around 2006 or 2007.  Had been working there for a little over a year, so I knew my first raise was around the corner (an extra $.25 to add to my $5.25 an hour).  Was in high school at the time, so it was a big deal for me then.  Right around my year mark, another employee was hired with the same first name as me.  Very common first name, so nothing unusual there.  I noticed after my one year that this new guy had received a raise (he had been bragging about it to other employees).  Curious as I thought that only happened after one year, I went to management to inquire about my raise and when I should see it as I had no reason to not believe I wouldn‚Äôt.  After an ‚Äúinternal investigation‚Äù my raise was given to the new guy on accident because we shared the same first name.  They then informed me they would not be giving me a raise as they could only give out one and since it was given to the new guy, they didn‚Äôt have another to give out and wouldn‚Äôt take it away from him.  Whatever.

Shortly after this I put in scheduled time off for my birthday coming up as I was going out of town with friends.  It was never approved or denied and I found my name on the schedule for the time I requested off.  When I approached management about this, I was informed I could find someone to switch if I wanted to.  So I did.  I found another individual who confirmed with management to take those days and I could have the time off.  On my second day out of town, I got a call from my manager.  ‚ÄúWhere was I?‚Äù  I informed them of me switching with another employee, again, and told them to call that person and that I was out of town and had no way of making it back in time for my shift.  I was told ‚Äúwe would need to discuss my *second* no-call, no-show (both days of my scheduled time off) and my attitude‚Äù when I returned.  At this point I realized they were just wanting me to quit, but I wouldn‚Äôt make it easy on them. 
They didn‚Äôt put me on the schedule my first week back.  I called towards the end of the week to confirm I would be on the schedule for the following week, as apparently mgmt needed to discuss some things with me, and mgmt said I would be.  One day.  That was it. 
I showed up on my one day that week ready to work and before I clock in, get called into mgmt office.  I was terminated for my no-call, no-shows and my ‚Äúattitude‚Äù when they called me into my shift.  
I still love seeing the same managers in the same roles almost 20 years later never having done anything else in their lives.

TLDR; petty mgmt fired me from my first job because I called them out on their BS.  They still work the same roles 20 years later and I love telling them how to pack my groceries."

9,2024-05-11,My department suffers incompetent leadership from a team member that the big bosses allowed to take over when our manager left.,u/JiafeiLiveSeller,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cpmvjk/my_department_suffers_incompetent_leadership_from/,antiwork,"For context: for months now, I‚Äôm (30+) in a department with Former Manager (37), Current Team Lead (22M, important detail), and Close Coworker (30+). The ages are important because this will reflect on CTL‚Äôs behavior.

After 2 years of working there, FM left the company for personal reasons unrelated to work. For a while, Big Bosses tried to look for FM‚Äôs replacement, but they weren‚Äôt satisfied with the applicants.

As FM left, CTL, a young ambitious team member who has a lot of energy and enthusiasm for this company after his first ‚Äútraditional old-school corporate‚Äù job (which he got via nepotism, btw), self-imposed himself as the team leader even though there was no official announcement or onboarding of him. CC and I just accepted this as the working situation for a while. CTL even proudly said that ‚ÄúBB will promote me to manager‚Äù even though CTL was an inexperienced fresh graduate whose degree had no relevance to the department he was supposed to be managing.

But eventually it got to us as CTL was showing signs of the following:
* very poor time management. Always asking to reschedule meetings at the last minute, asking external stakeholders to adjust. He‚Äôs also constantly delaying 1:1 with us or canceling them, and he delayed our 1:1 5 times‚Ä¶ rescheduled it once without checking we already had a 1:1 slot the next day.
* always assigning tasks via verbal communication or random slack messages but never via the official task management channel our entire department agreed upon on
* very poor prioritization. Once a project is thrown at him it becomes a ‚Äúpriority‚Äù. Then when another project is thrown, that becomes the new priority. Then he‚Äôll go back and forth with them.
* always imposing short deadlines for CC and I but never alloting any ample time to consider that BB might request changes and revisions for our projects. 
* always had grandiose project plans and short timelines without considering that it was just the three of us‚Äîme, CC, and CTL. But he insists that we can do it. Then when BB looks for these projects, he‚Äôd often say that ‚Äúit‚Äôs taking a while‚Äù bc duh, it will take a while.
*He doesn‚Äôt listen to the external stakeholders when in a virtual meeting. I‚Äôve had to start subtly correcting him.

On my end I also noticed CTL is undermining me even though I try my best to do what I can with my role.
* it‚Äôs my 1:1 he cancels and he always asks me to reschedule meetings with external stakeholders because ‚ÄúI need to manage my workload‚Äù.
* in our weekly company meeting, he suddenly deleted my slides of updates about a progressing project because ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a priority‚Äù. But when a meeting related to that project went well, suddenly it‚Äôs a priority again.
* He delegates projects that don‚Äôt reflect my strength or what the company hired me for. I was getting suspicious that he was outsourcing my role‚Äôs tasks. He also did this to me and CC when he requested an impossible deadline.

Thus, this caused CC to file their resignation. CC worked around the same time as FM. I‚Äôve asked CC to help me convince BB that making CTL a manager is a *grave* mistake they can‚Äôt recover their time from."

Also our performance ratings 1-5 (exceeds to not meets) are a forced distribution dependent on the department budget every year, i.e. if the department budget is bad, more people will get bad ratings regardless of the work they did that year so the company doesn't have to pay as much bonus. So basically my performance rating is dependent on my work and also the economy.

I asked for a change in teams. Being a good performer my boss's boss said that us not an option. So I escalated the issues to him and HR.

It's been 10 months since I have been working under a female boss. 
Her leadership style is to instill fear and control the team.
She gave me feedback that I am too nice to my team, and to control them, I have to be stricter (yell at them)

I did not yell. However, I got strict with them and distant myself from the team. My team told me that
""She will make you do this only so that when she starts torturing you, no one from your own team will stand up for you, and this has happened in the past,"" 

I got back to my original style of leadership. She started taunting me in the name of jokes. She started saying I have people management issues to juniors in the team. My appraisal was affected due to this. 
She makes assumptions and talks to me with the decided outcome of the assumption. Eg. She told me x and y employees don't do any work. She called my juniors to validate while I told her that they do work as I am the one who gives approval for the final designs that go out. She started yelling at me, saying it was her opinion, and she was allowed to have one. 

I am also subjected to loose comments like she doesn't trust me. Or if I have worked with one of my team members and helped him on the areas, he is weak. I have to give her updates on the progress. To which she goes laughing on the floor saying that I am suddenly that team members best friend. She has called that team member, who is a designer, saying he is more suitable for an admin role. 

Then there are days when she wants to hang out with me out of the office. I took that as an opportunity to build a positive relationship with her. 

But things did not change. She used to give me silent treatment like I did not exist, and sometimes she was my best friend. And something her anger and rage. I would come to work every day with a lot of anxiety, not knowing what kind of day I would have. 

I spoke to some of my colleagues and was warned that if you give her ur feedback and ask her to mend her ways she will have an exit strategy for you and it has happened 6 times in the past. I have also witnessed her vindictive behavior. So I dropped the idea of letting her know. 

But I had had enough because these were just 10% of the issues. 

I asked for a change in the team and raised these issues with HR (new HR team) and her manager (also new). To which her manager asked her to mend her ways and give me more freedom to run my team. 

HR, on the other hand, has started an inquiry by taking one on one with all her team members.

The issue is that I am super anxious because she has started letting the team know that I am a back stabber and someone who can not be trusted. She is influencing the one on ones. The HR is aware of and has stopped the meetings, which will be resumed next week when she is on leave. 

She has told some team members that I will never work in her team. She has become so vindictive towards me She is excluding me from tasks, directly talking to my reportees, and calling me a backstabber.

I hate going to work and think I made a big mistake asking for a change in team and standing up for myself and the team.

As of January this year, a new temporary Supervisor was assigned to oversee my work at the company where I've been employed for the past 7 years. I felt uneasy right from the start due to previous stressful encounters with him in 2019.

On two occasions back in 2019, I had troubling interactions with this Supervisor. Firstly, while I was multitasking between taking calls and working on homework (with company permission), he abruptly instructed me to cease my homework. Despite informing him of my authorization, he returned to my desk, leaned over, and forcefully shut my textbook. This incident left me deeply shocked and upset. When I approached HR, they dismissed it as a ""miscommunication"" without an apology, merely suggesting that he was approachable for discussion.

Following this, about two weeks later, he publicly reprimanded me in the call center for allegedly smoking too close to a door, even though I was smoking within the designated area for smokers. Although disturbing, as he was not my direct supervisor, I chose to distance myself and move forward after feeling shaken, opting to avoid any further confrontations.

Fast forward to four months ago when I was placed under his supervision again. Within the initial weeks, he summoned me to a meeting with my manager and accused me of avoiding work. In a subsequent meeting, he retracted this accusation, stating he did not intend it. I was utilizing a software that I was trained on, unaware that the company had recently prohibited its use.

Accusations of work avoidance were alarming, leaving me anxious for weeks about potential repercussions. I took my concerns to HR, filing a complaint against him, only to be told once more that it was a misunderstanding.

This year, I experienced significant personal loss with six family members passing away, for which I utilized some of the bereavement leave allotted by the company. Although entitled to 40 hours per family member, I did not exhaust all this time.

A week after narrowly escaping a reprimand for absences that were actually covered by my mental health accommodation, my Supervisor scrutinized my use of bereavement leave over the past year, specifically questioning my relations with deceased family members. He categorized great aunts and uncles as non-immediate family, insisting on detailed records to ensure ""accurate timekeeping.""

Receiving an Excel spreadsheet to document my bereavement leave was deeply distressing and intrusive. Being asked to outline my deceased relatives' details in such a formal manner felt excessive and emotionally overwhelming.

Unable to face a meeting due to emotional distress, I shared the required information directly with HR. Feeling unfairly targeted, especially given the timing of these inquiries, I raised another complaint. However, HR maintained their stance, citing the necessity for accurate record-keeping in potential audits.

I‚Äôm stressed and looking for advice and considering resignation and want to know how this looks from a third party perspective

Please, for the love of all that is good and holy, if you are a customer in retail- STOP targeting untrained employees for ""acting stupid"" and ""not doing their job correctly"" when they likely, don't know HOW to do their job correctly! 

This is usually due to a result of something called 'shark in the water training'. The basic idea is to not completely train an employee so that they may learn from their mistakes on the field. This mistake, could very well be YOUR mistake that the cashier/ associate is trying to navigate-- likely alone with little help or explanation. Even IF explanation is given, it is usually LITTLE explanation and not comprehensible but yet, it is always the fault of the cashier/associate. 

These types of business and managers will bull doze over their associates and cashiers to make themselves and the company look better. Don't believe the hype! It is likely not the fault of the associate/cashier in not knowing how to complete a specific sale, ect. 

For instance, if a customer is purchasing a large ticket item and the managers have not properly briefed the associate/cashier on the proper procedures to complete said large ticket sale and then you, as the customer, calls the associate ""stupid"" for not knowing how to complete in full (i.e. paperwork, ect.). Turn around and ask yourself a wondering question, ""How much are these cashiers/associates trained on this subject?"" The answer is likely either ""not very much"" or ""not on this specific thing"". 

  
Oh yeah and the associates are sworn not to bring up how little they are trained. So we just are basically meant to sit there and take verbal abuse not only from the customers we are dealing with who are understandably frustrated with the lack of knowledge, OR verbal abuse from the management staff.

Most of these steps were introduced as ""innovations"" that senior management got excited about, had meetings about, sent a company-wide memo about... and then lost all interest in within a few weeks. Or the senior exec who implemented the change has since left the company, and their project has been abandoned but remains clogging up the pipeline like a clump of extra-wiry public hair in a drain.

The steps are things like ""navigate to a particular tab in this spreadsheet and find the relevant code in the table and append it to your report when you submit it"" (for something that is no longer being tracked) or ""when submitting, navigate through 100 options in this dropdown menu and find the one that's most applicable (again, for something that's no longer being tracked). You can't skip these steps because the software is set up to reject any report submitted without them.

As a result of being exhausted by these million and one steps, I'd say my personal productivity at work has been cut by at least 80%. Fortunately, no one seems to care. There's no point trying to flag these steps for removal because my manager has no power to make any decisions, and his boss has no power to make any decisions. All previous attempts to run suggestions up the ladder have been met with irritation from senior management that the peons (a.k.a. people with multiple degrees and decades of experience in the industry) would have the audacity to make suggestions.

In conclusion: Everyone on or near the front line knows they're doing pointless busywork and that it's hurting the company's bottom line. The people who are supposed to be looking out for the company's bottom line don't care and won't listen. And that's why I'm writing this post on company time! :-D"

However, it seems to be that my boss and the hiring manager know each other realatively well so I am sure my boss would be informed once I applied for the job so I kinda feel like it would be better to tell now.

In my current role, I‚Äôve encountered practices that not only raise ethical concerns but might also be legally questionable. Here are a few specifics that have been particularly troubling:

1. **Fake Job Postings**: There appears to be a scheme involving fake job postings. These postings are seemingly used to apply for government benefits or loans falsely, like PPP loans. This isn't just unethical; it's outright fraud, exploiting systems meant to aid legitimate businesses during tough times.

2. **Forging Certifications**: Another alarming practice is the falsification of safety training certifications. This is not only unethical but dangerously irresponsible. It puts all employees at risk by bypassing essential safety measures. This could lead to serious workplace accidents, and it‚Äôs a clear violation of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.

**Under Arkansas Law, What Could This Mean?**

- **Workplace Safety**: Employers are mandated by law to provide a safe working environment. Falsifying safety certifications undermines this and could constitute a significant legal violation under OSHA.

- **Wage and Hour Laws**: While not directly related to my experiences, any misconduct in recording or compensating hours worked is illegal under both federal and state laws.

- **Discrimination and Harassment**: Any form of discrimination or harassment based on protected characteristics is illegal. It's crucial that all employees are aware of their rights and the employer‚Äôs duty to prevent such behaviors.

Given these issues, I am considering seeking legal advice to better understand my rights and possibly take action. If anyone has experienced similar situations or has advice on handling these matters in Arkansas, your input would be invaluable. How can one navigate these waters without exacerbating the situation or jeopardizing their job security?"

Previous management promised a yearly raise.

That turned into I don't have an answer for that talk to the big boss.

Big boss sits me down and basically said the owners have put a freeze on raises. I said they just got done about bragging about a record breaking year....

The big boss was like I'm trying and they still are like no dice. Then I was told maybe you should get a second job. (I'm a salaried manager that has open availability for them.). I said well it's not my first choice, but if that's the solution whatever I'll do it.

I asked the second in command what they would prefer, as my availability was going to change with interviews next week.  He wasn't told anything about that conversation.  I said well I'm just following the instructions I got. So again I need to know what you want from me because I will not have open availability in a week or two.

Poor guy is caught in the middle. But that's not my fault, or problem.

Like I have no clue what what they want me to do because they skipped out on a raise so now I am taking care of me with the very suggestion I was given.

Another manager did the same thing and they seem surprised that no one has open availability.

For context I saved this company tens of thousands of dollars in repairs by implementing a preventative maintenance program.  We execute with a smaller team and have record breaking sales.

I currently work at a Costco in the bakery department ; lots of family members have given the concrete cube good reviews but I find myself becoming unhappier with every shift. It‚Äôs a pretty well-paying job in these times so it seems so goofy to complain. There is never a feeling of pride or accomplishment when I‚Äôm done with a task, it is just endless.

Hey r/antiwork,

I'm in a tough spot with my job at a security firm here in Arkansas, and I really need some perspective and advice. Without getting into specifics about locations or identities, I want to discuss the general practices that are weighing heavily on me.

### The Issues at Hand:

**Encouraged Discrimination:** Our protocols discourage physical confrontation, but the underlying culture among some coworkers is troubling. There's a subtle endorsement from higher-ups that feels like it condones hostility, particularly towards homeless individuals who frequent the areas we monitor.

**Abuse of Private Property Rights:** The properties we secure are accessible to the public and include various commercial tenants. However, the fact that these spaces are privately owned is used to justify excluding and mistreating vulnerable groups under the guise of maintaining security.

**Ethical Dilemma:**

Despite the no-contact policy, the atmosphere and the actual practices don't align. This dissonance creates an environment where discriminatory behavior and harassment seem tolerated if not outright encouraged.

### My Concerns:

1. **Continuing My Role:** Is it worth staying in a job that conflicts so deeply with my moral beliefs for the sake of a paycheck?
2. **Advocating for Change:** Can I effect any real change from within this organization, or is the system too flawed?
3. **Protection Against Retaliation:** If I blow the whistle on these unethical practices, how can I safeguard myself against backlash or damage to my future career prospects?
4. **Documenting and Reporting:** Would gathering evidence and consulting with a legal expert be advisable to ensure any actions I take are protected and effective?

I'm torn between the financial need and my ethical stance, feeling complicit in practices I fundamentally disagree with. Any advice, insights, or shared experiences would be invaluable as I try to figure out the best course of action.

I declined to attend. I was fired two days later. I am aware this is illegal and have already spoken to a lawyer blah blah blah, that aspect of this is mostly irrelevant to my primary question.

My question is what would be the appropriate way to put this work experience on a resume without them contacting the workplace? My direct supervisor has/had my back and offered to be my reference as did a couple of my coworkers. I don't want to just put ""yeah I got fired for speaking up about religious discrimination"" because I don't want to look like a shit stirrer.  I feel that if I put the workplace on my resume they'll likely want to call them for a reference, but would they want to just call my references from there directly?

I'm married for 12 years now, co worker is also in a relationship 5 years. Ever since I have started at my job 3 years ago we hit it off as friends. Alittle while later there was some jealous females that wanted to talk and spread rumors about us and even bring it up to our DM, who even asked our store manager, and co workers best friend who worked with us at the time anout what was being said, and they both told him nothing was going on, that we were just friends. We disproved it all from the very beginning. Those females no longer work with us. Fast forward a few years.... 

come yesterday. 

I was taken into the office by my DM and the Loss prevention person. They again üòí questioned me about coworker and myself. I again told them we are just good friends. Which we are. DM then proceeded to spin around his laptop and show me some ""incriminating"" evidence that he has from the cameras in the store. Video shows coworker helping me up off one of the chairs, and as soon as I get up he stops the video. He then looks at me and goes, ""well...?"" I give him a look like what the hell was that. I said ""sir, we are just friends, he was helping me up off the couch."" LP guy then chimes in, ""looks like you were holding hands as you walked away.""  I said, ""If you play the video even one second longer, you will see i let go, I'm a married woman, what are you guys insinuating here? We are just friends, and we have always just been friends."" 

They then proceeded to pull up my time card and his, and ask me about the night he closes and I show up in the store and be there with him till late at night (sometimes off the clock, I love my job thats a whole other story about me working off the clock). Anyway, I said, ""we are friends I come to see my friend and we are working on putting out truck while the floor people are here cleaning the floors. Sometimes the floor people don't leave till 10:30 11pm at night and we have to clean up after so we don't get out of here till 11 11:15pm depending."" He said ""why do you only come up the one night when he closes and not when (other male co worker) works or (other female co worker) works.?"" I said, ""I don't know I'm better friends with coworker. That and I help him close the store (co worker is not so good with math, it's always easier if I do it)."" They just looked at me. LP guy chimes in again, ""from an outsiders prospective, if i came to see you every saturday morning and only saturday when you were there and left before anyone else got there you would also think something was up."" I said ""I dont only show up on days when he is there, the other manager is there until 8pm that night, and then the floor people are there. I dont come or go before anyone else gets there. Again this is the 3rd time you have come after me about this topic and we have disproved you guys from the very beginning. We are just friends and that's it. I'm married, and you guys are implying that I am cheating on my husband."" 

They then got all defensive and was like ""were not implying anything."" I said, ""but you are, if it was (female coworker) and I working together we wouldn't be in here having this conversation, we are only in here because he is a man and I am a woman."" 

They kinda dropped it after that, but told me basically that I need to ""distance myself from coworker"" and that I can't be friends with anyone from work outside of work. I just got up and left. 


Now mind you, in another store, I know for a fact there are relatives that work together, that DM know about, that goes against the company handbook, another store has a person, same position as me, best friends with someone on their freight team. (But their the same gender), and there is a manager that is openly dating another associate. But let's not go after those people, who are clearly going against the company handbook one of which you allow, let's try and find something that isn't there, because you have video evidence of him helping me up. üòíüòíüòí 

No one has filed sexual harrasement charges, no one is complaining we are friends the only one that seems to have a problem with it is my DM. 

I mean if this rule applies to me and male co workers, shouldn't this apply to all male and female co workers, they can no longer work together right? Also aren't they assuming my sexual preference? How do they know I'm not gay, or co worker isn't gay? 


Also not to mention the other 2 managers (M &F)  have been working together for like 10 years together and they are really close he goes to her house for holidays, and other events. Now as I said I'm not bashing any of my co workers I love them all, I'm just giving examples. I think my DM is just jealous that we are a close store and we all work well together. "

Just wanted to share my experience with others & hopefully share some stories, hopefully.

A while ago I decided to start investigating new career paths, as I am sick of financial services.
Id been doing it for nearly a decade and it makes me feel like a bloodsucker. 
No matter how I try to be a good representative of the industries by helping anyone in any way I can, insurers are the worst.

So, I've taken a sabbatical and look at some career jobs which would let me give back and help the community 

I saw an ad and booked a ticket to attend for a general info night to discuss careers with Vic Police.
Shortly after, I was told my ticket had been cancelled due to and I quote the following:

""Upon receiving your booking, we have undertaken a review of your applicant profile/background. Whilst we appreciate you are interested in joining Victoria Police, due to the outcome of your security check you will not be permitted to attend the event.

Based on the above circumstances, we have cancelled your ticket to attend the Information Session.""

To elaborate I got in trouble when I was a teen, (17 & 18) and one DUI driving offence, well over a decade ago. (I'm now 37 years old.)
I got no convictions for the 17 and 18 year old offences. 

Has anyone else experienced this? 
Seems pretty rough of them to make a decision like this, when I've been trying to be the best person I can be and I'm a completely different person now. 
Turned my life around and created a new life for myself on the straight and narrow.

Just curious to see if anyone experienced the same thing? Luckily I don't particularly want to be a policeman, it was more due to the fact it matched my career test. 

FYI:  For any haters, I did my community service, took full responsibility for my actions and have been doing everything I can to be better than the day I was before. "

-You have to live in a small apartment in a smart 15 minutes city.
-You can only use public transportation.
-You have to buy EVERYTHING with your UBI card. No cash or crypto allowed.
-You can""t vote in any election except a district representative that has no real power (like Hong Kong's parliament).
-You can't use VPN's or encrypted communications. Everything you do online is recorded and can be inspected by the government. 
-CCTV cameras with facial recognition will be EVERYWHERE except your bedroom and bathroom. For your safety, of course.
-Cops won't need a search warrant to enter your home or probable cause to arrest you.
-Alcohol and pot will be legal but rationed and you will be able to purchase very little amounts.
-You'll have to pass a mandatory medical check every four months and follow the treatment prescribed if necessary.
-You can have two guests for a werkend every month. They'll have to pass a background check.
-You can leave the city for a month if you want to make a trip when you can afford it, which won't be often.

You won't have to work. You'll be safe and healthy. UBI will cover your basic needs and allow you to have cheap entertainment like videogames and Netflix. Not much else. Your carbon footprint will be minimal. If you opt out of the program you can't get in again and will have to pay an extra income tax of 15% for  ten years.

TLDR; A long-winded rant about me missing my chance to see the Auroras because I had to get up early for a job I can't take days off from. 

Preemptively, I recognize my position of privilege when it comes to being able to complain about something comparatively menial to the other absolute atrocities happening in the world today, but this feels therapeutic and, if nothing else, I want to put it out there for selfish reasons (possible vindication idk).

Since the start of my senior year in highschool I've worked in my family's business as a vendor to some local grocery store chains, I get up at five am five days a week and three am on the other two days. I only get national holidays off and sick days are all but non-existent, I've been able to have my dad pick up for me if I was vomiting and couldn't stand or something. I've been doing this job for about three years now. It pays well considering I still live with my parents and they don't make me pay rent, but it's nowhere near the amount I could live on my own. 

I recently picked up a second job at a greenhouse with a shitty boss, the workers (like usual) run the store and a lot of the decisions when my boss can't be fucked to leave their office, but we still get paid far less than them. I work my greenhouse job three days a week and go from my morning job straight to the greenhouse and I get home around five thirty-ish. All this context is to establish that I don't have a lot of free time and what little I do I cherish and protect as fiercely as I can. 

While I don't think my conservative ultra religious city has much in the way of a night life, I have no way of knowing for sure because of my line of work I've needed to be home and asleep by nine o'clock ish so I can get up on time the next morning. My body is really weird in the way that if I don't get enough sleep I will literally wake up with what I imagine a hangover to be like (vomiting and a horrible headache) so I never got around much in highschool or anytime afterwards because the night was basically off limits to me. It's hard to meet friends who have a similar schedule where they're free during the day and occupied at night, but I'm autistic as hell so I can just put that on my tab in terms of social problems. 

The whole reason I'm making this post though is because of what happened this morning. I'm a huge astronomy nerd, I love stargazing, looking through my telescopes at different shit I can barely make out through all the light pollution, and trying my hand at astrophotography when I can. That whole hobby has basically been cut out of my life since I got the vendor job. 

Just last night was a huge solar storm, Auroras would've been pretty plainly visible from where I live and I haven't been able to see them because it happened on a night where I was getting up at three am. Since it's a family business, we have no other employees that could fill in for me, days off just aren't a possibility. Waking up this morning, I saw so many people's stories on Snapchat of all the gorgeous pictures they were able to capture of the auroras and/or the times they shared with their friends or partners stargazing.

I'm just utterly devastated, I've never been able to experience night life with the small handful of friends I do have and for the foreseeable future I won't be able to. The society we've been trapped in just seems so hopeless to me, I can't even afford a break from work to look at the fucking sky. I've been distracting myself all morning throughout the job with different podcasts and videos and any other para social relationships I've developed, but that's just it, in order to stop feeling so shitty about missing this huge storm and the isolation that comes from not being able to experience it with others, I've pacified myself with media and tried to claw back any sort of comfort I can get, i just hate it.

40,2024-05-12,Job is changing my schedule and I‚Äôm probably going to get fired for saying no to the change,u/grumpydwarf_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cqa81k/job_is_changing_my_schedule_and_im_probably_going/,antiwork,"I‚Äôm looking for advice on what I should do in this situation. So Im a full time employee at a hospital in the US (Oregon) and my regular shifts are 4x10s. My day off during the week is Wednesday. Over the last year my manager has changed my schedule around a few times. I used to have Mondays off but since we are so busy on Mondays they told me I needed to work Mondays and take Wednesday off. I was upset but told them sure I‚Äôll be a team player and change it. The last few months this has been my schedule, Wednesdays off now. 

This past Friday, 15 mins before the weekend by the way, my manager calls me to say that I cannot work a 4 day week anymore and that soon I will have to work 5 days. This 4x10 shift is what made me choose this job! I am paid so much less than what I could be making elsewhere but I chose this position so I would have better mental health and great work life balance. 

I‚Äôm the only one on my team who works the 4x10 shifts. It was something we agreed upon when I got hired. My manager even told me that since I work a 4x10 the ‚Äúentire team is sacrificing themselves for this schedule‚Äù and that ‚ÄúI know your mental health is important but the team is more important‚Äù. It‚Äôs not my fault the other employees didn‚Äôt make this agreement when they got hired! 

I told them flat out, with all due respect, no I will not change my schedule. Manager left the call saying they will have to talk to their manager and get back to me on Monday about what to do now. 

The more I think about it I‚Äôm so frustrated this even is happening. I will not change my schedule just because you‚Äôre guilting me into this. It‚Äôs not my fault the team is struggling so bad! We need to hire more people. The team is still struggling on the days I am working. TBH we need at least 2 more new people with how busy we have been the last year. Side note my manager also sometimes works a 4x10, they usually take off most Fridays. I guess it‚Äôs okay if they do it but not me. 

So I know what‚Äôs probably going to happen is that on Monday they are gonna tell me ‚Äúit‚Äôs not working anymore‚Äù and I‚Äôll be fired, so they can hire someone who can work 5 days. Or I might just bite the bullet and say I‚Äôll work 5 days but can‚Äôt start it until June. Then in the mean time over these next few weeks I‚Äôll be applying to other jobs then give notice in June. Cus if I have to work 5 days I will work 5 days elsewhere where I can be paid more. Or find a new 4x10 job. 

I know going to HR isn‚Äôt smart cus they look out for the company not the employee. But since my manager brought my mental health into this equation it‚Äôs rubbing me the wrong way. Should I go to HR?

I'm posting this more my husband. He is currently between a rock and a hard place and because I've never had a position like his, I figured this may be the correct place to ask. I apologize if it isn't. 

My husband is a Dining Services Director. He has been instructed by his supervisor to cover when his employees call out. Because life, there always seem to be someone needing to call. 

This wouldn't be much of a problem. My husband is one man but he does understand that he needs to help his team during these times. 

However, his Supervisors bosses have instructed the exact opposite. They've gotten upset about him having overtime, the fact he's even filling in is an issue. They've suggested he take people from other departments to fill in, even though those people are caregivers and have no experience in a kitche/serving, and it could potentially affect his relationship with other directors/employees of different departments.

They revoked the entire company's ability to hire temporary labor. 

In this situation, with supervisor instruction being the exact opposite of his off site bigger bosses has us both confused. He's worried about his job safety and I'm upset for him. He's done EVERYTHING he can. 

Please help us decipher which instructions he should follow. I'm leaning towards his direct supervisor because technically it would could back on her if he's not doing what her bosses asked due to her instructions. 

What do yall think? He is staunchly against demanding people to come in when they can't, and does everything in his power to prevent it. We just don't know what to do. "

1. Full uniform is now mandatory.

2. There is 6 different outfits, one for Mon - Sat. Also different outfits for summer and winter. Making it 12 different mandatory uniforms.

3. All workers have to pay the outfits themself. Workers can order the uniforms, this will be added to their staff account and deducted from the salary and the end of the month.

4. Anyone not in uniform will get a write up.

Shirts were going for $14, at most a shirt at a normal will go for $4. Jackets for winter is $47, at a normal store $21.
Pants are $20, at a normal store $11.

They are asking theit employees to pay for clothes double the price you would get at a normal store.

The office is located an hour away, so the only reason I took the job was because I knew I'd only have to make the drive a couple times a week, something appealing to me since I have 2 small children and a spouse with medical issues.

Management has always been flexible about it and would let us all use wfh on days we were scheduled to be in the office if we had personal obligations (Dr's appt, sick, sick famiily, etc) if we made the effort to come into the office another day instead.

Well despite me talking about the family issues I had (sick spouse) with my boss up front a few months ago and getting the okay to be flexible with my wfh/in office days, last week my infant child was really sick so I rearranged one of my in office days and unfortunately had to call out the next day to seek medical care for my child.

While I was holding my ill child that day trying to comfort them I got a call my from my boss telling me that they felt I was taking advantage of wfh and that it was a privilege, not a right, so starting the next week I had to be in office every day for the foreseeable future and would be getting a write up when I was back in the office. No warning, no prior conversations, no ""hey, we need you to stick to your scheduled in office days 2 days a week moving forward as much as possible,"" or anything. Not to mention it was totally crossing the line to call me to reprimand me while I was off (I'm an hourly employee) taking care of a really sick infant. 

Previous conversations had my boss telling me that they understood I had a lot going on personally but they would be flexible as long as I made effort to get into the office 2 days a week. They even dissuaded me from applying for FMLA or anything else to care for my sick spouse saying I wouldn't need it if I was making the effort and still working, even if it was remotely. I even have a text from a couple weeks ago saying that they need me in the office 2 days a week ""more often than not"" with no mention of me needing to adhere to a strict schedule moving forward. 

So now, everyone else on my team except me can continue working their hybrid schedules with all the flexibility that entails with things in their personal lives like Dr's appts, being sick, snow days, etc. Not me. I was told I need to use PTO for things like that moving forward.

99% of my job can be done remotely, and my numbers and production are stellar. My most recent review in February was glowing, and I had even talked with my boss about pursuing a promotion, which they seemed totally on board with and encouraging about, giving me things I could do to prepare for it. 

So I feel blindsided, and honestly, I think this is their way of quiet firing me. Company isn't doing well and there has been a lot of turnover lately. The work in my area has been drying up steadily over the last 6 months. The funny thing is they tout ""we don't do layoffs here!"" but I'm starting to think it's because they pull this crap like they are with me. Not only am I the only person in my department with small child and a sick spouse and all that entails, but I'm also in a less desirable demographic, as well as the most recent hire overall in my position, so I think I'm being forced out.

Time to tidy up the resume and look for a new job I think.

Oh, I spoke to HR and have a lawyer aware of this, but not sure how it will go. But I felt I had nothing to lose at that point. I should have an update sometime soon."

If I loose it, then I'll probably be unemployed for a year before settling for fast food again. 

I hate it with a job, I hate it without a job. Life is too short and my time is heavily controlled by ultra rich fucks who are not even human.

Was living in my car trying to make ends meet while coming off disability AND going to school full time. 

I was ‚Äúthe best employee‚Äù they‚Äôve ever had. Cross trained everywhere, 3 tardies in one year (most get 3 a week) always stayed late, OT, never said no for almost 2 years. 

1. During that time I would apply and get rejected for  promotions for what I later found out were made up reasons. The people who usually got promoted weren‚Äôt cross trained at all, late, and usually big time flirts with the managers. 

2. I was always the one put todo the hard job bc it‚Äôs ‚Äúprocedure‚Äù and I have ‚Äúno seniority‚Äù even though I did. I‚Äôd get the worst schedule, worst jobs etc. 

3. When I was pushing carts they would force us to TIE THRASHBAGS AROUND OUR WAIST AND THROW TRASH IN THEM WE FOU D IN THE LOT. No gloves unless we paid for it. When I brought this up and how we find needles and diapers and how this is dehumanizing I was told ‚Äúuse common sense‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs procedure‚Äù. 

4. The final straw happened after I already had an exit plan: I was reprimanded after coming back for not working as hard as I once did. I brought up how I‚Äôm unfairly treated and was told ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let that defeat you‚Äù and to work hard anyways. They continued to give me the hardest jobs with no time to do it. 

In my final  small team meetings (they‚Äôre abt to vote on unionizing so mgt is freaking out) I told the bosses ‚Äúwhen I break procedure, I get written up, when leadership breaks procedure, nothing happens‚Äù. 

The raise I would have gotten was about 40% percent and I do believ I‚Äôd been more financially secure with it. But, I decided while I was out to have a back up plan and I did it. 

From what I know my immediate and next level mgt got in minor trouble with one of them losing a promotion due to their failure to retain me and bc I let their ass up in the review. (Hearing the convo outside one the cages was so gratifying bc it was the mgr who screwed me). 

Living in my car sucked but I also had to be ready to leave asap and I didn‚Äôt have money for a apartment and did t want to burden a friend. 

I moved states and now make twice what I used to with free housing. The days are long and hard but im fairly compensated. I plan to never again be at the mercy of an employer one day and am saving and hope to start building other sources of income. "

Feeling as though I've been treated unfair leading up to this I discussed this with my manager, I complained about general things like his attitude towards me over the phone, e.g audible sighs and at one point saying to me ""You have 3.5 hrs before your shifts is there really nothing u can do?"" which considering I have an incurable illness I saw this as insensative.

However my manager argued that He was not personally aware that he had been sighing and as for the quote he said he probably meant have I tried getting cover for my shift before calling in and that saying that was him trying to support me.

I also complained that i was told i could come in late for shifts if it was for doctors calls or pharmacy visits, but both the informal displinarys I've received for being late were on days I had been to the doctors or pharmacy before 

My manager argued that I hadn't made the effort to inform him of that and either way there was other lates that would have contributed.

All in all he argued I should have said all these things when they orgianlly happened and now he doesn't know how to support me anymore as I'm not being communicative enough. 

I went into that meeting prepared to say my peace and left feeling stupid.

I work in airline industry, and the company absence policy dictates 4 or more absences in a year leads to a Level 1 (of 3) meeting which I've attended already, and have been put on an improvement notice of 6 months (since Feb). I've had to take yet another absence due to a stomach bug/gastritis/food poisoning of some kind. Due to this I'll now have to attend another absence review meeting where the 6 month notice will be extended. 

This is all stressing me out, and whilst I understand it's all following policy, I feel as if I'm being punished for events beyond my control, and extending the notice an extra 6 months, it feels like I'll just be stuck in a cycle of review meetings and escalating further up the levels of sickness absences.

Are there any ways to negotiate an out, or is this just how it goes? Any others with similar experiences?

my company has good benefits (they will supplement whatever is paid by the state to pay 100% of salary for up to twelve weeks assuming the insurance company approves it). what they don't have is good wages. I am living totally paycheck to paycheck and if I go without one paycheck I will absolutely not be able to pay rent. can anyone who's been through the process speak to how long it took to receive those benefits, both from regular disability and the STD coverage...?

also, did you need to do anything to up your treatment in order to get approved? i already see a therapist three times a week. I'm wondering if I would likely have to do an intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization on top of that too...?

I figured, that's OK, I'll just make lemonade with these fucking lemons, whatever. I became a prep cook to make ends meet, and worked my way onto the line. I figured I wont ever be comfy, but at least I'll have an apartment and be able to afford food. I was making more money at 18 then I am at 24 with inflation, despite multiple raises and doing my best to increase my income. I make 22/hr now and I can't even afford my own apartment and live with roommates. Average single family home where I am costs 970k (with conversions that's 5k more then a house in New york city, not state, CITY) average rent is 2.4k. And I don't even live in a big city. 20 years ago I would be chillin. Not rich, but not poor and self sufficient at least. Now we can't even have that. I'm so pissed that past generations couldn't manage to preserve the quality of life they enjoyed for future generations. And then I'm told it's my fault for being dumb enough to think I could get by without a degree, when past generations could get by without a degree just fine. Hell, in past generations you could afford to work part time and go to school and still meet all your needs. Now you can barely afford shelter when youre working fulltime. At least I'm not in debt I guess.

The affordability crisis is stopping young people from being able to move forward. A lot of us with no family support are trapped in survival jobs, with the threat of homelessness if we deviate. People being forced into being perma renters when they would otherwise be homeowners clogs up the rental supply, shoving the lowest earners into homelessness. People trapped in survival jobs limits their ability to realize their true potential. It's a chain reaction where year over year everyone's quality of life gets worse and worse. Most people in this sub are office workers, so think about how freakin comfortable you would be if this wasnt happening. Youd probably own a home by now and be super comfy with more then enough left over. Doesnt that make you so angry? It's appalling. I thought we where supposed to get better every generation but I guess not. 

And the cherry on top is that our government squanders our money on things that do nothing to better our country. I am not anti taxes. I would gladly pay *more* taxes if it meant less people suffering and our collective quality of life improving. But alas. Let's spend our money on war and keeping exploitative corporations fat and happy, and monopolies alive and well. And let's not tax the people creating pollution, or the rich, or incentivise the production of green energy. Let's tax consumers for having no other options. I don't have a car and I never will, because a) I can't afford one and b) I don't want to support an industry that makes 100 million dollars a day and can't even shell out a little bit to reduce carbon emissions.

Anyways. I'm bitter. I dream of doing political assassinations and watching the housing market crash and burn and bankrupting anyone who makes profit off poverty or the destruction of our planet. Is this how terrorists are created? Don't worry, I won't listen to my intrusive thoughts telling me to do a political murder. It's too much work and I'm in a constant state of burnout lmao. I would, however, be down to burn shit like they do in France when there's a threat to their working class rights. It would probably be cathartic as fuck.

Ok. I think that's it. Just had to get this off my chest. I hope you have a fantastic day. 



Side note: are any American men/women in the sub looking for a Canadian wife? I won't do terrorism, and I can cook real good, and I'm great at budgeting and saving money. I'll pay my share (line cooks make more $$ in America) I know a lot about permaculture and growing your own food to help keep our food costs low, and I will treat you well despite using you for a green card. Then we can write a book about our bizarre romance and make loads of money, and use that money to undermine this sham of an economy in some way. Bonus points: I'm an orphan so you won't have to deal with in laws. Let me know...just kidding...kinda.

My friend had been very stressed out from work, specifically her boss. He targeted her and actively sought out any reason to punish her. I was worried about her well being for a long time but the last few months I was much more concerned.  
Despite having excellent results as a supervisor and always having exceptional reviews, he would find new ways to demean her.  
Most of the things he attacked her for were not against any company policy or listed in any standard operating procedures of her department.  
His behavior was so predictable that she knew it would eventually happen again, so I advised that she record the interaction in a way that Teams video calls can't detect and if he happened to do it again, she would have proof of it and could submit that to HR.  
Inevitably, he did and she recorded the entire interaction. She sent me a copy of the recording and asked if I could help with making a transcript and lowering the video file size to be able to fit email formatting.  
The way he talked to her in that recording was not appropriate for anything, it was terrible.  
After preparing all of this, she planned on taking it to HR with documentation of previous instances, but she feared retaliation. All of her examples were very specific and even if reported anonymously she knew he would know it was her reporting it.  
To make matters worse, after that specific video meeting, his mistreatment escalated. He began demanding that she check in for any sort of break via Teams chat with exact times, estimates on when she would return, details of where she would be and for what purpose.  
Around this time she requested and was granted vacation time off, and planned to go to a beautiful air bnb to relax, but the day before she was set to travel, she had terrible pain and was suddenly unable to walk. Her father had to come pick her up to take her to an ER, then had to carry her into the ER.  
When she returned the next week from her time off, she informed me of the ER visit and told me that the doctors there, as well as her therapist agreed that the health issues all stemmed from stress.  
I reiterated the need to go to HR and she agreed, but she was also still having difficulty walking. I offered to come pick her up when she would eventually be ready, and to help her with anything she needed. She insisted her apartment was a mess and she just needed a little time to recover and that she would let me know if she needed me.  
Days later I spoke with her on the phone and despite having the same complaints about her boss, she seemed very optimistic. She told me she was feeling better, and had a plan to go to HR. We were even laughing about funny music before I got off of the call with her, and that was the last time I talked to her.  
The next week, another co-worker called me and told me that she no call-no showed, and she never does that. I told the other co-worker I would meet with them at her apartment for a wellness visit.  
We found her there, and honestly it was the worst day of my life.  
I could not tell if it was self harm, or if she had slipped, or if maybe her recent health complications caused something. I could be completely mistaken and it could have been something unrelated health-wise.  
What happened to her, while maybe not directly responsible, I do believe that the stress from work contributed to this. I also believe it's possible it was completely what caused this. I plan on going to HR to report all of this and to turn the recording over to them, but I also feel that this exceeds merely reporting to HR. I am trying to respect her family and give them peace, but I feel they deserve to know.  
I can't let this stand and I need some guidance on how to navigate this situation the right way.  
I am not trying to rush this and I am also hoping to find out if there is a medical examiner's report to confirm a cause of death."

So the interviewer asked him before the interview if he could move there and he told him no, then outright denied him claiming it was a waist of his time before leaving.

My dad has worked at this company for over a couple decades, has done extra work in half that time for that promotion and was highly qualified for it, only to be passed up because he is unable to move there even though the previous person in that job lived in our state and the lady is making sure her people who are relatively new are put into those positions."

 i spoke with my manager about it and he told me that was fine. we spoke about my new availability, and how i wanted to go down to 4 days (32 hours) a week rather than my current 40hr a week schedule, due to personal and mental health reasons. i put all of this in writing and he respected my requests for the next two weeks. 

however, on the week of the newest schedule, he has me back at 40 hours and scheduled specifically in the role that i‚Äôm stepping down from and i‚Äôm super irritated by it because i feel like he either ‚Äúforgot‚Äù or is going to try and have me do that job without getting paid for it, which i will not do.

6,2024-05-12,Company I've worked hourly with for years may have quietly changed me to salaried? What can I do?,u/SarkDamus,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cqobhk/company_ive_worked_hourly_with_for_years_may_have/,antiwork,"This is a developing situation, so it's somewhat hypothetical, but I'm posting because of the direction I'm afraid it's going in.

I've worked with this events company every summer for the last 5 years or so. For the last 2 years, I've been in an office leadership position, hierarchically the #3 position. However, due to the #2 quitting halfway through my first year and their replacement being under-qualified the second year, I've effectively been doing part of that position for the last 2 years.

This year, my #1 emailed me to say that he was also leaving as well as the company's president and asked me what my plans were in terms of returning. The idea that the president, #1, and #2 were all leaving meant that if I were to return, I'd be the only one in this department with prior experience. So between that, the historical unreliability of the #2 position, and the fact that I had been compensated 30-60% less than my peers while having objectively more responsibilities, I knew that I had to negotiate strongly. I laid out my terms for coming back, and it took over a month for them to come up with an offer I found reasonable. I mostly got what I wanted and even offered to cut the duration of my work with them this season by a couple weeks so they could budget me better. To sum up, he said I would get a specific rate, 8 hours a day, 4 days a week minimum, and would get paid the same rate after every 8th hour.

I felt pretty good after accepting their offer and assumed that I would be coming into the season with the same set of responsibilities but with significantly higher pay. One important distinction about my employment compared to the other two office positions is that I was an hourly worker who made OT while they were salaried. I assumed this to be the case again as there was no explicit mention of any change on that front. I also expressed during renegotiation when they asked if I would prefer to be salaried that I actually would rather be hourly.

The week before I started back, I called and checked in with my outgoing #1 who was training the replacements. When I asked about when he would schedule me using the timesheet app I'd always used, he vaguely said something about the company accountant wanting me to do things differently and to for now stick to an informal verbal schedule. I thought it was kind of weird, but I let it go.

When I came in on the first day, I asked him again about how I was going to schedule/log my hours, and he gave another vague answer, basically ""Let me check with (the accountant)."" Two days pass, I'm still coming into work, and I haven't heard anything. Then something else happens that makes me concerned.

During a discussion about event workers needing to contact us after hours, I said something to the effect of ""Well I'm hourly, so I don't think this is going to apply to me."" The outgoing #1 says ""You're not hourly?"" I was somewhat taken aback and repeated what he said about me getting paid after a certain hour, and he just said that I was getting paid a certain number per week. This confused me.

While at work on the third day, I sent the accountant an email asking for three things: how he wants me to log my hours (while also explicitly stating my rate and minimum hours per week as agreed on during negotiation), if he needs me to resubmit any payroll documentation, and if he could send me a copy of my employment contract.

He responded 2 days later by asking me to use timesheet app I'd always used to log my hours but to let him know if I was getting close to exceeding 32 hours per week. He also said that I didn't need to resubmit any payroll info other than an emergency contact. However, he didn't confirm my rate nor did he respond to my question about a copy of an employment contract. 

I responded by asking whether I was hourly or salaried because the #1 said I wasn't hourly, yet I'd been hourly every year I worked there and didn't hear anything explicit about that changing during renegotiation. I've not received an answer yet, though it's only been since the weekend started, so I should be getting an answer soon.  
  
All this being said, I'm feeling uneasy for some reason. I feel like there's a lot of ambiguity right now that I wasn't expecting. I'm just wondering if any of you think something weird is happening or if I'm just overthinking it and there's a reasonable explanation. Thank you."

Here's how to fight back.,u/tidepill,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cqp544/capital_always_accumulates_over_time_workers_and/,antiwork,"Capital always accumulates over time. The reason is simple: Capital is power, and those in power want to remain in power, so they will use part of their capital to **stay in power**, rather than **make new things**. (e.g. lobbying, setting up rentier economies) People without capital have less capability to do this. That means that those with more capital will get more capital, and those without capital will stay without capital.

It's important to understand this system. It's a cold and harsh system. But it's very consistent. That's why companies will squeeze employees and consumers whenever they get the chance, to claw resources away from them and back into their own pockets. Companies and capitalists do not do things out of the niceness of their hearts, and we should not expect them to. (Of course certain bosses can be nice individually.)

But there are ways to disrupt the accumulation of capital:

Societal triggers: 

* War, revolution. Historically, killing and smashing can severely disrupt capital structures and power structures, and take economic power away from elites, often creating a new class of elites. See any major war or violent revolution in history.
* Policy. Government can redistribute resources, bust big companies, and restrict exploitation of labor/consumers. This of course requires a government that is actually effective and has economic-populist goals. In the US this is not really tenable right now, but it can change with enough voter engagement. It happened with the New Deal.
* Peaceful revolution. When stars align, peaceful revolution is possible to change a government.

Environmental triggers:

* Severe pandemic. The black death killed a third of europe, and demand for labor went way up. the surviving peasants got a lot more economic and political power. OK obviously this is not preferable, but it clearly shows supply and demand at work.

Individual solutions:

* Escape the grind and live outside of mainstream society. There are people who do this in all walks of life, of all different political affiliations. Communes, preppers, nomads, hobos, bohemians, religious nuts, maroons, crypto bros, traveling musicians, homesteaders, van lifers, anarchists, squatters, rastas, surfer dudes, indigenous and tribal communities. We're taught to view all these people as crazy and dismiss them out of hand, but maybe we're the crazy ones.
* Become the capitalist. Some people, due to luck/connections/skill, can escape the poverty grind and become wealthy. This is rare."

(to get the internship in the first place, i had to apply to a free conference, get accepted, attend, apply to a bunch of stuff i found there, go through multiple rounds of interviews during exam season, etc). anyway i lost all of that. the job offer was rescinded obviously. and because of the money i earned from my internship, i can‚Äôt qualify for my state‚Äôs medical/disability financial assistance programs. i will have to pay all of it to the hospital. and my parents are still paying rent for the semester of college that i missed (i lived off campus with roommates 12 month lease from a private company). i just feel so disillusioned. even while i‚Äôm struggling through the effects of chemo, i‚Äôm thinking about how if i recover, i‚Äôll have to go back to working my ass off only to potentially lose it all in an instant if i get cancer again. if i experience long term health issues that prevent me from working, i‚Äôll have to live my whole life without my own assets or financial security. i‚Äôm getting close to the end of treatment but i just feel so defeated and trapped by this hellish system. literally what is the point of trying to live life by the ‚Äúrules‚Äù if it won‚Äôt benefit you at all, only the rich administrators somewhere profiting from your misery. i became aware of anti capitalist/ anti work ideas in college, so i had heasitations about working so hard to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù in my career in the first place, and now i wish i had listened to my own qualms. i never want to try so hard ever again. before insurance, the cost of the chemo drugs alone is $770,000 not to mention my 3 week‚Äôs of inpatient stay at the hospital which i have no clue of the price, plus 3 surgeries.

i don‚Äôt need financial advice (the hospital bills haven‚Äôt arrived yet, i‚Äôm still hoping the billing department will somehow lose them). and yes, i know u can contest medical bills and ask for receipts, but i have tried before and that has never worked for me in the past"

I work for one of the biggest isp's in my country, they provide telecom and integration services for every big player in every field where I live.

Started here almost 11 years ago in the home (soho) support department and worked my way up to enterprise level support, taking several different positions in the process.

Over all, most times where good enough so that even when I got offers from other companies I ended up declining them, leveraging them to upgrade my pay and status within the workplace.

About 10 months ago my manager (who was a great guy, and who I consider a friend) got a promotion and thus was replaced by his assistant. 

We never really got along, but most of the time she would leave me work in silence and not bother me much, knowing that I'm not really a people's person and would much rather be left alone with my music untill I was needed for something.

This attitude worked great with my previous supervisors (all 3 of them) as they trusted me and knew that I would do my job without any need to be micromanage, and would help other people when asked.
I tutored new team members, developed different tools to make our work more comfortable and efficient and got high praise throughout the years.

My new manager on the other hand, is a total control freak.

She wants to know exactly what I am doing at every moment, she messes with my (and other's) work, and is so busy trying to look good to the higher-ups that she has driven the whole team to misery. 

About two months ago I got an offer from someone I know from outside work to come work under him.

He offered me a 40% higher salary, a pay raise within 1 year, better environment, and most importantly-a way out from this soul consuming hell hole.

So today is my last shift here.

Everyone who has heard about me leaving has congratulated me, some people have asked me to take them with me after I'm accommodated at the new place, and besides my new manager, everyone has said that I have wasted my time here.

I really hope this is the right move for me, I have a house, a wife and soon-a first child, so I'm terrified of this being a mistake..."

I had to talk to NINE people over the course of two to get $30/month approved for this tool. Literally life-changing for this dude. Sucks, but we got him sorted. Cool.   
   
During this process, I learn this employee has no hardware accommodations like a foot mouse or special headset. No one I know in IT has helped someone with something like this. I do research, but idk wtf I'm looking at or for. So I go to Employee Relations with the ADA guidelines in hand. I politely tell them that since I can file an ADA complaint on someone else's behalf, by the transitive property, I'm requesting accommodations and possibly a consultant for this employee to give him whatever physical tools would help him do his job.

  
Y'all, if this wasn't the most demoralizing conversation of my life. The director of Employee Relations says they count on employees to tell the company what they need; they're only required to provide reasonable accommodations, which are up to interpretation, yadda yadda. I explained this employee has been here 15+ years, is universally beloved, all-around great employee, and a great guy, and we can't spend <$1500 to make sure he has what he needs to be successful. I'm told company has no official accommodations process by design.

So most people can't eat out since most restaurants including fast food have become stupid expensive, it's not even funny. Okay, so you've got to cook. But cooking also takes a human to do it, it'll be you. That takes energy and time. So now you're using those remaining 6 hours for stuff that's vital ie cooking so you can eat. You've also got to run chores such as doing the laundry, going out with doggo for a walk (that's fun), caring for your pets, etc. So those 6 hours ain't shit to ""recuperate"". And no, those 2 days you've got left aren't jackshit to recuperate either, never once have I felt them enough to recover from the weekly 40 hours"

Directly affecting her:

1. She has captured a company-wide email from the holidays telling all employees ‚Äúnot to discuss your bonus amount, just like your salaries‚Äù. This has been verbally reinforced many times. 

2. In recent performance reviews, she found out she is making the least on the team, including two less experienced people hired after her that she trained. (I know one of the others and can confirm, less experienced, and saw his pay sheet). My friend has the highest activity and output of the entire team and is being paid the least, and her performance review did not adjust accordingly. 

3. Her manager just told her that one less experienced employee ‚Äúprobably makes more because they assumed he was bilingual‚Äù. This person is of Latino descent but doesn‚Äôt speak a word of Spanish. 

There is definitely racism, discrimination, and labor violations here, but is any of it legally actionable? Does she have to be retaliated against?"

By no means I am not saying that I am entitled to get everything without working for it. But let's be honest, 8 hours work easily extends to 9 if there is even minor emergency and sometimes more too. Count the hours to get ready, traffic, mentally prepare for the job and tune down from it, that's easily 1 more hour, we essentially give 10 hours a day for work, and even then affordability is so low."

I need some help in a situation with my boss. I have only been at the company for 6 months. For the first 3ish my boss was fine, super nice outgoing and I thought I was going to like her and succeed in the role. When I was interviewed I asked if I could analyze data and I said yes of course because prior I was a chemist. When I got to the job I did not know, nor did it say in job description I would have to know computer science such as coding, high excel, python etc. Every 3 months a data pull is done. I watched the first time then the second time I got a new laptop (old one burned out they gave me) and did not realize my accounts would not transfer when IT told me they would. I could not do the coding portion but the data analysts took that portion and I was to do excel. I did the excel portion with him walking me through and there was an error. Rather than walking me through it he just finished and told my boss and it made me look bad. She was very mad at me but I explained to her. Since then (I had 1:1 with her biweekly) she threatened to fire me every single meeting. One time I was about to go home and calmed down came back and she was sitting next to me and she got up took her stuff and moved desks after threatening me. A month passes by and it occurs consistently. I went for vacation and right before I left she apologized for threatening and said she wanted to improve our relationship and for me to come to work comfortably. When I returned from vacation she was antagonizing me in the morning first thing. She was at our meetings for 10 of 30 minutes and said she would call back. I did something for her she wanted done asap and submitted it to her before lunch. She then sent me a random invite an hour later and fired me. I had someone I know who is he look over the letter and they said it‚Äôs not termination it was a lay off and she gave me 6K in severance which I heard is high for only being there for a few months. I contacted HR legal 6 days ago and nothing yet. Is it possible there is investigation that she wrongfully terminated me. The letter was not even signed by head of department and it as saved 5 days before I got fired. Sorry this is embarrassing and I feel like a failure any advice is appreciated thank you!

My boss sat down with me this morning and gave me some advice. All stuff that counts as hits... none of which any of my clients need. Therefore the advice is useless. She is behind on getting new clients to me which further makes my job impossible. 

She then told me this fine old tidbit of information ""since you've been missing your quota for the last few months- (by like hardly anything but ok) you will be written up at the end of the month if you don't meet quota."" 

I have never been written up for any of my previous jobs. She even said I'm good at the job itself... just not the quota part. But now I'm being threatened with a write up with only 15ish days left in the month. I'm wondering if I should contact my union representative at this point.

Thank you for allowing me to bitch about my job here because truthfully I'm about to fucking cry. I can't afford to lose this job."

So, ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù recently got promoted to the authorizations department, which came with a raise from $20 to $24.80 an hour.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: Sarah noticed a bunch of meds about to expire and worked hard to save the company $80k by getting them returned which is not an easy process in the world of pharmaceutical eye drugs. Otherwise the drugs would have just been tossed and absorbed as a loss by the company. 

You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd get some recognition for that and actually she was expecting some, but nope. Instead, she got hit with a pay cut back down to $22 an hour. The reason? They claimed there was an ‚Äúerror‚Äù in her promotion rate even though she‚Äôs got email correspondence stating that was going to be the wage. (Unfortunately she doesn‚Äôt have an offer letter to fall back on which I personally find to be a slimy business practice.)

Here‚Äôs the thing though ‚Äì the person before her was making $28 an hour in the same position.

The company has been toying with the idea of going full RTO for the past year, putting out several polls to our staff to see how many would be willing to return.

80% of the staff said they would not be willing to return.  In actuality, we only lost 50% of our total workforce, so the executives say it was a success.  We are talking about hundreds of people who now need to be hired and trained to replace the ones who left.  Needing to re-hire half of our entire staff is seen as a success by these people.

Now, I work from site doing the exact same thing I did from home (managing employees in other states via Zoom), except now I'm sitting in an office by myself all day and don't ever see any other employees in person except if I go to the cafe or restroom.  My coworkers all sit in their own offices and do the same thing.  There are not even any in-person meetings because our teams are so spread out across the country, we have to meet virtually so everyone can be included.

This serves no purpose other than for management to maintain their perceived control of their staff by oppressing their freedom.  I really don't want to participate in this anymore.

Barely any customers for me to learn and when we did get them there was a small squad to rush through and I was told to 'take my time' because when I tried to rush I kept messing up since it was my first day.

Turns out he didn't read my resume to throughly either and assumed I had more experience on cash then just those stupid subway POS's and clover. I feel so dragged on because I felt like I was given positive enough encouragement (which yes, I now realize isn't meant to be taken seriously but just to make me comfortable.) that I would've gotten a hang of it by the end of my shift had I not been told to go home for good after my break. 

I could just not be used to the real world, my old job was probably too kind with letting me stay as long as I did. But expecting an 18yr old to learn an entirely new cash register system that they aren't used to in 3hrs with minimal customers seems a bit high?

 My employment counselor thought making me look more 'hireable' would be a good idea but then they expect too much from me, especially for my age. So I'm going to go back to my old one, while it doesn't get me jobs I haven't ever had to waste my time with so many people due to it. This is the second job I've been fired from after my first shift, I'm just not fit for the working life since I can't learn or process fast.

I thought retail was supposed to be something you couldn't exactly get fired from? I know I'm obviously not fit for it now,  but what kind of entry level job would I be fit for if I can't seem to learn in 3 hours. 

I'm just going to go back to searching and hope someday I'll manage to learn quick enough, also going to start getting into shape because the way it's looking I'll have to start walking 5 hours to the city and back if I want to have any sort of money."

stop going to work. Alternatively, find ways you could work together to generate enough income for a temporary community living situation, it will suck, but could it possibly suck more than the hellish cycle many of you are stuck in?

Find businesses which abuse workers and
form huge picket lines of human bodies around their economic chokepoints to block the flow of material capital *only on private property* while making sure no one blocks public traffic or impedes emergency services

dress in business casual or formal attire and kick out anyone in black bloc or anyone wearing a mask because they're probably agent provocateurs and they're definitely going to ruin your movement

do not let people yell or throw shit, monitor and shutdown agent provocateurs with a dedicated team of enforcers

Hammer out a consistent and pallatable mission statement using simple rhetoric and set your sights on several small scale, significant, and realistic outcomes such as higher wages and smaller hours for specific jobs and industries, take inventory of what you can offer to and what you can withhold from employers

Bring flowers, pamphlets, and ribbons to distribute to law enforcement and pedestrians so when the cops come to remove you, you have something to do besides scream and act like an idiot and you make an unconditionally positive impact on the public

This will have the greatest impact when you don't leave your spot and make the cops beat you, pepper spray you, or carry you away

Do not allow overt partisan messaging outside of typical labor rhetoric and appeals to hardwork, prosperity, and other socially ubiquitous values

Kick out any avowed militant anarchists, antifa, and other political extremists from your movement before they poison your reputation and give the media a strawman (sorry, I love alot of you all, but you ruin every cause you support)

Engage in a media blitz across electronic platforms and elect a cabinet of volunteers to form things like a treasury and pr staff. Reach out and engage with traditional and electronic media to spread your message. I'm sure plenty of people here have college degrees they aren't using. Put them to use.  

Be fully prepared to get punched in the face,  organize a system to track and account for everyone who attends any protests for their own safety, and to hold the police and businesses accountable if anyone goes missing

Understand that the police will probably be the least of your worries and that once you gain traction, the corps will probably hire security contractors, which is why it's imperative that this be a highly transparent public movement

Organize a common fund utilizing immediate personal and online donations for the hiring of lawyers and other relevant professionals, with a group this large you don't need much per individual to generate a relevant or powerful group treasury

Organize all of this under the existing framework of political action commitees and labor unions

Don't give enough power to any one person in the organization which would allow them to make unilateral decisions and ensure that everyone has a voice on some level

Ensure the majority or even a quarum of the organization can always vote to effect meaningful change or remove someone from any leadership position

Don't expect a quick resolution and dont be afraid to starve together and sleep outside together, it'll only fortify your messaging and favorably impact your public optics

Violence will only get you shot while the average upper class corporate share holder laughs at his TV about how much you deserved it. You might despise those people, but until you reach a point where they cannot oppose you within their communities without appearing like a villain or a hypocrite, you won't get what you want

Abandon all childish notion of revolution or economic holy war, what I've outlined is more or less an historical blueprint of how these campaigns are successfully executed. 

I would also recommend trying to resisting any ideas of not having any leadership, although I would discourage the tactic of having a single traditional charismatic leader who shoulders most of the momentum or acts as the primary public face for your organization 

If you want someone to give you something, you need to demonstrate why they should and why they must. 

Good luck, and I hope some of you out there run with this."

I had a shift on Saturday with agency work and they sent me to a new place. 
When I got there, one or the workers, who was in senior management started asking me a lot of questions about myself, which I didn't mind at all, but he then started to try and engage in very pointless small talk. OK, I'm terrible, I mean absolutely terrible with small talk with strangers. My brain freezes up and I genuinely don't know what to say. It's something subscious and I don't think I can control it. My brain is just not wired to open up with strangers and engage in random small talk. 

He would say something like 'haha what are we doing working today when the sun is out' I would just laugh it off... He then kept saying other really random, pointless unrelated work things to me. I didnt understand why, but I just laughed it off as I didn't know what to say. I guess within an hour he must have noticed I felt super uncomfortable with trying to engage in pointless small talk with me and then told me when we were together alone that I'm a quiet person. I was like yes I am. 

I noticed through the day he stopped asking me irrelevant questions and stopped the small talk. I am glad he got the hint because he was being extremely talkative and made me uncomfortable 

Anyway he reported me this morning to my agency saying I didn't get along with the staff and that I didn't engage enough with staff etc. No, I did my work and engaged when I needed to sir. Your extreme chatty behaviour unrelated to my work made me so uncomfortable and you could tell. The entitlement of it. Guys I'm not even kidding when I say this guy literally would not shut up.

For context I have been working for this company for over a year and a half. I started working here part time while I finished school and it was a great gig. The pay was good for a person without a college education and they worked around my schedule so I  couldn‚Äôt complain. Just recently the state I live in passed a law that required companies to give sick leave (pto) to part time employees. Since this law took effect I have accrued 30 hours of PTO. 

I graduated college in December and started applying for jobs higher up in the company since what we do interests me. After months of applying and talking with those higher up than me, I was finally offered a job. It is important to note that they hired outside the company for the position I applied for twice before choosing me for the third opening (high turnover rate company). This has frustrated me to no end but I was glad to finally have a full time job. 

What the company did not tell me was all previously accrued PTO would become void. I have been in this position for 2 weeks now and I got sick for the first time. Since I thought I had sick time I took the whole day off. Telling my direct manager so he would know why I was not in the office. My manager also did not know my PTO was lost and said it was okay. 

I walk into the office this morning and my manager shows me the email from HR that states I lost all my PTO. I don‚Äôt understand how this could be legal or a productive way to run a company. It made me hate the company I work for and my job in a matter of minutes. The company showed me they don‚Äôt value my time.

I basically lost a whole week of pay in 2 minutes.

TLDR: I got a promotion from part time to full time at my company. This promotion voided all my previously accrued PTO and they didn‚Äôt tell me. I took a sick day (that I thought was paid) and was told I had no PTO. Worst part is they aren‚Äôt even paying it out. My pto is just gone.

While sales may (or may not) allow me to retire in peace, in the near term, doing sales for a living is *always* a shit show.  It's intense.  It's cutthroat (to a degree).  And the company *will* fire you if you don't make your numbers.  Even with the best / most functional tech companies, to be clear, sales is *not* a job for the faint of heart.



Typically, leadership in a startup tech company will let the sales organization breathe and do their thing, advise as necessary, then adjust things if they need to grow the company.  Or if sales is sucking, there will be a mass firing and a reboot of the sales team.  I have experienced this dynamic many, many times, and it's a part of the game.  Regardless, sales is almost always comprised of hires who have been trusted -- *empowered* -- to grow the business.

  
... not at this company, tho.

  
The CEO is this terrible combination of a sock puppet and one of those (creepy) dolls where you pull a string and the doll just keeps chattering away.  He's actually not a bad guy personality-wise, for the most part, but he has zero self awareness about how his approach to customer-facing activities has a negative impact on the business.  And I assure you that the business is failing, less than 2 years into it.  We don't come remotely close to making our numbers, and even with our best efforts, it's hard for me to believe that this company will ever turn the corner.



And it's fucking all of us in sales.  *Hard*.  Plus, the CEO has the most punchable face that I have *ever* seen.  This motherfucker gets on a call (mainly unannounced because he thinks that the prospective customer is ""interesting""), talks over our entire team, and literally does not deliver on the call what the customer asked for in the first place.  And the calls *always* run late, the customer gets antsy because we are running over schedule, then we lose any momentum we have around getting a next call with these customers.



When you have a multi-million dollar (sales) quota, and you end up losing a million or more in projected business, due to the CEO's shenanigans, and you're acutely aware that being fired is a distinct possibility if you don't make your numbers, working at a place like this literally crushes your soul.  I *hate* working here, and I say this as a person who's highly adaptable to tons of crazy shit.  Like I said earlier, it's the way of sales.

  
So, why don't I say anything about it?

  
No matter how much sales is balls-to-the-wall / take-no-prisoners, you still have to demonstrate some level of professionalism.  I was raised to not talk back to my parents.  And I have learned over time to not rock the boat in terms of creating drama with a company's leadership.  Therefore, in as much as my boss says that I should take this up with the CEO, well, I am *not* going to take this up with the CEO.  I mean, what am I going to say?  ""STOP ATTENDING CALLS.""  No.  ""EMPOWER YOUR TEAM MORE.""  No.  ""STOP TALKING SO MUCH.""  Strong no.

  
The CEO literally filled in for someone in leadership who was on leave, and when the person returned from leave, the CEO decided to keep this person's position on a permanent basis -- and reassigned the person to another leadership role, basically a figurehead role (ANOTHER talker) with basically zero decision-making power in the business.



On top of this all, this company is completely devoid of culture.  I look at a slice of white bread, and I look at this company, and they are indistinguishable.  I'm not a rah-rah or pom-pom type of guy.  I'm not going to raise a glass at a company event and scream out the company's name at the top of my lungs.  However, working with people where there is a common purpose and camaraderie are usually benchmarks for successful and healthy companies.  This company has neither of those elements, and I know that the CEO is aware of this deficiency.  Why?  Because he addressed it.  Well, he addressed it in his own special way.  Just like he *always* does.

  
So, what does the CEO do?  Does he start a campaign to have us take a poll where we state what would be important to us?  Does he establish, at the very least, regional, in-person events?  Does he do any other meaningful thing to bring people together?  Nope.  He makes a rule that we'll build our culture by requiring that we run our cameras on *every* internal company meeting.  People literally post, likely out of fear, in the chat application on Zoom -- if they need to go off camera so that they can take a shit.

  
Worst, I'm pretty sure that the board has been shitting all over the leadership of this company.  They have these board meetings each quarter -- each quarter nothing ever changes -- and leadership constantly whitewashes the whole thing.



Changing jobs in sales is a regular thing.  Maybe the tech sucks and your lunch gets eaten by a competitor.  Maybe the market has changed (it always does).  Maybe the company is poorly run.  Maybe it's a combination of all of those things and more.  At some point, and you'll know when it's time, you just move on to the next opportunity.



My longest stint has been 3 years.  Like I said, sales is not a job for the faint of heart.  Working in sales is a trade off between longevity at any given company and maximizing your own compensation -- because life is short.  Still, while most people in sales have a dozen or more jobs on their resume, having a stint for less than a year is frequently a disqualifying metric -- when you take into consideration that AI-based hiring models are so common for tech companies these days.  AI isn't going to understand the nuance of the breaks(s) on your resume, and you will be disqualified without any human intervention.  So there is that.

  
Less than a year into it I'm cooked, and who knows if the business will even let me stay for a year?  Heck, it's laughable that I've been able to sell multi-year deals to customers -- where I'm not certain that the company will be around a year from now.

  
The CEO is the issue here, unless I didn't make that clear enough earlier.  He will run this place into the ground.  He will end up with worse employees once the word gets out that his company is shit to work for -- after he suffers a bout of attrition after a year.  Replacing the CEO with someone who actually knows what they're doing / understands what it takes to grow a business will also probably kill the business.



Here's to hoping that I make it to 13 months.

I'm also trying to think ahead of how to use my PTO.

---

At the beginning of every year, we get 15 days of PTO. Also, our office closes for winter break starting Dec 23, 2024 and then we return on January 6, 2025.

I was thinking about using my PTO in January (Jan 6‚Äì24), wait a week, and then put in my two weeks or one month notice (haven't decided yet).

We're required to give 30 days notice if we're going to use 4+ days of PTO all at once. So I would need to give them notice on Dec 6, 2024 at the latest.

I'm just worried that if I request those three weeks of PTO, they're going to reject the request and press me on what's going on. Maybe even fire me before winter break even starts.

Any thoughts? My coworker requested 2 weeks last year at the beginning of Jan and she was fine. But I don't know, 3 weeks might seem suspicious.

By the way, I work at an extremely small company. 6 people including me."

This is a thing we do where I work. It's an opportunity to talk about projects, personnel, and personal issues. I haven't made it a secret that I'm working towards a supervisory position, which shouldn't be an issue: there are about 8,000 people in our organization and we being in new hires on a kind of regular basis. 

So I asked what I can do to get some temporary experience as a supervisor, noting several open positions. She then launched into how I'm not a lawyer, and how on our team we need one of the people in charge to have a law degree. I repeated that I was looking at these other positions that are not on our team. After a discussion about how those people choose their own temporary assistant supervisors and discussing my assignments she then launched into a critique of something that happened like 4 months ago.

It felt like she was trying to torpedo me looking for advancement. Is this a thing?"

I only stayed for a month because they lied about a ton of stuff pre-employment, they treated me like shit, and they expected me to treat my employees like shit. 

I was working a lot more hours than planned also, which I had to self-report for later approval by my manager as my salaried position did not clock in and out. 

After I quit, I was focused on finding another job (I tried to wait until I already had one lined up, but could not) and did not immediately report my OT because I didn't think it would matter as long as I reported it before the next pay period was calculated. 

To make a long story short, after discussion with HR who passed me off to IT, then going back and forth with them, I found I could not report because my account had already been closed, which is wild to me because I can still log in and see my pay information from the job BEFORE this one. 

I got back with HR and let them know and asked how I could still report my hours. They told me to just send them what I worked, so I did. 

That was over two months ago and I haven't heard anything else, nor have I received any payment. To make this even worse, I have to pay back a signing bonus since I left within a year. That is going to be VERY painful to pay back if I'm also missing out on $1k+ in OT. 

How can I get them to pay out the OT?"

I'm making peanuts, stressing out about these little issues that really don't matter in the grand scheme of things while the company owner (my boss) drives a 7 series and owns a beach front vacation property. I've been spending so much time worrying about getting fired for lack of performance and it leads me to work harder; desperately looking for solutions to problems that I should be escalating to others with a higher pay grade. If nobody answers my emails and the solution gets delayed, the customer gets upset...who cares ? I've been in this industry 10 miserable years and it despite how hard I work, how many big problems I solve on my own, nothing ever comes of it other than a ""great job to so-and-so!"" company wide e-mail.

I don't know why it's taken me so long to realize it but everyone here was right, it really is just a matter of perspective. Quiet quitting isn't a shameful, lazy approach. It's 100% absolutely necessary in this economy and work culture. Doing the bare minimum and letting go of any fear of being fired over lack of performance, while putting your energy into developing yourself, keeping yourself healthy and interviewing for different jobs IS THE WAY TO GO. I feel so foolish letting myself get worked up into this state of burn out again when it's totally unnecessary. 

I'm no longer afraid of the confrontation about performance. I'm gonna hit em with that ""I'm sorry you feel that way but I'm trying my best"" until I either line up something better or they fire me so I can collect that sweet, sweet unemployment and take my time to regroup and find a job that doesn't make me want to throw my laptop out the window. There's no shame anymore and there was never any reason to feel any shame. I've worked hard for peanuts my whole life, now it's time to put in the level of work this pay deserves."

During my previous burnouts, I would spend days planning out in my head a plan to quit or ""just keep doing my best and apply for something better."" but that always lead me to continue killing myself with stress over tickets and not putting enough time into studying/labbing and sprucing up my resume properly for a truly better, higher paying position.

I don't know why it's taken me so long to realize it but everyone here was right, it really is just a matter of perspective. Quiet quitting isn't a shameful, lazy approach. It's 100% absolutely necessary in this economy and work culture. Doing the bare minimum and letting go of any fear of being fired over lack of performance, while putting your energy into developing yourself, keeping yourself healthy and interviewing for different jobs IS THE WAY TO GO. I feel so foolish letting myself get worked up into this state of burn out again when it's totally unnecessary.

I'm no longer afraid of the confrontation about performance. I'm gonna hit em with that ""I'm sorry you feel that way but I'm trying my best"" until I either line up something better or they fire me so I can collect that sweet, sweet unemployment and take my time to regroup and find a job that doesn't make me want to throw my laptop out the window. There's no shame anymore and there was never any reason to feel any shame. I've worked hard for peanuts my whole life, now it's time to put in the level of work this pay deserves. I used to think this sub was full of lazy shitters but I now realize how wrong I've been. "

-21 complaints open
-HR won‚Äôt fire them (WHY? Just WHY)

I told the company I WILL walk out. I said I‚Äôm done. I noticed after I said this they started to move quickly and met with my boss. I said I will quit if they don‚Äôt coach her to manager.

Maybe I should just start abusing people so I can get a raise and also have impenetrable immunity in the office. 

HR also noted that me (the subordinate) have very different personalities and styles. They basically mean I have character, class and I‚Äôm not a narcisstic ego-driven abuser.

Has anyone been in this situation snd can you lend some advice? I‚Äôm thinking the advice is most likely to leave. I could leave but the job market is tough. However, I‚Äôm so mentally fried that I may have to just quit and live off of savings. Others said quiet quitting works.

In his contract, it mentioned that he must return all company property after his departure.

He tried contacting the former employer multiple times via phone calls to return a badge shortly after he quit, but the employer never answered. There was no protocol on how to return the badge, so he forgot about it. He did not return it and they never went after him in 2021.

So, he assumed that they did not want it anymore.

In November 2022, they came after him for not returning and asked him to pay $200. He paid it in full, and he assumed that they would never contact him again.

Now, in May 2024, they sent him an email telling him that if he does not pay $300 CAD, they will send his case to a collections agency.

1. Is he obligated to pay the money to this company if he does not return his badge?
2. If he finds his badge, and returns it to the company, is he still obligated to pay the money?
3. If he does not pay the money nor return the badge, what consequences will he face for this?

For context, my brother is a university student, so I think that they are trying to take advantage of him."

Meaning it is okay to constantly writing employees after hours and even at midnight and demanding things to be done ‚Äúright now‚Äù and pretty much saying that your time off will be when i will say so.
( even though its not an employee fault, those things were never brought up) 

He can can not express gratitude, but if there is any chance he will publicly humiliate you, in a most disgusting way even if its not your fault. 

He expect everyone to treat him as a god since ‚Äúhe gave everyone a job‚Äù . Personal time is not a thing at all. 

He thinks that some private life responsibilities can be dropped on employees and thats completely fine. ( completely not work related and has nothing to do with a work ) 


A lot of employees complained about him and pretty much dont want to have any business with him at all, but he still at the same place. 

He does not want from direct employees to grow at all, because its comfortable that all employees are doing all work for him. He is pretty much open about it. 


What is a smart way to handle this? Because i think that HR and him might be on same side. ( there might be some personal interest, not sure ) 

If i will talk to HR and tell that i will get a lawyer, this might get me fired.

Should i attempt to talk politely that i do not want to be under this manager? Or should i get an attorney before this actions?

I'm 27, M

first of all, I know there may be a lot of people who would just tell me to man up, shut the hell up and keep going, not on this sub but overall. There are lot of such people in my social group, family, everywhere. It seems I don't have anyone who even remotely understands the point of my struggle. 

The thing is, I don't like the idea I'm basically predestined to spend the rest of my life in some kind of work. The majority of the day, every day. Some days, recently pretty often, this feeling hits me so much that even after the work ends, I don't even enjoy things I normally like. I'm just feeling like a total lethargic crap waiting for it to start again the next day. 

There's even more to it - I've got a really nice job (if you would take a look on it from an ordinary person viewpoint), I work from home, there's a rly fine group of people in my team, the manager is super cool dude, paycheck is somewhat alright, everything is really close to perfection here. 

So this brings me to the topic itself. This is not about a certain type of job, this is about this life approach from top to bottom. I remember even my first day in kindergarten where only this idea to forcefully be there was presented to me was a total pain in the ass for me. It was the same on elementary school, on high school, even on Uni. I simply didn't want to be there at all, I felt forced to do something I don't like. 

But there's still this problem that I just stop showing up, I'll probably die in the next month or two out of starvation. This is nuts, I cannot probably even describe all the stuff I'm thinking about right now. 

What are some of the possibilities people like me have? All the articles online are only telling me to find something I'd like to do but I've already been reassured multiple times that no matter what it is, if it's forced, I won't like it. People around me are telling me 'dude, this is capitalism, just accept how it is or go to beg somewhere to Himalayas for one banana a day' or something. 

I feel lost, I feel weak, stupid, unnecessary, unheard, misunderstood. It's hitting me really hard that some other redditors are often mentioning that they just daydream between winning a lottery or putting a bullet in their head. 

This is just insane. 

What are some steps you guys took on this path please? What helped you to find some ease in this?

Thank you for any contribution. "

The company I work for is going through an acquisition and I am not on permanent contract, so as much as I like it and they seem to like me, I am still looking around. I had an interview with a company close by in a similar position (finance) and being a smaller company the interview was directly with the GM. All was pretty quick and fairly nice so I agreed to go to the office and see what they were actually doing in person, as she said ""it will be better to understand the job"". I noticed the office was not in the best condition, with piles of documents almost everywhere but I didn't think much of it since the interview was so quick. I show up at 9 as agreed and someone buzzes me in. Right after me, they proceed to buzz in the whole rest of the company as no one is apparently allowed to have the keys of the front door. I sit down next to a guy who tells me just to wait, a person will be with me soon to show me some stuff. 40 minutes pass and I am literally playing on my phone, when he decides me to throw me a letter and ask me what I understand from it since it's in a foreign language - which I speak. I explain it to him and start waiting again. After some 15/20 minutes he asks me to look at an email and do some online research to be able to answer the person.. Mind you, I don't work there and no one explained me anything about the company yet. I spend 1h researching as agreed and he gives a quick look and says ""good, I will use this to answer them"". Then another lady comes to me with a cordless phone, all covered in grease from someone's face and tells me I need to make a phone call. She explains what I need to request and how and I comply. While talking to the customer she keeps interrupting and asking for further stuff, which I cannot understand as the other person is also still talking. At this point I am already pretty annoyed so I just ignore her and keep talking with the customer till the line cuts. Apparently someone else in the office is making a different call on the same line and ""oh yeah it happens with these phones"". She then proceeds to pick up an old cell phone with the glass completely shuttered and explains that is the mobile they use. THE GLASS WAS COMING OUT OF THE SCREEN AND YOU COULD FEEL IT. Then she asks another guy to take over and if I tell you he never brushed his teeth ever you have to believe me. The smell was disgusting. He gave me another task and left me alone, but I noticed immediately in the time I agreed to be there I could not finish it so I said: ""You guys have the break at 12.30 right? Cause I made plans afterwards as I was just asked to be here in the morning"" to which he answers ""oh not really, it depends"".  I completed half of the task and at 12.30 I gave back the paperwork and said I needed to leave. GM comes to me and convinced it went well asks if I will be able to go back another day to see more, maybe for the whole day. Mind you, all of this was not paid as I was under the impression I just had to go see what they do and not actually work. Bonus points: THE OFFICE WAS NASTY. The laptop (yes they use laptops, idk how they don't get blind) was so dirty you could not see some of the letters on the keyboard. The screen had a big green stripe of exploded pixels right in the middle and the plugged mouse was not working so I used the laptop one. THERE WAS NO TRASH BIN, JUST A TRASH PILE IN A CORNER. Someone told me if I needed to use the bathroom I could. I wish I went checking to have a laugh but I didn't have the courage. People, do better. If you are in a high position make sure the office is decent and people have at least the minimum required conditions to do the job or you will forever complain that you can't find someone to hire. NASTY."

Long story short the person whose leave I‚Äôm covering recently gave notice that they won‚Äôt be returning. This happened over a month ago and my boss has not spoken with me about the position, only sent a company wide email that I will continue in my term position.
This boss is your typical toxic boomer boss who probably should have retired 5 years ago (expects us to be in the office when sick, doesn‚Äôt understand what my job is and continues to give me work that is meant for his assistant). 
The HR person also is not easy to deal with and during the process of trying to hire one of my staff members, she made a comment about one candidate being more qualified for my job and she keeps pushing to hire this person (I think they want to get her trained and then give her my role when my term is finished).
Fast forward to yesterday, I get a call that a job I applied for back in October of 2023 is interested in me as a candidate still (I initially turned them down for this job) and wants me to start in June. This job pays a little less but has guaranteed raises, a pension and is permanent.
I plan on giving my notice the second that offer letter is signed but I feel guilty because I don‚Äôt want to leave my staff (who are great) stranded during our busiest season. 
Why do I feel this guilt when I feel like the management always sees me as replaceable ? "

January 24‚Äô they only post half the years all in weeks. I knew something was amuck. 

Well, I was off on Friday. I returned yesterday to a linked post on our slack that states we all have to come back to office after they‚Äôve been remote for 5 years. 

Issue is, a lot of people (myself included) live hours from the office, have sold their vehicle to save money and bolster other areas of opportunity.

This was a golden ticket opportunity for my circumstance. And it‚Äôs all gone before I even hit my 2 year mark. I can‚Äôt go back in office with the cost of child care, buying a new (used) car, and then the commute. 

I was positive about it yesterday, ‚Äúit‚Äôll work itself out‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôll find something better, like you did here‚Äù. This morning, I‚Äôm filled with despair. The market is horrible, my area pays 12-17/hr. And I was making over $100k (with end of year bonus that I won‚Äôt see again) and barely making ends meet.

They have an in-store ""We're hiring, and here is how to apply"" infographic on the counter, as well as a job listing online for that store and for that position. 

I submitted my application online, and about a week later, today, I walked into the store to show my face and let them know I had applied. The response from the tech at the counter was a heartfelt ""I'm sorry, but we aren't hiring. In fact, we're cutting hours right now. There may be some other stores that are hiring right now, if you want to try those."" 

I'm not outright saying this is illegal, or fraud or whatever, but part of me wants something concrete for my frustration to latch onto. Part of the reason I left my old pharm tech job was because of cut hours leading to damn near unsafe working conditions when it comes to patient health. Why are there so many false listings?

I work at a marketing agency for 6 months now,because workload has heavy the company hired two more people one to work remotely and the other one in the office with me

The one that works with me was hired two months ago and is younger than all of us ,around 25, 
I tried to train her the best i can but two months in she is unable to do anything on her own she asks even for the minor task a million questions a day and as a result i can't finish my work on time and always end up leaving last because i help her...

Also she is completely ungrateful of that & has an attitude, i recently started to tell her that i don't have time to help her and that we have done this before and immediately gets defensive and lies to my face that we haven't showed her that before and she can't do it....it doesn't help that the manager always assigns task to both of us and i am.the only one that does the job and she gets the credit  with me...

Last but not least our work schedule is 9-5 and she comes at the office around 10 and she is one of the first to leave ....the icing on the cake is that out  manager knows about this and does nothing

There were millions times that the manager arrived at the office and found me only there and she arrived like a half hour later 

I literally asked the manager if she is related with anyone in the company and said no.
I really don't want to create any more drama at the office but i am over the edge...i feel like an idiot that i wake up at 7 in the morning every day to be there one time and it really bothers me, also it bothers me that leaves early and doesn't do anything in the office and it really gets on my nerves 

Should i talk with the manager again and tell her that i need a breather from her and that i can't work with her ?or should i completely ignore her and don't help her ever again?"

At her current and new job, about 6 weeks, the owner seems to thrive on intimidating my wife who is the office manager.  

This happened today.  The owner told her that he can't fire one of the employees who is African-American because he knows the employee will sue because of discrimination.  In his words ""You think people are nice, just wait until you fire them and they retaliate.  And if I'm sued you (my wife) are going to be coming down with me.""

I've been searching for a specific law that could apply here but I'm just finding sexual harassment and discrimination laws.  She is going to call the Department of Labor for NJ when she gets home today, but not sure what the actual complaint or law we could cite.

Thankfully she already has an interview for a new job set up for tomorrow afternoon as she is definitely leaving her current job.

If anyone knows of anything specific it would be greatly appreciated.

I argued for more pay and he said I need to take on more responsibility. I feel like if I‚Äôm essential enough to where I can‚Äôt take off for a week, I should be paid more. He essentially said if I handle this transition with grace, ie not be burnt out and upset about my vacation being taken away, he will talk to the owners about getting more pay. He offered to ask his friend to cover for me as well. I‚Äôve asked him about it 3 times and no answer. I no longer trust him to advocate for me.

Tips to get through the day?",u/Rei_210,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1crvpeo/suicidally_depressed_at_work_tried_to_call_out/,antiwork,"I tried calling out, and my boss had pointed out my attendance issues. Which fair, once a month is a bit, but come on. I literally only called out for one day when my father passed away. I even said I'm depressed on the phone. No ""are you okay?"", no ""we have resources"", no ""do we need to lessen your hours"".

So I said ""I guess I can try"", I got a ""thank you"" and that was it.

Anyway, I spent the entire time walking here debating just walking out onto the road, and I showed up pretty early cause I didn't wanna just sit at home at that point, so I spent the last hour crying in the break room. One co-worker came up and asked if I was okay and if I needed to go home, saying ""if you're sick, you're sick"", but that's not the way things work around here. People take pride in coming in sick, they might bring a face mask if we're lucky, and those who do call out are seen as lazy.

Oh and this is a retail business so of course I gotta put some dumbass smile on my face, or people will complain. And I'm definitely going to spend the entire time collecting carts hoping a car runs me over in the parking lot.

I don't really know what to do. I feel like at the slightest issue I'm either going to burst into tears or a rage. Like if I'm calling out, you probably don't want me there, whether it's a physical sickness or my mental health issues. Speaking of which I'm not sure if depression does this, but I feel like I gotta throw up too.

I wouldn't be surprised if I get sent home today. I have some edibles that I usually eat on the way home but I don't wanna get caught with that, but that's literally where I am with trying to cope."

I had been put under probation to be promoted as the assistant manager, which I‚Äôm sure was bullcrap anyway, but I was getting the hours for an assistant managers position. My manager (been 2 months since she started) has very incompetent and still doesnt know how to work the POS system still, vapes in the back room, gives discounts to customers like free candy, calls one of the team members a fucking bitch, whenever she sees her, cash has gone missing.. and many other problems which I and the whole team have highlighted to the regional manager, with no solutions. I had basically been running the whole store at this point as we can‚Äôt work like that with her. 

I had been sick from the flu (which I got from her cuz doesn‚Äôt want to wear a mask to work), it was pretty bad, I had fevers up to 101.5, chills and tonsillitis, cold cough and all. So I‚Äôve been calling off work for the last week. I have been giving notice that I can‚Äôt work the next day with a cover to my manager. The last time I did it, apparently the cover I sought for worked too much and wasn‚Äôt allowed to work. There is no way for me to know this, all I can do is ask if they can work, and they said they could. So I informed my manager at 5:43 pm that I found a cover and my manager said the cover can‚Äôt work as it‚Äôs over her hours. She still managed to give the cover my shift not sure how. Either way the next day she asked me 2 times if I‚Äôm able to come to my next shift I said yes, but then she said, I can‚Äôt keep having late notice, people are planning their day, and I obviously need notice to give them notice. Now my problem is how am I supposed to know if I‚Äôm upto working the next day or not. In my opinion I still gave her plenty notice. I never once misled her and she herself has left shifts midday cuz she felt sick with no cover. Technically it‚Äôs not even my job to search for covers, it‚Äôs hers, but I still try to find someone so it‚Äôs easy on her. At this point I‚Äôm not even allowed to get sick. 

After this, she started cutting my hours and even removed some of my shifts all together. I asked her why and she said oh I got an email saying the hours have been reduced, which is bull shit cuz when I went to work, her email is always open to download documents and there was no such email. I called the regional manager and apparently they‚Äôve removed the assistant manager position all together, which they had basically put me on probation for. 

Anywho, I know I need to find new work now, but it is just irritating how the management doesn‚Äôt see how much money they are losing employing such a person as a manager. I‚Äôm not even sure how she was hired as a manager in the first place. "

I've seen my doctor, and we have a game plan, but my boss says I cannot return to work without a note from my doctor and insists I go to the ER or walk in to get it, which I denied; My symptoms will not be resolved with another visit to the doctor, I am on a waitlist with another doctor and just need time before someone can see me. 

I don't understand what my bossed are planning. Today they text me, ""I understand not being able to go to ER. What is the reason for the walk-in clinic?""

I really just need some verbiage that shuts them down and keeps boundaries up. I don't even believe I can return to work right now, but I'd like to keep the option open to work for the *company* in the future. This department is just really nasty.

Also, I'm sorry if anti-work is the wrong place for this. Please don't crucify me. Life is hard enough as it is."

I had never called off, never been late, and tried my hardest to be a good employee. Hell, my very first week I covered 3 different peoples shifts and I was almost always avaliable to cover people because I needed the money. Problem comes in last Friday, I wake up and am puking my guts out. I wait a few hours to see if it'll pass, but I'm puking a few times every hour. So around 11:00/12:00 I try to call out but the only person avaliable to cover me isn't able to cover my shift. I ask my manager what I should do and she tells me to call the head manager and ask her. The head manager basically implies that I'll need to come in anyways and I say okay. I was fully prepared to come in sick, I couldn't afford to lose my job and I needed the money. Then, they both text me saying they figured it out and found someone to cover me. My head manager says I'll need to come in early tomorrow ""to talk"". I'm obviously freaking out, but when I go in she tells me I'm fired. She says that if our drawer is short or over 5$ then we get a write up and if it happens again we get let go. I accepted this and moved on but I've been thinking about it since and I feel like there's just no way that's true. There's a manager who constantly messes up with counting to the point I was warned about it before my first shift (the head manager had told me specifically if manager even had made this mistake, they would be let go). Also, she fired me a day after my second mess up. Basically the timeline is I mess up counting my register (during which my manager calls my head manager to let her know), I call out sick, and then I get fired. And she said I was fired like that day like do not come in for my next few scheduled shifts I'm just done and I think if it were truly that serious she would've fired me the day I called out. But she didn't. Idk I'm just freaking out because I don't have money for rent and finding a job in my town is impossible."

When I am watching television, I often look at [classaction.org](http://classaction.org) and sign up for any lawsuits I am qualified for. I do this because a) free money is free money b) F large corporations and c) if people don't put in claims that money sometimes goes back to the companies...

Today, I happened to look at the workplace and employment lawsuits and saw many that applied to posts that I have seen on this subreddit namely: drive time, overtime, misclassification, background checks. I HIGHLY recommend signing up for anything that you may be qualified for. I like the settlements page: [https://www.classaction.org/settlements](https://www.classaction.org/settlements) shockingly, Walgreens has done some shady hiring practices and also sign up for any potential lawsuits you qualify under workplace and employment [https://www.classaction.org/employment-and-overtime](https://www.classaction.org/employment-and-overtime)

  
You don't have to pay for a lawyer, and man is it nice to randomly get money in your venmo account.

(p.s. i am NOT a lawyer, I gain nothing from you joining a lawsuit except the satisfaction of Walmart having to pay you money because they misweighed their meat).

The caveat is that she would have to sign a document allowing them to install their own configured wifi router and monitor ALL of her home network traffic, all the time. 

As someone who works in IT, this is sketchy at best, total BS at the most likely. They could configure the router to restrict, but 24/7 monitoring? Why would a company even want to bother with this? It stinks of ""Well, we offered you WFH, you said no, and now you get nothing"" propaganda......

Lo and behold today I actually found out I am being screwed over.

There is this state grant in my country granted to long term unemployed people entering work that has a lot of prerequisites. But it covers around 80% of the salary for a while of the newly employed.

My job coach had a meeting with my boss yesterday and today I found out the results. And essentially my boss had heavily implied he would only hire me if he would get the grant. I have checked the requirements, I don't tick those boxes.

Issue is that the labour institute in my country, they have a tendency to assume that if an application is made for that grant, that means I have got a job, even if my boss would reject me if the grant didn't pass. And therefore take me out of any unemployment programmes aka rendering me without any income.

So not only did I not get a job, I am also most likely losing my only way of sustaining myself AND I still don't know if I am getting paid or not and I never got any proof of employment.

Tomorrow I intend to call the union and start working on seeing what I can do. My boss when I asked him if I worked anymore this week has refused to answer, and it feels like I am shadow fired.

Yesterday when I found out this was a possibility I cried, today I am just angry.

I was the customer service person for IT, which meant any e-commerce issues/requests went through me.

Fine, at least I still have a job and am learning a new skill, which could come in handy later.

About 3 months into training, I'm suddenly pulled aside and told that they were letting me go because the customer service role was being eliminated.

I enjoyed the job, but the manager is insane. 

I am on some medications that have been making me very sick for the last two weeks. Last Wednesday, I called out about 1.5 hours before my shift because I started vomiting. My manager proceeded to huff and puff about how now the store won't open on time and we can't have that. The man even HEARD me vomit on the phone and still had the nerve to ask, ""Can you still make it in?"". I also got told on monday that ""you need to give at least 3 hours notice before you call out"" like ok dude, next time i will plan my vomit better.

Today, I got to work, opened the store, and started to feel so sick. I was able to close the store and put a sign up for customers to know we are closed and ran to the back to vomit. I called my manager to tell him that I need to go home. This man proceeded to ask if I can hold out until someone gets there in 3 hours.... I tell him I can't even stand up without getting nauseous and don't really feel like vomiting on someone because when the vomit comes over me, it's instant. He then tells me, ""Well, if you are too sick to keep working, maybe I should call emergency services to come. Sounds like you are having a medical emergency."" in the most condescending tone ever. 

 Which I tell him that it's not a medical emergency, it's a reaction to my medications that I unfortunately have to take. And then he says, ""Well, if it's not a medical emergency then I don't understand how you can't stick it out. Either we can call 911 or you can wait. We cannot have the store closed during the day."" What the hell is an EMT going to do? Work my shift for me? I don't even understand the logic? He was clearly just trying to guilt me into saying it's not that bad and just staying at work. Because I guess to him if it's not life or death, I can just stick it out.

 I'm not going to be guilted or threatened into working while vomiting. This is a minimum wage job. He hung up on me after saying he needs to call our district manager, so I made sure all the doors were locked, wrote ""I quit"" on a sticky note that I put on my work keys, and left it on his desk. Set the alarm and left out the auto-locking door. This man has been truly one of the worst managers I have ever worked for. Part of me wanted to tell him to call 911 so I can get him in trouble for abusing emergency services."

Today I was told that my position was being removed and that I would have to apply for a higher position or be demoted to my former position. 
 To top it off my previous position will be absorbing the duties of my current position. AND  the pay is less than the pay in was hired at.

And the position I would have to apply for is played $ .10 more than I currently at with twice the responsibilities. 
My manager told me that corporate said for her to expect those in my position to quit. And that they are prepared to lose all employees in my position. 

They are now restricting all promotions to internal only. Likely to stagnate pay and to negate competition with other companies. And all the new positions start at $1-2 less than they did just last month.

After two years of this, I started working in a warehouse. It was fucking terrible, 7 days a week, no off days, with barely any actual compensation, felt like absolute slavery. Our break room, I remember, smelled like sewage water.



After a year of warehouse work, I moved on to being a waiter and then transitioned to being a bartender. A lot of things happened in between. Currently, I've been working in B2B digital marketing sales for more than a year now, as that's what my experience has been building up to. I am currently 20.



I am tired. I am really fucking tired. I live alone and have been living alone for years. I have expensive rent and bills to pay, which I've had for a long time. This year, I started saving some money on the side to go to therapy, and I've been prescribed Zoloft. Over the years, I've developed severe anxiety after being abused by many of my ex-managers and current ones. I can't even count how many jobs I've had anymore. I've developed multiple addictions and chain-smoke most of the time. I am burnt out and haven't had one full week to myself in seven years. I am suffocated. I can't even sleep anymore and I barely have energy for anything. I haven't had the chance to pause work for so long because of the risk of going homeless since I was extremely young.



I am really depressed and this has taken a toll on me in every way possible. I've made it a long way, but the way I've been treated my entire life like fucking garbage by toxic workplaces has genuinely fucked me up. My most recent position is okay, but I am genuinely simply too exhausted to handle it anymore.



I've been considering applying to copywriting positions. That is what I've excelled at so far. Yet I cannot get myself to do it. I am scared of any new workplace. I've had so many changes and I do not have the energy for anything anymore..



Forgive for this post. I am just not someone that talks about these things as I always pretend to be grateful. I cannot, however, for the love of fucking god stand this economic system anymore. I've reached my breaking point a while ago and I feel like I've completely fucking shutdown.  Saving money is not even an option with all the expenses that I have. How the fuck will I get a break at this rate? I cannot last for much longer and depression has been eating me alive."

4,2024-05-14,An Inequality Graph for the United States,u/OneOnOne6211,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1csajlu/an_inequality_graph_for_the_united_states/,antiwork,"**Preface for the purposes of intellectual honesty: I am not an economist. I did not make this to be some bulletproof scientific study and I only have access to the data that I can find on Google. I did not spend years creating this, I spent about an hour doing it. As a result I'm sure there are fair criticisms that could be levelled at the graph I'll present. But I was just hoping this would give people some vague idea of how much average workers in the U.S. are being screwed.**

Anyway, that out of the way... I spent the last hour or so researching and making a little graph to get across inequality in America.

This graph contains various measures: Worker productivity, CEO pay, median housing price, average big mac price (as a shorthand for the price of food), median yearly income and the minimum wage in the United States from 1970 to 2020.

This graph measures growth so all of these are compared each time to what they were in 1970. So for each of them 1970 is 1 and the other numbers are how much that value has risen compared to 1970.

For example, median housing prices in the U.S. were  63.700 dollars in Q1 of 1980 and 23.900 in Q1 of 1970. This means 63.700/23.900 which is about 2.67, meaning the median house price in 1980 was about 2.67 times as much as in 1970. This is the information conveyed on the graph. And I do the same kind of calculation for everything included. This is so they can all be displayed easily on the same graph.

In effect, I am showing you the growth of each of them compared to each other.

None of these numbers (except CEO pay, I'll get back to that) are adjusted for inflation. This is intentional because inflation doesn't matter here since we're compared non-inflation adjusted numbers to other non-inflation adjusted numbers. And the important thing about this graph isn't the absolute numbers, it is the distance between those numbers.

If inflation was the only factor, for example, then all of the lines on the graph would perfectly overlap. In other words, if the minimum wage grew at the exact same rate that CEO pay did (due to inflation), then these two lines would overlap each other. On the other hand, if the minimum wage grew faster than CEO pay did, then the line for the minimum wage would move up more quickly than the CEO pay line and the gap would get larger. And if CEO pay grew faster than the minimum wage did, then it would climb higher faster and the gap between the two would grow in its favour.

In other words, the important thing about this graph is always the gap between two lines.

To simplify it: The bigger the gap between two lines grows, the more the lower line is getting screwed compared to the higher line.

So what are the results?

https://preview.redd.it/xg244skyzh0d1.jpg?width=573&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d0116c15f977b7a059e4509bfd28dd0e3f4dc7c

As you can see the gap between CEO pay and both median yearly income and minimum wage grows quite a lot from 1970 to 2020, especially between 1990 and 2020. The gap is temporarily reduced in 2010 (I assume due to the stock market crash) but is well on its way to reaching a new high by 2020.

It's also worth mentioning here that because CEO pay is the one thing that IS inflation-adjusted, so far as I'm aware, because I couldn't find a non-inflation adjusted version, this is actually an *underestimate* of the degree of ""screwage"" going on.

We can also look at the median housing price which, compared to both median yearly income and minimum wage, has completely skyrocketed. Hence the growing gap between them.

The cost of a big mac doesn't fare as badly as housing, yet it is still more expensive compared to the median yearly wage than it was in 1970. This means your yearly income will buy few big macs today than it did back in 1970. This is extra true if you make the federal minimum wage, because the gap there is even larger.

All of this, including workers being able to buy fewer houses and big macs with your wage, is happening as worker productivity continues to rise.

And, as you can see, the gap between worker productivity and your yearly income continues to grow. Meaning that while you are producing more value per hour, you are actually taking home a smaller percentage of that value than before. And, in fact, it's worse than that because (as shown by housing prices and the big mac's price) you are even taking home less value in *absolute terms* as well, at least when it comes to housing and food.

So you are producing, inflation adjusted, more than 2.5 times as much value as in 1970 these days, but you find it harder to afford food and housing than back then.

By contrast, CEO pay compared to the productivity of U.S. workers has climbed *a lot* more. Outpaced it by quite a bit, in fact, as the gap there (though reaching a zenith in 2000 before the crash) is much, much bigger in 2020 than in the 70s, 80s and 90s. So the CEOs are actually taking home more of the value you generate.

As you can see the gap between their pay and housing prices and big mac prices has also climbed quite a lot. Meaning that in absolute terms too they can buy a lot more of those these days than they could in the 1970s. And, again, this is an underestimate.

But just in case you weren't convinced you're getting screwed, let's put a cherry on top of this inequality cake. Because I've created a second graph. This one includes the net worth (non-inflation adjusted this time) of the richest person in the U.S. for every year.

https://preview.redd.it/dmlxr83y3i0d1.jpg?width=572&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b5cb4fd9374fb57c346be03a60e4471d38c7324

As you can see, this graph is almost comical.

When it starts off, due to how I calculated the numbers, there is no gap between the wealthiest person's net worth and the median yearly income (cuz we're measuring growth here). Yet by 2020 that gap has grown so large that it becomes hard to make out some of the other gaps. Even the CEO pay vs. median yearly income gap pales in comparison.

By 2020 the federal minimum wage is about 4.5 times what it was in 1970, the median yearly income is about 6.1 times what it was in 1970 and the wealthiest person's net worth is about ***75*** times what it was in 1970. Yes, ***75 times*** compared to 4.5 and 6.1.

This is inexcusable. This is not a working system. This is a dark comedy.

It must be fixed."

I came to you the 2nd month of my employment frustrated hoping to change a few things. You taught me that was fruitless hence why this will remain unsent. 
Over the last month my own supervisors  don't even try to hide how much they want a coworker to fail, but I made a promise to coach/train her if the opportunity arose once again. I have every intention of trying my best to help her succeed but it appears I am the only one.  I have to wonder as the same people think it's OK to cut me down for giving this girl one more chance if you are hoping that I myself fail and leave the company. 
You allow my boss to micro-manage me as I am never allowed to make any decisions without her approval. She allows my supervisors to talk down to me to my face and talk about me constantly behind my back while saying she has mine.  It reminds me of a den of foxes nipping at each other constantly. 
I'm tired of coming home upset feeling like nothing I ever do is good enough for either my manager or the people under me.  
What I won't tell you is that today was my final straw, that I have put my resume online and begun searching for a new company. I appreciate  the experience but the salary and not being allowed to have weekends off when you allow people beneath my position to have that perk instead. The salary being taxed to the point that my own staff makes hundreds more a paycheck than I do just is no longer worth my mental health and time.  You expect me to stand smile while allowing them to berate me  is beyond words.  Thank you for the experience as I have said so my resume looks more attractive to other employers but that's the only benefit.

On top of that, there are a few things that I love about my job: no emergency setting, no work on weekends, and so on. 

Either way. My first task when I got there was to build a database with patient‚Äôs data. I was ok with that because I like doing that. 

My boss never gave me a deadline, he just keeps saying that I need to finish this as soon as I can. And truth be told, I could collect data on 200 patients in two months IF I were collecting one visit per patient. But I‚Äôm not. I have to collect all the visits the patients has done (easily more than 4 per patient) and I also have to collect extra stuff like lab results and so on. 

So even though I am collecting 200 patients, I‚Äôm also collecting 800 lines of data and he expects me to do so in weeks. 

On top of that, I have other projects that take up my time. I‚Äôm exhausted. Every time I think about this database I get anxious. 

It‚Äôs been two months and I‚Äôve collected 91 patients which accounts for 364 lines of data. And that‚Äôs ONLY from online records. I will STILL need to go over these patients‚Äô physical files!

8,2024-05-15,Incompetent Hiring Managers and Stupid Interview Practices,u/Affectionate_Fox_944,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1csfsi1/incompetent_hiring_managers_and_stupid_interview/,antiwork,"TLDR; Hiring manager passes up incredible candidate for being too incredible. Companies are terrible at training people to select talent.

I'm a relatively successful professional in a medical industry. I don't manage people, but my role is at the same level as a middle manager. I have interviewed countless candidates for roles and have helped develop four people internally into better roles. I met a woman in a bar about a year ago. We got to talking, and she expressed that, due to autoimmune-related health issues (she's now considered disabled), her career had been put on hold to accommodate for a diagnosis that was long in coming and six related surgeries. She has a Master's degree in a scientific/health field. She has a great personality and outlook, she's well spoken, and her resume is strong overall. (She had jobs and volunteered prior to her health issues, and she's been employed at a hospital ever since.) I've been helping her look for jobs and prep for interviews since we met. She's languishing in her current role, she can't get full time hours, and she's drastically underpaid. She's had some trouble finding roles that would be a good fit, however, and she's applied to over 20 jobs with no callbacks.

A position came open at my company, and I referred her. It's entry-level, but it matches her experience level for our specific industry. It would be a 30% raise for her annually, and she's excited to enter the industry and learn. She prepared by reading studies related to our tech and did a bunch of research about the company. She also prepped with me extensively.

The hiring manager and her team consistently brought up issues they had with her resume before she was even phone screened. Some of them were not even legal to discuss. Ridiculous questions came up about her ""taking a step down"" (this isn't a step down for her), ""clearly wanting to escape a bad manager"" (nope), ""would be bored"" (she's enthralled with our tech), etc. I professionally addressed each one. When the gap in her resume (due to surgeries/recoveries) came up, I suggested they ask her to talk about that when they interview her. I suggested if there were too many concerns, that they should not waste her time and get her hopes up. I also suggested approaches to keeping her engaged and retaining her for a long period if that was their main concern.

They put her through three rounds of interviews, including one on-site, four-hour set of meetings on her day off. The hiring manager and team repeatedly discussed how well she did in comparison to other candidates, none of whom knew anything about our business when they interviewed. The rest of the hiring team repeatedly talked about how impressed they were with her.

The hiring manager told me today she's not being selected because the risk of her ""getting bored"" and leaving before three to five years is too high. They've concluded she's ""too overqualified,"" despite all of the discussions over weeks of this process. 

I'm so embarrassed. They are at least referring her for another position, but I hesitate to put her through it all again; I'm worried the outcome will be similar."

I just did some research, and apparently (I don't care about the average, as it probably doesn't mean anything due to the super rich skewing everything) the median income per person in America is more or less around 40-42 000 dollars...now, I understand that it may not sound like much for Americans, but for us Europeans that's one hell of a big median income ! I live in France, and most people make something like 1900-2000 euros a month after taxes.

I see a lot of people earning 70-80-100k also in America, which is really not common in France, so I have to ask : how come Americans seem to be struggling so much despite this? Is life so expensive, are interest rates that high? What gives?

Apologies if I sound a little ignorant (I probably am), but I felt like asking."

I just started a new job after being unemployed for 5 months. My boss came to work sick in my second week, and while she tried not to stand less than a few feet away from everyone, she didn't wear a mask, and now I'm sick. She is allowed to work from home, but had meetings she just ""couldn't reschedule"". My husband and I are immunocompromised, and I don't have health insurance - I was planning on waiving it anyway because I can't afford it.

She could have worked from home any time. I can't, so what would have been an inconvenience to her is now lost wages for me. And the kicker is that all our customers are medically vulnerable - I don't even feel too bad aside from the constant coughing, but I don't want to risk getting our customers sick.

These people have no regard for other people. They really think nothing bad will come of coming to work sick. They don't think about the risk. I don't think it's covid, but I had that once and it permanently disabled me. If it is covid, it would stand a very real chance of killing me this time, not to mention my husband. We need better worker protections and to change the way we view calling in sick. They can't be allowed to get away with this."

I‚Äôm a little taken aback by this.

She maintained on that phone call that she was also being let go and that the reason for both our terms was ‚Äòrestructuring‚Äô but that they weren‚Äôt calling it a layoff.

The CNN article tries to make it seem like ""No, corporate greed isn't the cause of inflation!"", but thankfully they link to the actual source.

When you read the source, while they conclude that ""markups"" aren't the main driver of inflation *right now*, they are going by watching it from the start of COVID recovery. In other words, just not in the last few months. They try to keep terms snappy, but this is how they define their terms:

>Instead, we focus on another potential alternative driver of inflation that resulted from firms‚Äô ability to adjust prices, known as pricing power. As demand for goods surged early in the post-pandemic recovery, companies may have had a greater ability to raise their prices above their production costs, a gap known as markups.

Pricing Power is how much they are able to change their price. They go on to note:

>In fact, growth of nonfinancial corporate profits accelerated in the early part of the recovery (see Figure 1), suggesting that companies had increased pricing power. Some studies have pointed to the strong growth in nonfinancial corporate profits in 2021 as evidence that increased markups have contributed to inflation...

They try to waffle saying ""we can't base it on corporate profit"", but raising the prices beyond production cost, the markup, is the sign of the greed. All corporate profits measure is how successful they were!

I wish CNN had a comment section so I could rip into them for this shoddy bullshit corporate pandering. And right at the top of the page is the marker telling you what's driving the US Market:

So we all know if we have accumulated enough equity, the only thing enslaving us to a job is the threat of not having employer sponsored health insurance. IF I understand correctly, job insurance is cheaper partially b/c employer pay some or all premium, another reason is that with sheer volume of employees that presumably is average in health, the rates are lower vs individual. So, would it be viable to create a shell company for the purpose of getting cheaper insurance rate? The ""employees"" would be co-op members who participate but does not have a salary.

I then immediately sent him a follow up e-mail again letting him know that I am sick and I left him a voicemail explaining the situation. He did not call me back, nor did he reply to my e-mail. 

Today, we have a 5 hour meeting with our whole team of 20, that is 2 hours away from where I live. I was up all night again vomiting and was in no position to make the 2 hour drive and participate in a 5 hour meeting. I sent an e-mail to him at 8 AM this morning that I was still sick and not going to be able to make it today. He then calls me at 10 AM, when our meeting was starting, and 2 hours after I sent him an e-mail with conversation going like this:

‚ÄúHey, are you planning on joining us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but what do you mean? I‚Äôm out sick today.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay well I didn‚Äôt hear back from you, so I thought an e-mail might be a better way to reach you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôve been vomiting all night, I am at home, and 2 hours away from the meeting site.‚Äù

Moving IS NOT a solution to low wage and rising cost of living. People go ""oh just move"" but there is multiple issues at play. 

First lower cost of living has equally low wages with many things like healthcare and vehicles not being any cheaper. And often works out to be that money goes less far.

The other reality is were not robots support groups friends and family matter for maintaining mental health. Just picking up and moving into complete isolation, especially with work being what it is today. Having little energy left little funds left its very likely what you lose will not be replaced or take years even decades to rebuild. Leaving you in complete isolation. 

Beyond mental health there is tangible benefits even not doing stuff for you but ""mutual"". Roommates help substantially cut cost. And while craigslist is ""fun"" its also a good way to be stuck in a lease with violent person that steals stuff and doesn't pay. If you have kids there is back and forth where you with other siblings or friends take time watching each other kids. As well as helping move etc.

Then there is cost of move people joke bus tickets x and crap. But reality is you have stuff even if you can compact it minimalize. Replacing bed is not cheap  computer clothes it adds up. Even if you go small you either need to spend 1-2k replacing shit or 1-2k on moving vehicle for the cross country move.

Even on typical move where you ""just throw out"" dingy garbage can. Or a few other things or dishes break in move etc. Realistically just buying stuff for new apartment will run a few hundred bucks in odds and ends. 

So in reality you first need 3-5k to afford move, which your broke and not making enough to live let alone save.  

All this to move to area that sure rents cheap. BUT is there any jobs for you especially if you have any skills. I remember growing up in rural town. Kids would apply year round to 4-5 businesses in town as it was only option. And lucky few got jobs. 

Most moved out due to lack of available work AT ALL. One of friends that stayed he works for only car shop in town as mechanic. He can not quit if place goes under he is stuck with a house. With only option flipping burgers or walmart. 

Like the options are not great in these towns for work and even if you do get work. Its not great pay. So your stuck in town with no job opportunity no entertainment and substandard infrastructure. If you get a job your 100% stuck. If you quit you will have to move or work min wage. 

Like it has to be stupidest suggestion. Especially with ""rural"" catching up and being among fast growing rents with stagnant wages. Everyone from private equity to people who can work from home are chasing these cheap areas. And its skyrocketing prices but with wages remaining stagnant for area. In my state its like sure rents 30% more in big citys but pay is also 50% higher."

People keep quitting or transferring to different departments in the company. Moral is reallly really low. Corporate leadership is clueless. The company itself makes money. In 2023, I started with a regional team of 12 peers and now am down to 4 peers. My company has effed with everyone's comp plan and barely introduced the 2024 plan in Mid-April (Q2). We all got 2% bonus. (regardless of goals) - From that, I basically decided to ""quiet quit/do the absolute bare minimum""... I make a salary of $100k, w/ a company car, benefits etc. But there is ZERO... incentives to do any more than I have. And this is the FIRST time in my sales career of 25+ years that I dont care about anything. I have no motivation or drive at all. >>>WWYD? Stay in Quiet quit mode until someone notices?

I am a salaried employee, web developer, I work for a boomer, expecting me to work on the weekend for events under their job description not mine (no pay/extra hours). Wanting me to let her know when I arrive and or get up off my chair for any length of time. 

I am a web developer and my manager who does not know how to save a pdf, questions my work and argues that I am wrong about things whenever she has absolutely no clue about my job and what is involved. 

I had to argue that my job description does not say work weekends for events strictly web related tasks and I noticed it says 'No direct reports' so i am curious what that means exactly? 

Not to mention she also has been given work to relating to computers by her boss but wants to push it on to me, again not related to my job description. 

I feel for anyone who does not understand technology but to question my capability/work when you don't understand it yourself is extremely frustrating and also being micro managed with every moment I take. Being expected to put in weekend hours when I was never told this when taking the job and when  I need to take a sick day they deduct that time from my pay but extra time or hours for overtime I put in, I am hourly when it suits them basically."

In this super hierarchial oil and gas giant company, you would have maybe 6-7 managers exactly right above yourself in a ladder system. I am handling month end, quarter, and annual close business reporting activities and ad-hoc requests as a coordinator. It's just my second month into this job, and from day one my palms are always super wet and chest is always a little uptight and I often times find myself in need to take a deep breath .

The person who did the handover to me is still in the same team with a different desk and is a type of woman who is extremely serious and would hate you if you asked anything the 2nd time. I realised from my first week that her heightened stresss was stressing me like some kind of toxic infection in the air. Super uptight and passive aggressive and ready to blow up like a balloon near a needle. Today, I just simply asked her if it was okay that I forwarded the email to the right people from the email she sent to me with the files because I was not CC-ed in the original and could not just extract that one out. Her passive-aggressive remarks like hey dont CC him, HEY dont include me, it is not my desk anymore etc, made very subconscious and you know what? she blew up over the chat and then called me immediately on Zoom and immediately demanded what was my freaking problem and why on Earth I could not simply forward an email and understand and make my own decision and how I am now wasting her time with such a small simple thing. She was so upset that I also got very upset from the first sec.

Today during the big presentation to like literally 5 managers above myself as a new comer, I was quite nervous and my brain overloaded, and still shaken and upset from the fight with the colleague. I did my best to give the presentation but I had some stutters and my energy was not good as I could sense from the two managers in the same room. I was lectured for 20min how I could not answer one of the questions from the other big top dog manager by my local two managers. I felt embarrased and in no shape after the horrible two months of being buried with extreme stress, tons of tasks, extreme corporate show-results-impress-or-you-are-shit mentality of others. I am also burnt out and worried for my health as I had to work 12 hours a day for 4 days last week and this month is supposed to be even one of the lighter months of the year.

I am very educated and have masters but as a third world country citizen, I could at the moment only work in one of the big support offices in Eastern Europe for one of those big giant corporations as a white-collar corporate slave for better CV. My salary is low as a 'cheap labor' and I could not build up any emergency fund and now I am thinking if I got a disease, I would not have the job (they'd replace me easily, the woman who did the handover would curse me to death if you know what I mean) and zero money. Whether I should quit is my decision, but what would you advise and have you had similar situations?"

I‚Äôve worked at a popular retail store for about 5 months. During this time, I have found myself really disliking practically all of the managers except for the coordinators. One manager (an evil little lady) is extremely hard to be around because she‚Äôs basically just an asshole. She‚Äôs disrespectful and snaps at the associates when she‚Äôs angry about something that has nothing to do with anything. 

Today, I was supposed to work a 4 hour shift. No problem. I picked up some food before I clocked in. Well, while I was working I started to get really hot and sweaty. My stomach started to bubble and I automatically knew that something was wrong with me. I tried to suck it up, but the longer I stood there the worse I felt.  I then started to feel dizzy/light headed as my stomach began to cramp. As I‚Äôm standing at the podium, I decided to go into the fitting room to fan myself off. I take a look in the mirror and I‚Äôm extremely pale/clammy (I‚Äôm black so this was for sure a problem). 

By this point, I call my manager (the little evil lady). She walks up to me and asks me what I need. I tell her that I have to go home as I‚Äôm not feeling well and start explaining my symptoms. Instead of being a decent manager and asking if I‚Äôm okay/need anything, she catches an attitude and tells me, ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm not feeling well either! I‚Äôve had a fever for three days straight! You don‚Äôt see me trying to go home.‚Äù Usually, I would argue back but I‚Äôm actively trying not to shit myself and faint so I reiterate to her that I have to go home. She says to me, ‚ÄúFine. Go home if you want to go home.‚Äù And walks away. I was actually shocked because 1. Where‚Äôs the compassion? 2. It‚Äôs not my fault she doesn‚Äôt feel well and decided to work instead of staying home. 3. While she was talking shit to me, she was smirking at me.

As I‚Äôm grabbing my stuff to leave, my coworker comes up to me and asks me if I‚Äôm okay. I asked her if I Iook like I don‚Äôt feel well and she nods. I tell her about my conversation with evil little lady and she tells me that she‚Äôs been upset because four people called out‚Ä¶ And that‚Äôs my fault how? 

I went to the break room, grabbed my stuff and waddled out the store. I‚Äôve been home for maybe an hour and my stomach will not stop cramping/bubbling. I was already going to put my two weeks in as I am going to grad school in the fall and received an amazing assistantship offer. But my goodness, these managers are terrible. And they wonder why people quit/they can‚Äôt keep employees. I am definitely thinking of putting in my two weeks way earlier than I expected to. This job has obliterated my mental health and I‚Äôve begun to fall back into old self harming habits. It‚Äôs not worth my sanity or life. Especially not with managers like evil little lady."

Today was my first day of the week, and when I asked about sending an email out about our communication change, they said they already did it without me. I was never cc'd on it, so I don't know what was said, but it was strange to me that they would communicate the concept I came up with without involving me.

I'm going to ask them to forward it to me tomorrow, and if they refuse, I know another way to find out. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I'm concerned they tried to pass the idea off as their own. If I find out they did, I'm considering quitting.

0,2024-05-15,a thesis on why I should be able to make a living playing Minecraft,u/RalphORama,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ct1g0t/a_thesis_on_why_i_should_be_able_to_make_a_living/,antiwork,"I think a lot of you here already know where I'm going with this. I've been playing Minecraft since middle school, about 2010, and it is by far the subject matter I have the most experience / dedicated hours in. More so than any profession related or unrelated to my major, I have played hundreds of thousands of hours of Minecraft, both modded and unmoded, and, at the end of the day, found myself making less money than either a professional in my chosen field or a professional Minecraft streamer. 

this brings me to the main point of my thesis. I think there should be some societal or economic mechanism that allows me to live comfortably in my home, eat everyday, drink clean drinking water, and achieve creative fulfillment while only playing Minecraft. The Marxist Magnum opus dos Capital states that the bourgeoisie will naturally absorb all surplus value that labor creates. I believe I am in this situation right now, as I am in a crappy work from home job where I play Minecraft pretty much 8 hours a day while doing very little and still making a salary. 

this setup is as close to a platonic ideal as I could possibly imagine, but it is still crushingly oppressive and deeply depressing that I have to check into work every day and make sure I appear online on Microsoft teams for at least 8 hours. I should be able to set my own hours playing Minecraft, whether it is 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. or 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. I naturally have a non-cyclical sleep schedule that requires I wake up very late in the day and go to bed very early in the morning. The 9:00 to 5:00 work schedule most employers mandate means I am unfortunately unable to participate due to ableist conditions and have to find third shift jobs to participate in. 

this has not been an issue for most of my adult life, but recently, with a lot of jobs in my profession going back to in office positions from WFH remote roles, I have found myself struggling to find gainful employment where I am allowed to play Minecraft for 8 hours a day during my shift and do very little work in my company overall. I'm feeling very stressed out, nervous, anxious, and sometimes even like on a living myself because I am so terrified of what will happen if I am unable to both play Minecraft during the day and pay my rent at the same time. this is led me to do a lot of thinking recently and come up with this thesis. I hope you all like it, because in all likelihood it is my Magnum opus. 

please let me know if you have any notes or any thoughts on how I could improve this thought or idea. thank you very much comrades."

He recently accepted an offer that is higher in position and pay and is also closer to our home cutting his commute by hours.

Don‚Äôt worry the anti is coming. He put in his notice yesterday, his last day was supposed to be the 28th. HR informed him today that they were moving his last day to the 23rd. Because the 27th and the Friday before are PTO days and they don‚Äôt feel like paying. (The company has every other Friday off and the 23rd happens to be one.)

He responded asking for the policy that allowed the company to deny this PTO and they provided a PTO policy that absolutely did not support this. It stated that a supervisor could deny PTO if enough notice was not given, if it was a clear issue for the team, or if the employee was not in active status. 

His supervisor has no problem with his last date, no one on the team will have an issue because everyone will also be out of the office, and he is absolutely still an active employee until he walks out for the final time. and when he asked for a policy that did state PTO could he denied for any other reason they refused to provide it. Which is super illegal. 

I‚Äôm all fired up to have him pursue this and he is leaning towards letting it go for a few very valid reasons. But man am I steaming. 
The pay for those days aren‚Äôt even drops in the bucket that this company makes and spends. But for our family it will mean an unexpected financial loss that will be felt.

Nobody pays me any attention so I just coast. I don't see the need to bust my ass for nothing.

I recently got back from vacation and apparently forgot to put a day on the calendar that I wouldn't be in. I was not believed when I gave the honest answer of I forgot.

 Now, I come back from a long weekend sick and needed to take a couple of days off. Now there's another meeting between me, my manager, his manager, and HR tomorrow. Thankfully I have a note from the doctor I saw.

I genuinely feel uncomfortable and unwelcome at my job now where everything I do isn't trusted nor believed. I'm looking for other options already. My fear is that I'll be offered a pip or to just quit. My hope is that I'm offered a severance but I have no idea if my company does this. Needless to say, I'm stressed, frustrated, and hurt. 

I've made mistakes but I've always tried to correct them and be a good worker. It's not my fault that I've had some medical issues recently that have made things difficult for me. They're aware of this and it seemed like it wasn't being held against me but that feels like it was a lie. I really can't wait to leave this job. I love my coworkers but I can't stand management.

Has anyone else ever experienced something like this? Am I actually just a bad worker or something? I try my best and sometimes things go wrong. I do my best to fix them when they do. My coworkers like me, it just feels like the one above me does not like me."

I started a new job 6 months ago and I‚Äôm trying to gauge how productive I should be. I‚Äôve realized that in past jobs, I worked hard, I excelled, and my supervisors then expected me to keep up with that standard. I do enjoy the work I‚Äôm doing currently and feel appreciated, although my pay is low. I also know I‚Äôm already being miles more productive than the person who was last in my role. 

So. How hard should I be working? How productive should I be? How do I gauge what‚Äôs average and then stick to that? "

We craft dancing attire for people who can afford $2,000-4,000 dresses and churn out around 10-15 per week, depending on the season. This doesn‚Äôt include the sales of our large back stock of dresses.

My job is very physical (I‚Äôm often sore and overworking muscle groups to the point of mild injury) and has no benefits. No dental, medical, and no PTO unless you count sick leave.

I understand that many jobs paying more than this might require a degree, which I do not have. The expense of a degree/taking on student loan debt hasn‚Äôt been feasible for me, so I‚Äôve done my best to find steady work without that. This is the highest paying job I‚Äôve had, ever, and I don‚Äôt know what to do to secure something better. My goal was to be a homemaker, but instead I‚Äôve found myself here.

Money has always bothered me. It‚Äôs a fundamental part of society and I‚Äôve accepted that as best as I can, but every day I wake up and it feels awful to participate in a ritual that feels like I‚Äôm throwing away my precious time for income that won‚Äôt even allow me to rent an apartment on my own. I‚Äôve resorted to taking on a side hustle (sewing and decorating MORE dresses after work) to make ends meet after what NJ taxes take out of my paycheck.

My managers seem to always be busy while my coworkers seem bothered whenever I ask them questions about the job I just started. My manager is even telling me that my work isn‚Äôt at the standard that they wish even tho I received barely any advices/coaching.

How do you guys deal with a toxic workplace?

She has treated me like I‚Äôm incompetent and today I just broke down on a call. 


She completely put me on blast after just getting back from being out of office for a week and a half, both of our supervisors were on the call and she tried to humiliate me by saying I haven‚Äôt provided her any updates in the past six weeks.

Had a job at a car salesman place. The people who worked there were not very nice people and during the interview the boss made a joke about how I 'won't be affording a mansion' on the pay they're offering. I laughed and hoped he meant above minimum wage but alarm bells were already ringing. I was desperate for the job so I took it. I had to ask what the pay was a couple of days before and the manager texted me back '23.23 AUD' which I've never seen in Melbourne. Generally it seems like the lowest is 25 AUD and for cleaning the pay is usually at least 28 AUD.

Had to wipe cars and clean this filthy car place that they couldn't be bothered to clean themselves. I called in sick on Friday having worked Mon - Thurs. They fired me straight away which I don't really have an issue with as calling in sick on the first week isn't great.

However, I just received the pay and they've not bothered to take my details down correctly when I was first employed so I've been taxed 32.5% on a minimum wage job which is a joke. I should have been taxed 15% as per working holiday rules. I'll probably be able to get the money back but possibly not til the end of the year and it's a big hassle.

I did my job well throughout and turned up on time.

Below is the email chain I've had since I left. The boss sent the last email. Anyone got any advice on what to do next? Apparently I should count myself lucky that they paid min wage lol

I spent from nov of 06 till june 0f 2018 with a government agency just hit a wall and needed to take a break. spent the better part of 3.5 years floating from one shitty job to the next mostly retail or quick jobs couldn't really find something I wanted to do (granted I quit a lot of those jobs after a cup of coffee ) Could of been burn out, could of been being tired of getting hired for a job that needed 20 people to run and it was me the new guy and 4 other people, honestly probably it was my BS meter was on full and I just don't want to put up with that amount of BS so I would leave.

Now after 3.5 years I decided to go back to the agency job and found out that nothing changed and honestly gave it a good 2 years and decided that I just had enough. Now that I am looking for serious work again I find companies are just not interested in me. Today I got done with a psych exam for a state agency everything seemed ok till we got to the part where I needed to go through my work history.

The person grilled me like i was some sort of ex con that had a wrap sheet a mile long so why did you quit so and so. I answered truthfully as I could but got the feeling that I am now out of the running for this current job offering. The thing that pisses me off the most is that I was honest with the interviewers and they seemed not bothered with my work history but now that this Psych exam took place . I just don't know yes I did it to myself but does it really matter that someone quit some give me jobs in the grand scheme of things? Especially when at any given time a job can let you go for any number of reasons and working in a state that allows you and the company to part ways for any reason I just don't get it."

Work is work. But humans have worked for thousands, upon thousands of years. I won't say that people have always been happy either, but there was purpose in that hard labor, you had to work the farm to live.

We work to live now, but what is the greater purpose? If you were a farmer, or hunter a long time ago, there was a reason to work, but also a greater purpose. Your tribe benefited from your work, it wasn't just you getting to eat, to wear clothes, to live another day. It was that small group of people you loved, you depended on, and who depended on you.

Now let's look at the modern era. It doesn't matter if you are a blue collar, white collar, or government worker of whatever stripe. Your work does nothing to affect anyone you care about, you work only to pay -your- bills, to keep -your- roof over -your- head. It's been like this for a long time, and the discontent tends to shift depending on what is going on in a given country.

Some people love their jobs because they are, in fact, doing good in the world. This tends to be restricted to various sciences as far as I know, whether it's marine biology, medicine, or astronomy. But these are niche markets, you can't just become any of these. In fact many people later in life wish they could have entered a field like that, but it might be too late, for whatever reason. I've heard it before, read it before, people really want to affect their ""tribe"" in a positive way.

But no matter where you live, with a few exceptions, there is no actual ""tribe."" People rage at each other, they argue, they see you as ""other"", you see them as ""other"", within the same country, certainly all over the world. You are taught to see other people as different in the workplace, because someone got a raise, and they are held as an ""example"". I am sure a -lot- of other examples of division in the workplace can be provided, but this post is too long already.

We are divided, we have no purpose, we slave away so that rich people can get richer. We are not helping our communities when we go to work, the stagnation, even degradation, and decay continues. When we punch in for work, our entire day goes to making some rich fuck on a yacht more rich, while the people we care about around us do not directly benefit, other than what little money you bring home.

I say this as a blue collar worker, I know some people are better off, but it's not much different unless you are some high level executive, or CEO, or even better yet some primary shareholder who has invested millions. Nothing we do actually helps our communities. Why should we care about our jobs? We are stuck in survival mode, personal survival mode, and not because we want to be."

After years of being over stretched and complaining to management that I needed more resources to adequately do my job I finally built a team to do all the busy work and handle most of the day to day comms so I could focus on the high level stuff with clients and work on process and strategy that had been neglected. After just a couple months of having a functional team in place they were all laid off, including my boss, and I was basically expected to do all the work myself. The administrative team that supported my team also got laid off and a few months later our entire marketing team for our division also got laid off. 

I just stopped working, if someone from management asked why numbers were down or why people hadn't heard back from me I'd say oh I'm really understaffed since the layoffs and I can't keep up and they'd say something about how they're going to do something to fix it and then never get back to me. I don't even check my email anymore. I think I was supposed to go to a conference a couple weeks ago but I skipped all the meetings about it and nobody has called me out on it. My coworkers at my level are all aware and are mostly jealous, they all have more allegiance to me than the company after how we've all been treated.

My new boss is an idiot, I think he knows I'm not actually working but he's not willing to confront me. I got my annual bonus and two quarterly ""performance"" bonuses since I stopped working as well as a promotion. My raise and compensation restructuring hasn't been processed by HR yet but I keep hassling my boss about it and I'm planning on complaining that it isn't big enough, everyone in my branch of the company is super underpaid and they withhold promotions so people won't think they're valuable enough to move on. 

I've recovered from super burnout and I think I'm ready for a meaningful job again but why quit this one. I'm hoping I'll just get laid off and get a bunch of severance to go along with it. This has been one of the most relaxing and enjoyable periods of my life. If you ever get the chance to just stop working I highly recommend it."

Have moved around and worked my way up as a specialist in an awesome job. The work environment itself is toxic, with people leaving left right and centre. But my particular role is quite awesome and comfortable. Being a specialist no one really knows what I do for work, so as long as I meet my deadlines, no one really bothers me.

  
Over the last couple of years, I have been feeling a bit of a burn out and wanting to take a 6 month sabbatical. I started talking to my manager about it a year ago, and back then they were very supportive. But more recently, there have been some restructures and hire freezes in the company. The timing is not great, but because of these reasons they have basically said a blanket ""no"" to my request. 

 

I have been saving for the break for quite a while, and was planning on a thru hike. Should I just quit? The other conundrum I have in my mind is knowing there are not a lot of people that can do my specific job, and part of me just wants to ""quiet quit"" over the next few months and then resign when the time is right. I do feel guilty being in such a lucky position, especially in the current economy, but for me after giving this place more than a decade of my life, I do feel a little betrayed. "

4,2024-05-16,Technical support woes,u/EskimoB9,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cta965/technical_support_woes/,antiwork,"Tl:Dr: So I started a new job last week. Tech support t1 for ‚Ç¨35k in Ireland. So I recently quit said job because it wasn't what was said it was going to be. Got sick for the second week and quit today. 

Also on mobile so format may be shit, don't care. Any spelling mistakes are my own, and I own that. Also please don't share this on any other platform. 

Storytime: 

So some background I applied for t2 for an ecommerce company (think shopify but not shopify) back at the end of January, which was perfect, when my department was closing at the start of January. Was advised that the job was 70% emails, 20% live chat, 10% IBC and obcs. Which as someone who hasn't done calls really in 6 maybe more years, sounded perfect, mostly emails and live chat are my jam. Can do that work for days because I hit my targets mid week and just close out cases for my last 2 days in the week. 

So interaction with the recruiter was brilliant, and told me all the things I wanted to hear. Start time anywhere between 6 and 9 am. Latest I would be in would be 6pm (which is perfect so I can get dinner done before the missus gets home), I would be t2, writing scripts and fixing issues not a problem. Some weekend work was advised but not often (once a month for 1 day type of thing). 

The 1st round interview was the general, where you worked, what you expected from the role, and all that. Grand out, was over prepared, so that's always good. Finished the interview and seems all good. 

Assessment was to design a store (that was easy but their ui is a bit stupid) and submit before the end date. Got the store done easy, got someone else to review and double check it. 

No word for about 2 months. Got an email in March saying they are looking for an April start date if they have the head count for t2. 

the 2nd round was at the end of March, 2 weeks before the start date originally provided. Aced the interview, no issues, got good background in cxc and tech sup over 12 years. 

Was told in the interview it would be the end of the week as the start date is now May not April. The following day, the recruiter rings and says a good interview should be this week (a week earlier than the interviewers said) when a result will be announced. 

2 weeks goes by, no notice, emailed once to see if things are all OK, if there were any issues, if I could supply references. No word, no response, nothing, I started getting worried. 

1 week before the May start date (now 5 months living off my savings. now stressing about work) gets a call. Gets offered a job, but as t1 because they are hiring 3 t1s and a product service engineer instead of 1 t2 and a pse.

Accept an offer for 35k instead of 45k for t1. Less responsible and same hours and benefits they said. 

The training starts (elearning, just call it fucking learning, stop with putting e infront of everything) and it's 5 weeks of content condensed into 9 days (I would know, I trained a lot of people in my last team and knew the way to train others). 

Lots of learning is grand, but the big test was daunting, but the presentation for the store we were building through training was going to be done by the two local manager, 2 local tech leads, 2 UK tls and 2uk tech leads, and the 4 tech leads and 4 tls from texas along with the coo. I mean no. Pressure for 7 days of modules and barely any classroom training (1.30hrs a day). 

Was advised that 1 weekend a month is now 3 rotations of days, Tues-Sat, wed-Sunday, Thurs-Mon. Which is grand if you're into that lifestyle, but no, I want to spend time with my family, and partner. Also, instead of 6-9am start times, it's not 6-12am which means the latest I'll be in would be 10pm. 4 hours after my partner is finished work and also leaves 30 mins of interaction with her before she has to go to sleep for her 9-5.30.

First 3 months will be on a late shift because we will be nesting with a team over in the US, not in the EU. Which means we work their hours for 3 months on and 3 months off. 

Tuesday, I broke down during training, thinking how I was going to deal with it. And suddenly I remembered after 31 years on this earth, and 14 years of working (started working around 17) I didn't have to deal with this shit. 

Called into support, said I was sick, went home early (just logged off WFH) and sat down and called my doctor. Explained the situation, and was told to just leave, which was something I thought of during the weekend. So I quit. 

I quit their lies, I quit their culture and I quit making myself worried sick because they really lied to me during the 5 months of interviews and such. I realised that I am more than a job, and I can find something else. 

Remember folks, your mental health is not worth the money. You are not your job. And before I get asked, yes the missus is OK with me leaving, in fact encouraging me more so than anything. Yes I will get unemployment, but I will have to wait 6 weeks due to me leaving the job. And lastly I will send back their stuff because it will just take up space otherwise.

On the staff level, there‚Äôs little to no turnover. 

But in upper management (and less so middle management), there‚Äôs recently been significant turnover. And some of these C-suite executives are not getting replaced. Rather, their roles are being absorbed by other people in the C-suite or people in the parent company C-suite. Or their tasks are being outsourced to consultants. 

For example, in the past year we‚Äôve lost one CIO (his responsibilities were absorbed by the CFO), COO, CTO, and CAO (Chief Accounting Officer). The Human Resources leader was also canned after we got a new CEO two summers ago. 

Meanwhile, half the people who are VP-level are taking 3-6 months of extended vacations or parental leave. 

I‚Äôve never before been at a company where most of the turnover has happened in upper management. Is this normal? I find it easier for me but bad for my workflow (getting no training or direction and I feel my work is not valued because it was requested by some folks who no longer work here). "

> Walmart, which remains America‚Äôs largest employer despite Amazon‚Äôs rise to the status of world‚Äôs largest online seller, [announced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/14/walmart-layoffs-relocate-remote-jobs/) on May 14 that it will let go hundreds of its corporate staff and require the majority of those of its 1.6 million employees working remotely to return to the office, some four years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

> ... Nevertheless, no one should imagine that Walmart is tightening its belt out of being faced with lean times.  As an ‚Äúessential business,‚Äù no one fared better under the lockdowns than Walmart, whose net sales, for instance, [grew](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2020/05/19/walmart-revenue-up-86-e-commerce-up-74/?sh=198e025566cc) by 10.5 percent in the first quarter of the pandemic in 2020, its e-commerce sales skyrocketing by 74 percent. The overall retail market, by comparison, declined by nearly 3 percent in that period. Walmart, in fact, was the [only](https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/how-walmart-beat-amazon-during-the-supply-chain-crisis-of-covid-19/) retailer with net income growth during the first quarter of 2o2o.

> Its new personnel decision means that most Walmart employees in Dallas, Atlanta, and even Toronto will be required to relocate to Bentonville, Arkansas, the firm‚Äôs birthplace and headquarters, where a 350-acre complex is being constructed featuring a child care center, a hotel, a 360,000-square-foot health center and gym, a dining hall, and a 37-mile walking-and-biking trail.

> But some 82 percent of American workers [said](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics) during the lockdowns that after the pandemic they wanted to work remotely at least once a week, preferably half the time, while only 8 percent didn‚Äôt wish to work at home frequently; 19 percent wanted to work at home all the time, according to a survey of 1,100 by the Global Workplace Analytics consulting firm.

> Further findings show that if not permitted to work from home after the pandemic, 54 percent would remain with that employer but would be less willing to ‚Äúwalk the extra mile,‚Äù while 46 percent would seek another job, according to a 2020 survey by Massachusetts-based videoconferencing firm Owl Labs. In 2016, Gallup found that 35 percent of employees would be willing to change jobs in order to work from home full time, 37 percent if it was to work remotely some of the time. Owl Labs found in 2019 that more than a third of workers would take a pay cut of 5 percent to work from home some of the time while a quarter would take a 10 percent pay cut and 20 percent of employees would take an even bigger reduction in salary. **Employers oftentimes may only be hurting themselves by denying their employees‚Äô strong, justifiable preference to work remotely.**

The shops lights are on but the door is locked and there's an apologetic letter taped to the door. The kiosks are all closed and the restaurants all have crowds gathering around the hosting area. What's happening?

Think of it this way, 5 kiosks, 10 shops and 10 restaurants employ about 75 people. Let's say the average wages (including tips for the relevant jobs) is $25 an hour for those jobs. An average weekend night starts gearing up around 5pm and ramps down around 10pm. So $25/hr x 75 people x 5 hours = $9,375. Let's say $10,000 for easier calculation.

If we assume for any one of these areas about half the employees would be willing to call in sick at the last minute and a night off that means for the price of about $10,000 and a little bit of planning there's a good chance of creating a work stoppage in a high traffic area.

That's a kickstarter fund I would support."

I have a very stressful corporate job, where I essentially make the job of two people. It has been impossible for me to meet with the expectations in the long run, and based on the job market/indeed, I am very very underpaid. The only reason I was bearing the job is that it is my first job out of college, and was already considering looking for something else as I now have two solid years of experience at what I do. So given the fact that I will probably get fired, should be a good thing, but it was not the ideal timing. I wanted to job hunt and eventually leave in the long run, while keeping my current  job, instead of being forced to get a job asap as I have a family that depends on me. I have been stressing out about this... but I do have a couple of side hustles and now with unemployment insurance we should be okay until I find something else. So... today, tired of it all, just really wanted to take the day off and spend some time with my family. Maybe we will go to the park or the beach. 

Any experience or advise on being unemployed will definetely help!

Hell I couldn‚Äôt even take much time off when my son was born. So yesterday my manager from the agency reached out to me bitching about me calling out stating that ‚ÄúI call out more than anyone in the agency.‚Äù One I call bs, because I barely call out. Maybe one or twice a month. Two, even if that were the case, I have a newborn at home, sicknesses going around, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety so it‚Äôs hard for me to even get out of bed some days.

2,2024-05-16,"Should I feel guilty going on short-term disability (possibly quitting after) when the manager has caused me extreme stress and anxiety?
",u/fudgexo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ctgkb6/should_i_feel_guilty_going_on_shortterm/,antiwork,"Long story short, back in January/February I caught Covid/flu and even though I recovered, I was still feeling really fatigue. Multiple doctors and specialist cannot figure out why, however, cannot rule out that I was experience long covid symptoms. I had visit the hospital multiple times for feeling dizzy and strange stomach issue. I simply can't focus at work and had bad headaches once I look at a screen. I even had issues scrolling my phone. My job is to modify and create new legal contracts which means a lot of detail is required. My manager was aware of the situation. My quality rate and utilization rate had gone down. This manager is known to be lazy, favoritism, only reach out announcing bad news, and gives hardworking people a hard time with no appreciation. He also keeps employees with very bad work ethics who don't just don't care about their jobs, but also doing things to cause legal impact. He doesn't care about employees birthdays or anniversary dates and even though people complain, he still doesn't change.

In March (a day before my vacation), my manager had a one on one with me about my quality of work and utilization rate in February with a unfriendly attitude. He also has an expectation that we complete things way BEFORE deadlines. **I had been completing things 1-2 days before the deadline and it wasn't good enough**. I acknowledge the errors was a fair say, however, I don't think having an expectations to complete things WAY before the target date was fair. Even though my utilization rate has gone down, I had been **working overtime** to get things done because of my health issues I was slower than normal. It seemed like he was bothered that I was acting calm during our conversation. Then he finally added, ""**I will take away one of your work privilege if I don't see improvement"".** He then sent me a formal e-mail with all the above including to provoke a work privilege of mine if I don't improve. A day before my vacation, I was extremely stressed out making sure everything was in good order. I was pretty pissed off and my vacation was pretty much ruined worrying about my job security. 



When I came back, **I improved** with both quality rate and utilization rate and meeting the average among everyone. Apparently it was not enough and the manager was **still not happy about it and explained I was only doing mediocre.** He has been on my back and giving me extreme anxiety. I am terrified of having any errors on my work and I had been completing things 2 weeks before the due date. I put in a lot of hard work and still wasn't enough. This actually began to caused me to make more errors due to extreme stress and panic when doing the work. We have daily briefing meetings and he accused me of skipping them because I took a day off. The day I came back to work (after my day off), he sent me a message without greetings and straight asking me why I'm skipping the meetings. When I advised that I had a day off which was approved by the team lead, he responded **""huh? I don't get it?!?!?!?"".** I actually broke down in tears after that message because he was accusing me of things I didn't do. We also have meetings every month where I have to talk about all the errors I made and explain why I made the errors in front of everyone which caused me extreme anxiety. The night before that meeting I can't fall asleep at night and wake up 2 hours before my alarm goes off. 

I am not lazy and I am hardworking. The funny thing is the team lead agreed some things were not fair especially the formula to calculate utilization rate is extremely flawed and inaccurate. I was actually told even though we had been working overtime, it only shows that we are only at 35% capacity. When the manager was on vacation, we all had a meeting about the inaccuracy of that thing and how the manager refused to change it. Upper management doesn't even know any of this. 

I am in huge stress, breaking down in tears, and had caused me stomach issues, anxiety, can't sleep well, and even on weekends I'm scared on Monday the manager would find things to accuse me. Work quality has also being going down. 

I talked to a doctor and based on the analysis, I was suggested go on a stress leave and applications are filled.

My best friend wants to open a small business and asking me if I want to go on board with him. I am thinking to on a stress leave (which I still get 80% of my weekly salary) and quit when the business is running.

Went to the doctor and got a note with restrictions and an accomodation. Not allowed to lift over 20 pounds, no overtime, chair provided to work from seated position. Received these because of family medical history. 

When I first found out I knew I was going to have limitations due to family medical history. I told my employer the day I found out. A week later I was placed in a position with more physical duties and heavier lifting for the day. I told my boss I did not feel comfortable doing heavy work while pregnant due to medical history and explained a little further. I was told I needed a doctors note to confirm before they could do anything and to just ""take it easy"". The rest of the week i was incredibly exhausted and my body hurt from head to toe. Anyone who's been pregnant before knows it takes a while to get that first doctors appointment so i had a few weeks left until i could get a note. 

I finally had my appointment yesterday and my doctor gave me a note for accomodations. I requested for a chair to sit when im having cramps or when im starting to feel light headed. When I returned to work with my note they told me that I had to clock out and leave because I cannot work until I get a ""Fitted for duty"" form filled out by my doctor and my accomodations go to their ""board"" and they can see if they can do it or not. No other pregnant woman in the building has had this happen to them. I know that they denied a chair before or made it difficult to get their accommodations but they put me on unpaid leave until i get that paper filled out, despite my doctors note. They have plenty of other jobs in the warehouse as well like returns, where no boxes are heavier than 15 pounds, and VAS which is just rebagging and security tagging, etc. Plenty of work I can do but they sent me home and told me I cant come back without being approved by their board. They then told me that if I am not approved I would have to go on short term disability,
 use up all of my fmla and then once thats exhausted I ""wont have a job"". I have been reading up on the pregnancy fairness act so I know my rights and in all honesty it sounds pretty illegal what they have been putting me though. now I have to struggle to get money to pay rent and afford food while they keep me on unpaid leave. Could anyone help me figure out what I should do or if I should file a charge with the EEOC? Also, if I were to file a charge with them does anyone know what will happen and if I could get compensated for the time they forced me to leave and possibly emotional distress? thank you!!"

Fast forward nearly a week after my leave of absence.... I had just gotten done grocery shopping for my parents and I was in my car leaving... when I saw the store manager of the place I work at.

He wasn't grocery shopping, he had nothing in his hands... and it seemed too much of a ""coincidence"" he'd run into me twice.

I can't move. I feel numb. I feel like what's the point of work? If I make it thru to my retirement plan I get to retire at 65 years old, which already sucks. I don't even want to make it to 60 bc that's when I think all the health problems set in hard. I think in my 60s I'll probably be trying to beat some serious health problem; cancer or something disabling. So I'll have to keep working to keep my stupid health insurance, bc I can't afford it anywhere besides work, so I'll have to keep working while I'm sick and hopefully I can retire by 62 and if I'm not disabled or I'll or broken, then maybe I can finally enjoy life. Travel, take time for myself. It feels so pointless. I don't want to do all that in my 60s I want to do it now. I feel like I would happily trade these years for working mindlessly in my 50s and 60s. 

This all just sucks. I can't believe that man JUST retired and now he's gone. He didn't even get to enjoy it. I feel so bleak about everything. Glued to my couch today. :("

Not sure what I will do to survive but I don't see any light at the end of this tunnel. I lost my job in December last year and I haven't found anything worth while since. I know I screwed up by actually caring about the company I worked for and speaking up when I saw things going downhill. Maybe my approach was off but I didn't do or say anything that others above me weren't saying but I'm the one they fire. So I've been looking since then and either I don't get any callbacks or they only want to pay $12 an hour. I took a job on a landscaping crew and damn near killed my knees for $14 an hour and no benefits! I'm almost 50, I couldn't cut it. One slip and fall and I'd be oweing money instead of making it. There is no industry here besides the steel mill and who wants to start that at 50. Yet they're gonna build a billion dollar high rise nobody that works here can afford to live in. I'm just at my wits end, I don't have the vocabulary to express how fucked up my mind is right now. I know I need a therapist but without insurance or an income pickins are slim. I have prescriptions I NEED and doctors I NEED and paying out of pocket is ridiculous but I'm doing it thanks to the last bit of my 401k. My wife is supporting us at the same company that fired me and that doesn't exactly make for fun conversation. I'm thinking of just swallowing my pride and asking for my job back. It sucks but I had it made there if I could have just learned not to care. I don't know if this is a rant or if I want advise, I just had to get this off my chest.

Despite me being a top runner in the company and always volunteering to come in early and stay late. (Because I like the extra pay not because I care about the company) They dislike the fact that I stand up for myself and my coworkers when we are treated unfairly. In one instance they made policy changes without informing us and then when we inevitably are upset why we're not getting the perks we had before I talked to them and they couldn't explain why we were no longer getting those perks and instead they told us to refer to the policy. The policy that says it had been altered a few months prior. Another time my coworker was getting punished for not taking breaks so they could a higher bonus on their check since productivity is paid out. I brought up the wording in the policy how it said ""may take"" for breaks and ""must take"" for lunches. That was shut down by saying policy is up to ""manager discretion"" and verbal policy holds the same weight as written ones. 

Since those incidents I've kept a pretty low profile but have had a target on my back. When I applied for a supervisor position they said one of the reasons I didn't get it is because I was too combative. I figured I would never move up in the company since the reasons for not getting the job became personal not professional. So I just continued as normal working late if needed and being their go to for little things. I drive heavy machinery, something that I'm one of the few people who seem to realize is dangerous to be around. And I take extra care to be hyper aware of who I'm around when I drive. But I'm also well aware of my experience so I drive at top speed when it is safe to do so. Something that is only now an issue. 

So to the issue at hand. They put up an arbitrary stop sign at a choke point / blind spot which sees a lot of traffic both on foot and on equipment. This was about a year ago. It has caused the area to be more dangerous than before because now people on foot do not watch out for heavy equipment and expect them to keep them safe. Nobody bothers treating it like a road stop sign, management included. People often do a rolling stop to see if anyone's around and go about their way. If it's apparent nobody is around then sometimes people will just go through. Management sees this first hand and never enforces it. Yesterday someone saw me and another person drive through and complained. They brought me into the office and basically tried to get me to admit to something but I had no idea what they were talking about. After that they finally said it was about the stop sign. They said it was an issue and I brought up what I stated above. They did not like that and took me off equipment for the day. 

The next day I came in and they immediately took me into the office. Right off the bat they were aggressive. Bringing up what if scenarios to say I could've hurt someone, and making personal jabs saying I'm not ""that good"" at driving my equipment. Despite being in zero accidents in the last 2 years and some people being in at least one accident every few months. They also tried to make claims about me not having ""remorse"" for the hypothetical person who could have been hit. Acting as if the reason I drove through wasn't because nobody was there, but that it was an act of God nobody was hurt.  They put me on ""administrative leave"" pending ""investigation"". And that I would be escorted out of the building and can't return until I'm told otherwise. They asked me if I had any questions and they refused to answer any of them. Such as, 1. ""What exactly are you investigating?"" Since I at no time did I deny drivjng through and the video footage was already seen of it happening. 2. ""Why am I being singled out despite other people doing this?"" Which they said I wouldn't know if I was being signed out or not as if it isn't obvious since I'm in trouble and nobody else is or has been. And 3. ""Can I go talk to my HR representative and why wasn't an HR representative here in the first place?"" Which was extra suspicious because they said no I can't go talk them. And that if I want to be difficult we can do this the hard way. Overall a bad interaction despite me remaining professional the whole time. I've seen other people go on ""leave"" 90% of the time they never come back. 

So TLDR, my job of 3 years is putting me on ""administrative leave"" over a minor infraction that everyone does. Because I don't take their BS. In my company ""administrative leave"" rarely means you come back. "

I started at a new job back in January, and when my offer was made, my recruiter told me it would be a hybrid position. Additionally, someone who started a few before I did, also was told the same thing. Flash forward a few weeks after we have been through the initial phase of training and ramp up. I asked my boss when would our hybrid days and schedule begin, and he was ‚Äúputting together a team schedule‚Äù. Fine. 

A few weeks after that, we received a calendar with one WFH day every other week, which IMO, is clearly not hybrid. He mentioned once we have a little more headcount, this would move to once a week. Still, annoyed but okay. A few days after that, he tells us in our weekly team meeting, that he will be leaving at 1pm on Monday/Wednesday every week so he can WFH, to be on time for his sons‚Äô baseball practices. Now, if you‚Äôve read this far, he is getting one WFH day a week, with the team still at two days once a month.

Flash forward to today. My coworker who started before me, resigned last week, and her WFH day were on Fridays. I asked to be moved to that day (since I am next in seniority) and was told no. My boss is now additionally adding Fridays to his WFH days, giving him two full days of working at home per week, while we are stuck at two a month.

I am livid. I negotiated my salary to align with the idea of being hybrid, now I am working and covering more job duties, in addition to this guy getting to work from home twice a week while we are lucky to get two days a month at home.

What would you do?"

We have no air conditioning and only half the fans work and now I find out we can't even dress to relieve ourselves from over exhaustion from extreme heat exposure. Anyway with all that being said I can't help but feel this entire dress code is just directed towards the female staff. Even though they say ""everyone"" we all know what they mean is women. I'm just flabbergasted because I have worked for a lot of places and never once have been told I can't wear a tank top when it's over 90¬∞ and it ain't even full summer yet. Some days it pushes over 100 easily. Idk I think I might ghost this job üòÖ "

I wish this was taken more seriously in the eyes of the government, I've never been so depressed in my life and really don't know what to do or even what the point of this post is.

  
I guess if anyone has any recommendations or experience with working with and around epilepsy I'd be happy to hear your story for motivation and or comfort.

As I was employed at the time I actually disclosed ahead time what they would find because I wasn‚Äôt going to waste theirs and my time if it was going to be an issue. I was told it wasn‚Äôt going to be an issue if it was what I said it was so I decided to move forward with the process.

On April 18, I got the call from the HR that the background check had cleared and I was good to go starting May 2. HR told me that I had actually given them more info than was in the background check. At that point I gave my notice to my current employer who were very gracious and happy for me. 

On the first day I discovered that the president of the company and I had a history and so I talked to HR about it and told her if it is going to be an issue tell me and I‚Äôm sure my old job would take me back.  I was told it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem and that I had already been vetted by their attorney. She also told me that only 3 people knew what was on the background check: her, my supervisor, and the general manager. On May 10th, I expressed the same concerns to my supervisor regarding when the president would see me and was told I was thinking more into it than necessary. 

Today (5/16) the president saw me and by lunch I was put on paid administrative leave with a letter saying they were thinking about firing me because of the background check.  I live in California so I know there was some rights under the Fair Chance Act as my job and my issue do not conflict.

1,2024-05-16,The problem with the data pointing to 'retirement leads to worsening health outcomes',u/3RADICATE_THEM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ctpgo6/the_problem_with_the_data_pointing_to_retirement/,antiwork,"Tl;dr: correlation != causation

Here's my theory:

surface level analysis of data says retirement is bad for health, but it doesn't address situations like the following.

Take Boomer Bob. Boomer Bob began working full-time at 20 years old as a manual laborer. Objectively, he had very high purchasing power for his skillset compared to people his age today. However, work is still work, and he comes home exhausted and demoralized everyday. As a result, over the decades, he developed alcoholic tendencies to cope with the psychological distress from work in addition to working even heavier hours down the road to provide for a family relying on his sole income.

Due to Bob becoming an absent father and husband, he experiences a divorce and a distanced relationship with his kids.

Eventually, his pension finally kicks in, he gets the rolex watch, and he never has to work another day in his life‚Äîbut he kept one thing from work that he couldn't let go of‚Äîhis alcoholism.

As Bob goes into retirement, he spends more and more time with alcohol as he never developed any other hobbies in his life while also essentially losing his family due to work draining all of his attention, energy, and the best hours of the day just to get by.

Bob eventually dies‚Äîalone in his home‚Äî16 months into retirement from alcohol poisoning.

What does 'science' conclude? 'Retirement is bad for your health', but clearly the situation is much more nuanced than this. Work limited his alcohol exposure, but it also was a root cause in him developing alcoholism in the first place. So, did alcohol kill Bob or did work kill Bob?

I just had my one year anniversary with this bullshit company on 05/15/2024.

I went above and beyond as an employee for these soulless morons. The day after I started working there, they fired one of my three team members. 

About two months later, they fired the other employee on my team, leaving just me and the team supervisor. The Team supervisor was a real one and kept everything üíØ with me all the time. He even purchased me a second monitor when I was just working out of a single, second-hand, broke-ass laptop. Just because he thought I was a good person and he wanted to see me succeed. That shit brought a tear to my eye when it happened. Anyway, no more than two weeks after they axe the second team member, the supervisor jumps into a meeting with me, (we worked there remotely), and he tells me that the manager just busted him down from Supervisor, to a regular CSM like I was. This man used to own his own tech company‚Ä¶and they decided to bust him down in rank and promoted  some know-nothing serial f-up who had ZERO management skills to oversee our team. Well that Supervisor said f-it and quit the very next day. 

Then it came down to me and this new manager who comprised the entire team. I was breaking my back to work with their entire client base and manage all of their accounts, single-handedly. All the while, she was trying to implement new policies and procedures, leaving me with a laundry list of chores to do, on top of this insane workload. 

I soldier up and stand tall through the chaos. (like an idiot). I helped to implement new procedures, codify our CRM labeling structure for accounts, helped to onboard countless new clients and facilitate renewals, onboarded two new teammates, one of whom they randomly promoted to supervisor of the team.

Anyway, long story short, they canned me one day after my year anniversary at the company, due to ‚Äúinternal restructuring ‚Äú. All of my clients loved me and I was f-ing killing it at that job. 

Morale of the story is F**K THESE CORPORATIONS!! No matter how hard you work or how good you are at your job, you are expendable and they will fire you for no reason at all. THEY ONLY DESERVE THE BARE MINIMUM FROM ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE! Don‚Äôt give them an ounce more than that!"

Yesterday I quit my toxic draining job. Its a small pet sitting business with less than 15 employees. I worked as a client relations manager but also did events, marketing, advertising, and was sent out in the field to cover for staff. She refused to pay me more than 15 hours per week doing admin work, but frequently reprimanded me for not being available and on call during their working hours from 8-6. I worked at this place for two years. She also gave me pushback when I had surgery and tried to make me work during my medical leave. I would frequently wake up to messages at 6 or 7am when I was off the clock to sceenshots of typos (""you said 'the' twice in this sentence) or how I misgendered a dog in a social media post before it went live or something. 

I frequently covered shifts when we were short-staffed, worked off the clock, and went out of my way to make her life easier. But every time, she would take advantage of my efforts, asking me to do more and more while pushing back when it came to paying me. Id give her an inch, she‚Äôd take a mile. We would often get into power struggles, and petty arguments over inconsequential issues. From the micromanaging and nitpicking, I felt taken advantage of. Yesterday, 30 minutes before a meeting that should have been an email, I reached my boiling point and decided to quit on the spot, and then immediately drove over to her place, which was 40 minutes away from me to drop off as much company property as I could. 

About an hour after dropping her shit off, she messages me pointing out things I missed and demanded they be returned by Monday. After events, my boss would often dump the decorations I went out and purchased for her for me to hang on to, so many of these are dollar store items from events we did months ago. I told her I was busy and would get them to her by next week. She then threatened legal action and told me I was stealing from the company. Work shirts, training gear, and similar items? Totally fair. But perishable items and $1.25 holiday garlands from events from 8 months ago? I find that outrageously petty. This person has over 500 clients, charges exorbitant rates, and pockets 65% of the cost for the services that the pet sitters provide. She often leaves for vacations during our peak seasons. She is by no means struggling, so this is clearly yet another power play she‚Äôs trying to pull with me. 

I‚Äôm going to drop her shit off a day earlier, and just reimburse her for the other items to get her the hell out of my way. I‚Äôm so tired."

One day we got audited (i believe, not sure exactly the circumstances but someone was coming by to report on taxes or something like that) and the owner told us to hide the tip jar. I never asked why and the only reason i could think of was for our benefit. When you get tips you can get taxed on them i believe and they were trying to save us from that which is my standing theory

However i don't trust companies and believe that everything that any company or business does is for the benefit of the people on top and if it benefits the workers then its just a byproduct of a business strategy that is meant to make more money. Is there any way that this action could be interpreted as a selfish act? Or was my boss actually looking out for us?"

We would gossip about our teachers and roast each others' driving skills while play Mario kart until we get called up for dinner.

Shaun Fein, the UAW Union President is planning to strike with other major unions in that year. ",u/StardustWithH20,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cttuvj/we_need_help_corporations_have_doomed_us_we_need/,antiwork,"Post about Shaun Fein, the UAW Union President! Post about the 2028 General Strike, everyone please let's get this ball rolling! These corporations have killed us cortisol(stress hormone) and have killed our next generations with microplastics and climate change. Their sociopathic lack of empathy, has somehow become the basis for modern life and has caused us to turn our backs on human experience and connection! They have taken our free will from us for every hour we spend at the abundant, destructive and meaningless jobs. 

We've let go of what it means to be human and to  experience. We have exchanged the invaluable, precious time we have for something that is fake and proven to cause greed and selfishness, the antithesis to human connection. 

Have someone you loved die? And do you need to mourn and heal from it? Not possible unless you pay for a therapist since no one has the time to feel your pain. There are no connections simply transactions

Prepare for the General Strike in 2028! MODS, and EVERYONE we need your support and consistency reminding one another to begin preparing to cause as much impact as possible for the General Strike in 2028.

We have all power and the justification to cause change! The corporation lobbying is evil and it shows in the impact it has had on our Earth and the impact on our health. We're all connected, one and the same, yet the rich think they're different. And they are, simply because we've allowed the made-up idea of money to dictate the way of life and suck the planet dry of life along with it. 

I must admit, I feel like an ant with how little strength I have for making an impact in providing the means for people to have their basic humanity returned to them from these rich devils. However, much of life reflects ourselves and we cam see that ants, when they work(healthy, altruistic work in this case) they can do amazing things. Let's help one another. Please. This can't be all that humans have limited life to.

I am a salaried employee that works with patients, typically seeing around 20-25 patients per week with predetermined appointments.

I am taking a Friday off. In the past, if someone takes a day off, they use PTO and the company can usually find a PRN employee to fill in.

In my scenario, there is no PRN employee available for the day I am taking off, meaning I have to reschedule all my patients on that Friday to days preceding that day. This means my Monday through Thursday will be longer ours and I will still be getting all the work done that I would if I were to work 5 instead of 4.

My question is, since I am still doing the same amount of work, why would I have to use a PTO day? Especially if in the past they have found people to cover my work load.

To add on to that, what stops me from not scheduling a day off and instead calling in sick. I would still use a PTO day but my work would not be rescheduled earlier in the week because it wasn‚Äôt a predetermined absence. 

Curious as to what others have experienced in similar situations. I‚Äôve tried googling it and am having trouble finding something similar to this situation. 

Luckily, I am close with my supervisor so I plan on asking them tomorrow in person. "
12,2024-05-16,TALK ABOUT YOUR PAY!!,u/SirThePot,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ctu5so/talk_about_your_pay/,antiwork,"So a coworker and I both passed an anniversary date at our job. I'm a year senior and he does some of my same duties. Shortly before our reviews with HR I showed him my paystub which also shows some extra stipend and reimbursement that he wasn't currently getting (but definitely should have!). I also helped him talk up his achievements and got a significant raise plus all the extra allowances. He ended up with a raise of almost 30% over all. And he totally deserved it. 

Of course IANAL but for most workers in the USA the right to talk about your pay is protected under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The state I live in also has penalties for employers who try to prevent/retaliate against employees for discussing pay. It's also a single-party consent state just in case of such an issue.

I saw the company for what it was, something that had potential, and room for growth, however needed work.

I recommended two things to improve at the company, a risk register, and improved ticketing systems.
This company has been around for 25 years, however they have never really had someone come in, have a look and see improvements.

I got called into the Bosses office today and layed off, with the reasoning that I tried to change the way the business worked and took over too quickly.

I was just trying to show enthusiasm and show initiative, putting things into place which should have been put into place years ago.
Feels like they are just complacent and happy to let the company rot."

Let me know if I‚Äôm being unreasonable as I could not be angrier. 

I have spent the last 4 years integrating myself in every system we have at work. I‚Äôve learned to modify, administer and work with every single one we use in anticipation of a role in reporting and system admin because it‚Äôs where my passion lies.

Meanwhile, my coworker has not raised a finger once to learn anything in the same time, which is fine because it‚Äôs not her job, but she never shows initiative to do anything other than her job tasks.

Alas, a gentleman is retiring and I brought up 6 months ago my interest in this role and everyone already comes to me for any fixes and issues and modification with our systems regardless, so this should be mine. I also basically manage my coworker and main client without a manager title but that‚Äôs another story.

So today in our meeting, my boss asks my COWORKER if she has system admin skills and experience because get this her HUSBAND works in IT and somehow there‚Äôs osmosis that she‚Äôs now an IT expert?? When I‚Äôve been working on it for 3 years, proven myself and my boss along everyone else in the org comes to me to fix and modify everything? When she‚Äôs never lifted 1 finger to learn ? How is her husband relevant?? And then she asks me to continue to make reports and send them a video showing them how I do it. Wtf?

And now she gets to do the work I wanted to do and I get to basically be tech support which I never even wanted to do because they‚Äôre dangling the carrot of me being the next director in the department when my boss retires in HR and they have to be mindful to keep me involved? While guess what it‚Äôs been years and they keep saying she‚Äôll retire in 5 years and it never happens. And I have no interest in tacking IT helper on my long list of work with no raise or promotion. 

So now my coworker gets to do the job I worked for years to learn for no reason and I‚Äôm incredibly offended about how somehow her husband working in IT is more relevant then the effort I‚Äôve put in for years .

I want to quit. Basically just a rant. Work sucks"

3,2024-05-16,"Let go because of ""non-compete""",u/Worldly-Ad-5196,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ctw2f9/let_go_because_of_noncompete/,antiwork,"Just got let go on the 14th from my restaurant job where I was a line cook.  (Full disclosure, I was only getting about 7-8 hours per week because they couldn't get business)  In my exit interview, they stated that the reason for seperation was at-will (I live in a state where that is fine) but the issue that I'm having a problem with is that I had no prior write ups with them.  I have had managers try and berate me or say somethings that are inappropriate to me, but also other employees; now this isn't the problem because we've shit talked each other, I was told that there were some employees that thought that the things I did or said weren't always ""appropriate"" (which they acknowledged they don't think that I was doing anything malicious and that they knew I was joking) and that whomever reported this also doesn't hate me or dislike me, they just wanted me to be more professional.  They also told me that the another reason for seperation was that I signed a ""non-compete"" agreement when I applied for a job.  I have personally never heard of a restaurant that had a non-compete and was already working my second job for about two months.  Since restaurants are competing with a lot of different places whether it be direct or indirect competitor I wasn't aware of any non-compete, and certainly don't recall signing anything in an employee handbook that they claimed I did.  It's interesting because while I had mentioned it multiple times that I was going to apply to other restaurants within a two to three block radius, noone said a thing.  It wasn't until the GM mentioned that non-compete in passing that I thought he was just ripping on me that I was even aware that one could possibly exist.    
After a simple phone call to HR earlier today, they stated that the ""reason for seperation"" states that it was ""at-will"" and there was nothing written stating any conduct related issue.  So I'll be applying for UI benefits I guess.  (Unemployment Insurance)

One of the last things that I was told by them in our conversation was that they were doing an ""overhaul"" of the kitchen because it's not where they want it to be and they are going to be letting (from what it sounded to be, pure speculation though) everyone in the kitchen go and start from scratch.  My theory is that their thinking that they pay their kitchen employees to much and need to fire everyone and when they do, start them at a lower pay.    That job isn't very difficult, but it's also a very popular bar.  This decision comes right on the heels of having to pay a worker's comp injury I encountered with a blade knicking myself good enough that I went to the hospital.  They don't rteally have any cut gloves which I don't think everywhere does, but it's safety equipment and not everyone is a pro there. Then to top it off, in the injury report they ACKNOWLEDGED that they didn't have any cut glove and this could have prevented the injury but then didn't do anything about it.  

Last thing that I'll say is that despite all of this, I really liked the other people that I worked with.  Our kitchen had great people that I liked coming to work with every day.  Now there was 3 other people that quit bringing us down to 5 and then now that I have left, there are 4 people in the kitchen, plus a kitchen manager.  Management told me that they're cutting back because they don't have hours to give.  

  
Now, after all of this is out there, to the best of my knowledge I don't think I've left anything out, but is there a problem here?  I'm thinking that there might be and I have issue with being fired and I'm more upset about it than I thought that I would be, but does anyone else think there might be foul play or am I just seeing this through a negative lense because I was fired?  For what it's worth, I was initially supposed to become a lead when I started and effectively be the assistant KM (told so by GM) and then turns out he was drunk and got fired, but for 9 weeks I was going above and beyond stating that I was in charge and other people treated me like it, but noone told me that it wasn't real.  So any difficult task I was undertaking because I was supposed to get paid more was something I would advocate for, I would send people home early to try and save labor, close by myself because others called off... to which even our regional KM acknowledged that I was a big reason for why our current KM was doing so well.  



TL;DR:  I got fired by GM who claimed I signed a ""Non-compete"" that was in the handbook that I was never made aware of until after I had started new job.

I‚Äôm working a 9-5 job but can‚Äôt afford food, have gone days without food, have been in food pantry‚Äôs and am about to be homeless. I told my boss this before I went on unpaid medical leave.

I had to take unpaid medical leave because I‚Äôm suicidal for a month and a half and couldnt even go to a doctor because my medical insurance gets cut off on medical leave. So I went a month and a half unpaid and didn‚Äôt get disability.

I went back to work a few days ago and I emailed my boss that basically I‚Äôve been unpaid a month and a half and I can‚Äôt get to work financially because I‚Äôm out of money. I don‚Äôt have any family or any sources I can go to. I asked them if they might know of any resources or if I should contact hr.

They told me in an email that my work hours are x-x. If I don‚Äôt show up tomorrow I‚Äôm going to face disciplinary action. It‚Äôs gotten worse since.

I can‚Äôt afford to get to work, to eat, about to loose my apartment and be on the streets with my cat and I just fucking cracked my tooth open and can‚Äôt get to a doctor or dentist because my copay is so high.

Blah blah blah, cut to the chase, they expected me to memorize the ingredients of around 37 drinks, each of which has different measurements depending on size. Not only that, I also had to memorize the side of the cup shorthand for all of it.

Im in a relief position so i'm going to different schools frequently so i cant exactly get a feel for when i need to leave daily. I found out today that the time clock system (Kronos) will round the payable hours in intervals of 15min. So lets say you run late due to whatever reason. You get there at 8:07. It will round the hours paid to you clocking in at 8:15 so if you clockout at 4:06 you will be paid for 7hrs and 45min that day. It will RECORD you clocking in at 8:07 and out at 4:06 still. If you have any ""unpaid"" time on your time clock they expect us to use our PTO to cover that unpaid time. I have used Kronos at an old job and it did not function this way. It would calculate the exact hours worked for when you clocked in and out. This wouldnt be too bad if they also did not expect me to clock in exactly at or before 2pm, not a minute later, despite not a single school letting out before 2:30ish. Highschools get out at 4. So i have to clock in before or exactly at 2 and sit and wait for the 30min to 2 hours for school to let out. I'm fuckin irritated because they are expecting us to use our PTO to help cover their dog shit system. I hate this stupid math game because as long as i clean my area and go no one should care. but because some fuckin spread sheet says im late or leaving 2 minutes early they'll get on my ass.

For example: I worked a 19 straight hour day; after 8hr penalty and after midnight penalty.

I'm dealing with a frustrating situation at work and could use some advice. Recently, a few of my coworkers went to our manager and mentioned that they had extra free time and could take on more responsibilities. As a result, our manager decided to assign more work not just to them, but to the entire team.

Now, we're all swamped with extra tasks, and it's causing a lot of stress and frustration among those of us who were already managing our workloads effectively. I didn't ask for or need this additional work, and I'm finding it hard to keep up with everything.

How should I approach this situation? What's the best way to address this with my manager without coming off as complaining or not being a team player? And how should I interact with my coworkers who caused this mess?

Any advice or strategies for handling this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

**TL;DR: Coworkers told the manager they had free time, now the whole team has more work. How to deal with this?**"

My boss is garbage. Poor manager, doesnt respect work-life boundaries, narcissistic, and lets anyone do what they want to his teams even if the workload is insane. 

Anyway, we've been dealing with his garbage for a couple years, and he's 1 step down from C-suite. A couple weeks ago, internal auditors interviewed 2 of his direct reports to gauge his leadership effectiveness, integrity, etc. They were scheduled for 30 mins. One went 45 mins, the other went an hour. Both basically vented on his horrific leadership. My turn came, I went on for an hour and 15. Next two people went 90 mins. We all said nothing can fix him and that if he's not removed, then his whole leadership under him are ready to leave.

Lately weve all been fairly confident that something will happen to him. Our calendars are all widely visible (we use google), and his boss met with audit for an hour, then the next day his boss had a meeting with employee general counsel that was scheduled during the audit meeting. 

Now we wait, but its getting tough to wait because we're all eager to see him axed/terminated soon and patience is wearing thin. We're also all become a lot more flippant with him and resistant to the ridiculous things he says. Im prepared to lose my job over this as I have a lot saved up and a decent side hussle.

Any tips on this situation? Should we try to get HR complaints going too if he's still here by June? Should we just go to his manager as one unified team to make sure she knows everything we told audit? 

This manager has 0 consideration for work life balance, will bomb us with work, will hold us 30-90 mins over in a meeting because he rambles so much, and will change major assignments on us with 1 day notice to get everything changed. "

I'm glad they did that.


I was overworked and underpaid (as usual).


Most / some / a lot of employers really do NOT care about their employees' well-being.


Lack of work-life balance is extremely common.



There are too many things wrong with it.


These are my main grievances about the job.



I didn't do any major misconduct, but it was just a very old-fashioned, conservative, extremely bureaucratic, reactive, inefficient, unorganised and extremely religious work environment to say the least.


It was also full of favouritism.


It was TOXIC as hell.


I was also bullied a lot by my female co-workers.


I worked in a mostly male dominated field.


Most / all of the men were chill / neutral-pleasant, but most of the women were nasty to me.


I do NOT know why.


All I cared about was work and nothing else.


I was focused on my work.


The very few women that I worked with were lovely, professional, amazing, wholesome etc to say the least, but most of the women were nasty to me for absolutely NO acceptable reason.


They would nitpick on me for IRRELEVANT things.


They would also nitpick on me for the MOST MINOR of things.


They were often / usually reactive and overly emotional about things instead of being professional, ethical, compassionate, patient, empathetic, open-minded and respectful.


It was stressful and exhausting, and HR was extremely biased towards my seniors and they did NOT even bother listening to my side of the story.



I do NOT expect a perfect workplace, just a DECENT one where they prioritise the basic (universal) human rights of people and where they prioritise the employees' well-being.


I just want to be treated like a human being.


We all deserve to be treated decently / well because it's a basic (universal) human right (need).


We all deserve to be treated with compassion, empathy, patience, love, care, open-mindedness, integrity, dignity, professionalism, ethics, competence, sincerity etc."

I work as an assessment specialist in a mental health/detox crisis center. We temporarily take in people suffering from mental health crises (suicidal, homicidal, actively psychotic, etc) or substance abuse problems. We're basically the ""grippy sock hotel"" that people stay at before going to a larger, more long-term facility. I have mental illness (schizoaffective disorder) and I have been at rock-bottom before. I acquired my masters degree with this job in mind because I wanted to help people.

I've been here 5 months and I have HUGE problems with how things are run. More specifically, the insincerity of the company. I diagnosed a man with ""alcohol induced depressive disorder"" due to him having a long history of alcoholism and depression. He's been a client with us since 2008...I looked over his file and found out why. He's homeless, for one. When he gets admitted, he gets sent to detox for three days before being discharged and sent right back out to the streets again. He's never had MAT, proper therapy, or adequate medication.

I gave him this diagnosis and even put a clinical recommendation for treatment...and got fucking eviscerated by the business office over it.

Apparently, the insurance company doesn't like ""substance induced"" diagnoses and the lady demanded that I completely rewrite the ENTIRE assessment and leave out everything involving his alcoholism. She called me THE VERY MOMENT I was about to clock out and go home...demanding that I ""fix"" the assessment right then and there. Not wanting to get fired, I begrudgingly did the bare minimum to change the diagnosis to MDD. I did NOT completely erase the details involving his drinking, however.

I thought we were supposed to HELP the clients. Not give them wrong diagnoses all because insurance is fucking tone-deaf. And they wonder why we're getting so many frequent flyers! Fuck all this red tape.

But as much as this angers me, it makes me even more depressed that I let my high school teachers and mother bully me out of following my dreams of being a writer. Writing is the one thing I'm most passionate about. Nothing compares to it. I'd give up my job in a heartbeat if it meant I could make a living writing.

I've been told by a few people that I need to make a career out of my writing so I can get away from the bullshit pulled by large corporations. But how? I'm a very unknown author; I have four books out that I have only sold a few copies of. Freelance work pays pennies...unless it's ghostwriting. But I'm completely appalled by people who hire ghostwriters. I've ghost written one book and I hated every second of it. It lacked soul. It lacked passion. It was just another boring shifter romance story...which there's hundreds of already with the exact same tropes. That book has a high rating on Amazon, according to a friend of mine. So I know I'm decent at it. But it goes against my morals to do someone's else work while they take credit and pretend that THEY are the ones who put their blood, sweat, and tears into this book.

I suppose I could advertise myself as a writing coach while working on my own projects...but goddammit this job helps pay the bills. I'm stuck choosing an insincere crap-shoot over what I love. It's very fucking depressing and disheartening. I guess I'm just at my wits end.

Thank you for hearing me out.

124,2024-05-17,'Retirement leads to negative health consequences' is a premise built upon inconclusive evidence,u/3RADICATE_THEM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cu5o51/retirement_leads_to_negative_health_consequences/,antiwork,"Here's my theory:

surface level analysis of data says retirement is bad for health, but it doesn't address situations like the following.

Take Boomer Bob. Boomer Bob began working full-time at 20 years old as a manual laborer. Objectively, he had very high purchasing power for his skillset compared to people his age today. However, work is still work, and he comes home exhausted and demoralized everyday. As a result, over the decades, he developed increasing alcoholic tendencies to cope with the psychological distress from work in addition to working even heavier hours to provide for a family relying on his sole income.

Due to Bob becoming an absent father and husband, he experiences a divorce and a distanced relationship with his kids.

Eventually, his pension finally kicked in, he gets the rolex watch, and he never has to work another day in his life‚Äîbut he kept one thing from work that he couldn't let go‚Äîhis alcoholism.

As Bob goes into retirement, he spends more and more time with alcohol as he never developed any other hobbies in his life while also essentially losing his family due to work draining all of his attention, energy, and the best hours of the day just to get by.

**Bob eventually dies‚Äîalone in his home‚Äî16 months into retirement from alcohol poisoning.**

What does 'science' conclude? 'Retirement is bad', but clearly the situation is much more nuanced than this.

Sure, work technically helped create distance between alcohol and himself, but it's also the cause of him developing alcoholism in the first place.

So, did retirement kill him or was it work that killed him? "

There's this insane hack for writing cover letters, and it's seriously blowing my mind. No more staring at a blank page, trying to come up with a less cringe way to say ""I match your JD and have attention to detail""

There's this tool called¬†[Jobfly](http://jobfly.co/)¬†that uses some crazy advanced AI to whip up personalized cover letters like a boss. All you gotta do is upload your resume once, and boom ‚Äì you're ready to generate letters that match your skills with all the different job descriptions you see. It's like having a super smart wingman that knows exactly what to say to get you noticed.

It saves your resume, so you don't have to keep uploading and keeps a history of all the letters you've generated, so you can easily tweak and reuse them. Pretty much your own personal cover letter library.

Oh, and Jobfly is totally FREE. No catch, no hidden fees, nada. You don't even need to enter your credit card info.

It doesn't just stop at cover letters. It's got your back for the interview process too. You can practice interview questions and get pro answers generated like a career coach and a hype man all rolled into one.

I'm sure some are gonna ask - Do AI detectors pick it up? Well if it did, it wouldn't have landed 5/7 interviews in the last 2 weeks.

26,2024-05-17,The biggest problem with work culture is the consistency that's demanded,u/First-Football7924,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cu6vms/the_biggest_problem_with_work_culture_is_the/,antiwork,"One thing I do now, to test employers, is see how they handle me being inconsistent for a small period.  You could be a A+ employee for a year, but one week of being a bit unreliable, or not as consistent as you were before, undoes EVERYTHING you did before.  Any hint of change in your consistency is examined quickly.  Around 99.999% of employers do not put more than a few minutes into deeper empathic thinking into what's going on with you.  Not even ""I can tell you feel bad today, go home.""  I'm talking more nuanced thinking into how the job may be affecting your overall life.  They are not going to think about how to put the most fair work load on you.  They want to find the employees that will take the pay, the workload, and they will continually try their hardest to squeeze the most out of people.  If people don't accept the offer, that's when they decide to up pay and better work conditions.

I don't care how much of friends we are at work, or anything like that.  How you treat me when your management/boss hat is on, is how I will respond to you when you turn that personality on.  I won't hold it against you later, unless it was malicious, but I also won't let it fly.  And there's no doubt people develop two personalities to get through this cartoonish culture of work.  You're joking and having a good time, throw a work question out, and even their tone and enunciation changes.  You hear their work tone.

It all used to stress me out and make ME feel guilty.  I felt guilty when I was inconsistent for a tiny period, even if the job had crushed me down, barely paid me, and expected everything from me. 

More than anything, don't be afraid to be assertive at your job, with the expectation they may let you go for it.  Because if you can find a workplace that actually takes your criticism, maybe even tries to find middleground, then you'll find a place that doesn't have their head in their cheeks.

There were about 20 people in the org, and two people in customer service: my manager and me. For that first year, it was amazing. My boss was awesome and so was everyone else I worked with. I learned the product crazy fast and clients loved me. 

At the end of the first year, they pulled me into  meeting and asked if I was interested in developing product as a product lead, with the intention of training me so I could become a product manager. I told them I wasn‚Äôt qualified but if they were willing to give me guidance and help me learn, I‚Äôm was always down to try something new. For half of the second year, I fumbled my way through creating specs and the dev at the third party company we used was about as patient as you can be, but it was abundantly clear he needed something better to work with. It ended up not mattering.

Our tech debt was soooo bad. We were on obsolete versions of SQL, Python, Ubuntu, etc, but the move from Python2 to Python3 (in 2023 btw) was the biggest lift of them all. I immediately went from Product Lead to QA where I thrived! I loved QA and over the last 12 months, I‚Äôve written hundreds and hundreds of manual tests that found bugs in the product that had been there for a decade. I was super proud of helping us successfully move to MySQL 8 (the devs really did the heavy lifting, of course!) in the fall of last year and I spent the majority of this year leading a team through different rounds of comprehensive manual testing and by round three, we were basically bug free. 

A few weeks ago, they hired an automated tester (TJ, I know you read this sub and this story is too specific so hey!) and he was great. We had excellent collaboration and he would reach out and ask if I wanted to learn more about automation, even sending me links so I could take a free course! He was great! Not long after he starts, we successfully get our first round of clients on Python3 and it‚Äôs exciting, but then my work dries up. I‚Äôm asking what I should focus on now and I knock it out in a day or two, so I‚Äôm twiddling my thumbs. New dev had been put on hold until Python3 but now we can get to the fun stuff.  


Now, I went into to QA just using my product knowledge to determine what to do. But I grew exponentially and earned multiple certs of completion that I paid for out of my pocket to get better and I did! And if you‚Äôre not familiar with QA, you really need manual and auto testing - it‚Äôs typically not one or the other. That still didn‚Äôt stop them from pulling me into a meeting yesterday and telling me my position had been eliminated due to financial reasons (I‚Äôm literally the only California employee).

Does it suck trying to find a job in tech right now? Am I even more concerned cause I just started dipping my toe into this career that I loved? Yes to both. But I‚Äôm also so incredibly pissed that the testing is going to be thrown on the shoulders of those who are already stretched too thin. My coworkers were all amazing but the C level can suck a bag of dicks. 


TLDR; I was fired the second the big project I was working on was complete and now overworked, underpaid people are stuck doing my old job.

i started working at a small vape store about 3 weeks ago. i did 10 hours of unpaid training without knowledge i was not being paid. i worked 2 normal days the week after. i was told we get paid every week by check, but when i asked where mine was, my boss said ‚Äúyou only worked 2 days last week so you don‚Äôt get paid until next week‚Äù‚Ä¶ ok.
she also informed me that someone stole something at the store while i was trying to sell something to a different customer. the video showed the woman only taking one $15 item. she said i have to pay for the stolen item and it would be taken out of my check. ok whatever. it is what it is.
the next day, she says actually it was 2 items. $24 off my check. the video i saw only showed 1 item‚Ä¶ but ok‚Ä¶..
then at my next shift she starts telling me i gave someone something for free 3 shifts ago. she started saying an additional $25 would be taken off, until i defended myself. then it was ‚Äúmust be a misunderstanding‚Äù.
after that i decided to quit.
i told her wednesday and that i would come today (friday, the day she said i would get my first and now only payment) for my check. left on read. i confirmed today, ‚Äúwill my check be available tonight‚Äù her response was ‚Äúcome before 4 and drop off keys‚Äù (i was given a key to the front door)
i asked again, am i getting my check today?
left on read.
what exactly are my rights here? i don‚Äôt know what to do. i live in Florida & i don‚Äôt know if i can do anything if she doesn‚Äôt pay me or gives me an inaccurate amount.
i worked 21 hours total minus the 10 hours of training at $12/per hour. it‚Äôs a W2 job to my knowledge because she took a picture of my social and ID. i don‚Äôt even know how much the check should be at this point, with how many ‚Äústolen‚Äù and ‚Äúwrongfully sold‚Äù items i have to pay for. what do i do?"
5,2024-05-17,Trying to break into cybersecurity in 2024 has been hell on earth,u/Additional-Farm9628,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cu9rr8/trying_to_break_into_cybersecurity_in_2024_has/,antiwork,"For the past year, I've been taking time after work to study and break into cybersecurity/cloud security with the hope of landing a secure, remote, well-paying job. This would free up a lot of time for me to invest in my hobbies, traveling, and other interests. I've worked really hard to earn certifications, complete home projects, and create my own experience. But man, job hunting has been a pain. I've been getting interviews and had my third IT interview not too long ago.

A couple of months ago, I had a frustrating experience with a cybersecurity company. I applied for several positions, including help desk, entry-level cybersecurity technician, and compliance.

I got a response inviting me for a phone interview. I scheduled it for 4:00 PM on a Monday. When the time came, the HR representative didn‚Äôt call. The next day, she emailed to apologize, saying she had to leave early, and we rescheduled the call for later that day.

When she finally called, it turned out to be about the help desk position. Here‚Äôs the kicker:

The job is onsite, only pays $19/hr, and requires providing 24/7 support, meaning my schedule could fluctuate. Plus, the interview process isn‚Äôt standard. They wanted me to come in twice during the work week for 2-3 hours at a time to do help desk simulations before deciding if I was a good fit.

All that for a $19/hr help desk role. I understand I need to start somewhere, but I can't afford to work for $19/hr.

Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed. I didn‚Äôt outright decline, but I did leave it open-ended and asked the HR representative to check on the entry-level cybersecurity technician position because although I don‚Äôt have work experience, my certifications and home projects meet the requirements for the position.

What's frustrating is that if I had embarked on this journey a couple of years ago, I probably would have landed something a lot sooner. But right now, I have to work twice as hard. I'm getting burnt out from this shit. 

If there are any cybersecurity/IT professionals on this sub who could provide advice, that would be great. I'm not doing this just for the money; I've grown to really enjoy this field. I'm just at a point where I'm like, ""What more do I need to do?"" lol

and if there are any ppl on this sub that wanna rant with me then feel free to do so haha"

Basically, the author goes with the premise that making money isn't an inherently bad thing. What I think is worth examining here is the idea that founders and leaders are actually ashamed to make money as their goal or that making fun of wealthy people is considered largely acceptable in society. This reads like something you'd see on LinkedIn and get riled up about. Where's this wealth and money from being a founder/leader supposed to come from in the first place??? Where are you supposed to get ""startup funding"" from to found your own business? And what about folks who pathologically hoard money and don't do anything constructive with it? I feel like the author is trying to answer these things, but I remain unconvinced.

I was laid off from my last one, but found it a blessing in disguise because I was unhappy and it was a hostile work environment. Luckily, I was hired at my current job a few days later. 

Now, I like this job. The environment and culture is very nice. 

However, there was a girl who started a few months after I did. She‚Äôs the kind of person who basically thinks she‚Äôs better than everyone, kisses managements ass, thinks she‚Äôs untouchable and breaks policies all the time yet nobody says anything to her. She talks to you and treats people like she is a manager when she isn‚Äôt. She acts entitled, immature, she‚Äôs in her 20s and one of those people who clearly don‚Äôt want to work.

I work as a coordinator and answer phones. Recently, she‚Äôs started just picking up the phone and doing blind transfers to other employees because she states she is ‚Äúbusy‚Äù doing other things, when I turn around and see her socializing and not working. She simply thinks coming to work is all about socializing. You aren‚Äôt supposed to leave your seat unless you‚Äôre using the bathroom or taking missed call notes to other employees, but she‚Äôs always spending extended time away from her desk. She also dresses inappropriately and doesn‚Äôt abide by dress code. We can‚Äôt wear AirPods or headphones (other than headsets) but she still does. She thinks she‚Äôs untouchable because nobody says anything to her.  The fact that she‚Äôs like this is stressful for me and my colleagues because it increases our workload.

I‚Äôve gone to management a few times over various issues but they just shrug it off, saying they‚Äôll talk to her, but nothing is being done. I am starting to feel defeated and it‚Äôs becoming a hostile work environment again. It‚Äôs so frustrating seeing her get away with everything. I always feel on edge whenever she works. I hate feeling like I am complaining too much, but she shouldn‚Äôt be working here when she acts like this. She needs to be fired.

There have been good workers who have left because nothing is being done and they just won‚Äôt fire her. She‚Äôs started drama and arguments with those employees and they left because she didn‚Äôt even get punished. She‚Äôs also had several customer complaints about her rudeness and attitude, but it was shrugged off.

I am a person who believes in Karma and I hope that one day she will get what she deserves. It‚Äôs just a matter of waiting until that happens‚Ä¶if that ever does.

I feel completely disillusioned and frustrated. I worked tirelessly to understand the intricacies of my field, thinking that this knowledge would empower me to excel in the professional world. I graduated with a 3.8 GPA, But here I am, feeling like my education was a waste of time.

I was taught to solve problems creatively, think critically, and stay updated with industry standards. I studied hard to become a professional, but now, every day at work feels like a slap in the face. My employer constantly undermines my knowledge and expertise, making me feel like an imposter in a field where I am supposed to be an expert.

Why did I spend all those years learning the best practices and industry standards if my employer insists on doing things their way? They belittle my suggestions and dismiss my input as if I have no idea what I'm talking about. It's infuriating to have my education and skills disregarded, especially when I know I'm right. The methodologies and principles I advocate for are industry standards, yet I am made to feel like I'm completely out of touch.

The disconnect between what I was taught in college and what is practiced in the corporate world is staggering. I entered the workforce with the hope that my education would be my greatest asset. Instead, it has become a source of frustration and disillusionment. I thought college was preparing me to be a professional, but now it feels like it was all for nothing. The corporate world doesn't care about what I know or what I've learned; they only care about conformity and blind obedience.

Isn't the point of hiring educated professionals to leverage their knowledge and expertise? If employers are going to dictate how everything should be done, then what's the point of seeking higher education? It feels like I've been cheated, investing time, effort, and money into an education that is not respected or valued in the real world. I'm tired of being treated like a clueless newbie when I have the credentials and knowledge to back up my work.

College was supposed to be the foundation of my professional career, but in reality, it seems like nothing more than a checkbox for employers. They don't want innovative thinkers or experts; they want drones who follow orders without question. It's demoralizing and disheartening to realize that my education, something I took immense pride in, is rendered meaningless in this corporate environment."

Unfortunately we have to participate in this failed system, otherwise we end up in prison, because being homeless and or not producing for the capitalist class is a crime. Managers are the moral superior of no one, rather a product of upward continuous failure. In employment business don't make people assets, rather hyper individualism, dependent on you going somewhere else to learn a job.

 That hyper individualism coming into play as the managerial class won't take the time to create you into an asset. Saying we only hire with experience, expecting a prepackaged product/ experience which covers up for the failures of business organizations. Remember when a manager says no one wants to work, they mean they don't want to work, managers the most laziest and a class of people who contribute the least to a community but rather aid in the extraction of value and wealth from a community. Any one can be a manager, very few are actual leaders. Managers are a dime a dozen, leaders are hard to find.

It's not that managers won't mentor and create people into assets it's that they have failed upward with for so long with no real structure or promoted/hired with no real leadership qualities or training. Our culture is so toxic our country is evil. We don't elect or hire leaders in this country, rather we hire and elect people in positions of power who consistently fail upwards, at the behest of the predator class while the country and economy decline. We are a failed state."

I work in a well-paying, mid/senior IT position in a massive organization. So far I've had stellar performance reviews (and I'm looking at a promotion later this year). I have a family, exercise regularly, and usually eat well. 

Due to job stress over the last two years (which exacerbates my always-present anxiety), I've started drinking more heavily. I'll drink a shot of Vodka in the morning, during lunch and when I get back home. The longest that I've gone without drinking is seven days (I had a cold at the time). My wife isn't tracking this, which is why I have to drink carefully at home. 

I've been going off and on to therapy to address my anxiety (I've talked around the alcohol abuse) and was told that I should consider medication. However, the therapist admitted that medication may be bad for my career. Even if that wasn't the case, due to my security clearance, it wouldn't be a good idea to admit to having anxiety/ADHD/alcohol issues (I would have to report these and my job has access to my medical record). Aside from supporting a family, I'm not in a sufficiently good financial position to leave my job.

It's just insane to me that an organization can enable substance abuse so long as you perform well. All that talk about supporting you is just for show. If you're a risk, you're gone. 

Thank you all."

Throwaway here

In late ‚Äò22 I was hired by a firm that required me to relocate by moving across the country. I was very excited, and upon salary negotiations I was informed I was now the youngest and highest paid individual in the company. Just FYI I am 6 years younger than the next youngest person, all of the employees are 35-60 range with a majority on the mid-high range. The CEO, accountant, and office manager are the only ones that know salaries. 

The first few months were great. Then I ran into problems with a vendor, who was the SO of our office manager. Our first meeting they said something along the lines of ‚Äúwith what YOU‚ÄôRE getting paid, I‚Äôm surprised they increased the budget‚Äù. It rubbed me the wrong way. Time went on and because of their attitude, we had to cut contract with them. This pissed off my office manager, but little did I know, I stepped into something I wasn‚Äôt aware of. There was already bad blood between the vendor and my CEO. 

A few months later, an individual known to be a gossiper, who is close with my office manager, said the following to me while we were out getting drinks: ‚ÄúI do know if X (my predecessor) was getting paid what you are, they‚Äôd still be around‚Äù. I knew then for a fact my office manager was relaying my pay to others. 

Lately, my entire office has been acting very abnormal with me. Conversations are short, and many make excuses to not work with me. I‚Äôm getting the hint many of them are aware. I‚Äôm a very easy going, friendly person, and less than 1% of my work has to deal with any other team members, I know I haven‚Äôt done anything to offend anyone. 

I‚Äôm unsure what to do. My office manager has slandered my CEO to me saying ‚Äòf that guy, I can‚Äôt wait to leave, I‚Äôm looking elsewhere for work‚Äô, and for the last YEAR since letting go of their SO vendor, I have received constant snarky remarks from them. I avoid them at all costs and have kept this all to myself to not tip the boat. 

I‚Äôm tired of my office managers attitude, I‚Äôm pissed I‚Äôm under the impression the entire office now feels a specific way about me, and I‚Äôm pissed they‚Äôre still around. 

Does anyone have any recommendations or thoughts on this? Appreciate it. "
14,2024-05-17,Why do so many jobs in the USA pay hourly instead of a salary? ,u/peanutismint,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cue1tm/why_do_so_many_jobs_in_the_usa_pay_hourly_instead/,antiwork,"Since moving to the US I‚Äôve been shocked how many jobs list their compensation in terms of hourly wages rather than a yearly salary. I‚Äôm not just talking like McDonalds or something, even technical jobs I‚Äôve been looking at in fields like IT or audio-visual are often listed at their hourly rate rather than a traditional salary. 

Is this something companies do so they can vary the amount of hours they might need you to work and if so are these kind of jobs to be avoided? 

I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to worry about not being able to pay my mortgage because a company suddenly had less work and instead of having to honour the contract they made to pay me for my work regardless of their level of business they could just say ‚Äúoh jk don‚Äôt come into work this week‚Ä¶‚Äù

Throwaway for privacy. I work in the medical field and I have 2 main coworkers. We have specialized lab positions (for privacy reasons I do not wish to disclose my specific job title). 

For background, I am 26F. Coworker 1 is 24F. She has behaved unprofessionally towards me a couple times, i.e. yelling at me for now knowing how to do the job when I was new. She generally keeps to herself but her daily mood is 50/50 (either extremely happy and talkative or quiet and passive aggressive). Coworker 2 is 45M. He is friendly enough, but loves drama/ is constantly talking negatively about everyone and everything. Neither of them seem to have very happy lives.

Part of what bothers me the most is that Coworkers 1 and 2 seem to enjoy each others company more than they enjoy mine. Whenever the two of them are alone, they‚Äôre always chatting/ gossiping but when I‚Äôm around they stop. I try to be as positive as a person as possible so I don‚Äôt like to get involved in the drama. Im sure they have talked shit about me behind my back because when I‚Äôm around they‚Äôre just constantly talking shit about everyone else. 

We work together in the same relatively small room for most of the day, except for lunch and breaks. 

I am seeking advice for how I can change my mindset to improve the workday. What can I do to make the workday more tolerable‚Äî besides finding a new job? Lol. Thanks! "
1,2024-05-17,Coworker creating time off conflict ,u/Chickabow90,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cuede5/coworker_creating_time_off_conflict/,antiwork,"Hi, I work for a scheduling center for automotive service. There are 4 of us including the manager.

My coworker Becky (fake name) and I have gotten close as we sit right next to eachother.

She got me into raving(i liked the music just never went to festivals/raves)

We like going togeether if we can but we have different schedules. She's Monday-Friday 8am-4pm and I'm Monday-Wednesday 10am-5pm, Friday 10am-5pm, and Saturday 8am-3pm. I've only had 2 Saturdays off Since I started in August.

I work every Saturday mostly by myself because Tami went part time from having a baby last October. Even if she does work a Saturday its only 2-3 hours at the beginning so I have no help during the busy part. This is making me frustrated on it's own and I've already mentioned it to my manager. 

Becky is constantly requesting time off each month. It's always 2 days in a row after the weekend so then (I was told to try to not take Mondays off) I'm alone for a of couple hours after the others leave answering for 6 stores by myself.  

If I need a Saturday off I have to ask Becky to cover but she's already put in a bunch of time off. My manager said to just communicate if she cant cover.

The biggest issue I'm frustrated with is I kept telling Becky i'm going to GOLDRUSH in October on both days with my husband and friend(which would mean she needs to cover me Saturday and I need to leave 2 hours early on Friday) and now she wants to come with me both days. She wants to do our theme and come over for our pregame. I keep telling her "" Oh well how is it going to work with both of us off?"" She just says oh we'll figure out.

She doesn't understand that I'm the one already working Saturday so now I'm frustrated. And this job is already pissing me off.

I liked my coworkers but I was always criticized by my direct manager and left to figure out a lot in my own. 
Since leaving it‚Äôs felt like a whole new world and as much as I knew I had been affected by the years in my previous toxic environment, I had no idea how transparent it was to an outsider.

I‚Äôm currently being trained on some tasks and I believe I‚Äôve got the hang of most of it, so I don‚Äôt need to have it reiterated to me a bunch of times. The one thing that my trainer did have to reassure me on every new task was that I would not get criticized for making my own decisions or in certain scenarios where a task could potentially go wrong. I didn‚Äôt realize how many what-ifs I kept asking that were related to me trying to be as perfect as possible at the task so I can avoid scrutiny. I guess my teammate caught on to my questions and behavior and said I wouldn‚Äôt be punished in any way like that and there‚Äôs nothing ever so urgent that would be cause for extreme stress.

I realized then how many of my questions were related to immense fear and thanked her profusely for the reassurance. Now I realize just how much I have to heal what my last place did to my mentality as I really don‚Äôt want to be annoying someone with a constant need of reassurance. Hopefully through time at this new job, I‚Äôll become more relaxed.

Anyone else have similar stories or advice?


TLDR: Last work environment fucked me up so bad that teammate caught onto it by how many fearful what-if scenario questions I asked during my training."

I failed my CDL the first time and am scheduled to take it again, but they expect me to pay out of pocket 200 dollars and not get reimbursed. I have not even had a raise since I started. 

When I expressed my concern with him, and how it relates to issues in the past, he screamed at me it was not all about me, and that he was not going to argue. He said if I did not like it, there is the door.

Two years ago I switched jobs to get more responsibilities. Previous job was unofficially remote but new job paid more but required 2 days in. They were very flexible and barely enforced so was in maybe once or twice. When negotiating, I didn‚Äôt even consider the cost of RTO. A month in, the two days was enforced. Later on, 3 days was made mandatory and then last year 4. I am expecting 5 to happen this year. This has made my pay raises go out the window, to get to the office, I spend 2 hours commuting via train to which I spend $200 on a pass. Then I have to get lunch (tried meal packing but it never works), don‚Äôt forget the snacks, coffee and random stuff you see around. 

In the 2 years, the work cafeteria went from free to paid but subsidized and high quality to now low quality with almost outside restaurant prices. There has been zero days where being in the office was an advantage to being at home. In the past year, l useless middle managers have gone from zero micro management to being up your ass.

1143,2024-05-17,50 Families with over $1Trillion net worth spend $600Million 2024 Election (So far). ,u/TheRealEnkidu98,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cuewrc/50_families_with_over_1trillion_net_worth_spend/,antiwork,"We're in trouble because most people just don't understand the scale of money.  Million, Billion, Trillion, is not just a one or two consonant difference. 

So, let's put this in perspective - I would ask whenever you try to discuss politics etc with your families and friends you use this method to get them to understand the scale of the problem.  Most every one of them has a cell phone and the cell phone has a calculator, if they don't believe you, have them do the math themselves. 

So - 50 Billionaire Families with a net worth of over $1,000,000,000,000.00 have spent (mostly for Republicans)  $600,000,000.00 dollars in the 2024 election cycle. 

First, how much is this of their net worth? 

1,000,000,000,000 / 600,000,000 = 0.0006. 

OR 0.06% of their total net worth. 

How much money would the 'Median' American need to spend to equal this $600,000,000.00?

US Median Net Worth (HALF of all Americans have this or less) was $192,700.00 in 2022. 

0,06% of their net worth is $115.62 (0.0006 \* 192,700 = 115.62)

NOTE:  This is 50 Families of Billionaires, so they're actually only spending about $2.31 each (50 \* 2.31 = 115.5) to proportional to the net worth of the Median American, influence our elections/Politics. 

SO, for what is less than a price of a cup of coffee (proportionally) each one of these 50 BILLIONAIRE families is exerting a huge amount of influence on our elections. 

BUT it gets even worse....

Lets say that HALF of all Americans represented by the 'Median' Net Worth figure above, each wanted to pay their $2.31 each to band together to 'fight' the 50 Billionaires and dilute their ad buys/campaign donations, etc. 

So, 330,000,000 US citizens / 2 = 165,000,000 people. 

165,000,000 (the lower half of the median, every man, woman, and child) scrapes up their proportional $2.31 and they have a whopping.  $381,150,000.00 dollars. 

381 < 600.   

In fact,   Just by 'happy' coincidence, $381 Million is just about 3/5's $600 Million. 

165 MILLION people, spending proportionally the same amount of their net worth as 50 BILLIONAIRES, still can't amass the same level of economic power to match their spending. 

We can make it \_EVEN WORSE\_. 

Billionaires make money not by their own labours, but by rent seeking behaviour and 'Investing'.  

Let us presume they are only making 5% on their net worth in interest (Most of the wealthy would NEVER accept a paltry 5% return)

So, $1,000,000,000,000 \* .05 (5.0%) = $50,000,000,000 (50 BILLION). 

$600 MILLION is just 1.2% (0.012) of 50 BILLION.   So for less than 2% of the interest they earn on their assets, E.G. they are never ever even touching their principal ad they still get enormously richer at $49,400,000,000.00,  They are purchasing the political fate of the United States. 

Again, proportionally to the MEDIAN NET WORTH in the US....

If you earned 5% on your $192,700 = $9,635.00 to spend as much, proportionally, of money earned just from your interest income, you would be spending just $115.62 of your interest income to change the fate of the United States. 

Your ONLY effective way to combat this is to VOTE and to VOTE AGAINST the interests of 50 Families. 

And if the 50 Families 'Win' by collectively spending what amounts, for them, to less than the cost of a cup of coffee to you from your net worth, then you have to deny them your labors until they accede to your demands. 

Every Billionaire is a CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY. 

Not a SINGLE BILLIONAIRE under the age of 30 earned their fortune, all of it was inherited. 

Every Billionaire, yearly, has a carbon 'expenditure' equal to that of 1,000,000 people from the lowest 90% of the world's population. 

With just 2,781 Billionaires on the planet, they emit the equivalent carbon of 2,781,000,000 people. 

A bit over a THIRD of the entire population of the planetary

A THIRD of all Carbon Emissions made by humans comes from 2,781 people flying around in private jets for vegas weekends, a surprise visit to Paris for a spouse/child, jetting off to a music festival or Burning Man,  and having multiple yachts and driving 2 million dollar Bugatti's or mere $250,000 Bentleys and Porsches. 

And it costs them barely anything to buy up the media and the airwaves and convince you that they shouldn't have to pay taxes, and that you should admire them instead.  It costs them pennies to influence our governments in their own favor and at YOUR expense. 

There should be no Billionaires, and the political and Economic systems that have allowed it to happen have done so by making the rest of us pay a price for 50 Families spending on the US elections, or 2,781 people out of the worlds 8,000,000,000 controlling the majority of the worlds wealth and thus the power that comes with it.

I arrived 10:15am, His shift starts at 10am. I called to see if he was on his way, He said he was. I said ""Okay, Let me know, I'll be here waiting at the back door."" I sat down in my car, Watched and Waited, Noone ever came. It was almost opening time and I got curious as to where he was but I didn't want to keep calling him while he was running late and trying to get to work. I looked in through the back door and I see him setting down chairs already. I knock on the door until he sees me and opens it. As soon as he opens the back door he shouts ""Why didn't you just go around to the front!?"" I replied that as it was almost time to open up, It didn't make a big difference to just wait a minute here. 

I went in and clocked in almost 30 minutes late. I saw he had enough prep done that meant he had been there atleast 20 minutes. I asked him why he didn't call or text me that he'd arrived, He replied ""I don't have to be worrying about where you're at, That's not my responsibility, It's yours."" I could tell he was being stubborn on the matter due to being in a bad mood. He is usually much more decent and friendlier. I've built up what I thought was a friendship with him, This was a side of him I wasn't familiar with. 

I asked if he'd atleast consider fixing my time, since I arrived even before he did. He told me not to tell him what to do, and he's not fixing my time at all. He doesn't have to, according to him. I told him I'd talk to our GM about it since he isn't taking responsibility. He told me to do it, He doesn't care. I said ""Ok, I'm going to drop it because there's no point talking to him about it, It's like talking to a brick wall or my mother, I'm not gonna get anywhere with this discussion."" 

That last remark sent him over the edge and he became aggressive, getting in my face and telling me to clock out and go outside with him. I calmly told him I would not be doing that. He egged me on atleast 3 times to do it, saying he doesn't give AF about this job. He even said he'd catch me after the shift. I asked him what is going on because this isn't him, not the version I'd come to know. I know he is having relationship problems but this is not how you solve anything. He eventually stopped because I walked away but he was very close to assaulting me. I called our boss and the next day he suspended me, the AM was suspended too but only for the remainder of the week, while I am on week 2 of suspension. I know the cameras have no audio but they can clearly see I wasn't on the offensive there. 

I don't even want my job back because I don't feel safe with him there. I haven't heard anything, It's been radio silence since 11 days ago. I'm pretty sure they're waiting for my last check to give me the good news. I already found another job, just wanted to share."

0,2024-05-17,Why we have a housing bubble and how to fix it,u/SyrianKing81,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cuhg10/why_we_have_a_housing_bubble_and_how_to_fix_it/,antiwork," Why:

* We have allowed rich investors to buy up homes and convert them to rentals
* All the jobs are artificially concentrated in big cities, so we are forced to live there, and this is by the design of those investors
* The family unit has been destroyed, so the demand has been doubled, also by the design of the same investors
* Related to this, women have been manipulated by the investors to think that they should work, so labor became cheap due to increased supply, which contributed to rising inflation, including home prices
* We have open borders, allowing migrants to come in droves and compete for the limited inventory, also providing more cheap labor to the same investors. Even legal immigration is a big factor here

How to fix:

* Do not rent vacation homes. You are literally helping rich people buy up second and third homes with your own money
* Stay at your parents' home until you can afford to purchase your own home. And if you're a parent, allow your adult kids to stay with you until they can purchase their own homes instead of renting
* Do not get divorced. Split couples double the demand for housing
* Do not purchase a home with these inflated prices, it's a scam
* Realize that everyone and their brother wants to be a real estate investor, and that it's not really a great idea to follow the herd, especially at these astronomical prices
* Move somewhere cheaper where you can afford to purchase a home instead of renting
* Buy a piece of land and put a mobile home there or build a home, instead of renting. Every house added will help with the inventory issues
* You might think that pressuring politicians to fix immigration and to stop investors from buying up homes will work, but it won't. Politicians are bought and sold for. - And guess who has the money to do that. The situation we're in is not a coincidence.

As you can see, the common theme of the fix is to avoid buying homes with inflated prices, or renting homes at all. Of course, none of this is easy, or even practical in some cases, except the point about vacation homes. They need to die.

Eventually the problem is going to fix itself. People can no longer afford to get married or have kids, mainly due to housing. Our population will start shrinking, and that's a good thing. Do not believe otherwise. Yeah it's a crisis for the ultra rich, but for most of us it's good news.

I am optimistic. I see a future where rental homes sit vacant and their values plummet, hopefully forcing many owners to sell or go underwater. It's coming. But we have to understand the game and refuse to play it."

3. There is no swearing allowed because it offends her

4. We're required to reply to every internal email within 15 minutes, otherwise she will ask us why we haven't replied

5. She requires us to write up ""apology"" emails to the entire department  when we make mistakes, regardless of how big or small

6. We aren't allowed to leave work even 5 minutes early, even if we're finished with our work for the day (again, we're salaried)

Managers: don't put all your functional weight on one position, and then do them dirty.**

I had a job where in the four years I worked there, we went from a support staff of 11 to 5. We were at 7 pre-pandemic.

The workload didn't decrease, it just got spread out.

On top of my normal job, I picked up extra duties as a second job at the same place. I worked 60-80 hours a week a lot of the year because of this. It's important to note here that including my extra work, I was doing the work of three full time staff. 

When the pandemic hit, my original role was temporarily decreased to about 20% of its workload and my second job became my normal job. 

I dealt with the huge loss in income best I could. I was also one of two people to return on site for the higher risk face to face jobs. Thankfully it was our slowest time of the year. We normally get half day Fridays for the summer, but my manager said not for me. I needed to be there. When I asked if I could have a half day on another day, I was told that it was discretionary and not mandated and they didn't need to give it to me. 

I also had accrued so much vacation even before the pandemic, that there was no way I would ever get back those hours because of pay out policy (which also changed with the pandemic). I asked in writing if I could take Mondays off for the summer since that was a day I didn't need to be there. My supervisor would only have that conversation in person and would not admit to this in writing, but told me that I absolutely couldn't do that. But that they would consider an occasional Monday off here and there. Two days later, they scheduled a four hour recurring mandatory meeting on Mondays for the rest of the summer because it was ""the only time that worked"" for them. 

I was getting upset and asked to see my position description. It got re-written to be so general that a lot could get swept onto my plate. I also was told that come our busier season, I would be in full force of my normal job duties pre-pandemic and taking over one of the other support staff positions ""but with volunteer help."" And that I would receive no extra income for any of this. So basically still doing the work of 3 people. 

So, I quit. No other job lined up, just fuck this I'm out. The shocked Pikachu look on their faces. I got pulled into a meeting with my supervisor's supervisor. Unheard of. That's how I knew they were panicking. 

I told them I would only stay if they increased my pay to what I was making when I was working. They said no, but I could take more on to get paid more. 

Nah, I'm out. Unfortunately, they immediately terminated access to my email.

Few months later one of the remaining support staff suffered from a stroke. Which was horrible. 

So that's my anti-work story I've been meaning to post. "

The report was first stated by a manager that black water was overflowing from the sales floor bathroom in the morning.
The cause was found later that night.

Sewage pipes busted in the basement breakroom causing sewage to leak into the walls(been ongoing in all bathrooms since December). A store associate(DM'd me) was shown a video by one of the plumbers showing that sewage was leaking above the breakroom ceiling.


The regional manager lost his shit and went ape angry on my coworker for even mentioning this was a health hazard. Super bully tactics. Our GM reported the regional manager to HR and worries he might lose his job for reporting this misconduct.

 Only after employees leaving and customers complaining about a horrible stench and health concerns they shut down the store 9 hours later. Btw they pooled employees from other nearby stores to stand in for my coworkers that left due to all this shit.

Management sends out email saying a Specialty cleaning crew has restored,scrubbed and sanitized everything overnight. They go on to say everyone must show up for their shifts immediately next day.

The break room entrance is sealed loosely by masking tape and plastic. We were told the breakroom closed off due to ""biohazard"" concerns. To use the upstairs corporate bathrooms if we need.
There's holes in these plastic barriers.
Completely useless.
There is an elevator to the breakroom where I wanted to see if they done what they'd said.
They lied. Same pipes, same walls. Everything looks dirty and there's visible fecal matter on the ground. Foot prints of what I imagine from one of the ""specialty cleaner"" tracking poop on the ground.

Smells retched. Coworkers still complaining about smells permeating through the walls and some reported they have headaches(I pray it's not related). 

I believe there's still mold and sewage in multiple places since December, but this is the worst of the incident so far.

But corporate higher ups say to keep the store running and emailed management team a hand-typed ""official"" report that it's completely safe to keep working. Still no reports of the cleaning done or that the air quality is safe. In fact the other assistancnt store manager was denied access to the reports by HR.

 I'm at a loss. What should I do?
Can I call out and not lose pay over a store that shouldn't be open for health hazards?"

Never had issues with any of them until now. My new manager wrote me up yesterday for accusations and assumptions he made up and thinks are true, and I‚Äôm now on a probation period where he gets to micromanage me, coworkers are watching my every move, and have to have a weekly performance review with him

The claims made that are not at all true: 

1. Using my phone on the floor. He said I was texting my sister or mom one day apparently? I keep my phone in my car at all times and only use it on my breaks. The only time I‚Äôve brought it in-store is to use the phone charger or to connect music to our portable speaker when our store radio was out. I‚Äôve even messaged him regarding this

2. Eating in the back. He told me a coworker said I did, but I seriously do not recall eating on the floor. I bring my food to the break room or my car

3. Taking a 25min break on my 10min break. I seriously do not know how he got the timing so wrong. This one left me speechless. I never go over my breaks, and if I *had* to, I would let him know

4. That I‚Äôm rude to my coworkers‚Ä¶ I do not speak to them unless spoken to or if it‚Äôs work-related

The only acceptable claim he‚Äôs made is that I‚Äôm frequently late. Though, I‚Äôm late by a minute or two and I very often make up the time by staying an additional 30min-1hr to help the closers with his permission 

Anyways, the PIP states that if I ‚Äúmess up‚Äù just once ‚Äúagain‚Äù, I‚Äôll be fired immediately

Unfortunately, I injured my lower back before this PIP ordeal by simply picking up a ~10lb basket as I was opening the store somehow. It sent a sharp pain to my lower back, but the pain wasn‚Äôt so bad that I could work the rest of the day. As today came though, the pain worsened and I had to ask my assistant manager to leave early because of it. Now, I‚Äôm told I need to open a claim with L&I by a clinic that can help me before I can even set up an appointment with them. Upon that, I also learned I should‚Äôve reported my injury to my manager immediately. But I didn‚Äôt until after speaking with said clinic

My manager hates me, has already came up with lies about my work performance, cut my hours, and I‚Äôm on the edge of getting fired if I don‚Äôt ‚Äúimprove.‚Äù Corporate is corrupt and always protects and sided with the managers, therefore they don‚Äôt believe a word I said or will say

Can I get fired over reporting my injury and reporting my injury more than 24hrs later?

I moved to China a month ago to start a new role at a reputable financial institution. It aligned with my career goals and I got a pretty good salary bump too.

But boy oh boy - I never imagined this would be a living nightmare. I have a boss who can‚Äôt stop shouting, screaming, mocking at everyone and every little thing. He never listens to anyone. Asks for suggestions, then says drop it because he doesn't want to hear it. Makes me feel uncomfortable with all his random comments. This one time he made a comment about how a new person who‚Äôs joining soon will get up to speed quicker than me. I find him pretty dumb frankly speaking. He has no clarity in his ideas, thoughts, and planning so when you ask him something, he gets super defensive and outraged.

This trickles down to the entire team I suppose. Everyone is either stressed, upset, or frustrated at someone or something. No respect, no boundaries. One senior, Chinese btw came in to my office getting super mad for editing a deck that the boss had asked me to. All I did was correct grammatical errors and typos. I don‚Äôt get why she came at me the way she did. Told me she wanted someone else to take over NOT me.

So basically this place is a circus! Toxic as hell. No respect. No acknowledgements. People say things left and right and get surprised when I confront them. Having worked for government contractors in the US in my short career, I have never seen anything like this before.

I feel depressed and have lost sense of my self worth. I want to quit!! But I don‚Äôt have resources to go back to the US. Haven‚Äôt received my first paycheck yet. I can't believe I left everything behind to come to this and I don't know what to do next.

I asked her why she interviewed me and her response was ""I see someone with your experience and I know that if we don't grow you that you will leave.

Dejected I interview for another Manager role - make it final selection dont get selected.

Again interview for another operations manager role - make it the final selection dont get selected - the director tells me ""Crippled2 your so close and your amazing just keep going""

  
The lead on my client goes out on leave for 6 weeks - fun fact before i left my old company that was my job. So rather than having the person in the Manager role above me cover for the Senior manager while he was on leave. My director comes to me and says ""Crippled2 - can you fill in while he is out?"" I lead meetings, talk through priorities, i run the entire team, my peers in my associate role tell me how great i am as a senior manager and how much smoother things were. I tell them very matter of fact that I've done this job for over 3 years at my old employer this isnt new""

So the senior manager comes back every thanks me for covering, my VP is thankful, and a new manager role comes up. So i interview and wouldnt you know its with the director for which I covered for the senior manager. I interview they both recommend me for the role but its for another Director's group.

I dont get selected for the role - I get pulled into a meeting with that Director and I simply say ""did you see my resume?"" He says ""Crippled2 - honestly I'm shocked your not already a manager or senior manager, i dont even know what to say."" He proceeds to tell me they promoted someone to Manager that was already aligned to his book of business and that rather than move me to his book they promoted that person instead"" He said ever director and even my VP all recommended me for the role and said I was perfect for it, but they didnt want to mess with client alignment. He also tells me I was the preferred choice in every single job i applied for in the last 4 months. He said i literally have no feedback for you, you should have this job and if i had another opening i would give it to you""

  
I told him i feel like I'm being penalized for putting my career on hold when my wife died of cancer, he said as a father he had no idea that happened to me and really didnt know what to say he could tell i was pissed"".

  
I have a bi-weekly meeting with a leader of my company - who befriended me, this leader has tried his hand to push positions for me and he genuinely cares. I told him I believe i made a mistake putting my career on hold for all that, and he said ""No Crippled2, you did the write thing and this will come back to you, you will see"" I believe I'm going to just lay it out for him that if this is how his company is going to treat seasoned talent that is a huge red flag for sustainability. The fact that i can be recommend by everyone that knows me and i dont get selected just fucking pisses me off.

The worst of it is this manager role is a position i held in 2015 with my old company, this is a role I've done before. I found out in a team meeting today when they announced the promotion that the person i lost my promotion to graduated highschool in 2017 (I was already a senior manager by that time), and he has been in his role for a year, the role I've been in for 3 years because i put my life on hold"" - fuck em"

She changed a bunch of processes and protocols to make herself look good, but the only reason those didn‚Äôt horribly backfire on her is extreme luck. Several things she changed did in fact backfire on her, but she‚Äôs pushed the blame onto her staff. Myself and another person are on PIPs for BS reasons seemingly to try and push any performance issues onto us.

But anyways, the boss, who gets paid double what I get paid and has seemingly shut down any discussions of staff pay increases, scheduled a potluck and invited like 20 people as a celebration of everyone‚Äôs stellar performance because 2 people did the work of 6 people and 16 of those people did the work of 1.

So start spreading rumors your co-workers are going union. Even if they aren't.

Management freaks the fuck out, pulls the chain, calls in the union busters... wastes their time, energy, and money trying to bust a union that isn't even forming.

Then do it again.

And again.

And keep doing it.

Forever.

One of a few things happens - they keep wasting time, energy and money, or they stop believing there is actually going to be a union forming and ignore any such rumors. The former is good (and hilarious) because it means they're wasting money and time and energy.

The latter is better, because it means you can then ACTUALLY unionize in peace, which would also be hilarious."

Due to caregiving for family members and I don‚Äôt have that availability and have told them when I have availability I‚Äôll cover a shift.

I do maybe once a month. I didn‚Äôt cover often the first time I was employed by the company and they would only ask about once a month.

The issue I have now Is that they ask everyday, up to three times a day though a system that all schedulers have access to.

About two weeks ago when I rejected a shift I was asked if I have the exemption from the Staff Member that did my onboarding paperwork.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The opposite happened today.
A local petite bourgeois person offered me a no strings attached scholarship so that I can pursue my goal of becoming an academic.

Currently I'm in between things and have been searching for money. I decided to find some part time work so that I can focus on my research work and study. 

I go to this public park for exercise, and often have lengthy discussions with this person who's come from a very small village and has managed to grow a business in this city over the years. He reads left leaning books.

He's a genuinely nice person, my only complaint is that he praises me too much. 

Anyway, he asked me how much money do I need monthly, because he wants to help me focus on studying and doing research. He said that when he was a young person in this city, someone had given him the money kept in front of the gods to help him get started and he wants to do the same for someone who needs help.

It was nice that he offered, I politely declined anyway. I have some money saved up, and I will be getting an offer soon (not sure how much yet) and I can find some source of money. 

But it's interesting to see that this kind of bourgeoisie also exist. The previous person was born in privilege and was oversaturated with all the sweet things in the world, so much that it spilled out from his pores as toxins.
This other person came from the soil and became a tree, offering some shade to tired travellers.

I'm not looking for advice, but want to tell my story.  Currently, I'm in charge of 5 CNC machines and 2 multi-million dollar stone saws on the night shift where I work.  There is of course, an\\ expectation to perform, which I'm fine with, the goals are close to realistic and there is some movement from leadership to help make them happen.  That said, I worked a 6 day week two weeks in a row, with the second sixth day a Sunday morning (I'm normally 2-12:30 Mon-Thur).  I worked the Sunday to A: take some pressure off of my younger brother who is the manager on days, and B: Earn the bonus.

  
Outside of this, I've taken over the manager position on the night shift in this factory, with the promise of a 2.00 raise (this is eclipsing a year, and a standard raise for CNC operator, so I'm a bit shafted to begin with).  I'm not an experienced saw operator, and management has saddled me with two noobies on the saws.  I've got the two other CNC operators on nights trained well and they are capable at this point, but I'm lacking in the ability to support the sawyers.  I've been coming in early/days off to learn the basics of running and programming the saws so that I can help the new sawyers.  These hours are clocked.  The plant manager supports this.  He's a reasonable, intelligent person, but ultimately there a lot of corners cut on the production side so that he can earn his bonuses.

  
My latest pay period should have had both the bonus and pay raise attached, neither are there...

  
So tomorrow, since I'm now in the corporate e-mail, I will e-mail and then call him, asking when I should expect to see the bonus and back pay.  If there is any bullshit involved, my exact response will be this:

  
'I like you and understand you are an intelligent and reasonable person with some leadership qualities.  If this was not the case, I would not be employed at this location at this company.  However, this is not my first rodeo; I know who I am and what I am worth.  I do not chase carrots on sticks, nor do I leave money on the table.  I expect this issue with payroll to be addressed post haste or I will be started at a better paying job this coming Monday.  Again, no hard feelings toward yourself, but I come here and perform my duties for compensation, and I expect that compensation to be correct.  Best Regards, XXX.'

  
Keep in mind this kind of response will not earn you corporate bonus points nor will the boss you send it to promote you again.  However, this is exactly the kind of response you should be prepared with if you get jerked around on money at your job, especially if put in the impossible situation/overly high expectations."
4609,2024-05-18,Not having children is the only way to end capitalism and fix the cost of living and housing crisis,u/d8gfdu89fdgfdu32432,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cuutr6/not_having_children_is_the_only_way_to_end/,antiwork,"It's the only way to break the system. Politicians will do nothing to fix the problems. Most people can't protest due to being unable to go long without income. Rioting will have a riot squad sent after you. However, having children? There's nothing the government can do to force you to have children, and it even saves you time and money. By having children, we are just fuelling the system and keeping it alive. Why would capitalists ever do anything if their population keeps growing and they keep getting richer?

# Why is not having children important? 

Capitalism relies on constant population growth to fuel economic growth. Without population growth, economies would stagnant or fall. A [study](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26651/w26651.pdf) found that an annual population decrease of 0.5% would cause a population to stagnate. Larger decreases would result in economic decline. They also found that **GDP per capita rises as population declines and that in the long-run, GDP per capita would rise to 7.4 times the values from January 2020** if population declined by 1% annually. This would **solve the cost of living crisis**.

Population decline would also solve the housing crisis because a constant supply of housing would enter the market from people dying. Housing supply would eventually exceed demand, making housing affordable.

Employers would also need to treat employees better because people will keep becoming scarcer. Employees will become less replaceable and more valuable since there are fewer people to replace them. 

Governments are also placed into a situation where they are forced to fix population decline. They only have 2 options:

* Fix population decline, or
* Go extinct and have the economy crash

I assume they would take the 1st option since even the countries with the lowest fertility rates, e.g. South Korea and Japan, are trying to fix their population decline. This means addressing the root causes, such as poor work life balance, high cost of living, and etc. They have tried [throwing money at the problem](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/12/asia-worlds-lowest-birth-rates-baby-bonus-not-working-singapore-south-korea-hong-kong-japan/) and found that it's failing completely. 

Finally, the environment would be better since a smaller population means lower consumption and hence impact on the environment.

# How close are we to population decline? 

Actually, not that far. There are several projections for world population. Most of them show the decline starting in 2050-2060. The 2022 UN projection shows 2100 but more recent fertility rate data shows fertility rates have fallen much faster than the UN predicted, so the UN low variant projection is likely more accurate.

However, there's a large detail that these projections don't show: almost all future population growth  comes from undeveloped countries, particularly Africa. For example, the [UN mentioned](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/wpp2022_summary_of_results.pdf) that ""Countries of sub-Saharan Africa are expected to continue growing through 2100 and to contribute more than half of the global population increase anticipated through 2050."" If Africa was excluded from these projections, the world's population would already be declining in 2030. Considering not much immigration comes from Africa, it would be fair to exclude it for most developed countries.

Also, fertility rates are falling much faster than all these studies anticipated. For example, [Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00550-6/fulltext) predicted South Korea's fertility rate to remain at 0.82 all the way to 2100, but it's already at [0.72 and projected to fall to 0.68 in 2024](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-29/south-korea-world-lowest-fertility-rate-plunges-in-2023/103525770). Another example is China. Lancet predicted its fertility rate to fall from 1.23 in 2021 to 1.16 in 2100, but it was already at [1.09](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3244794/china-population-falling-fertility-rate-unavoidable-norm-beijing-told-focus-should-shift-people-not) in 2022. Due to much faster fertility rate declines, world population (excluding Africa) may start declining before 2030.

# Criticism

Many people will bring up immigration as a solution to population decline but the top 2 countries which immigrants comes from are China and India. Both of these countries have been projected to face population collapse in the future, so immigration would also be lower. Basically, if the fertility rate of emigrating countries fall, there would be less people to emigrate.

Another issue are higher pensions due to an aging population but that would be insignificant compared to the gain from higher GDP per capita and home ownership. Think about it. Lower mortgage repayments and not having to pay rent for decades saves you far more than a pension. Remember that GDP per capita was [predicted to increase](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26651/w26651.pdf) to 7.4 times January 2020 levels, which means having 7.4 times more money."

My company typically orders from a local pizza place for any sort of retirement, party, holiday. We get an assortment of sandwich trays typically on an extended lunch and then expect to go back to work. So, our Christmas party was going to be different this year, they planned it for December, a couple days before the holiday. If I recall, it snowed pretty hard that day/week so the party got cancelled and rescheduled to May. Yes, may, 5 months down the road. Yesterday upon arriving at work there was a notice for all employees that the Christmas party was cancelled again and to the final ‚Äúappreciation for employees‚Äù will be to work through your lunch on the Friday before memorial day(we have off) and they will do an early dismissal and pay you for a full 8.

63,2024-05-18,i think i just got fired for injuring myself at work,u/Analord158b,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cuwcvu/i_think_i_just_got_fired_for_injuring_myself_at/,antiwork,"TL;DR I injured my back because of ridiculous uniform rules and 0 health and safety, I was lured into a meeting under false pretences and lied about, then fired.

on a 2 month contract, working the post room for some awful private school that charges ¬£50k a year when most of the school budget seems to be spent on marble topped desks and shoddy artwork

I thought I'd be walking around with a trolley delivering letters but my job was actually ferrying 20kg+ worth of parcels from one end of the school to the other, dragging them along the floor in a bag. I would then organise them, catalog them and contact anybody who had a package, so lots of lifting and carrying. Any other department would be allowed to request the estates team to carry packages, who would wear appropriate, comfortable, unrestrictive clothing and use a trolley to transport them. Me, it was slim fitting suits and shoes only.

A week later I changed to my normal clothes, this was very much not allowed so I changed back to shirt and trousers, just not so slim-fitting. Nobody said anything against it, my manager in fact commended me for dressing appropriately. I started to notice teachers, other admin staff, anybody really, wearing trainers, these were all people that faced students far more than me, they also dealt with the principal, parents of students whereas I didn't really, I spent most of my time in a room at the back of the school, a dusty little hovel that had lift-up windows that were sealed shut. One rule for me, one rule for everybody else.

There was a large, plastic box that held exams,  it was wider than me, heavy alone but would be much heavier depending on how much is in there, and would have to be placed on top of a cabinet that was nearly a foot taller than me. I was hurting my shoulders constantly doing this, and I was not provided with a step ladder to level out the height, in fact it was such a small space the myriad of amazon boxes that were delivered were often in front of that cabinet, making it more difficult.

I put the box in an area on the floor, my heel caught it and the force went straight up my back, and I now have muscle damage in my lower back. I went home early and had a total of 1.5 days off. I was interrogated over the phone, and the day I went in my manager immediately tried to paint it as my error, i disagreed.

Lunch time came, I was lured into an office for a 'back to work meeting' where HR was on Teams, and I was told my work ethic was poor(nobody said anything previously, I was consistently told I was doing a good job), my personal presentation was poor (by the same woman who thanked me for dressed appropriately) and that I had lied on the phone about hospital opening times (how could she know? she didnt even know the name of my hospital, I had to repeat it to her 3 times on the phone, so there is no way she could have told me the operating hours) 

I was offered no representation, no time to prepare, I was lied to about the reason for the meeting. And worst of all watching her putrid, piggy face smirk when she felt she had caught me in a lie made my feel physically sick (she didn't btw, she lied about me calling her at a certain time, I have screenshots proving there was never even a phonecall at the time she stated, I had been calling starting 90 minutes before she said)

She was so smiley and nice up until the morning when she tried to make me blame myself for my injury, when I said 'well it's not like there's much place to put the box' which she then stormed out and an hour later I was lied about and fired. In the meeting she told me they had THEIR health and safety person do a risk assessment, conveniently they had removed nearly all documents from the box and calculated the weight down to the individual sheet of paper and then used it against me. This does not negate the fact I had to lift it onto something taller than me without the aid of a step ladder (which I also have proof of)

The only upside is that when she tried to break the news that 'it's just not working out' I just said ok bye, walked out and got my things. She followed me into the office and said 'I need your lanyard then I need you to LEAVE.' It is amazing how this subsection of mildly educated, overweight middle classes will patronise you, treat you utter contempt, outright lie about you, smirk in your face while doing it but two simple, non swear words send them into a self-righteous frenzy."

I don't know about other places, but up here we have Labor Laws and Employment Standards that employers have to follow. THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM.

Certain fields of occupation do bend the rules slightly to accommodate for the nature of the occupation ie. nurses & oilfield workers., but there are basic rules such as what constitutes overtime, when overtime kicks in & must be paid, wages, how long they have after termination before they MUST pay you out, rules surrounding the age of workers (children/students are not supposed to be exploited the way they were when I started working at 13), etc., etc.

And if you aren't sure, things are searchable online, there are phone numbers you can call to ask and, they will go to bat for you if an employer is breaking the law.

It's crazy how much power and authority the workers that I've met attribute to their bosses...

""What do you mean they have to pay me overtime?""

""I thought they could pay me anything they want? They're the boss, aren't they?""

""The right to refuse unsafe work? What does that mean?""

""What's hazard pay?""

""They said I wasn't allowed to take a break.""

""I've never heard of OH&S... What's that?""

""You mean our boss ISN'T allowed to lodge 7 workers to a one bdrm apartment AND keep most of our wages as rent?"" << this one was a temporary foreign worker situation. White guy running a Dairy Queen exploiting a bunch of workers from India. Fucking appalling & made it into the news back in 2012 or so. Happens all the time up here in so many employment fields. 

I know things are tough. I've seen employers do this to my fellow workers for as long as I've worked from young kids to old timers. 

It's maddening and wildly sad. 

I fucking hate the leverage those shitbirds have over people. And many don't know, so nothing gets said or done, workers are abused and wages are stolen.

My most recent fellow worker that I can think of who went through things of this nature is only 19. 

We calculated that there are at least 4 restaurants in our community that owe her a few thousand dollars EACH in wages. She started waitressing at 14. Employers fired her for not being able to work more hours over the evenings and weekends, even though she was a minor + a student. She never recieved overtime when she worked over holidays or summer breaks. Recieved far less than the minimum wage for pay. Stole her tips. Didn't allow her to take breaks at any point in her shifts. And so on.

And she believed all of this to be normal. Didn't question a thing. Never got her stolen wages back. She had no clue that she could challenge any of it. 

So I encourage anyone to empower themselves by researching the laws and learning your workers rights. I'd imagine that some places are harder than others to deal with if there isn't something like Employment Standards available. 

But holy fuck, this shit isn't okay. 
It was never okay."
5,2024-05-18,Megalomaniac boss,u/Successful_Rope249,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cuxq8b/megalomaniac_boss/,antiwork,"I joined a start up company as a part time finance manager. In the interview the founder said that he thought I had the accounting skills and he could help me take the next step in terms of looking at strategy etc 
I started the role and was building out processes for basic financial procedures that weren't there before. I was thinking that this was his plan to get this stuff out of the way first.
Then a high ranking woman got called to a dismissal meeting and fired on the same day. At the time I didn't think too much of it as I had been cc'd in emails where she had been less polite to the clients than I would have been - I thought potentially they were right to fire her but did it in a bad way.
Her grievance was that the founder was sexist though at the time I thought this was maybe bitterness.
Then I have my probation meeting (10 days after my probation lapsed) and my probation period has been extended by 2 months. In the last 3 months I haven't received a single communication to say that my performance was unsatisfactory on anything non minor. Apparently the problem is that I'm not providing the higher level management service they wanted from me as in analysis and suggestions for strategy. They say I have the ability to do this..I've never been encouraged or asked to do this or treated like a high level member of staff and I've not been provided with any meaningful ways to meet their criteria.
On this I had a look through the employee files and can see that around 8 women have been dismissed over the last few months. Noone who has been described as a poor performer has successfully improved their performance since their appraisal and they've been dismissed. There was hardly any documentation and what little documentation there was did not give valid reasons for dismissal. Reasons for dismissal included 'poor body language, 'lack of poker face' and 'having a drink at the company social'."

(Was never something I felt I needed/wanted to pay for, so I always had other alternatives and I had never been late for work due to it even once.) 

This job is an office job that doesn't require relocating to other facilities or frankly even driving of any sort so I don't exactly get why it matters lmao
I also told them i'd relocate. 
But anyways - now I need to back track on every single plan I already made and crawl back to my old job like a fool. If this was so important to them, I don't get why they let it go so far/didn't ask during the interview. 

Note- even on their application website I even clicked I do not drive and they ignored that. 

They encouraged me to comeback once I get my license but this rubbed me the wrong way and I think i'll be staying far away from now on. "

Looking for answers.,u/NEBC14,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cv4fn6/possible_tip_theft_looking_for_answers/,antiwork,"My (20m) girlfriend (18f) has been working at a restaurant in BC, Canada for 14 months now. Her manager, named Jane for this story, seems to have a monopoly over tips. It is important to say she also serves. While servers get their tips, she hires young ‚Äúhosts‚Äù to do everything from clear tables and take orders to do takeout orders for her. My biggest red flag has to do with the takeout orders. My girlfriend has been doing takeout orders 5 days a week for 14 months, since she started working there.  Jane demands she uses her own login when doing these orders. This means that Jane takes home ALL the tips from takeout orders, even though my girlfriend has been doing all the phone calls and taking the payments once they are picked up. Is this legal? I did some math and realized Jane has made almost $45000 just off my girlfriends work doing takeout. I feel this is tip theft and should be considered stolen. Am I out to lunch? Thanks everyone. 

TL;DR: My girlfriend has lost out on $45000 in takeout tips over the past 14 months because her manager, who also serves there, makes her use her account when taking online/takeout orders. "

I work as a specimen processor in a large lab in my state. I've worked my way up over the past few years, learning all the different facets of the job, such as what specimens are suitable for which tests, canceling tests, contacting clients, and resolving complex issues regarding our clients and other departments. I used to really enjoy my job because I enjoyed how everything worked together and ultimately I enjoy healthcare because I know what I'm doing can help somebody get the results that they may need to save their life.

Sure, it can be a little stressful sometimes, but I used to think I thrived under stress and to be honest the money is pretty damn good, as we get raises for every new skillset that we learn. But things have begun changing with the reorganization of leadership.

For those of you that work in this field, or in healthcare in general, you may know that mandatory over time is sort of a given in certain times of year or during staff shortages. I'm not disputing that. But what's been happening in the past year or so has been absolutely insane and I think it's killing me and my co-workers.

We've begun losing a lot of the more long-time processors as they either move on with their lives or they do not get along with the new leadership. Unfortunately, the workload does not reflect this and that gets spread across more people, and not only that, but our sales team is so desperate for their commission that they keep signing on new clients even though we are not getting any new employees.

Just this past month we've signed on so many more new clients and the workload has exploded. What's gone from the occasional 1 to 2 hours overtime has now shot up to a daily 11 hours a day and we are definitely suffering for it. My supervisor who was appointed only in October keeps on telling us ""we are a business first. Our goal is to make money. But the more revenue we make, the more people we can hire on."" As if that's how it works. What the hell do we care about how much money the company is making if we are only seeing that through overtime that is beating our asses and we are not getting any raises even though we are the ones who are subjected to training the new people?

I, like anyone else, have bills to pay so that's the main reason I've stuck it out for so long. But I honestly fear that this place will soon have a mass exodus and it will just fall apart at the seams. Really, this is more of a rant than anything else, but I really do hate that workplace that I used to really enjoy has just turned into this fucking sweatshop of a situation.

No. I don't choose to require food and shelter to survive, andI can't afford to spend several months being picky with job offers. 

I recently was hired as a chef for a national restaurant. I won't say the name, but it's a bit classier than Olive Garden and the name rhythms with Sona. 

Anyways, I signed 18 documents before being given my schedule. 18. These contractual documents sign away my right to file a wage dispute with the department of labor, sue the company for harassment or discrimination, and also requires servers to waive their right to minimum wage if they earn at least 30 dollars a month in tips. That's right. In the United States of America, this company is allowed to pay servers $2.75 an hour, plus $30 in tips, or under $500 a month for full-time hours. 

Why is this allowed? Why don't workers have any damned leverage in this country?"

Sure there are multiple reasons RTO is getting pushed, but this might be a larger reason why. The long term goal for business \*is\* work from home, but what they'd mean be that is as jobs can be untethered to an office they can then also be laid off and outsourced to third world countries. And the cheapest way to make any transition is nice and gradually, not all at once. Plus let's say they could move every work from home job out of the country all at once. The shock to the system would get people to actually pay attention, organize, get political. No, businesses also need this to be gradual so the frogs in the pot don't realize all the office jobs are disappearing entirely, being outsourced or replaced by ai, and the only work that's left is minimum wage labor or starving."

First off, there are COUNTLESS job scams out there but they‚Äôre especially common if you‚Äôre looking for remote work so my guard is ALWAYS up.

Well Im currently applying and a recruiter called me (from an unknown number obviously). 

From firsthand experience, I‚Äôve learned to be EXTRA skeptical if I get a call from a recruiter for a job I did NOT apply for. Red flag #1 

And look, I don‚Äôt mean to be unkind, but  English was not his first language, which is fine by me but I could not understand him and had to ask him to repeat himself multiple times. It was extremely awkward and difficult to communicate with him. And the harsh reality is that a language barrier is not great for building trust or rapport.

Then he tells me about a job opportunity but is very obviously trying to ‚Äúclose the deal‚Äù by getting me to apply. I‚Äôve done sales before and he was trying to ‚Äúimpulse‚Äù me into wanting this job. The language barrier combined with him rushing me was red flag #2

I didn‚Äôt immediately say no because I wanted to keep my options open. I just went through with the first steps of applying so I could review the opportunity later and get off the phone. 

After thinking about it, I started to seriously question whether I wanted to pursue it any further. The pay would‚Äôve been great but the whole thing seems like a scam, no health benefits and it‚Äôs in the real estate industry, which I don‚Äôt want to work in.

In hindsight, I should‚Äôve just emailed him ‚Äúnever mind please withdraw my application‚Äù but I still hadn‚Äôt fully decided. 

The next day, he texts me ‚ÄúHi [My name]‚Äù which I found unprofessional for a recruiter to send such an informal text like that?

And then immediately calls me to schedule an interview. I said ‚ÄúI thought about it and don‚Äôt want this anymore‚Äù and then he WOULDNT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

He seemed SO UPSET and was like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not going to find another job that pays this much in this market‚Äù

And I‚Äôm thinking to myself ‚ÄúNo shit Sherlock! This job is obviously a scam. If the company is able to offer that much $$ then they should be able to offer benefits and use an experienced recruiter who doesn‚Äôt pressure people through the application‚Äù

I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs following a sales process that the recruiting company teaches him, and his behavior is prob ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in the recruiting world but I don‚Äôt think this shit should be normal.

This is my career. This isn‚Äôt a phone plan or used car. Stop trying to sell me a job and push me into a decision. 

And also it should NOT be normal for recruiters to text/call applicants out of the blue without sending an email first. It‚Äôs pushy because they call and then you feel pressured to give them an answer right there on the phone. 

Well I learned some lessons from it. If a recruiter calls me out of the blue, I‚Äôll just ask them to send an email so I can review on my own."

On the day I was supposed to be fired, I resigned instead, knowing I was at fault. My manager, who texted me yesterday, didn't even want to hear my resignation because HR was ready to fire me. After I left the company, I didn't hear from her for two months.

Then, out of the blue, I receive this text from her as if nothing happened. I just ignored the message.

These egotistical douchebags cared more about hyping themselves up than actually improving their product

When times were good, they invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into courses, masterminds (so they could get selfies with ppl like Russell Brunson and Dan Kennedy), company retreats, hiring a bunch of new employees so they could get on the INC 5000 fastest growing companies list‚Ä¶

And they even dropped over 100k making a documentary about their company, and the doc did NOT generate ONE SALE.

It‚Äôs like they were high off all the schmoozing and marketing assets that propped them up as ‚Äúindustry leaders‚Äù

The team would be scrambling trying to finish one project at bare minimum quality, and then the bosses would be like ‚Äúhey we‚Äôre gonna start another podcast‚Äù and it‚Äôs like BRO let us work on actually IMPROVING the service rather than feed your narcissistic shiny object syndrome!!

And then when the economy took a dive all the shortcomings in their business came to light and clients started dropping like flies.

The bosses blamed it all on the recession, but the truth is, they were so shortsighted they thought their business was recession proof

Turns out a lot of their initial success was due to luck and confidence, not actually providing a valuable service to clients.

So the layoffs started. I survived round 1. They actually gave me a raise shortly after, and then did temporary pay reductions 2 months after my raise lol. (They basically gave me a raise and then took it away.)

I worked my ass off trying to do my part to keep the company afloat but it was a sinking ship. There were several more layoffs after that, so I wasn‚Äôt surprised when my time was up. But get this:

During the call, I asked them ‚ÄúOk, what do I need to know for off boarding?‚Äù

And they had no answer. They‚Äôd laid off dozens of people at this point and didn‚Äôt have the decency to write some bullet points on a google doc to go over next steps. Fucking unprofessional losers.

They literally said, ‚ÄúWe hadn‚Äôt really thought about it, but what would be very helpful for US is if you could send over any information you have that could help us take over your assignments‚Äù

I responded, ‚ÄúNo. I need to put my energy into finding a job, not teaching you how to replace me‚Äù

So yeah, these two narcissistic douche bags who ran their company into the ground and kept bragging about how they landed on the INC 5000 fastest growing companies list are now facing bankruptcy, and had to layoff their entire US team, except for two or three people.

Here are some more grievances I want to rant about:

They once threw a company retreat with the sole intention of making a documentary and use us as props to hype themselves up. They hired a videographer to record us for their documentary and got everyone on the team to give testimonial interviews talking about how amazing our bosses are. It was incredibly emotionally manipulative. The video is still on YouTube and they ended up laying off all but 2 employees in that video.

they would always say  ‚Äúwe‚Äôre like a family here‚Äù and I begged them to stop saying that bc it‚Äôs a massive red flag to new hires but of course they didn‚Äôt listen or care.

One of my bosses thought he was a sales Psychology god and charged $500 an hour for his consulting.

(he always bragged about how he was once so poor he had to sell plasma to pay the light bill. He portrayed himself as a self-made man. Well turns out his dad actually wrote him a big check so he could start his first business lol.)

This douche nozzle used to always say: ‚ÄúMoney is like a good woman. If you don‚Äôt treat her right, she will leave you and find someone else who will.‚Äù well, guess what his girlfriend left him and now he‚Äôs facing bankruptcy lol.

About a year into my employment, I lost a lot of weight and it was noticeable on a zoom call and my other boss said I had gotten a lot ‚Äúsexier.‚Äù Fucking creep

That same creep once moved into a penthouse apartment in Chicago, and gave the team a virtual tour bragging about how he had ‚Äúmade it‚Äù Meanwhile, nobody on that call was making enough money to afford basic expenses.

Anyways, I‚Äôm just excited to be out of that industry. The whole ‚Äúgrindset marketing podcast bro‚Äù phenomenon needs to fucking die once and for all

I've been at my job for over 12 years. I have been in my current position for over 7. I am currently the only full time trainer for company at my certification level. I train all new employees as well as do continuing education for our current employees. There is another full time trainer at a lower level and then multiple per diem trainers who pick up shifts here and there. My boss clearly prefers my counterpart as they frequently have meetings without me despite my skills being useful in those meetings. He's closer to her age and they I guess they just get along better (I'm older than my boss). My yearly review was due over the winter and I still haven't received it despite getting a raise (company wide raise to everyone at my level)  and my counterpart received his. I have been actively looking to promote to either supervisor or out of the department. Promoting to supervisor would give me a worse schedule (probably weekends) and I have a toddler who I want to enjoy time with. 

I easily have the credentials to do my boss's job but it seems like the hierarchy here does not allow me to jump over the supervisor position.

I recently attended a training class where the instructor was showing new programs and technology for online learning that is going to be rolled out for the entire company (extremely large healthcare system of almost 90k employees). I have been an admin for the previous program and have been developing education for 7 years now so I would still be doing that for my current department. The head instructor mentioned a specialized team is being formed to transfer all current education to the new program and then to continue creating content for the entire company. After the class was over I approached the instructor to clarify and item or two and she admitted that she wanted me to be on that team and requested me specifically because I took to the old program well and I have the credentials to be important to the team. I was so excited as this is exactly something I'm looking to transition to do. She then proceeded to tell me that not one but two people at the manager and director level told her I could not be on her team as I am ""the only one who does what I do and I can't be lost."" 

This pissed me off to no end. I'm stuck in a job that I get little recognition for, and no lead titles or stipends for the extra work I do/credentials I have. We used to have a training department of 6 at my level and now we've downsized to myself and someone less certified. I do the work of 3 people and get nothing out of it. The company touts itself as a place that is all about helping people promote and move up and yet I'm being held down. So frustrating.

Only silver ray is that when the job is posted publicly I can apply and hopefully get in."

I'm an 18-year-old guy, and I've been thinking a lot lately about the way our society and economic systems are structured, and I can't help but feel like we're being scammed. Hear me out:

1. **Education System:** We're told to spend years in school, accumulating massive debt, with no guarantee of a job that pays enough to cover that debt. Is the education system setting us up for success or for financial enslavement?
2. **Job Market:** Many people work long hours in jobs they don't like, with little to no job security, just to make ends meet. Meanwhile, the wealth gap keeps growing, and it seems like the system is designed to benefit a select few.
3. **Housing Market:** The dream of owning a home is becoming increasingly unattainable for many, with sky-high prices and interest rates. Are we being set up to be lifetime renters, funneling our hard-earned money into someone else's pocket?
4. **Healthcare System:** In many countries, healthcare is a massive financial burden. People go bankrupt over medical bills, and it seems like the system prioritizes profit over people's well-being.
5. **Government and Taxes:** We're taxed heavily, yet essential services like infrastructure, education, and healthcare are often underfunded. Are our taxes being used effectively, or are they lining the pockets of the wealthy and powerful?
6. **Investment and Savings:** Traditional investment vehicles often have high fees and low returns for the average person, while the wealthy have access to more lucrative opportunities. Are we being scammed out of our financial growth?

I know these are broad strokes, and there are many nuances to each issue, but it feels like the system is rigged against the average person. As someone who's just starting out in life, I don't want to be stuck in this system my entire life.

I'm reaching out to older folks here who have more life experience‚Äîwhat advice do you have for someone like me? How can I find an alternative path to avoid being trapped in this system? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences."

I feel really bad because they all made me feel like I was part of them, gave me advice on the job, and really welcomed me as part of their own. The reason I feel bad is because my position at work required to be for a male, and my supervisor said I was the last missing piece for the company. Now that I want to quit, I‚Äôm essentially leaving the guys short staffed. I don‚Äôt want to quit in person because then I‚Äôd have to walk in the office and even if they don‚Äôt say anything to me I know they‚Äôll probably give me looks of disappointment or something.

61,2024-05-18,Got fired :(,u/Remarkable-Tip-4080,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cvdwi3/got_fired/,antiwork,"I have been working at a local bakery mainly as a cashier for just over a month; my only other job experience was working for 2.5 years at a retail store during high school (I liked the job but I left because I was starting college and needed to focus on my education). 

My summer break started last month (April) so I started looking for a summer job. I landed one at a bakery about 30 mins from home, and I was excited to start because I have been to this bakery before and their baked goods are just incredible, I am impressed every time. 

I went in for my training shift and I was incredibly overwhelmed because it was extremely busy, even though they wanted me in on a day that they thought wouldn‚Äôt be that busy because they didn‚Äôt want me to be overwhelmed lol. I was so lost during that shift and thankfully I got some help from the other workers, but I was mainly by myself. 

Then my next shift was about a week later so I kinda forgot some of the things I learned during the start of my shift, but then adapted a bit more quickly than last time. I saw that I was getting 1 shift per week so I asked if I can have more shifts, and they said they will try to get me some more, which ended up with me having about 2-3 short shifts/week which isn‚Äôt really enough for me, but I was happy that they were fulfilling my request anyways, and I figured I would ask them about more shifts a bit later so I wouldn‚Äôt come across as annoying/desperate (maybe this is the cause?)

All of these shifts took place on busy days during busy times so there was no time to get to know my coworkers personally, like not even talk with them about anything except about a task we were doing in the moment or something. Then there were maybe 2 or 3 times where it finally wasn‚Äôt that busy so there was a chance to chit chat a little bit. Everyone has been there a long time except for me so naturally everyone was already talking with each other and not to me. I‚Äôm an introvert and I also have social anxiety so it‚Äôs hard for me to start conversations with most people that isn‚Äôt to do with work, especially in a group setting such as this. They weren‚Äôt being mean or cold, it just seemed like they forgot I was there and their conversations seemed to have a lot of inside jokes which would have made it kinda weird if I tried to join in. Plus I didn‚Äôt want to set off a bad impression by engaging in chatting when I could be doing something more productive instead, so I was keeping myself busy while the others were talking. Maybe once or twice they would ask me how my weekend was or something and I would respond and act interested in how their weekend was, but they ended up talking with each other again. I kept reminding myself that I‚Äôm new and that my main purpose was to work and maybe through time I would find something in common with the others there and be a part of their ‚Äúgroup‚Äù.

Then today I got a call from work and it was one of the managers (not the owner) telling me in the nicest way possible that the owner of the bakery doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a good fit for the company. I was shocked and extremely sad because I actually liked working at this job and other than the fact that I‚Äôm not a chit chatter, I couldn‚Äôt think of a reason why I wouldn‚Äôt be a good fit. A few times they asked me to cover a shift when someone called in sick, and I came in each time, and my attendance was excellent and I wasn‚Äôt late except for 1 time where I was 1 minute late, plus I stayed longer than I should have a few times as well. I didn‚Äôt complain about anything nor did I make any huge mistake that may have costed the company something (of course I made some minor mistakes which the manager helped me with them and said it was completely okay and that it‚Äôs a way of learning). She even praised me for my work a few times which made me feel even more motivated. 

The bakery has some products that contain peanuts and tree nuts, which I‚Äôm allergic to. If I wear gloves while handling these products, I‚Äôm completely fine. I even let the bakery know about this when they hired me but still, perhaps this is a reason?

After the call, I just sat in silence for like 5 minutes. This was while I was in the car (I was driving and stopped somewhere to answer the call) and thankfully my boyfriend was there with me so he comforted me and said it‚Äôs not fair at all. I understand the laws about firing without a real cause in Ontario but I didn‚Äôt think it would happen to me, and now that it did, it makes me scared that it might happen again with a future job. 

I‚Äôm not looking to sue or anything like that, I kinda just wanna get this off my chest. I still live with my parents at home so I‚Äôm not in desperate need of money right now, but I just wanna be productive and earn some money this summer. I‚Äôm not sure if I should include my experience here at this bakery on my resume or not. Anyways, this post is much longer than I thought and I‚Äôm not looking for pity, although I personally think that firing for basically no reason is kinda unfair. "

Then I was told that night I didn't need to come in at all since they'd be going with someone else.

2. I have Tinnitus. Server lab is noisy even with noise cancellation headphones. Ringing became worse Everytime I spent more than an hour in the server lab.

After 9 months I was put on a performance improvement plan(PIP). I am 11 months into the plan and I found another job. I want to leave now.

However these people spent a lot of money in relocating me.

1. Relocation bonus: 7K

2. Packers/Movers, Temporary storage: 10K?  
3. Temporary accommodation, flight tickets, transportation: 11K?

4. Immigration related expenses: 5K to 10K?

  
My last paycheck would be for around 12K. The total amount I owe them would be 25K? So I would still owe them 13K. 

Any tips on how I can negotiate it down. The contract says that they won't pro-rate the relocation payment if I leave early."

I currently work in the warehouse where our productivity is tracked and graded by a program that scores us on a scoreboard everyone can see.. Well, this program is EASILY manipulated by the employees once they've learned the little tricks to make it seem as if they have performed far better than what they are. I know, because I have to constantly pick up their slack. And I know the tricks but refuse to play that game.

The kicker to this is that the score is tied to a yearly review as well as a monetary bi-weekly bonus if you reach a certain score.

So I go to my manager about it, he basically says its too much to keep track of and is basically annoyed i am even mentioning. I go to HR and they are absolutely clueless on the program and basically tell me ""work is work...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"".  

So yesterday, I am working hard as usual. I finish my section and I go help my coworker with his picks. He is way behind. I get him caught up and look at the score and his has skyrocketed. Highest in the warehouse, per the scoreboard. 

The end of the day comes, I turn in my equipment and I go straight to the manager. At this point, I am flat out angry. I come in a little hot, I'll admit.

""How is it ok, or fair, or even ethical that I spend the last 2 hours of my day picking up my coworkers slack yet his score is through the roof?! How is it ok that we have a bonus and a yearly review tied to a number that is so easy to cheat and you just turn a blind eye to it? These guys are STEALING from the company on 2 fronts, its time theft and monetary theft!"" 

The conversation goes on, im told to calm down. It's hard. I get the run around. And I tell him that if this isn't figured then I am going to have to walk. He says he considers that a threat. So I tell him I am calling the ethics line because they are allowing rampant cheating and theft to take place under their watch. He says ""go ahead, in fact you can talk to my own supervisor, HR, or even the DC manager"". 

I leave, telling them I am about to get on the phone with the ethics hotline. 

I want to quit. I feel like I am going to come back to retaliation and I am just completely unsure of what to do. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place.

The hours were not all there, and as a dishwasher was denied tips at first because their controversial policy of dishwashers being excluded from the tipping pool. 

After just under 3 months of a relatively easygoing working environment, I managed to get included in the tipping pool after making a verbal long-term commitment. At the same time, I was looking for other jobs with full-time hours elsewhere and would retain this position to a minimum of 1-2 shifts a week because almost all positions were part-time. 

A new pizza cook was hired on at the worst possible time which screwed the kitchen over for their chance of extra hours leading up to the Christmas holidays. To make way for the new pizza cook, the other pizza cook was demoted down to being a dishwasher, although it was later revealed that the pizza cook wanted to be a dishwasher. 

To make things more crazier, the pizza cook who became a dishwasher ended up taking my shifts that were canceled on me and the kitchen manager ended up saying this wasn't punishment. I ended up disputing it out of seniority status and felt that I was singled out. 

The kitchen manager accused of guilt-tripping, being a disruption to the business, and all this other nonsense of talking back to employers and had fired me with the owner present as a witnesses who backed up everything that the kitchen manager was saying. 

The kitchen manager ended the meeting saying that my check would be mailed giving off the hint that I wasn't allowed back as a customer. I was pretty angry at their decision and stormed out and group-chatted my now-former co-workers that I was longer employed and not to believe everything that the kitchen manager and the owner had to say about my cause for termination. 

A co-worker who was fired for no reason explained to me that the pizza cook was given my hours because of the difficulty of paying rent. I only learned of the favoritism going on shortly before my unceremonious termination.

I learned that most of my co-workers had left or were fired for all the wrong reasons with the kitchen manager leaving himself to pursue other opportunities, which was a good idea after deliberately ruining a great team.

A number of times,  I have reached the stage where my resume meets initial qualifications then gets reviewed by the SME (subject matter expert) and doesn't pass. It's never for something where I am way out of my element. Quite the opposite. For example, I applied for a position within my own organization and had this happen. I am an environmental engineer for a medium-size city and was previously managing a stormwater permit for a nearby city. Stormwater dynamics are intimately associated with vegetation/land cover. We use it as a variable in hydraulic&hydrological (or H&H) modeling. When I worked for a water and sewer utility we did this as well. I spent three years as a riparian botanist on a Superfund project doing this and coordinating riparian restorations as part of the remediation. 

Yet I apply for this and get rejected. Meanwhile, my state outright includes urban forest management as a compliance and reporting element within the permits I have been managing for for almost 10 years now. I have been the person setting up and running the GIS tools for this shit. Even more, I'm a hydrogeologist and engineer. Kind of critical to understanding the soil and water processes supporting the green leafy stuff above it. 

And of course, they claim to embrace ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" as an organization. Yeah sure. Until it comes to hiring. Then they can't see past the way they've always done it, or the quals of the last guy in the position. Real growth mindset there."

For clarification, I live in Australia and this was last year this happened. I worked at boost juice for 4 months, but I was under employment for 7 months. I was a casual and started my work, did all my training, followed instructions, and let them know when I couldn‚Äôt come in for work. I wasn‚Äôt given proper training as they just did a talk and showed me some things, but not everything that was mentioned on my online training. The owner would come by sometimes and micromanage me, she would count how long I would use the bathroom for, message us in group chats for minor things she didn‚Äôt like, and would give my shifts to other people sometimes. She also had a niece working there and I traded my shift with her and her auntie gave my shift to someone else. There were also other problems such as vegan only blenders being used to make dairy juices, owner would tell me to measure the ice then tell me not to measure the ice next time she came around, correct amount of ingredients weren‚Äôt used, etc. I also felt like I was a good cashier but apparently I wasn‚Äôt upselling enough, pretty much had to ask every single person if they‚Äôd like this or that as an extra in their juice. I messaged HR about some issues I was having there and juices being made incorrectly but I never got a response, also tried contacting the CEO but didn‚Äôt get a response either. I got laid off work after not having any shifts for over 2 months and I didn‚Äôt know it was because I was going to be laid off this whole time. Sorry for the rant, but I just needed to let this all out due to frustration.

TL;DR: Worked in a micromanaged setting, correct procedures weren‚Äôt followed, nepotism, negligent HR, and got laid off after not being given any shifts after 2 months without any word beforehand."

 https://www.uscareerinstitute.edu/blog/65-jobs-with-the-lowest-risk-of-automation-by-ai-and-robots

something popped out. The jobs least likely to be impacted by AI:

""are ones that require human qualities that a robot cannot replicate, such as social skills, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal relationships. Fields that are more creative and don‚Äôt stick to a rigid routine will also lower the risk of AI replacing jobs in that field.""

The thought being, that the jobs we will inevitably have to focus on educating and training most people for will increase the skills far to many people lack, of which contribute to most of the societal ills we now face. This is exciting for a variety of reasons. 

1) Most of these jobs are in fields that are suffering shortages that will be detrimental to society if not corrected. 

2) Most of them are people facing meaning you are going to have to interact with other people to learn them. 

3) The only way we are going to be able to funnel people into these ""AI proof"" careers is to invest heavily in education at all levels and lower or eliminate the barriers of entry to higher education. 

4) Bye and large, these jobs will cause people to interact in ways that we don't currently which in theory should improve our ability to cooperate and relate to one another. 

These are the ideas that first occurred to me but I'm sure there are tons more. There are obviously downsides as removing the vast majority of non-skill specific jobs will hurt a lot of people in the transition period. There will also always be people who will struggle to excel in even the best educational environments and fall behind. For those people, it appears specific-skill vocational trades will be safe for years to come. I don't see AI replacing plummers, electricians, mechanics, most construction jobs, etc any time soon. Then there are the handicapable individuals whose disabilities allow for them to do some menial labor that will be greatly impacted. 

While I understand contraianism and nihilism is the flavor of the day, especially in certain corners of the internet, I am myself an eternal optimist. There will come a point when the concerns of communities, governments and corporations converge. The necessity of investments in education, health and well-being will follow so that people can thrive, governments can function and corporations can continue to prosper. I do think, due to the speed of advancements in AI and the time it will take to adapt to those, there will be a ton of pain that follows. I am however optimistic that the outcome will be a more cohesive and less toxic society as a whole. 

I am interested in seeing what others think about this and what excitement and fears AI invokes in them. As always, be kind to one another, as well as yourselves."

‚ÄúThis is not healthy‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the fuck am I alive‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt handle this shit anymore‚Äù

Are all the things that go through my head on a daily  basis. I can‚Äôt help but feel that I was born solely to serve other people shit, at the expense of my physical and mental wellbeing. 

Nobody, in terms of the consumer, gives a fuck about the employee, about what they go through, how they feel, whatever stress they‚Äôre going through, cuz they‚Äôre seen as robots. The average consumer is no different; they‚Äôre robots too, mindlessly buying shit requiring the service of anybody capable of lifting a finger. 

Nobody at my job seems to understand why they do what they do other than the obvious fact of them needing to pay their bills to make a living; nobody goes to work just for fun, unless you‚Äôre fucking some bitches as a pornstar for a living. 

I get asked daily why the fuck I don‚Äôt just go and find a new job. It‚Äôs not that hard to understand why the fuck I don‚Äôt, considering how any other job at this current level would be the same shit, just a different toilet. People really think that the name of the toilet matters. Fucking idiots. The problem is work. The problem is being alive solely to be a servant. 

I injured my back and groin several months ago. My dick always hurts because I probably got nerve damage or some shit from heavy lifting. You think they give a fuck? HA. They still want me to continuously try shit that would obviously make shit worse. I don‚Äôt owe my job a mother fucking thing. They owe me. 

Look, I‚Äôm not writing this for advice. Fuck your advice. I‚Äôm writing this while on the clock trying to distract myself from my pain, this is for me; but I guess that‚Äôs a dumb way of cathartically dispelling my anguish because it‚Äôs all coming back full force. This anger is too much for my now, nearly anorexic, body to handle. Fuck sleep, fuck eating, fuck working. 

And fuck this subreddit too for making me censor this writing even further. If I offend you then tell me how I offended you so that I can not offend you only to get this shit posted "
119,2024-05-19,Quitting my job over a T.R.A.P.?,u/Easy_Recognition_33,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cvq95j/quitting_my_job_over_a_trap/,antiwork,"I work for a car dealership in Arkansas as a mechanic. I've been at this particular dealer for about a year and a half. I am 1 class/test away from gaining the master certification for this brand, and the class/test is next week. We scheduled the class back in January. 
While handing me the hotel reservation details, they also give me a TRAP (training repayment agreement provision) they want me to sign. It's for 1 year from the date of training and would require me to pay back all associated costs of this training.(only if I quit) For me, that is about 3K. This dealership has a high turnover in management and is a pretty volatile work environment.  We have had 4 service managers and 2 GMs in the last year and a half. With every new manager, come new rules and policies. I have no faith that the current management will even still be here in 1 year and honestly,  I had not planned on staying that long anyway.  When I started at this dealer I had about 85% of my classes and certifications already, so they didn't train me from the ground up. Another thing is that we are required to go to 1 training per year (minimum) to maintain our certification status which means it will be a never ending cycle. I really don't want to sign the agreement,  I feel that they should have presented us with this at the time of sign up for the class, not 3 days before we are scheduled to leave. I make about 125k a year, so 3k is manageable,  but I don't want to pay them shit if I decide to leave. For some context, we had about half of the crew quit last year and go to a competitor. Most of them were rookies and had been through their 1st round of training shortly before they left. Right now I'm trying to decide if the master certification is worth 3k to me. If I refuse to sign they will likely fire me or cancell the class (that will cost them 1200 in cancelation fees) which would cause me to quit at that point any way. Looking for some perspectives as I have a day or two to decide what to do."

But the job has been the cause of some of my flare ups lately. I‚Äôve had friends suddenly come down with acute life threatening situations and been owed back pay from 10 weeks of checks. So I‚Äôm weary to continue that process and want to try and thug it out. 

Today I just had to call out not because I feel sick, per say, but just because I‚Äôve allowed the vitriol and discontentment build to the point where I‚Äôm sickened by the idea that I might be trapped in this state of working a job that is wearing on me physically and mentally, but is allowing me to get some vital help with my quality of life.

2,2024-05-19,From an old email sent to HR in 2014,u/PensiveGamez,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cvskgs/from_an_old_email_sent_to_hr_in_2014/,antiwork,"This is an email I sent to head office HR. Got no response and no action was taken, so therefore it was ignored:



Dear \[Head of HR\],



This is regarding a more serious issue, as you may or guessed from the title. I feel I need to raise this it's possible this might not of been the first time something similar has happened to me.



After about a month of arriving at \[location of work\] I became a training buddy due to my years of experience at cinemas and I have now been performing this duty for many years. Shortly after joining \[cinema brand\] I became a member of the projection team, then during the change over to digital projection I became a digital buddy



Recently the duties have been revamped for both roles, but I have been left out of this. I have discussed this with \[Twit of a GM\] (our new general manager) and he completely ignored any¬†knowledge of all of the hard work I had been doing in these roles over the years. (I informed him that I am a buddy after the first staff meeting) and he stated that I haven't been do the two jobs recently. 



I must state it's hard to do the job of digital buddy, for example when during a power out the important information that you have given to the manager is ignored. leading to further problems.

The digital buddy has to be invited to do their job to delete old files from the server, chase KDMs, and such, so how am I meant to do that job without the invite (it's only in the past week or two that \[co-worker\] has been allowed to do the deletes. I helped in training \[co-worker\] on how to do digital projection when he came to \[location of work\])



In the training buddy section of my job I train new staff when they come in, sometimes management will provide me the forms for the trainee to fill in and sometimes not, this prevents me from correctly performing the signing off of new staff. The management have never informed me of this new box system (which has been implemented only a short time ago), but they have been treating me as a trainer and I have been training people.

\[Twit of a GM\] says that because I haven't been using the box system I'm not a trainer, even though I have been performing that role.



\[Twit of a GM\] has said my up selling is up and down every week, which doesn't set a good standard (yet at the same time saying up selling isn't the reason for not allowing me to be a buddy). 

He complimented¬†me¬†on my customer service saying it was the best, but then insulted the way I look and implied that no one would come to me for help, this is quite bizarre as after talking to him I asked my co-workers that day and they were confused as to why he would say that as they always come to me when I'm there.

To tell you the truth that saying that colleagues do not seek my assistance was the biggest insult to me and is clearly untrue. I try to solve problems before the need to the manager whenever I can.



Regarding my appearance, one shirt they gave me is too baggy but I tuck it in and my other shirt is too small but it looks better in comparison so I try to wear that one (shirt sizing seems to be a problem).



\[Twit of a GM\] informed that when he arrived at the site he was introduced to the managers and buddies at the time (I do not know as to why I was not there, but it could be something to do with \[Old Dumbass GM\], who seemed to have a problem with me because I had requested to move sites and he refused the transfer, or it could have been something else as I was never given a satisfactory reason. 

There were other instances of \[Old Dumbass GM\] behaviour towards me, I provided many ideas to improve the cinema but these were generally ignored.



It is interesting to note that many of the other managers have known that I am a digital and training buddy, but \[Twit of a GM\] and a select few disregard this fact.

I feel that I have been demoted not via any official means, but according to the whims of a few members of the management team.



Soon after \[Twit of a GM\]‚Äôs arrival at \[location of work\] I was asked about my sick days and I answered honestly the sick days were necessary and I have gone over this with another manager. Every time I have been sick, if I have had to visit the hospital (which I was forced to do so by a manager once because of chest pains) I have sent in pictures of the forms and any other information they may need (I still have the emails with all the information I gave). But for some reason I get the feeling am I looked at by him as if I am dishonestly taking those sick days.



Now this is in my file and I have talked to at least one manager at \[location of work\] (and one at \[another location of worked when needed for an event\], now), I have dyslexia with dyspraxic tendencies and also suffer with depression, these are very personal I feel that these are being used against me as they make me very vulnerable to being discriminated against. \[Twit of a GM\] response was that he doesn't know of any of this (which seems to be a line I heard too many times in that meeting).



I've put a lot of time and effort and sometime money in to my job (I brought pens for every person and labeled them so each person would have a pen. I brought torches to light the hawking trolley. I created a spreadsheet to help in the rotation of the posters, etc) and many joked I lived at the cinema as I was there so much, but now I have managed to have a life outside of the cinema and my job responsibilities are been taken away, despite all the years I have put in, it is very disheartening to think my efforts have been wasted



I am certainly not progressing at my current site, and I feel my skills and experience are being wasted. I am only allowed to perform duties I am qualified for when it is convenient to the management.



I suggest the best thing would be for me to get a transfer to a site closer to \[location of where live\] and be reinstated to the role of Digital and training buddy. If possible I would like to work in the \[another location of worked when needed for an event\] sites as I miss working in the \[another location of worked when needed for an event\] and I enjoyed the times I worked at the \[another location of worked when needed for an event\] site as well as visiting the \[different cinema location\] site (I have talked to \[cool manager\] once or twice saying I would love to work with her once again). If not \[\[a nice cinema location I did some projection cover for\] would be nice (where I trained some managers how to use the digital projectors).



Please if you could help me that would be great.

Sincerely,

Pensivegamez"

I work in a call center for an energy company. It is outsourced to the company I work for so we take their calls generally.  
Over the past year close to two I had numerous ""Up skillings""/trainings and the sudden jump to shift work where now I work on weekends with no say in the argument.  
A friend of mine and I had to fight just to get additional pay for working on Sundays.  
And right now I got a large number of skillsets under my belt so I want to check something.  
Is it normal for a call center to have them not increase your salary for each department you are doing, regardless on the large amount of work we do?  
  
Side note: There are some people in this company that do EVERYTHING and basically didn't get a salary increase proportioned to it. And no we don't get a choice as to if we take the training or not Upper management basically tells us we are going to get training for this department and we can't argue against it nor decline it. It is effectively MANDATORY.

I'm in a position right now where I'm working a weekend shift (Sat-Tue) and I want to get off of it. They told me when I was hired that after a certain amount of time I'd be able to move off of the shift, and that time is coming fast. I've let my boss know previously that I am very much looking to move off of weekends and every time its been met with roundabout solutions of swapping shifts with other people or requesting off in advance, never discussing a plan to actually make the change.

I have a meeting coming up to discuss this and I intend to be very clear with my desire to move off of the shift. I'd also like to make it clear that not moving my shift means I'm likely going to start looking for a new job to meet this goal.

Any advice on how to word this without coming across as hostile? I don't want to just say ""take me off this shift or I quit"". I'm kind of worried about strong wording opening the door to retaliation of some kind."

I lost all love and dedication to the job and despite all the perks and benefits and everything being ""at will"" I'm half tempted to give the bare minimum instead of the ""above and beyond"" I've been praised for at this point. 

Could I please get some opinions or advice on this?

It was a great job with good perks and benefits, however, the hours and schedule were long and limiting. No work life balance, just work. 12hr days 6 days a week for the first 2 years. Jobs these days seem like they just want to work people into the ground and drain every minute they can from a person. 

For perspective, I‚Äôm (36m) single father with a bachelors in Communication and Information Sciences and prior military veteran. I started college late due to being active in the military for some time. The job that I walked out on was with USPS. For some reason I panicked and never returned. I just couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around the fact that ‚Äúthis was it‚Äù, the job I‚Äôm investing in for the next 25 years. I left and I don‚Äôt really have a reason why other than reasons I came up with to justify my choice and make me feel better. I felt like I was wasting my degree but ultimately my heart and  mind weren‚Äôt aligned with the job. I didn‚Äôt feel enthusiastic about it even with the substantial pay I could possibly earn. It had guaranteed OT as well. The job just didn‚Äôt appeal to me at all. I felt like I could do better or find something that I‚Äôll be somewhat comfortable with daily and in the long run. 

So now I have feelings of guilt and shame for not following through with a job position I initially intended to do. I‚Äôm so ashamed that I haven‚Äôt even admitted it to my family yet. I don‚Äôt want to ruminate on their perceptions or judgements of me, even though I understand that it doesn‚Äôt matter what they think. This was totally a new situation that I‚Äôve never experienced, so naturally it caught me off guard. I feel like I‚Äôm running out of time by thinking that I should be well established with a job at my age by now, but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm still searching. I plan on finding a job in radio or work my way up to be a radio personality. Is it ok to feel this way, shameful or regretful? Should finding a job be this complicated?  I‚Äôm wondering if there are others out there like me or people that have experienced something similar.

Several years ago, I was hired at one of the biggest sign companies in the world as head of the electrical department at the local branch. The previous lead had left to head up the maintenance department at a big, local commercial electrical company. 

I was brought in as a temp to hire and was hired in a little over a week. I started to tackle the very large backlog they had, doing field work AND paperwork back at the office after hours. I was doing estimates in the mornings and then going out on job sites in the afternoon. I was on call 24/7 for emergencies.

Everything was working out great. I was turning in estimates that were right on target and all of them ended as signed contracts with customers for new work. I brought in many thousands of dollars in revenue. The gen manager even told me I was killing it and that he was stoked that I was on the team.

Fast forward three months. I now had an apprentice I was training who had gotten to the point of taking his own truck out on calls. I streamlined the estimation process to the point where I was cranking out 2 or 3 every day. I even had customers requesting me by name for service and new construction work. I managed some very big jobs at some high profile sites with great success. The salesmen were bringing me with them to help sell, etc...

I came in one day and this new guy was in my office, sitting at my desk. I introduced myself. He said he was the previous lead electrician, nice to meet you and so forth. I was kind of taken aback at that point. The gen manager called me into his office and told me what the new situation was. 

I was now going to be the field supervisor and this guy was in my position as the lead. I had a nice truck to drive around doing estimates. That truck was his now. I had a great office, that was his now.  They told me I had to drive a giant service/boom truck. I was no longer doing estimates. I no longer had an office and had to get all my shit out asap.

I told them I didn't want to drive a service truck and that I was not happy with the new situation. He said OK, don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out!  Let me know if you would like a reference for your new job search! Have a good day! 

I was so shocked I didn't even say anything and just walked out, got my tools and left. I forgot my friggin ladder too. Turns out the scab was the bosses brother in law and he couldn't cut it as the lead at the other company. He came back to take my job away from me.

I was able to obtain a job later on that afternoon. If you don't burn bridges in construction, it's usually very easy to find work. So I wasn't super angry or anything. I know that guy was messing stuff up before I got there, so I am assuming he continued messing stuff up after. This state is ""at will"" so no recourse really, just to move on...

I found a great company (I thought) which was for a position I specialize in which I have 8 years experience. I was chosen to do an interview and everyone was extremely happy, was making them laugh and it was amazing, they than told me it was going to be 3 more interviews which I was surprised but said it's no problem because they told me it will all be done within 1-2 weeks

I got the following email 1 day after moving forward to next steps which was a zoom call with Managers, which also went great he personally told me he would move me forward

I than got the email 2 days later to come back into the office to meet Recruiting managers, this was with 2 people and again went great and told me they will let me know results the following week. I ended up getting the final zoom call meeting with one of the Founders

As soon as I joined the call the founder let out a huge sigh like she wasn't happy at all, but didn't want that to throw me off. She started asking me strange questions that had nothing to do the job. ""What would you do if someone ate your food"" I thought this was some part to lighten up the mood? But anyway she seemed extremely uninterested in no matter what I was saying

I emailed my contact throughout the entire process and she told me they needed 1 week to decide on but they all loved me , no promises 

I waited a week and got no email or phone calls I decided to email her, got no response for a day than called twice she still didn't answer

She finally decided to call me back and say they offered someone the job 3 weeks prior but because they loved me so much they are trying to find a position for me...like what the hell is this? Is this what finding a job is now? Just hoping companies aren't lying to your face and wasting your time? But complain they can't find people.

Anyway I guess this is just a learning experience for me

I work for $22 an hour

My boss recently accepted a new job, installing 3,000+ feet of cat 6, numerous cameras, network switches, digital recorders and signage etc. essentially cable installation and termination for a building security system the size of a Costco. I‚Äôve had 3 hours of experience installing and terminating data, nothing else.

I started to breakdown, overwhelmed with school work and feeling this impending doom that I would fail the semester. I mentally withdrew from everything. I started to pace, I couldn‚Äôt fall back asleep, I started to believe my life was falling apart. I turned off all of my devices. I was so nervous that I felt sick. I felt consumed by this shame. I didn‚Äôt leave my room for 2 days. I have missed calls and messages from my manager.

I know how irresponsible this is. Should I send a mass email to my management and hr? I also have contacted my doctor about this situation.

Is a recovery possible? In terms of work? Any advice on next steps? "

He had to renew his food handlers card and send it to his manager, which he sent via email last night as instructed by his manager. He double checked and the email was correct and it did go through. At around noon today, all of his shifts were released. He tried calling his manager to sort it out but he didn‚Äôt answer and my partner left a message that he did send the food handlers card via email. About 15 minutes later, his manager has another employee call and pass on a pretty passive aggressive message to ‚Äúremind him he has a shift tonight and that he needs to deal with his food handlers card‚Äù. He went to work, gave him a physical copy of the certificate and reminded him he sent it via email last night. Despite that, his manager still approved others picking up those shifts so now he lost all those hours he could‚Äôve. 

How is any of that ok? I‚Äôd understand if he never sent him the certificate but he sent it to him last night just as his manager told him to do. But how can you give someone certain shifts and then just take it away like that? Just fuck the fact that he has bills to pay or groceries to buy I guess. "

35,2024-05-20,So ready to quit (Goodwill employee here),u/MntDewJunkie,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cw9eiz/so_ready_to_quit_goodwill_employee_here/,antiwork,"I work as a cashier at a goodwill in Central Indiana. At first, I was really loving the job. Got me out of my shell, loved the people I worked with, easy tasks but always something to keep me busy, and I loved having more social interaction in general. Only 11 an hour but I didn't really need a high paying job at the time, as  my bf is the breadwinner.

 But quickly the amount of work became very overwhelming and red flags started appearing everywhere. First of all, I noticed they were REALLY big on watching the cameras and reprimanded people for very small, dumb things. I also noticed it didn't seem hard to get fired there, a red flag I will touch on later. 

It really started to go south within 2 or 3 months, when the amount of racks we had to run more then doubled. We are now expected to put out a massive amount of clothing, regardless if whether the store can even hold that much clothing or not.  It actually turned into fairly demanding labor as I am now on my feet for 8 hours non stop rushing around with a hefty load in my arms all while keeping the store clean and running a register. It's  exhausting at this point and it's a non stop rushing around frenzy for me. My arms and legs actually hurt quite a lot after working. (And im a runner who works out daily so im very fit)  I have no problem busting ass. I actually like being active at work, but for 11 bucks an hour, it seems ridiculous and unnecessary. Most of the clothes get purged anyway. It seems they are just artificially raising thier numbers at the expense of the actual laborers. Managers get bonuses but I get nothing but a larger work load.
 
As for the firings, they have been very aunbundant. More than 14 people have been fired just since I put in my app in December. People will get fired over very small things, sometimes with no solid explanation at all. I have also seen MANY people quit, especially recently. 2 just walked out withing a few weeks of eacother. 

They are also unnecessarily strict  about certain things. I had to go to the Dr's twice just to get a note to sit down for a few minutes during my 8 hour shift. I have also been corrected for reading a book in the morning b4 any customers or racks are in the store. We basically are not allowed to be still at all, even in those rare moments when there is legitimately nothing to do.

On top of that, they began moving all of the good workers into the back,  leaving me to do the vast majority of the work. Those were all the people i loved working with . The majority of the people they are hiring now are unhelpful or completely incompetent. Two have been quite obviously geeked out on hard drugs consistently and are therefore useless workers. The cashiers seem to just do what they want now, doing irrevant tasks rather than actually  helping. I am generally the only one working effectivly and not messing around, which means I take the vast majority of the load. It's just wayyyy too much work for 11 an hour. I'm sick of a simple job being made impossible just because management wants high numbers and doesn't care at all about employee loyalty. Good chance i'm putting in my 2 weeks tomorrow

Even in this day and age. Fancy Schmancy grocery store, similar to a store that rhymes with Smolfoods. Store manager thought it was a great idea to go after one of the only black employees in the store and accused him of doing drugs in the parking lot, and demanded he take a drug test. He denied it, took the the test and was sent home until results came back. What do you know, the test was negative. Bruh is back there stocking milk jugs and butter boxes, not performing brain surgery, we dont even have actual forklifts. And this manager decided he must be smoking pot in the parking lot, on his break, and it warranted instant action and removal. The funny thing is, TONS of people at the store smoke/vape on their breaks, some in the bathrooms, some in the fridge. The produce guy is always stoned at night, because hey, he's stocking tomatoes, he should at least be vibing. And the manager is acting like the poor dairy guy was free basing crack in the middle of receiving. Tell me that isnt racially motivated. I really hope he sues for discrimination, because WTF "

Well, he gets angry again, replied that he didn‚Äôt understand why ‚Äòall these resources‚Äô were involved when it was a ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô matter that we could have resolved between ourselves. He stated that my behaviour has also been horrible (which is simply not true), implying that I should apologize to him as well. I responded by saying something like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt agree with some of the things you mentioned, but I think it‚Äôs better to move on.‚Äô 

Later another coworker (whom I know is his friend) gave me a lecture about how wrong I was to go to HR saying that everyone has moments of nervousness and I hand't thought enough how much damage I've done because I'm young and I don't know that much about life (to clarify: he just got a kind of reprimand, that was what I expected and wanted, nothing more). Also hinted that if someone ever reports me ""easily as I did"" I could possibly be fired. 

I'm in honest shock. But well, that's it. Thanks to everyone who has invested some time in giving me advice and support"

The manager said I could not because it was too late to apply but I really needed it as I found myself to degrade mentally as work made me feel worse and not better, so in the end I asked if I could resign but they told me to take the days off to reconsider, I went to travel for a bit, then during the middle they called and asked to send the resignation to the HR, which was surprising, when I returned I found myself removed and not assigned in the schedule, apparently I was under resignation.

This is a weird situation, but honestly I couldnt for the time being handle more of the routines as I was really at a breaking point mentally. So for now I will probably take a break at least a month before considering something new, not sure why I post this as I do not post often about those things. The Job was an outbound call center type of thing, borderline back-office with 10 hours a day in total being wasted so to speak and learning nothing new at this point, the pay was on the low side for european standards. I generally didnt know that companies would see into getting rid of people that easily, likely they used the opportunity as I have seen they change people very rapidly within a margin of 4 months I have seen most people come and go except the older people. Generally management was bad, we had to ask for permission for most of the case handlings to cut costs so basically no initiatives, I only worked there for getting first experiences post college, which was more than half a year as mentioned. As this is antiwork, well I feel like chilling for a month or so, to pull myself together. Being in a stressful situation while under the routine of work was not a good idea and I probably lasted one and a half months under said mental struggle, finding myself needing more and more break-time during the work and simply standing next to a tree relieving the pain for even a small bit. Overall I was productive to the point of even initially having overachieved and getting bonuses for groceries or whatever they apply for, small things like that. At least I saw that I have the ability to learn really fast and adapt even whilst having supposedly ADHD and dyslexia, being on top charts for handling, which provided some confidence. Now I think gaming contributed to my organization skills as I usually play more management oriented games which is a plus. Thanks for your time reading if you reached the end."

Filled out their antiquated on-line application, get a request for an initial interview.  Had to wait 2 weeks as our schedules didn't align.

We talk about the job for less than 5 minutes before the inevitable question: So what is your desired salary range?

I've given up on playing the koy ""I need to learn more about the job and expectations from the hiring manager"" as that ends up just dragging the process another month or two just to find out they are cheap assholes.  At this point in my life, I'd rather just find out day 1 and move on.  I'm making good money now, so I'm not in a hurry to move, but my job has no upward mobility and I've been punching above my salary range for a few years, now.

So I tell them my number, then they tell me the range, which is not only uncompetitive, it's 50% lower than similar postings for the same job.  She said she didn't feel that they had anything that would meet their expectations.  I replied that this could have been avoided if they posted the salary range along with the posting and hung up."

I am not his boss, but we are on the same team. He will sometimes ask me for help and I will give him a pretty clear path of ""Do #1, then #2, then #3, then #4."" Then a few days later he will ask for some help with #1 because some vague reason like ""I had some trouble with that."" I sometimes want to ask, ""Have you tried literally anything?""

So if management wants to fire him or not, that's up to them.

Customers believe they are tipping the person serving them, but the salaried managers get nothing. One manager tried for a while to get the company to disperse the tips, but they have just kept all of it. Not a small amount either, maybe $1500 on a busy weekend. Is this legal?

Fiat (paper) money is a joke. It isn't backed by anything for decades and US/EU stamp it 24/7. We all live through inflation because of this for years now and prices will only go up. Especially the food.
Climate change will help in raising prices. People are born into funds/money and others slave for them. Some build and repair their mansions for peanuts while others raise cattle and prepare it for them and other slaves. I just want to tell you that you shouldn't be stressing too much about toilet paper money, it's meant to control you. Don't let it. Earn as much as you need for food, shelter and entertainment, you don't need big house, new car or other gadgets.

Job is a lie. Although 10 - 15% of them are needed to keep this race going, everything else is a joke. Imagine being fashion designer full time. Then being assistant to fashion designer. Imagine being financial consultant for professional athletes. Your full time job is to remind them not to spend millions in a year. Athletes? They get paid millions in a year and you need 1000 years to earn that money. Hey! They shoot 14% from three point line and not many can do that. Bread and circuses. Athletes are important part of the circus.

Tbh I am wasting time writing this. As climate scientist, I plan on moving away from society anyway. I give this species 15 - 25 years before supply chains, food and everything else goes to hell. Do your part and don't bring anyone into this hellhole of society and live your days enjoying your hobbies. Job, rent and all that, just keeps high temperature in this hell.

I‚Äôve been stuck in a job where I‚Äôm underpaid with a toxic boss. While I hate my boss, I like everyone else. It‚Äôs just that I can‚Äôt work with her anymore, she‚Äôs a micromanager but is so stupid. 

She is rather ignorant and has said many racist and offensive things, she also claims that we‚Äôre ‚Äúfamily‚Äù and uses that as an excuse to yell at her workers and pressure them into doing more than they‚Äôre required to do. As a result, most of her employees are older people who don‚Äôt question her orders and do not know about their own labor rights. She did not even know that full time workers are mandated to have hour long lunch breaks until a year ago‚Äîturns out she had been encouraging her workers to not take the whole hour because the company is a non profit. She always complains about young people not wanting to work for her, but it‚Äôs pretty obvious why they don‚Äôt want to stay. 

I recently accepted a job somewhere else‚Äîit‚Äôs similar to what I do now but the pay is much better, the environment is more progressive, and the people much younger and closer to my age group. However, and this is my fault, I didn‚Äôt realize that my new job only offers employees health coverage until after the probationary period (90 days). This was after I said my last day would be late this month in May. I asked around and HR said if I quit early June they‚Äôll cover me for the rest of the month. 

Here‚Äôs a background‚ÄîI have ADHD and take medication for it. It is a controlled substance and expensive without insurance. 

I asked again last week if I could move my last day, boss kept me hanging and then told me today with barely concealed smugness that she can‚Äôt because she already found my replacement. She said something about how the budget was already finalized and said I could only stay at latest on May 31st. I said there‚Äôs no point and just said May 28th is fine. 

She then said I was ‚Äútaking advantage of‚Äù the company by trying to get them to pay for another month of insurance. 

Idk what else to say, I‚Äôm very lucky that 3 months of no coverage won‚Äôt completely bankrupt me, but to other people that‚Äôs not the case. She‚Äôs done this to previous coworkers as well‚Äîmoved a coworker to part time without any written warning first and he lost his insurance. He ended up transferring because of her. She did the same to another guy, and he quit and got a new job.

I ask about it twice a week and have done so for months. At one point, the review meeting was scheduled on my calendar, and then removed without my notice the day before. 

I‚Äôve been planning on quitting this job for a few months now and had set my sights on the end of June as my last day, thinking that was no possible way that my review/raise wouldn‚Äôt have been delivered by then.

I'm sorry but I just need to vent, I need to get this off my chest. 

I'm extremely lucky to have a job right now in my area with some severe layoffs in my area/environment. I have two degrees in history, can't find a job that utilizes them, can't find someone willing to take me in outside of the job I have now because I'm ""overqualified"" for the position due to my degrees. I tried my hand at teaching public education and that failed, adjuncting was so sporadic it isn't stable enough income to live off of (AND i need to pay for my own insurance), and I can't apply for any proper college locations as a full time employee without a PhD which for those curious, average degree time span for a historian is an additional 6-8 years. 

I had left an EXTREMELY toxic environment in public teaching prior to this job that paid fucking pennies. I'm now at a job that pays a little over COL, but I have to drive an hour to get to it (And work nights). It started great before having to swap departments over insane work expectations and work hour creep \*(see: mandatory 7day weeks+10 hour days during some of those days). 

The department I'm in now was fantastic....and then our company went through restructuring three times in the TWO years I've been here and each time it gets progressively worse. The department I work for now has a HIGHLY inflated workload, so much so that it is literally impossible to achieve the quotas they require. I have been yelled at multiple times for being too slow in processing things \*I work in Quality Control\* and holding up production. I have felt used and abused the 2 years I've been here and it always starts with the creep, the creep of abuse and toxic work flow. I'm sitting here in tears trying to keep it together because I know. I KNOW people have it worse, I KNOW i should be thankful to have a job. But the abuse we take, the wall of never ending expectations and EVER growing work that just CANNOT be met on any realistic level, the consistent threat of ""If you cannot keep up, we just can't afford you"" is starting to take a serious toll on my health and mental health. 

I just want to be happy. I want to experience life without spending 98% of my life in work or sleeping. I feel the growing anxiety because I know for a damned fact that we are in a recession. I need the job and I need the insurance. I desperately need the money because haha, life costs money. I'm depressed because all I can ever think about is how am i going to survive the next few years? What plans can I possibly make to have a happy and fruitful life with my future husband who is also struggling? I'm so bitter because I took a small break over the weekend and it was honestly the best I had, not thinking about work, relaxing. And as soon as I get back and I peak at my work email, I see that work has devolved into a full blown trashcan fire. I'm just sitting here just crying but I feel like I just can't talk with anyone about this because ""You are lucky, why are you upset?! You have a job. You have income.""

I've spent the better part of the last 3 months job hunting, throwing out applications like candy and all I get back in response is nothing, not even a ""Thanks but no thanks"". 

  
TLDR; I'm struggling and nothing is fine, things are expensive. Nothing seems right. I can't really talk with anyone about this and deep inside I feel like I'm being entitled so I also feel a SUPER deep seated guilt/exhaustion/anxiety over this. "

No matter how long you've been with the company, no matter how many Internet deals you've sold in your life, no matter how well you understand the service, you MUST attend the repetitive weekly morning training meeting.

Well. Our stores open at 10am. Openers typically arrive 30-45 minutes early to setup. The Teams meeting at 8am MUST BE ATTENDED IN STORE.

I've been working for a contractor for about 3 months now. They haven't been that great at anything but they ""helped"" me get this job so I am thankful. Today I was told that next Monday, the company will be closed for the holiday. I asked my boss if there was anyway I could work that day since taking a day with no pay would be detrimental to my family's finances (I'm the only income earner). My boss said to reach out to my recruiter but I wouldn't be able to work, even remote. I texted my recruiter to confirm that even if I'm being forced to take a day off that I would still not be paid. The recruiter texted back this whole paragraph on how he has gone over the contract with me multiple times (not true. We went over it once and I had a lot of questions that he still hasnt answered or he brushed them off saying I should already know), I shouldn't need to ask questions, and I ""shouldn't be shocked"" that I wouldn't get paid. Nowhere in my contract did it say that forced days off didn't include pay but whatever (my contract states only days I take off voluntarily don't get paid but I guess I'm too stupid and shocked according to the recruiter to know this). I responded that I did not like the tone of his message and I was just asking for confirmation since that wasn't specifically in the contract. He then responded by saying he wasn't being condescending and I should be well aware of their policy by now (I'm 3 months in, this is the first holiday the company is taking off since I started, and I have not taken any days off). I don't want to associate with this recruiter any further if me asking any questions results in that type of response. The funny thing is, I wouldn't be so upset if he just responded with ""that's correct"". 


Needless to say, I'm going to start putting resumes back out there because being forced to take days without pay when I'm offering to work and even offering to put in OT to make up the difference gets denied. I'm just trying to survive here.

Life tests and whatnot, we normally just run them til they break. In-doors with these shoddy ass exhaust hoses to extract the CO. The CO is still usually high, sometimes reading up to 400ppm in one of the lab rooms. No one really cares about this job. The factory here is kind of a joke. They don't drug test and pay close to minimum wage on the assembly lines and whatnot. My supervisor is a different story. He makes like $16 and he's super fucking serious about everything, even though this entire department will likely be shut down and moved to their main production facility in just a couple years. Our big boss is a Vice President in another fucking state who we communicate via email and sometimes phone. 

The job itself is pretty chill, and since my supervisor ""can't get up early"" to be on first shift, he works on second shift, so I only see him a couple hours out of the day. The dude is an insufferable tool. I just don't even get why he takes the job so seriously. He's originally from Germany and has an American mom, so he has a German accent, a lisp, and he's stuck in the US because he has 6 kids. Hes in his late 30s. I could get a way better job, but this is pretty close to my home. My supervisor is a decently smart guy, but he's super arrogant, treats us like toddlers. I used to work as an accounts specialist and an IT guy for a city, and I have years of IT experience. I just find it funny and sad. I'm working 4 10s and have 3 day weekends though, so that's kind of nice.

Well it got worse and off work I get snaps sent to me of my coworkers hanging out but I never get invited even tho I have expressed that I would like to join next time. 

After a while it got so worse I almost ended myself.. I survived and had another talk with my supervisor. Now coworkers have complained that I am not ""happy"" while at work and I got the owners after me now. 
We sat down for a meeting to ""help me"" as they said but they ended up blaming everything on me not being happy at work... 

""maybe people wanna hang out with you if you ar happier at work"" 
""if you smile more maybe people wanna talk to you more"" 

Yeha you get it, it was all ""my"" fault 
I started to look for another job but omg it's so painful going to work everyday with this going on.. I have always been positive and nice so I don't understand what is going on... 

Has anyone had any similar experience?

Filed a ADA accommodation.,u/Outrageous-Voice-173,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cwng2m/being_forced_back_to_office_and_boss_refused_to/,antiwork,"I work in prior authorizations with a medical company and have been remote for awhile. My stats are above normal and my error rate is extremely low.  My boss has been on the warpath and looking at every little thing I am doing and has pointed out things that I did ‚Äúincorrectly‚Äù even though our onenote said differently. Long story short, I am being forced back to office after a doctor complained that the wrong product was reviewed and I‚Äôm being thrown under the bus for it. What happened is the dumbass doctor wrote it for a different product and I reviewed it for the only commercially available product that he specifically listed on the form but then was pissed that it wasn‚Äôt the product he truly wanted (but didn‚Äôt list it). I did fill it out correctly and even had someone back it up. My boss said I had to go back because of this ‚Äúerror‚Äù. I showed her all of the research I did and had proof that it was reviewed specifically what the doctor wrote for. I have no problem taking accountability for errors, but I fought back on this as I was being blamed for dumbass doctor‚Äôs mistake. She refused to listen and wouldn‚Äôt hear me out on why this wasn‚Äôt fair or right. Starting today, I had to go back into the office.
My boss knows that I have been dealing with some medical issues but I haven‚Äôt been specific as to what. It‚Äôs not really anyone‚Äôs business, but now I guess it is. I have had severe chronic migraines for over 20 years and lately it‚Äôs been daily. To make things worse, my migraines are causing horrible brain fog and I seem to have very poor memory while having any kind of headache. I also have major depressive disorder, autism, generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, and PTSD. My brain is damn mess. I do have a history of panic attacks. I haven‚Äôt had one for a few years until a few months ago when I was getting them due to stress or when I‚Äôm driving more than 10 minutes. My husband has had to take over the longer drives to take my daughter places after I had a panic attack in the middle of driving and had to pull over. It terrified my daughter to see me like that. I am on medications, am seeing a new psychiatrist and psychotherapist, and am waiting back for a referral for a new neurologist (I‚Äôve see 3 over the years). My main doctor was more helpful for my migraines than the neurologists were but now I know I should be seen for the brain fog and memory loss. I live over half an hour away but left an hour early just in case I had a panic attack episode. Sure enough, I did get one and had to pull over and was still late. I brought sunglasses with me since fluorescent lights are one of my worst triggers. It ended up helping but was still struggling with a migraine. My boss didn‚Äôt say a word to me when I walked in and after an hour after I came in to work from home.
I talked to a friend that happens to be a lawyer and he suggested filing an ADA accommodation claim that working from home is a necessity. I have never filled one out before but it was easy to do so. My husband suggested I just get a letter from my doctor without filing but I know the ADA form can help protect me. My doctor knows what is going on and is writing a letter of medical necessity to my boss. I also have appointments with the psychotherapist and psychiatrist this week and will see if they can write a letter as well. 
I am a bit nervous about this but I don‚Äôt want to put myself in a dangerous position either. What is upsetting is that I am forced here after being blamed for something that wasn‚Äôt even my fault."

According to the article, The Board game was initially conceived by Lizzie Maggie with the intention of teaching the public about income inequality. A man named Charles Darrow, misled her into selling the rights for $300. Charles Darrow made changes to the game and brought it to the Parker brothers (which later was bought by Hasbro). Hasbro later gained a monopoly in the board game industry (with monopoly being one of its most sold products). The company is not known for creating new products or innovations. 

Monopoly ""Go"" is one of the most profitable mobile game in the global market, with a monetization based on the addictive strategies of casinos. The board game ranks in the top ten for board games sales worldwide.

There is a bunch of tragic irony attached to the story of this game. I remember playing the game feeling unfair without a bunch of house-rules. Until recently I didn't realize that the game being miserable might have been the creators intent.  "

A bout a month into this new position some family things came up that wouldn‚Äôt allow me to continue working. I shared this with my boss with the intention of quitting that day. He, however offered me a remote position with the company because they ‚Äúsaw potential‚Äù and were in need of extra help in that department. All they asked was that I continue to work in person until they were ready to set me up at home. The timeline on that was 30 days. It ended up taking 5 months but I hung in there because they understood my situation and didn‚Äôt mind when I couldn‚Äôt make it in due to my circumstances which I appreciated. I finally got to the point where I could work from home in February but they flipped the script on me and now I was expected to work in person 1 day a week.(after I pulled my child from daycare) I was under the impression this was a temporary schedule and have made efforts to secure child care for that one day a week. This last week I was unable to come in because my child was sick. My boss sent me an email stating that I would no longer be able to work from home on the one day a week that I was required to be there and I would have to use a PTO day. I expressed to him that I hadn‚Äôt missed any other days and that it felt like a punishment that was unwarranted. The response from the owner ‚Äúhmmmm üò≥‚Äù and ‚Äúwow okay. We will need to see if this position is working out‚Äù. That was last Thursday. i emailed them back Friday morning and apologized if I had offended them but I still haven‚Äôt heard anything from them.

This is now the second time they have said ‚Äùwe will need to see if this position is working out‚Äù I am a good worker and they know that.

My wife just delivered a child last week after an immensely difficult pregnancy. I was looking forward to my two weeks of paternity leave (which is mandatory in my country) to be there for my wife and son. 

I soon found out that there is no such thing as paternity leave at my startup! Dejected, I decided to use my entire leave balance of ten days as a makeshift paternity leave. 

On the fourth bloody day of my leave, my manager calls me to 'check in' to see how everything is going. At the end of the call, he not-so-subtly asks me to 'resume work in my free time', 'catch up with the team on call regularly', and 'reply to any emails I send'. 

I'm bitterly disappointed. I just started this job and I can't afford to keep changing jobs every year, because recruiters have told me that it looks bad when workers keep changing jobs too quickly. 

Any little sense of joy and purpose I felt at this workplace has evaporated instantly. The last time an organization respected my private life was maybe four jobs ago. I don't think I'll ever find a role that pays well, is interesting, isn't immensely stressful and respects personal borders. "

My first week was at a tradeshow and it was nonstop so I was around him probably 16 hours a day. There was another girl with me there so I didn‚Äôt feel completely uncomfortable. the CEO is known to be ‚Äúnot corporate‚Äú and likes to joke around a lot and have fun. However I started noticing he constantly ‚Äújokes‚Äù about his wife in the most desparaging way. Then he makes jokes about being around us girls and to ‚Äúpush his wife‚Äôs buttons to make her mad‚Äù

He‚Äôs said he likes to push buttons. Heres the weird behavior I‚Äôve experienced.

In the interview he looked me up and down. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it but took note of it. 

Trade show week: again constantly looking me up and down and smiling and making jokes about spending a lot of time together. They also basically pried information out of me about my boyfriend. (The other girl is very loyal to him). 

So they knew my boyfriend was not comfortable with me doing lots of travel with this man multiple times a year. The vibe from the conversation was basically ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let this become a problem because we will fire you so if he can‚Äôt get over it break up with him‚Äù ok. 

First day in office and I was told to be 10minutes early by the other girl. I was 5 minutes early. I saw on his iMac. That him and the girl were talking about me because i wasn‚Äôt 10minutes early and they were being rude and it made me feel uncomfortable.

I was told I would be working 7:30-3:30 but then he told me it‚Äôs really 7:30-4 and he doesn‚Äôt like people really leaving right at 4.  So that‚Äôs confusing because there‚Äôs no set hours and leaving right away is looked down upon.

MAJOR CREEPING: he kept looking me up and down and smirking, told me he likes my freckles that came out in the sun and getting closed to me when we were sitting next to each other to book travel. Joking about spending time together and not telling our significant others. It‚Äôs all jokes but to me it‚Äôs inappropriate especially when he tells his wife about me to apparently annoy her. ( apparently she knows he is joking but this is what he tells me )

I just feel extremely uncomfortable and mad. It had a good salary and I do feel like I could get a lot out of this job but after telling my mom she told me to quit immediately and be done. She said I would never win and he has all the power and if he‚Äôs doing this now it will only get worse. I‚Äôm just afraid he will somehow trash my name. What can I do ?"

I (M/49 ) with a wife and 11 year old, was hired in 2018 at 70k/Year,  I work from home and on average travel out of state for 4-5 days one week of the month. Otherwise I'm at home if not asked to do some 'special project'   
I don't hate my job per se, but my immediate supervisor is a micromanager and can be very annoying. He will go through my (open to the team) emails and close them without telling me. He will do this now and again when he gets a hair up his ass.  
My only other co-worker threatened to quit over the micro-managing and they put him under a new supervisor though he 'technically' works on our team but now has better excuses for ignoring the first boss whenever he wants to so call/emails he doesn't want to answer end up on my plate.  
The kicker is, although they didn't fire me, they reduced our pay by 30% during Covid and once it was over never made us 'whole' again. In 2022 I went and asked for an inflationary raise just based on where I live and what's going on in the U.S. and although not denied they never responded directly and I never got any raise.  (I did get a taxed, 1,500 bonus, but that was it.) So, 6-7 years with no raise, not even a performance review to be able to base a 'merit type' raise on in all those years.  
No clear plan for improvement, grooming me for when my boss leaves, learning about another aspect of the business, nothing..

I am able to freelance now and again and I can fill in gaps and make an extra 10-20k year with bits of short term work but that means adding days or weekends and I feel I'm working all the time. Do I stay at this place and just do the minimum and keep the paycheck or is it time to move on and look for something else?   
I see many stories from people having a hard time finding work and while I'm not 'satisfied' with my job who really is, and the reality is I can't afford to be snobby about finding my 'passion'.   
  
I would not leave this job before I have other employment and I will not quit without other employment. I will make them fire me before I quit."

I'm trying to move from one job at my current employer to another department with the same company. The first two interviews were fantastic, including the meeting with the next higher up who literally said as we were leaving ""You have my thumbs up"". 

After that interview they reached out to my references. I know this because I contacted one of them that I knew would give me a good reference. Because I am trying to move within the same company I have my current supervisor as a reference. I know she does not like me, as we have had disagreements in the past (which is one of the main reasons I'm trying to leave this current position). 

After contacting the references I got a ""thanks but no thanks"" style email. I pretty much can guarantee it was due to something my current supervisor said since the email came within 3 hours of them calling my references. 

I sent a very professional email to the person I interviewed with to ask why the rejection but he never responded. I plan on asking my supervisor about it as well. I live in a one party consent state so I plan on recording the conversation. I feel like she may have said something purposefully to try to screw me out of the opportunity. What kind of questions should I ask her? What kind of things I try to get her to admit to that would have been technically protected that she shouldn't have said?"

A few years back I worked for a shitty paper press company. The building was a sweatshop and was a total dump and literally had black mold everywhere. I was on night crew and we had about 37 people on our shift mist guys. The building only had 2 single person men's restrooms in it and it was always a fight to get into one since we all went on break at the same time. One night I needed to piss really bad and both restrooms were taken. We also only had 10 minute breaks so I didn't want to wait. So I just went in the woman's restroom next to the men's which was also a single person restroom with only 1 toilet because I didn't feel like waiting. Well apparently one of the female employees reported me to hr and the Next day I was dragged in for a meeting. They told me I'm a disgusting pervert and that was extremely inappropriate. I told them it's not my fault the building is so badly designed that it's not even remotely accommodating for its employees but it was either that or piss in the woods behind our building. Well they said it doesn't matter because I'm fired. I walked out of there and didn't even really feel bad I honestly don't see what the problem is both restrooms are identical. And it's not my fault the building was horribly designed.



Anyway after I left 3 months later the health department and local code enforcement shutdown the company because the building was condemned due to the high mold infestation.the company closed down for good and is no longer around "

Boss gossips about other employees to other employees in front of me.

Favoritism. Literally my boss said out loud ‚Äúpeople who get upset over favoritism need to just get over it and do their jobs.‚Äù

Boss stood over my shoulder to make sure I did the employee engagement survey. 

Low retention.

Poor communication over scheduling and what my actual job even is.

There are 5 other people with the same job title as me but I have two other roles I am expected to do while the others are not. Now that people are leaving the one position I sometimes work, I fear I will be scheduled to do it more often over my actual fucking job title and will be stuck doing it indefinitely as it‚Äôs happened to others before me. Furthermore, they are training someone else for the other ‚Äúside‚Äù position that they were so adamant and excited for me to do. They said they really needed someone to fill that role and I did the best I could and now they are training someone else. It all smells so fucking fishy, my gut is screaming something is wrong but everyone tells me I‚Äôm worrying too much and to basically get over it. 

I feel so uncertain. Having 3 different jobs with 3 different responsibilities and times I have to show up for is hard for me to keep up with.

A few minutes later I get called into the office with the HR person and the manager asking if I'm happy to be here and that if I'm not that they ""value"" my happiness over my job. Of course seeing this bullshit as a tactic to gauge (or find reason) to fire me I asked what about my comment offended them to which they replied that I didn't sound ""enthusiastic"" about my job (which I wasn't but a job's a job). They demanded to know why I wasn't all smiles and rainbows and I just flat out said it's stress and that I was tired. What was I supposed to tell them? That management is a shit show and no one knows what the hell they're talking about form one person to another? That no one wants to lift a finger to help because the rank and file should just ""know"" what to do and to consult the manuals? That management is so fucked in the head that they were upset that ""we"" were under performing and thus didn't get some cheap ass trophy (no bonus, no increase in pay, no special prize just a stupid ""You did it!"" trophy)? That HR and up is staffed with nothing but people who look down on everyone else and will make snide comments about one's appearance, interactions, skills directly at them?

HR was not having it. They grilled me about my job, my contribution to the team, my reason to be here to which I wish I could have said because being jobless equates to homelessness. They then espoused about how they are a business that needs people who ""want to be there"" and to not treat the job ""as a requirement"" which ironically goes against their whole persona of a company that strives to better the lives of the community, to be the pillar that holds up the people and the glue that keeps the community together (the top brass really make a show with social media). Not wanting to give them any more reason to fire me (which at this point they probably will since I'm in an at will state) I just told them I will improve my attitude from now on. 

I need to take some of the advice from those who've left the company to heart and find somewhere else to work but it's not like there's a single company out there that will not hire and fire as they please. My loyalty lies in whoever pays me more because just like we are selling a service to the people I am selling my service to the company and that line is getting really thin."

I was told years back by someone who delivered pizzas in college that delivery drivers made a % of sales, dorm deliveries didn‚Äôt tip much but you had so many on Sunday nights (dorm cafeterias in his college were closed Sunday nights) that the % of sales made up for it. Apartments tipped better, he said, but you didn‚Äôt get as many of them and/or you had to drive a lot longer to deliver to them.

9,2024-05-20,Meeting with HR for calling out sick when I was actually sick...,u/Giggadream,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cwwojl/meeting_with_hr_for_calling_out_sick_when_i_was/,antiwork,"So I work at a restaurant and about 2 weeks ago I messaged my manager asking if I can get May 19th-21st off because I had free tickets to EDC. (EDC is Friday May 17- Saturday May 19 but I was only going to go Sunday and then return home on Tuesday.) I told her it's no big deal if not because I understand it's last minute and I also knew others have already requested these days off far more in advance. I ended up not getting the days off and that was fine. The 18th rolls up and (which is also a day EDC is part of but I didn't request that day off because I didn't plan on going Saturday). I call out of work because I am very sick. Sunday the 19th rolls up and I'm still sick so I call out again. I feel better today Monday 20th so I decide to go into work. I knew calling out the days during the festival did look suspicious and I wanted to clarify that I was actually sick right away to my manager so I go up to her and explain to her that I was actually very sick and I wasn't lying just to go to EDC. She said were gonna talk to HR about this. I then showed her pictures of a negative covid test that I took on Saturday that shows my location in Los Angeles on my iPhone (which is where I live, showing that I was not at EDC.) She still says just to save it and talk to HR later.  

So then later I sit down with our in-house HR manager and my floor manager and the HR manager basically is saying how suspicious this looks and does not seem like she's believing what I'm saying at all. I tried to show her the picture I took but she said that, ""that could have been sent from someone in Los Angeles and it would still show the geolocation on my phone as LA..."" which I am not even sure is true on an iPhone and is absolutely ridiculous (i'm pretty sure it would say ""sent from X contact"" if that were the case). She said next time go to a actual clinic to get tested. I was just trying to plead my case and it seemed like she was not believing me. It felt very unprofessional to be confronted in a meeting about calling out sick when I was actually sick. And it ended with ""next time it may be more than just a conversation"". And SHE kept talking about next time. As if I did something wrong and they're letting me off with a warning. 

It's very frustrating for me because I feel like this is something that I *thought* I could bring up to HR, reporting how it was unprofessional for a manger to be confronted about calling out sick when I was actually sick. But it WAS the HR manager who confronted me about this. I was already so bummed out that I had to not work this weekend because I really needed the money and then have to deal with the stress of working my whole shift thinking about what is going to happen to me and then this BS happens. Just looking for some advice. Thanks"

Good to note that I am not the team leader, and only an underling.

We have deeply expressed our frustrations time and time again that we're just not equipped and that we're already at our limits but it always come back to ""You need to do this and that"" ü§°. We can't get support and they expect us to fend for ourselves. 

One consultant doesn't even know much about their job yet it's easy for them to call out names and throw them to the battlefield like it's a piece of cake. All we want to happen is thay for the consultant to be in our shoes as well but I guess that's not gonna happen.

I was promoted to a supervisor position last year and moved from hourly to salary. I have many qualms with this company and it‚Äôs why I‚Äôve accepted another offer and submitted my notice. 

Anyway, all of the unethical things and unfair practices they‚Äôve directed me to participate in are starting to eat at me. 

For example: I accepted my promotion with an offer letter that explains the position is salary, but my hourly rate will be X. All my paystubs list hourly. I still get paid biweekly. My time cards are auto-filled with 40 hours and I don‚Äôt clock in or out. I‚Äôm wondering if I may be misclassed or if there is something else going on here. It‚Äôs the least of my concerns and I haven‚Äôt read about it too much, FLSA laws get deep. 

My biggest issue is their time card practices. I haven‚Äôt been hourly in a while and when I was I was a to-the-minute kind of time card person, so I don‚Äôt know if I was a victim here too. But I‚Äôm in charge of other people‚Äôs time cards now. Editing, adding PTO, approving etc. It‚Äôs been well directed to me that ‚Äúwe should never let time cards go over 40 hours. If there‚Äôs anything going over, edit it to bring it down to 40‚Äù. And another good one, ‚Äúlunches have to be taken by 6 hours worked (state law), if someone‚Äôs taken a lunch at 6.5 hrs adjust the time card so lunch is at 6 hours‚Äù. 

Just all kinds of ridiculousness. I have been scared of retaliation for some time and have held my tongue til now, when I‚Äôm about to leave and can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Am I opening myself to any legal liability if I report them for these practices? Is there even anything to report? Feeling gaslit. I know the HR and Payroll at this company leaves something to be desired, it was months before I was even paid correctly when I started here. "

I wonder if I should defend myself or what because this job is tied to my personal life and seems like they're potentially looking to validate their contempt with me with digging into people from my past who are mad that I was an edgy talk back teenager.

There's people who acknowledge this mistreatment, but seem to make this meta and the neutrality of it from acknowledging it to being apprehensive with me really feels off.

He also just learned through the grapevine that one of the remaining 3 may be far along in an interview process with another company, and may also be leaving soon. 


The work his team does is critical to the company's function. The hold a lot of power with all of the software running smoothly, fixing bugs and issues in a timely manner, etc. They've been very overworked for a long time with high expectations, and it's only getting worse as the team shrinks. They also got abysmal raises and their bonuses were cut by 70% (yes, 70%) this year.


We're wondering what the best path forward is in this situation is. Him and the two other remaining staff want to approach management and ask for a raise/promotion. We think they have enough leverage to actually get something out of this. Right now all they can think is to schedule a group call with both managers, lay out how heavy the workload has gotten and how hard they've been working in the absence of so many people, and request all 3 of them get promotions and a 10% raise. Does anyone have ideas that may be more effective? They want to do something that will get them the best outcome without being illegal or putting them in a bad spot (for example I was wondering if they could threaten to quit, but would that actually be feasible/legal?).

I work for a company that does. In my job I go into people‚Äôs houses. Covid nearly killed me last winter. It's not just like the flu. My company didn't announce it to the employees or the public. By doing this it puts pressure on people to show up to work even if they are positive for a potentially deadly disease.

I don't want this to be a big deal, but it just feels like they've been taking advantage of me. I've only been at this job for a few months, and it seems a little early to ask for a raise based off of older coworkers experience, but now this new guy has been here for 3 weeks and has been making more than me this whole time. 

It's just annoying :(  

I work at a small company, like 10-12 employees, and I was excited to work here, (I needed a new job). But it just feels like they thought they could just save a few bucks, and get an employee, meanwhile I'm struggling to keep any money in my bank account.

Obviously I'm going to ask for a raise, but I'm pretty annoyed.

So often it seems like you have to work much harder than their paying you to be, and so infrequently do you ever actually get the pay off.

Which I was shocked to hear but not surprised. They been talking budgetary problems for at least since the beginning of the year and I went through that once at my other place of employment so it‚Äôs a weird space to be in when you know cuts will likely be made. I was already overworked and the perception was I wasn‚Äôt doing half my job so it was a matter of time - you make mistakes, you piss off the wrong people and perception is reality so even though you never had a chance to have it fixed they probably cut you loose. I stayed longer than I should have bc I had a golden handcuff situation with my kid going to school at the place I worked so I got an employee discount. Timing is good for both of us since my kid is graduating (it‚Äôs preschool) but it made sense to go anyway. I enrolled my other kid but once I heard I was laid off I pulled his application and I‚Äôm getting a refund on funds paid. 

I am taking it fairly well doing my work since I can work until the end of their fiscal year (June). 

Until I was asked to post my job on the website today. My boss even said in the email that it was an awkward request but I said no not awkward but I can‚Äôt help feel weird. The job is the same. Different title and the new hire will report to two people instead of one. Salary is what I started with when I started four years ago.   

I was ready to leave anyway but it kind of all feels gross. I‚Äôm doing my best to keep my head down and get to the end of June so I can move on. My boss was asking me about a big project and I was like ‚ÄúI thought you said you weren‚Äôt doing it?‚Äù And he was like oh yeah the ball is still in my court but I don‚Äôt want to work hard in my last month for them anymore. 
The place is disorganized and I wasn‚Äôt really managed. I will admit I was busy a lot but got comfortable in their inability to plan or do anything strategically. 

I guess this is all to say it feels weird and I guess I want to be angry about it but I‚Äôm not. I have friends that are angry for me or at thinking I should be. I ask them if I‚Äôm missing something or not getting something. Maybe just being lied to is what bugs me. Just fire me. Don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs budgetary and then post a job saving a measly $20000 (when they are $2 million in debt). "

I work in a security control room, where we monitor clients in basically all of Australia and New Zealand. We have a relatively small team of 14, which basically just barely covers the required staffing to operate 24/7. Enter manglement, who asked each of us individually to swap to 12s. We all refused of course, and were clear about why. Apparently we should have kowtowed to the beings the great gods of capitalism saw fit to put above us lowly peasants.

Manglement, in all its wisdom has decided that for ""operational reasons"" they must institute a new rotating roster. Which would be fine, if the new roster wasn't specifically aimed at three people in particular, myself being one.

The three people this will have an impact on all have relatives with some kind of disability, be it mental or physical, and as such we have had 8 hour shifts since we were hired. One for mornings, one for afternoons and one for nights - fully covering a 24hr period. We have worked out the rotation amongst ourselves, and until now there hasn't been an issue. They tried to sweeten the pot for me by tossing in a promise of promotion, but when I said I'd need that in writing funnily enough they decided not to pursue that.

They haven't realised yet, but this was the final straw for not just us, but the other 6 most senior people in the place. We're all actively looking for somewhere else, where we aren't expected to manage the workload of 3 controlrooms between a max of 3 people at a time. They fucked around and are definitely about to find out."

Six months ago during my interview, Human Resources asked me if I would be willing to stay after my temporary assignment. They said they were impressed with my resume and credentials. 

Since I am a contractor, I busted my ass extra hard these past 6 months. I worked overtime and skipped lunch when possible to push my metrics above and beyond (my own fault). 

Last month, I participated in a corporate program where I sought out and enrolled extra customers which earned more money for the company. All the Sales Managers thanked me for this. My boss told Human Resources that I absolutely deserve to be hired on permanently.

Last week, I sat in a hour long interview with Human Resources while I was questioned about what I have learned and given the usual rapid fire questions where you barely have time to recover before another person speaks. It was exhausting. The questions were hard but my boss prepared me and told me I was a great candidate. My boss said ""you got this!"". 

I received a call from home on my personal cell phone yesterday which I found odd because I did not give HR this information. Someone from HR said I was absolutely qualified for the role but that someone else was hired. They also told me that means my contract is over TODAY.

So, now I am entirely out of a job. It's such shit the way employers in corporate treat their employees. I asked if I could have this in formal writing and I was told no. That a phone conversation was sufficient. 

Never give more than you have to. Never skip lunch and never ever work harder than necessary just because someone acts like you're about to be promoted. Usually, it's all a facade so they can squeeze you dry while someone else is already in the position they're pretending you will receive. "

I wanted to set up a quick website that tracked bad behavior by companies when recruiting. But then thought, maybe it would be easier to just post on Reddit to start (and then later I can make a website if these type of posts are well received and save other peoples' time).

The intention is that hopefully sharing info about companies will prevent others from wasting their time on bad interview experiences.

Edit:

These were the three people that commented.

Recently we noticed he was being paid time and a half/ overtime pay for these shifts on his pay stubs. He asked his supervisor and apparently that is just a new company policy.

I have 20 years experience in my field and 1 year ago was hired to head a massive project worth a few hundred million usd with 1000 workers. I had 4 predecessors on that job - English, German and Italian - in just a year and all of them failed miserably. They spent too much, worked too little and really were not that good at their jobs.

Within a year of my arrival I had corrected all that was wrong, finished the project with profit (which seemed impossible), and improved quality and resource use. Also, sacked 10 expats that were there from the start just collecting free wages without doing anything, and I assumed all their positions, but unlike them I succeeded. The company's management were happy, clients happy, the workers were happy. I will admit I was not really happy and that I twice thought about resigning as I did not really like the company, but stayed on so no one would ever think I was not up to the task. The pay was average.

In my Middle Management role I do not really have to give any satisfaction to anyone but my boss, which I did, and we got along well and I constantly received public and private praise. Although I was always very polite, I did not really engage with colleagues of other projects because I found them boring, stupid and amateurish, even though I engaged and was friendly with a few that were really good at their jobs and had contributed in their capacity to my project.

Following a racist comment from one of my team, another European, German of course, and the third time, I gave him a beating, and did not really put him in hospital because while I was hitting him I noticed he was so shocked and frightened that his hands were literally shaking. It was not in the West, so laws regarding beatings are very easy there and I am expected to do what is necessary to keep discipline. That was 3 months ago...

With the project complete, and expecting to rest or be moved to anothet project, a week ago, my boss called me while I was on holidays, told me my work was superb and I could not be faulted professionally, but I was not part of the company culture and my results were only achieved because of the too strict discipline I had imposed (still everyone happy)... He further told me bs of the sort ""you are so intelligent and so good at your work that none of your colleagues dares to talk to you, as they are afraid to look stupid."" What!? Then I met him personally, same story, I did not ask for anything, not even to keep my job, just listened, and then told him facts of how many millions of usd I had saved, quality and all metrics achieved and surpassed and that if with all that he had still decided to sack me, fair enough! 

I took everything with composure, smiled, said my farewells, packed my things and left. I believe they were expecting a scene, but I was not really into any drama, which seems to me to be what some colleagues wanted. I really was not sad about being sacked as I really did not like the open racist company culture, even though I was surprised with the sacking.

Perhaps I am getting too old but I don't even know why I was sacked. I always kept and promoted the good workers and sacked the lazy, unproductive, troublemakers, but it seems to me that somehow the rules have changed. I am thinking ofndoing something else as these kind of experiences seem to be the rule nowadays, not the exception.

What I really love (sarcasm) is I've observed at least a dozen times my ideas getting shot down and then brought up by one of my bosses as their crazy revolutionary new ideas and then our whole focus is on that idea and developing it. Example: I brought up to our GM almost a year ago we need to start honing in ops processes and get a standard layout and inventory list for each of our trailers. That idea was met with frustration and him saying no it's not worth the time. tune in today and he brings up the BEST idea ever. Exactly the same idea I brought up for the first time almost a year ago!
I'm just really tired of 1) being belittled on the phone by our customers because I'm too stupid to know anything about our business and 2) tired of these tired construction haunchos stealing my ideas and pawning them off as their own. I'm tired of my managers doing it.
I stopped giving out ideas. I stopped trying to solve problems that aren't mine. I've found peace but everyone has started to ""step up"" and begin to do their jobs finally.
Our GM is struggling. He can't even keep up with a to do list or let alone use one to document what he needs to do. It's just he'll remember it if it's important and do it when he has the time
No one on our team plans things out. When during the day to stop by X place so you don't waste 2 hours in your day so you can get to where you need to go on time. Then I'm left with calling our customers to tell them we're running behind because we forgot a $15 caulk gun and our guys can't plan for shit.
Our crew can't keep their space clean. Used gloves litter the truck and warehouse. Unless I stand back there every second and watch them clean it doesn't get done. I've cleaned up the truck and warehouse so many times I'm done. Everyone here is an adult in a profession Im assuming we all want to succeed in because that's how you make more money right? I didn't think this job was going to be like this. I DONT get paid enough to do everyone's job and keep track of everything and do my own job

19,2024-05-21,Why would I work overtime?,u/LajosvH,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cx9ffd/why_would_i_work_overtime/,antiwork,"my crappy job pays me 15.22‚Ç¨/hour before taxes. Today, my ‚Äöboss‚Äò (the dude in charge of this particular shift) asked very sweetly if we (including me) could stay an hour or two longer because we‚Äòre short staffed. I could use some more additional money, even if it‚Äòs just a little over 30‚Ç¨ 

then I realized: my *actual* wage is minimum wage (12.41‚Ç¨/hour in Germany) with an added voluntary pay on top to make the job more attractive. any calculation of additional pay (working after 8pm increases your wage by 25% percent for the hours after 8; work on Sunday increases pay by 50%, and work on a holiday by 100% (no, they don‚Äòt stack)) ‚Äî any calculation of additional pay happens on the basis of 12.41‚Ç¨ and not 15.22‚Ç¨ euros 

even more fucked up: overtime doesn‚Äòt get paid out or amasses or anything like that. it is transformed into vouchers that can be used at the company; it‚Äòs being advertised as ‚Äötax free!‚Äò (and since it‚Äòs a supermarket, the argument is: well, you gotta buy groceries anyway, right?) which, of course, also means: tax free for my employer and money not paid into my retirement (haha, good one, I know) ‚Äî the calculation is on the basis of 12.41‚Ç¨. so I‚Äòd have to change my plans for today, work a crappy shift in a crappy job for two more hours to no not even get 25‚Ç¨ in the shape of a voucher to be used for my employer (so it‚Äòs their money going from one pocket into the other)

because they‚Äòve only hired me for 30 hours/week, I don‚Äòt even reach 20k/year, even with government ~~wage subsidies~~ social support. in the state with the highest average wage (almost 50k/year)

so let‚Äòs recap: the work sucks ass, they stiff me on my money, overtime is less valuable than regular working hours, and I‚Äòm still on fucking welfare. why ‚Äî the fuck ‚Äî would I work overtime?

‚Äûsorry boss, no can do, already got plans‚Äú was my answer by the way"

7,2024-05-21,My resignation letter,u/bliss1976,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cx9qaf/my_resignation_letter/,antiwork,"Dear XXXX,

This email serves as resignation from XXXX effective today.

HR ‚Äì please put this email on my personal file.

Working at XXXX has been the most dispiriting experience of my career.

The Supervisor group is treated by XXXX with disrespect, dismissiveness, and anger as you are aware. This is because of the low numbers, but we all deserve to work in an environment that is professional, respectful, and collaborative.

The Advisory Group, made up of two retired consultants, is also negatively impacting the work of a number of departments at XXXX while not having current knowledge of company operations or the advances that have been made in the modern business world.

Due to the issues that the advisory group has created, an external HR consultant was hired last year to investigate claims by multiple staff concerning the group and the hostile work environment it has created. I have seen no evidence that this has been followed up on. Our department is still controlled by the group, even with new management in place who are constantly undermined by them.

The advisory group is autocratic, lacking knowledge and makes knee jerk reactions without proper attention to detail or listening to the people who do the work. Conversations that I have had with them have been combative and dismissive with a lack of concrete or effective follow up.
The group‚Äôs actions, attitude and behavior create an intimidating, hostile work environment which interferes with the department managers‚Äô ability to manage and their associate‚Äôs work performance.

My level of anxiety and stress are constant due to the messages I receive about my work. You have indicated that I have done excellent work managing my team and removing 98% of our 5-year backlog. 

In following up on the training to do the job I was hired to do (2 years after starting in the job), you indicated that I should not be punished for not having done my job for the last 2 years. This indicates to me that a conversation has been had in which it was put forward that I should receive censure of some kind for this.

As you indicated, the fault lies with Company name and not myself. I have worked hard and taken on many Senior Manager tasks to get our operational activities back on track.
 
Company name‚Äôs harassment policy indicates that it is ‚Äúcommitted to a work environment where all associates are treated with respect and dignity‚Äù. Based on the above this is not the case.

Regards,

taking vacations at inconvenient times.

the company as a whole leaves a bad taste in my mouth. workers are starting to organize but the higher ups are doing their best to squash unions.

i am paid... ok. it isn't quite enough for my needs and the cost of living in my area. i am currently homeless living in my car and paying off debt due to health problems and repairs on said car. with my current job it will take 6 months to clear my debt and start saving up for a place of my own. it's not a long time, just sucks.

the job i applied for is a fucking unicorn. im qualified, and it pays double my wage. i am frothing at the mouth at the thought of paying off my bills in half the time i planned, living somewhere with working hot water and laundry, taking a vacation for the first time in 3 years, and being able to buy a house one day. if i don't get it, i'll survive. if i do, ill celebrate but feel a little guilty. help me turn off my empathy while i climb the ladder."

I'm a data analyst with 6+ years experience. Have a background in data science and have worked in several different companies over the last few years via mostly remote contract work. The most recent job was an 18 month contract with a giant tech company everyone has heard of, so I'm thinking it will be a steady paycheck and I'll have plenty of time to prepare for the next bout of job hunting and having this company on my resume will make things easier.

Turns out they terminated my contract more than 5 months early (I live in an at-will state, my contract was written in a way where there is no recourse for me) because upper management decided they wanted to outsource the work to an offshore company rather than pay contractors. They also gave me about a week's notice that this was happening. No such thing as loyalty, I get that but it sucks.

The real problem is that I have been looking for work now for almost 3 months, and haven't had a single interview. I've never seen the job market this slow since I entered this career. Direct applications to companies get crickets, and recruiters are so poorly organized or unresponsive I'm starting to worry about entrusting my information to these people. One recruiter tells me after scheduling an interview the client realized they posted the wrong type of job (after approving the job description). Another says the company was worried about the short tenures I've had with companies, when I have clearly listed that it was contract work. Another says I've been shortlisted for interviews, then radio silence for the last 3 weeks. Another tells me the company declined me because I didn't have experience in two required software packages, even though those are clearly listed on my resume. It's maddening.

I like what I do, and am motivated to work. I have certainly sent out more than 100 applications at this point, maybe closer to 200. I'm reaching out to friends, family, past coworkers, everyone I can think of to find leads on jobs or how I can improve my chances. I'm working 2 side gigs to make ends meet, and I'm lucky to have my wife supporting us with her income, but we all know that single income households don't exist anymore and the constant scramble with no progress is wearing on my mental state. 

All this and I still hear people making statements about lazy people relying on unemployment and benefits so good they don't want to go back to work. That jobs are open because people don't want them. How can people seriously think that, when the process of even finding employment is so grueling at this point? If I hear one more person saying this nonsense, I feel like it's going to take everything in my power to not punch them."

I follow this sub pretty consistently and have taken so many of the tips and used the nuggets of wisdom to be had here. Overall I've become a worker who knows the system better and who doesn't think of myself as a corporate slave. 

Started a new job last Monday, as a receptionist. The office is very small (just the boss and 1 other employee beside myself). I didn't immediately take the disrepair of the office as a red flag because they said they were replacing the floors (which they did do), but I did notice that even during my interview the boss was shit-talking their previous receptionist and said that the worker had messed up some of the filing out of spite. I should have thought about this more in depth but I was pretty excited because the pay was what I was asking for and boss offered me the job then and there. 

Come Monday I start working. There is no training done with me whatsoever, just boss's husband (whom I was told DOES NOT work there, yes with that emphasis), telling me in a very general sense how to work the phone system. Boss is consistently working (dentist) so I get less than half an hour of going over the day and trying to get a few questions in. No matter, I have experience in this field so I do pretty much what I know needs to be done and am working on learning some more of the involved tasks all by myself using an outdated (early 2000's) software handbook.

By Friday I feel like I've figured most of the necessary tasks  The Doctor starts laying into me as soon as I arrive. I am not used to or enjoy confrontation so I just tell her that I had been doing my best to follow her limited instructions and I asked her to believe in me that I was trying my best. The rest of the day we spent going over some details that I had missed. She never explained anything to me, only put the correct things in. Like a teacher giving the answers to a test but never teaching the material. 

Yesterday (Monday) was more of the same from last week, but when I arrived today she starts to berate me again for not following her simple instructions (she will bark them while walking into an exam room to start working on a patient). I simply told her that she can be as frustrated about the situation as she'd like to be, and that I never received any training on processes. Furthermore I insisted that I need to be treated like a human being with dignity. 

Finally, today, I gave her an ultimatum, ""I do not need this job but from the state of this office you need me, I demand that you both apologize to me AND give me a promise that you will act civilly in the future, or I walk."" When she responded that she would absolutely not be doing that I said ""I have one more question, why are you such a shitty boss?"" As I left I told her to eat shit. HAHAHA typing this from my cozy bedroom and sipping my giant iced coffee that i had to, ""leave in the breakroom or throw away.""

FUCK all these bosses, they don't own me and never will. Train me to do the job or shutup.

Very cult like culture (there are people with the logo tattooed), at best they are very unethical but I certainly saw instances of fraud, and they go through a constant cycle of layoffs/mass hiring/layoffs/mass hiring. It is a sinking ship that I am sooo happy I jumped from when I did.

That being said, I feel inclined to leave a negative review and warn other potential employees. I have a review drafted and was very careful to not include anything specific to my role or anything confidential. It is very much so my experience which was INSANE to say the least. More and more negative reviews are popping up since the layoffs and I WISH they were there when I was looking at the job. When I looked, everything said it was great because they literally beg their employees to leave positive reviews. I am still bitter AF about that and the fact that I left an amazing job for this shit show of a company. 

Anyways- my friends have advised against leaving a negative review and think that there's risks associated. I have read a few posts of people saying it isn't as anonymous as we think. What are your takes? Do you post negative reviews after leaving a job? It seems insane that we can't speak our truths without exposing ourselves to some kind of risk."

I know it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs afraid of losing more people, but I‚Äôm angry and hurt. 

This bump would have made it feasible for me to stay. I don‚Äôt want to knowing that this is just a band aid and another sign of poor management, but it still sucks. Just feels like a reminder of why I was leaving: constantly having to fight for any recognition or pay until it was dire. Now it‚Äôs just a slap in the face."

The saddest thing in all of this was how the CEO praised him for still participating in the all-hands. Did it REALLY matter that much? Also, the company Slack was loaded w/ people saying the same crap as the CEO."

Before that I was with an academic lab/core working with the same things for 2.5 years. 

I worked really, really hard at the academic lab. Only took time off if I was sick and then only if I couldn't function. I rarely took a lunch because I was so busy I didn't have time to eat. I'd easily work 10-12 hour days and always got paid for it. My boss was super appreciative and promised me a promotion that never materialized. He blamed it on HR which I want to give the benefit of doubt to him and believe but I never got a promotion. I got tired of the constant push and poor pay. I was about to be living without a roommate and could not afford it. So I looked for a job in the industry and got one. 

At first I was excited because it was way more pay and set 9-5 hours and people were pretty relaxed about that. Things went well for the first year. I got to help on projects and it really seemed like the role was working for me. However, I never heard a whisper of a promotion nor any discussions about my career prospects within the group. I felt invisible to my manager and just drifted through the work hoping something would change. 

It did in the form of a new manager. My previous one was promoted and someone under her was then promoted who I got along with. I thought ""alright, now things might be changing!"". They did not as it was the same old same old. He did help me put together some goals to learn new instruments and techniques but I was always so busy I couldn't do them. 

A few months later a new guy gets brought in and one day after a department-wide meeting, a bunch of us were asked to stay. We were being moved under the new guy to basically do nothing but what I was already doing. I was furious because it felt like I was boxed into a corner to be yet again forgotten about and left to the wolves. They guy was pretty nice and approachable. 

This didn't last more than maybe 3 months before he brought someone in personally to oversee our group since he was the director or whatever of our group (dumb workplace hierarchy stuff). So in about 9 months I'd went through 3 managers. None of whom gave any real guidance and didn't seem to take an interest in being a manager and helping your direct reports grow. 

I did not like the new guy at all. He gave me a really weird vibe that just made me uncomfortable. That sort of went away as I got to know him a bit but he was still always a little awkward and off putting to me. By this point I felt completely boxed out of any opportunity. He let me help on a long term project but that's about it. I've been doing nothing but the same thing since I started. 

I also struggle with depression, anxiety, and chronic migraines. A fact that I had to embarrassingly bring up in a meeting with him, my previous manager, and HR. I was in trouble because I'd missed 2 days without saying anything. At the time this happened I was experiencing really bad withdrawal symptoms from running out of a medication that took a few days to sort out. I also mentioned my chronic migraines as being a reason for absences and having to resort to PTO since I'd ran out of sick days. 

They seemed very understanding and offered me support and just wanted me to fix being late all the time and lower productivity. I did my best and was able to appease them. That is until recently. I'd went on a vacation with my partner and took Monday off the week I'd be returning to work. Except I totally forgot to submit the PTO. I'd thought I had done this, genuinely but my manager was a real dick about it. He clearly didn't believe me, used my last incident against me, called me unreliable, told me to get my shit together because I'd forgotten to do some things that he'd said weren't urgent. 

Needless to say, I left that meeting feeling really down but not worried. Then a few weeks ago I took a long weekend to go see a friend. I ended up getting sick with an ear infection the day after I got back so I was out for 2 days. Both were submitted and he knew. The second day, I see another meeting with him, my previous manager, and HR. This time they were far less friendly and understanding. The HR guy accused me of abusing PTO for sick leave (I've been out of sick leave since February due to chronic migraines). Now I'm to go on a PIP and I feel like my days are numbered. I tried to use my latest performance review to stick up for me but my own boss acted almost as if it didn't say what it said and HR guy interrupted me and told me the performance review doesn't matter. So I just shut down and let them speak their piece and then I left the meeting. I feel like my manager just wants me gone and doesn't like me which is fair because I don't like him. 

I've already started looking for new jobs but I'm not even sure if I want to stay in this career anymore. I'm burned out and tired. I'm not listened to nor accommodated as I feel this should be. I've applied for FMLA to use intermittently for my illness but I feel their just going to fire me anyway. I'm hoping they offer a severance and me quitting in lieu of a PIP but they probably won't. This company doesn't care about any of us. None of them do. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? How did you handle it? I also want to sit down with HR myself and tell my side of things now that I've had time to process and collect my thoughts but I don't think it'd do any good. Sorry for the long rambling rant! I tried to break it up into paragraphs instead of a big wall of text. "

I especially hate that they brush off the impacts as, it MAY effect productivity in the long run.  My American friends fight this as hard as you can.

from Monday:


Forget a four-day workweek, some companies are demanding six

As companies look to increase profits and drive productivity, a six-day workweek is becoming a reality for some Americans. Samsung has already introduced an extra day to the workweek for its executives, and a new report by ResumeBuilder indicates that this trend may be gaining momentum. Based on the responses of 800 companies, the survey showed that one in ten executives plan to mandate a six-day workweek in 2025 and that business leaders overwhelmingly believe longer hours lead to increased revenue. In fact, one in six executives feel employees should work more than 40 hours a week, and an overwhelming 76% think that adding a workday would boost productivity. Career experts warn that enforcing longer workweeks might damage company culture, which, in the long run, could actually harm efficiency.

I had a 30-day review and a 60-day review as well as bi-weekly check ins, and never once did my boss express any concern about my performance. She kept telling me things were going great, then I went in for my 90-day review, and she fired me. When I asked for more information as to why, she insinuated that I had no critical thinking skills. But then offered to give me a good reference lol? (does that even make sense)

It was horrible. I've never been fired before, and what she said really hurt. I cried and left. They had 0 training for this role, she would just tell me to do things, but never explain how/why and she worked from home 99% of the time. She would yell at me and have a horrible attitude any time I had any questions. She was terrible to work with. They hired me and another person on the same day, and they and I had barely any work to do. I had wondered if that was the real reason they let me go.

Anyways - 1 week after firing me, I was she viewed my LinkedIn profile. I decided to remove her, she gives me anxiety, and she 'likes' SO much stuff, I was constantly seeing her name and it was a constant reminder of being fired, which was a humiliating and shameful experience for me. Well now, a week later, she viewed my profile again last night and tried reconnecting. Why?!?? Just leave people alone, especially if you've fired them with 0 warning or opportunity to change and do better. I don't owe you anything and am allowed to keep boundaries that feel healthy for me!"
9,2024-05-21,Entitlement is Not a Dirty Word,u/OneOnOne6211,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cxdoi9/entitlement_is_not_a_dirty_word/,antiwork,"I see the word ""entitlement"" used all the time by corporate media outlets and CEOs to refer to workers. Especially stuff like ""these new millenials are always so entitled.""

Well, let me just say this: Entitled, in this context, is not a dirty word.

Because the way it is used is not to refer to people wanting insane and unreasonable things. The way they use it does not refer to people demanding special treatment. The way they use it ""entitlement"" just means that people want what they are entitled to have.

You are entitled to a living wage that allows you to live a decent life. You are entitled to affordable houses. You are entitled to work from home if you can. You are entitled to have a reasonable working schedule with a good work-life balance. You are entitled to a 4 day work week. You are entitled to have healthcare that you can afford. You are entitled for your boss to not call you on the weekends, and you are entitled to get the wages you are owed by your employer, you are entitled to not work extra hours, you are entitled to your tips.

You deserve these things, because you DO work for them. And you make these other people MILLIONS and BILLIONS through your hard work.

But most importantly, I'll say this: As a worker you are entitled to whatever it is that you can take.

Corporations and their leaders will take from you as much as they can. Anything and everything they can take from you to enrich themselves, they will take it. That is why productivity has gone up 3-fold in the last couple of decades but you still have a 40 hour work week. That is why it has become progressively more common for employers to call you at whatever hours they want and to demand whatever extra hours they can get out of you. That is why the median worker's wage is now LESS than it was in the 1970s despite your increased productivity.

These people will always, ALWAYS grab as much from you as they can get away with. So never let them talk you into feeling anything except justified when doing the same.

Never feel bad about standing up for what you want against them. And force them into giving you whatever you can force them into giving you, because that is what they have been doing to you for your entire life."

I was laid off a few months ago and have been working as an independent contractor (1099) in sales to keep my resume active. Alongside this, I‚Äôve been juggling multiple side hustles to make ends meet, as the independent sales haven‚Äôt been very lucrative yet.

In my recent interview experiences, I‚Äôve faced some tough questions about my sales performance in these new roles. For context, I managed to bring in $30,000 last quarter, which seems unimpressive compared to the $2-5M figures from my previous W-2 employment.

One thing that came up was whether I could embellish these numbers for my 1099 a bit. I know this is a grey area, and honestly, I‚Äôve heard mixed advice about being slightly creative with facts to get through tough spots. However, I want to stick to ethical standards.

I‚Äôm reaching out to this community for some wisdom:

	1.	How can I present my recent sales figures in a better light without crossing ethical lines?
	2.	Are there any ‚Äúwhite lies‚Äù that are commonly acceptable in such situations, or should I avoid them completely?
	3.	Any suggestions on phrasing or focusing on other aspects of my experience during interviews?

I really value your input and look forward to some guidance!"

I have been with my current company for 5 months now working in an industrial quality control position. I have not liked this job from the beginning because I was not told the severity of the working conditions, I‚Äôm covered in fiberglass everyday but was told I would have ‚Äúminimal contact‚Äù with it, and the schedule is not was I was told during the interview & hiring phase, was told it was rotating 8 hour shifts Mon-Fri but it has been rotating 12 hour shifts Mon-Fri. I started off just working Mon-Thurs, 12 hour days (48 hours/week), but for the past two months I‚Äôve been on Mon-Fri , 12 hour days (60 hours/week). Also, they just hired my old terrible boss from my past job to be my new boss at this job. 

I was able to handle these conditions, but when I went into work last night, there were papers posted in various locations throughout the plant informing everyone that we will be on a 24/7, 4 on 2 off, rotating schedule effective at the start of the next week. I have now given up on the prospect of just sucking it up and working here until I find a new job and want to resign at the end of this week, 3 days.

I have a Bachelors in Biology and am not using my degree at this current job, so I am not too concerned with ‚Äúruining‚Äù my professional background, but I don‚Äôt want to burn bridges if a future job contacts them. The paper also informed us that we will be working this Saturday and Memorial Day, Monday, and I already have out of state plans I am not going to back out of.

I don‚Äôt feel confident in putting in a 2 weeks notice just to tell them the days I will not be able to work during it. I feel like it might be best to tell them I resign with a 3 day notice.

The management at my job used to always say, ""This is NOT a 40-hour/week job.  That is why you're on salary.""

Now that the overtime laws are changing, next year everyone who's on salary under 58k (which is most of the salary management at my company) will make 1.5x pay after 40 hours.

My job's response is to now tell everyone they CAN NOT work over 40 hours, but you must still get the same amount of work done and profits must continue to grow.

Anyone else seeing anything similar?"

So I posted this a while back and wanted to uodate, I still haven't paid anything on my loans at all.

For context I didn't pay because my school failed to meet the promises they made when it comes to supporting its students even after graduation.

A part of this shattered me upon graduation because I was completely overwhelmed with my life and what I wanted to do.

When I first posted this I got a lot of support from this sub which I appreciated but I also got a lot of backlash. People called me lazy or irresponsible (which I guess would be slightly true if you read the title with no context and wanna be a keyboard warrior)

Any who I knew that the educational system failed me you guys who supported me gave me the resources and warnings I needed even though  I was mainly ranting. 

My loans have been forgiven turns out that the school I attended was going some illegal mess (foraging graduation rates, falsifying promises to students etc) 

I got an email at the beginning of May telling me to stop paying my loans anf I thought it was a scam until I traced the email back to the studentaid.gov website. 

After confirming I realized that I'm actually going to be forgiven for every cent and my credit history would also be wiped of the loans.

So....yeah to everyone that was flamming me (or attempting too) just know that taking advantage of stressed underaged studentsanfd gas lighting them into going to school for the sake of ""The american dream"" isn't always the best way to go through life. 

Anyways I work in logistics now and I have for a while. I work good hours have great benifets and I work from home (I actually love my job) I absolutely hated my last job I was miserable and contemplated killing myself. 

I do feel like a weight was lifted from my shoulders though school should be this expensive and jobs shouldn't be miserable that's no way to live. 

I want to live life the way I want to. I'm still in my 20s I don't think decisions I made in my early teens with intentions on bettering my life should burden me still to this day.

No one should feel that way."

It also helps to keep in mind our supervisor is always around so he can hear whatever we listen to.

I can't name names because I am still employed and it's against our rules to say what might be deemed negative on solical media. However, it's a small one and it has a lot of the mismanagement and pseudo feudalism of any company like this. And they have only gotten worse since I got hired a few months ago. When it began, we were suing a paper system that relied on us to pull products by hand and mark it all down on the order sheets. It was more work but it was manageable. They had at the time promised to upgrade the system to digital and that this would make things easier and simpler for everyone. We prepared for the day and hoped it would work.

We started actually using it about a month ago. It shit the bed from day one and has only continued to roll around in the brown sheets as all the employees are forced to watch. Nothing works like it should, the system is a decade old and used software from 2014 as per the liscense information, only a handful of people having access to important features and there's no way to use it if that person is not there, and we are constantly fixing mistakes thanks to no longer having the system that had rules in place to make it easier for quality control. And everyday, a new problem arises and adds to the horrible way things are run. Like wrapping up products for shipment, only to have it unwrapped, ""fixed"", and put away until we have to repeat the process several more times before shipping out.

And thanks to it being ten hours a day and a night shift, the stress is not only making me want to do illegal things, I'm so deficient in some nutrients that my doctor (when I could get one after two months waiting for insurance) said I needed a special pill regimen to fix what caused me extreme fatigue, dizziness, skeletal pain, and fevers. All from dealing with the stress and overwork, and being unable to recover from the work week. And I'm not the only one.  Like the other week when we had sixty hours and one day off. I didn't leave my bed for two days and no one was surprised or worried, it was almost expected.

Now we had QR codes that didn't work for the customers to check products in case of recalls, and we were told it would take all night to fix (it's still being fixed today by worker they brought from another plant). My coworkers and I were rightfully pissed and one threatened to send in their two weeks to the supervisor to his face. He just laughed, they did not. Talked to them after and both agreed to quit if the issue was that severe. This had several of my coworkers soon after beginning to blast RATM on the speakers because they got in a ""fuck it"" mood. I don't think the supervisor got the hint..."

You know what grinds my gears? The hypocrisy! They preach about work-life balance while they're sipping organic kombucha on a beach in Malibu. Meanwhile, I'm juggling deadlines like flaming torches and praying I don't drop one and set my sanity ablaze.

And let's talk about those team-building exercises‚Äîbecause nothing says ""bonding"" like trust falls and awkward icebreakers. But when it comes to real support? Crickets. Mr. California Dreamin' is too busy communing with spirit animals to give a damn about our struggles.

So here's my message to Mr. California: Your ayahuasca-induced enlightenment won't pay my rent or fix my caveman laptop. Maybe instead of chanting mantras, try chanting ""employee benefits."" Just a thought.

10,2024-05-21,"Company pulled ""bait and switch"" with my new schedule. I'm not sure what to do.",u/lonelyants,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cxm36u/company_pulled_bait_and_switch_with_my_new/,antiwork,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask for this kind of advice, but it's the first place I thought of. 

I work from home in customer service for a large company that is constantly expanding without hiring new people. For this reason, existing employees are currently having their assigned schedules stripped away so that new ones better aligned with ""business needs"" can be assigned based on our metrics (highest metrics = first to pick, lowest = you get what's left). 

As fucked up as this system sounded, I'd been dying for a new schedule and worked my ass off for a shot at some sort of work/life balance. When schedules were finally announced I got exactly what I asked for, with the stipulation that I'd need to do some additional training I'd previously declined as it meant almost doubling my workload for no additional pay. I agreed to this ONLY because my new schedule was an absolute dream, and (in my mind) just as good as a raise. 

A week later, we get an email saying that the start date for our new schedule was being pushed back. I was annoyed, but I got over it since **there was no mention of those schedules being changed.** I go through with my training - it's hell - and continue working as usual while counting down the days until I'm able to clock out while the sun is still up. For those few weeks, my manager was out of office several times on 3-4 day vacations. Our team would occasionally receive forwarded emails from other managers with important info that she wasn't there to give us.  

A week ago, I get a message from my manager a few minutes before I get off asking why I hadn't submitted my new shift preferences list as it would be due that evening. I checked every single email I'd received since it was announced that our new schedules were being postponed - I got nothing. I let her know this, and she says she can't find the email either and will just use the one I submitted originally. Again, I'm annoyed, but I figure my *new* new schedule can't be too different as my metrics had been consistently high. 

I got that new new schedule today, and it is more or less my current schedule without the consecutive off days (think 10 hour shifts, off Mon, Wed, Fri). Out of maybe 20 possible schedules, it was more than halfway down my original preference list. I checked and double checked, and my metrics are actually *higher* now than when my dream schedule was awarded. I genuinely have no idea how this happened, and I waited around for half an hour after I got off in hopes of asking my manager but she marked herself out of office not long after I sent an email asking for clarification. No prior notice she'd be away, and no word on when she'll be back. 

What am I supposed to do about this? I'm infamously bad at putting my foot down, but I can't imagine continuing at this company without getting the scheduled I worked for. 

Tl;Dr: I was promised a new, easier schedule based on my high metrics. I agreed to take on additional work for this easier schedule. I just found out that - despite me taking on the additional work and still keeping my metrics high - I will actually be getting a different, shittier schedule. Who do I yell at and how loud?  "

If your job can be entirely WFH, which I imagine is the case most of the time since we use computers, then their mandate is just to fuck with you, to make another demand of their obedient pet.

I thought it was interesting,  in 2024, that a recruiter herself offered me the possibility to start a brand new career in a different professional field,  so I decided to give her a call (I always prefer to call instead of continuing long email chains). 
At first,  she was enthusiastic that I called her back and we talked a bit, but then something didn't sound right to me and I asked her if she knew what was my current job now (I always keep my socials updated). She replied: ""No, can you explain?"". At that point,  I was already pretty pissed off, because she contacted me in the first place, but I proceeded to explain what I was doing. 
As soon as I finished, she said something like: ""I am sorry but your profile does not correspond to what we are looking for"".
The call ended shortly after and then I found myself thinking: ""wait a minute, she contacted me in the first place and also wrote a message with ""career change"" in the subject, and then she deemed me un'altra for the role because I work in a different field..""
I couldn't holt myself but laugh about how it is comical (to be optimistic) that we completely normalized the total incompetence of most of the HR and recruiters... given the power that they have,  to me it is just crazy...
It is a second time in less than a year that a situation like this happens to me..

TLDR:
Recruiter contacted me and offered me a ""career change"". I called back and assessed that she did not even knew what is my current job. After talking, despite she offered specifically a ""career change"", she told me that ""my profile does not correspond"" because I work in a different field (which she could have seen because I keep my social profiles always updated). The call ended and I find these kind of situations at the limit of tragicomical.

5,2024-05-22,Supposed GDPR breach,u/Geralt_Blackfyre,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cxte1l/supposed_gdpr_breach/,antiwork,"Hi guys,

I just need some guidance. Last week I was pulled into a meeting which was described as an ""informal catch up"". So a so called ""friend"" had a secret meeting with this manager the week prior when he was on holiday. He told him that I had sent him another colleagues number without their permission. 

Now, a bit of background, this ""friend: who we will call Allen, asked me for the number of another friend who we will call John, because John had asked Allen for a tutorial to help him with something. So, thinking we were all friends, obliged thinking that John would really need this tutorial. We all work the Night shift 9pm - 5am. These messages occurred at around 8am, outside the working hours. 

Anyway, back to the meeting, I walk in to the Manager and a HR rep. Odd for an ""informal catch up"" I know. Long story short l, the manager asked me if I sent the number to which I replied ""yes but I'm sure I must have checked with John before I sent it, can I check my phone?"" Turns out I didn't check with John and showed the manager the messages between myself and Allen, in which it clearly states he needed the number to send John a tutorial. 

Manager claimed I had breached the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by giving another colleagues number to a different colleague. I explained that I did not send the number as my capacity as a colleague of the business but rather as my capacity as a friend. I did not obtain or send the number by accessing company property, files or servers, in fact I obtained the number through the owner since we're you know... friends. Also, this was outside business hours.

The manager replied that it does not matter if it was outside business hours or the fact that it was not obtained or sent with company property,servers or files, I had the number and u sent it without the owner's permission. 

Can anyone tell me if this falls into GDPR jurisdiction in the UK because I have tried to look for an example of this but can't seem to find one.

Any help in this matter would help tremendously, especially if anyone is very familiar with GDPR in the UK.

Its because we have 10x the stress and work pressure at work than they had. One  Boomer reported that his job was doing 3 big orders a day. That was his job he did in 8 hours. Someone answered that this could be done in less than 1 hour today.

Due to computers and emails and the internet we are probably doing 10x the amount of work in the office as Boomers. Everyhing is super fast. You are bombarded by 100 or 200 emails every day of which 3/4 are ""urgent"" - everyone can contact you and give you work to do. When you get out of work you are half dead and have 0 energy left.

Same applies for blue collar jobs. Truck drivers reported that they had HOURS where they could just park and rest because their schedule wasnt packed until the last microsecond. Between the shipments they had half a day or a day off, so they could regenerate and actually see somthing of the city/region they spent their time in. Nowadays they are monitored 24/7 have 0 time and have to help with loading/unloading.

Its a BIG difference if you work 40 or 45 hours at 1/2 or 1/3 of your maximum or 40 hours at 90%+ of your maximum. If they reduce workload/pressure to the levels Boomers had - I wouldnt mind ""working"" 40 hours.

Like seriously, how is it fair that a handful of people hoard so much wealth while the rest of us struggle just to make ends meet? It‚Äôs infuriating. I mean, look at Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, or any of those other guys with more money than they could spend in a thousand lifetimes. They have all this power and influence, and what do they do with it? Build rocket ships to play in space while people here on Earth are fighting just to survive.

We hear these stories about billionaires donating to charity or starting foundations, but it‚Äôs just a drop in the bucket compared to what they could be doing. And let‚Äôs be real, a lot of those ‚Äúcharitable‚Äù acts are just tax write-offs or ways to get more public praise. Meanwhile, the systems that let them get that rich in the first place stay exactly the same. They get richer, we get poorer, and the gap keeps widening.

It‚Äôs maddening when you think about all the essential workers, the people who really keep society running ‚Äì teachers, nurses, grocery store workers ‚Äì getting paid peanuts compared to these billionaires. And don‚Äôt even get me started on how these billionaires treat their workers. Amazon warehouse conditions? Insane. People literally peeing in bottles because they can‚Äôt take a bathroom break? How is that even legal?

And the politicians are no help. They‚Äôre all in the pockets of these rich guys, getting campaign donations and cushy jobs after they leave office. The whole system is rigged to keep the wealth where it is ‚Äì in the hands of the few. The rest of us are just here to pay taxes and keep the machine running.

I think we really need to rethink how wealth is distributed in this country. Maybe it‚Äôs time to seriously consider a wealth tax, or even more radical ideas like worker-owned businesses. The status quo just isn‚Äôt working. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and it feels like nothing‚Äôs going to change unless we make a big, collective push for it.

Anyone else fed up with this? What can we do to start changing things? I‚Äôm just so tired of seeing these people live in luxury while the rest of us fight for scraps."

 Later, I found out closing day happened to be on an office day again the following week. I planned to be in office but then we had more inspections so I put in PTO since I would be out about 3-4 hours. My boss later tells me that I need to be careful to not make this a habit and that she doesn't want me to take advantage of this and to make this day up. I told her it was last minute that they had inspections and my babysitter happened to schedule vacation the rest of the week so my childcare arrangements make it hard to come in the office on my wfh days.

4,2024-05-22,VP of Finance said my position was eliminated today. This is less than 4 months after he encouraged me to transition to the role...,u/SwayZSays,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cy14d1/vp_of_finance_said_my_position_was_eliminated/,antiwork,"Earlier this year I interviewed for a promotion after being with the company for a year and a half. Despite numerous higher ups being impressed with my track record and recommending me for the role, the hiring manager (who I've worked with the whole time) decided to go with an outside hire-- moving someone halfway across the country and training them from scratch. 

Once I was given the news that I wasn't selected, my boss's boss gave me the option to report directly to her in a different position, but technically a lateral move-- no salary or upgrade in title. Her boss, the VP of Finance, encouraged me to take this role. Sr Managers, Directors, and another VP all encouraged me to take the role.

Once I transitioned, I was given minimal work and next to no direction. I asked for more to do. I was finally given an interesting project and worked on it for weeks with multiple stakeholders. As soon as I was ready to present, the VP hired an outside consultant, gave them everything I'd put together and laid me off the next day due to ""company performance"".

TLDR:
Executives made bad strategy decisions, the company lost customers, and several people lost their jobs as a result, but the executives whose choices lost business remain at the company. My position was eliminated after less than 4 months by the man who told me to take the role. 

Never expect loyalty from an employer.

We go into people's homes, measure, give a presentation, and then try to haggle over the price. Commission based, and I was the best, so they promoted me to assistant manager.

My manager quit, so I was left to run the Indianapolis branch alone. It was a baptism by fire, and I came out the other side glowing. My performance review said I had gone above and beyond in almost every aspect, and they were going to implement some of my ideas into company policy. I loved my job.

But they didn't promote me to manager because I didn't have previous management experience. They hired M, and on his first day we all believed M could lead us to glory. His first week, he was scammed out of $1200 from a phishing email. It took 5hrs of driving from store to store buying itunes gift cards for him to even become suspicious.

His first month, M ran out of fancy speeches and we lost faith in him. He couldn't even work the staff calendar and constantly scheduled people to work on their day off. I could do his job standing on my head at this point, but every time I tried to help M acclimate, his ego would put me back in my place. After a while I stopped caring that he was hurting the company, but he was still hurting my reps.

About once a month my regional manager would come by for whatever reason, and every month for five months I complained about M. I showed text messages of M being disrespectful to me for trying to help. I showed pictures of his shoddy work. I was so stressed out that I was puking on the job, and my employees could see red rings around my eyes from burst blood vessels. Every month, the regional assured me he would look into it.

One day M held a meeting, which we do every Thursday, and he started blasting the company and our flooring installers, so I hit record on my phone. I caught him saying our installers were not trustworthy and that corporate doesn't want our commission employees to have line of sight about their own money. I brought this to corporate. I received a slap on the wrist for recording him.

Our regional was promoted to VP, and another manager was now our regional. On his first visit to our satellite he sat me down and explained ""I know you don't like M, and you want his job, but he's your boss whether you like it or not. Get in line or get out."" 

It took a month for me to find another job. As I was writing my resignation letter, our new regional called M to see if this ultimatum changed my attitude. I couldn't believe it. It was glaringly obvious in every aspect how worthless M was to this position, but I'm the one with the attitude problem? It occurred to me, why should I give notice if they already think I have an attitude problem? So I left my stuff on my desk and walked out.

I had been on-call from 7am to 9pm 6 days a week for 6 months straight. It took me weeks after quitting to get my first good night of sleep. Since leaving, I've gone back to old hobbies, and I'm so much happier. I'm unemployed, getting back to a healthier weight, and bills are stacking up.

But I'd rather die penniless with a smile than continue feeding this broken system.

Felt amazing waking up the next day knowing I was done. To be honest, that place really did feel like I was walking into a prison. I couldn't be happier. I have no regrets leaving or how I quit either. I flat out blocked my bosses number and for all intensive purposes disappeared. I pray my boss doesn't find another employee for the own employees well being. Seriously, fuck that job. The money wasn't worth it when it was slowly killing my sanity. After blocking my bosses number, I received 5 missed calls and 4 texts messages. Surprisingly only took my boss 4 days to figure out I'm not coming back. I wouldn't even take that job back for $50hr. What amazes me is that my boss never asked me once why I quit, let alone so abrupt. However, only a good boss who gives a shit would be asking their employees this question. I didn't expect so many people to be interested in this 3 part posts. Therefore, have any questions that aren't too personal I'll answer them.

I clean a dentist office a business complex and a hospice. My boss called and asked if I would do two more properties, saying I would have more hours and a raise. Seemed like a good deal even though she didn‚Äôt specify how much. 

The week (new properties are only serviced once a week.) came to start the new properties so I asked about the raise. She said she would remember something like that but she will see what she could do. I get trained at my normal rate that‚Äôs fine but one of the properties has a huge task load and a short window of time. Plus the person training me doesn‚Äôt know or care to understand about 1/8 to 1/4 of the tasks, he basically told me those tasks don‚Äôt matter. Which is not my style. I would rather complete everything to the customers desire. 

Next week on my own still not answer about the raise. I tell my boss I‚Äôm willing to do one of the spaces for my original pay rate but I won‚Äôt take on both unless she was willing to give me the insensitive originally offered. That the person training didn‚Äôt understand all the tasks and I would need additional training if I were to do the second space. The boss offers me the time off I asked for a month ago. I say cool thanks. 

She again calls. I record the phone call this time in case she forgets what was said during the conversation because she obviously didn‚Äôt want to do it through email or text. She offers me payment for drive time and a 3 dollar (more than I was expecting) increase in my pay rate. She says the boss above her would need to approve that but is on vacation and will return on the 17th. 

Next week comes and I am put on the schedule for all three properties ( the two new ones and the property I clean normally every week night.) Again I reiterated that I am willing to do the new properties if she is willing to insensitive me. I explained there was about an hour of driving between the properties so without the pay raise the extra hours are not worth it to me. She asked if I could cover because I am a better quality cleaner than the manager that trained me on the property and it being new customers they would like the job to be as thorough as I clean. I said with all due respect could he not be asked to do a more thorough job? A few hours later they called and asked if I could please do the shift as there was several call outs and the manager needs to cover those shifts. I was offered a one time 50 dollar bonus. I take it. 

The next week they asked me to drive to the one of the two new properties I was willing to take on without an increase payment. I thought I was cleaning it that week but not the other space. Nope. I was there to give the manager my key. He told me they were going to put up an add for the new jobs. At this point the boss was telling me she was still waiting to find out if I could get a pay increase. I tell him that I was waiting to hear back and only covered the shift last week because of so many call outs. The look on his face tells me that was in fact not the case last week. 

This week nothing. We are now past the date I‚Äôm sure they are just hiring someone new for a super part time position. 5 hours a week. Pay to onboard that person and whatever else. When they could have just done literally anything to help me feel more invested in helping them out to begin with. Not giving me time off til they thought they could use it as a bargaining chip. Offer me pay for drive time. Offer me a smaller amount of money increase and immediately implementing it. If they would have done any of these things I would have been happy. Instead they don‚Äôt have me to cover the shifts and I feel really unappreciated and want to half ass my normal routine because they obviously don‚Äôt care as an employee so I don‚Äôt really care about my performance.

16,2024-05-22,Advice from a hard worker,u/Eden1914,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cy8uug/advice_from_a_hard_worker/,antiwork,"Do not work hard.

Wow, what a revolutionary idea. It's not like that's what this whole subreddit is for or anything /s

But seriously, I came here mostly to give my slice of life, more or less to vent tbh. None of the ideas in this post will be wholly unique, just reinforcing topics beat like a dead horse. 

I'm a hard worker. A really hard worker. My bosses use me to unofficially train new people on their first day because I'm their ""blueprint"" (their words, not mine). I'm a poster-child, a perfect representation of exactly how manipulatable they want their workers to be.

I work, and I work without questions, I work without hesitations, I work with or without orders, I work quickly and I work to meet expectations exactly where\when\how they're expected, *if* not above and beyond taking some liberties to step out of my bounds to *excell* expectations.

I do it mostly to get away from home. When I work, I work to vent. I get into it so I can stick to myself, have a quiet day full of tasks to distract me. Sometimes I'll be the only one working, and I won't even complain about it because it gives me more misc to think about, and less home.

And not once has it amounted to anything besides the passing courtesies of fake empty thank-yous.

I seen somewhere on the internet the idea ""working hard is useless because nobody besides you will remember how hard you worked, but your family will remember how often you weren't home"", and with 100% certainty I vouch for this statement being true.

Working hard is not worth it. Doing favors for your coworkers, being the only one on task, taking up extra labor and extra hours. None of it is worth it. The only thing you can do in your career that has any impact moving forward (moving up the ladder I mean) is doing the bare minimum you can to not get fired, and focusing on being valuable in a different way.

If you want to make money, you need to make your boss some money. And that depends entirely on one trait. Your social skills. How well can you sell? How well can you manipulate? How certain are you in your ability to embellish without completely lying? Can you socialize your boss and become friends so he is more apt to think about you before the people who actually work ""with"" you? Are you okay with the idea of being cut-throat and *literally traumatizing* coworkers with at-work rumors/drama/decharacterizing so you can get opportunities that *would have* been given to them before you took control of the narrative? Are you able to pick up your slack when you're called out so you *look* like you're improving before you slowly settle down and go right back to your old habits?

If you answered yes to any of the above, then congratulations üëè, you're a sick sack of capitalist trash. And you're definitely going to have a better time in this system than most others.

I wish I knew this before setting my own standard for myself. Do you know how insulting it is to be treated like The Perfect Worker when you get the lowest annual raise amongst your ""team"". Do you know how devaluing it is to do ""3 dAyS Of wOrk"" in one 6 hour shift, just to be scheduled a meager 18 hours the next week despite being ""full time"". Do you know how humiliating it is to hear your boss say ""Yeah, he can honestly work anywhere"" just to refuse to write you a letter of recommendation because ""you just don't cut it in some areas"" despite a sentence before being told ""come on man, you're way too valuable to leave me here"". 

If you work hard you **will** be a puppet. That's consistent. It's principal. Literally an in-game function at this point.

Tl:Dr

Working hard = nobody cares, you'll be used like a condom

Not working hard = become everything you hate and for what? You're still objectively never going to be a millionaire either way.

The system is dead and we didn't kill it, we were merely born in it."

i‚Äôve had issues with a manager creating a hostile workplace (with me included) for a year now. people have switched stores, complained, filed, nothing changes.

i brought up my concerns to store leader (who‚Äôs friends with that manager, so not much changed) in december with a steward and a 3-page letter.

she saw a coworker and i speaking recently and vented to store lead about it. store lead threatened suspension for ‚Äòwasting time‚Äô.

in order to protect myself, i filed an ethics report complete with 9+ pages of documented incidences (with dates and descriptions), along with the other 3 pages, so 12 pages total. i stayed anonymous and expressed fear of retaliation due to the highly specific nature of the report.

5 days after i got an email saying the report investigation was finished, i got called into the office with the store lead and district HR.

for background: i have IBS. diagnosed years ago, have a doctor‚Äôs medical note since 2021. i have to use the bathroom at work which i cannot control. all members of management know this. nothing has changed in 3 years and was never a concern.

until now, 5 days after the report. where district HR tells me management is ‚Äòvery concerned‚Äô about me ‚Äòdisappearing‚Äô on my shift. i explained its to go to the bathroom, which they all know. she asked if i tell management when i have to go (obviously no that would be uncomfortable/demeaning) among other questions.

when asked if i had a doctor note, i said yes, to which she was shocked, so was store lead, and they pulled it out and read it. suddenly after that the questioning stopped and the meeting ended (they asked for a new one, which i think is ridiculous for a chronic issue, but i relented).

my concern is that this could not be random. nothing has changed in 3 years besides an ethics report investigation being finalized 5 days ago. i expressed my concerns at the meeting which were dismissed.

the note itself said due to my condition i can use the restroom without reproach (which happened here).

what in the world do i do now? nothing is helping, every avenue i turn to, and no doubt if they couldn‚Äôt get me on this they‚Äôre gearing up to try and terminate me soon."

Anyway when I handed in my notice, I rang our HR rep to say I didn‚Äôt feel supported and that I felt the meetings were out of the blue as they gave me the first meeting invite the evening of my annual leave and the morning I returned back to work was when the meeting happened, and the 2nd one I had less than 24hrs to prepare for. 

Anyway as HR does, they defended my manager, said that the first meeting ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a formal meeting‚Äù as it had a ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù (meaning I wasn‚Äôt warned) and that the second meeting I didn‚Äôt have a formal warning either, anyway I got her to look for the email she sent back 4 months before for the first one and she said ‚Äúinvite to‚Ä¶.oh‚Ä¶ well yes it is titled that but it wasn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt take action as when I applied for new positions I knew I would need a reference, I‚Äôve just been offered a job and I had to put them down as a reference.

I had a look at the reference form they have to fill in and it asks ‚ÄúHave they been through formal or informal disciplinary proceedings during the last year of their employment?  If yes please give details.‚Äú

I‚Äôm so nervous, I am going into a completely different field to law, it‚Äôs in special educational needs and completely unrelated to my apprentice role, I assume they will put my ‚Äúmeetings‚Äù down and I was very transparent with my new employer as to why I left and also that the reference may only be satisfactory, which they were fine with but I‚Äôm just nervous with what they may say, I had to put the HR lady down and I just feel sick thinking she will stop me getting this role - do you think I should be worried? I have had two other good references sent to my new job, just don‚Äôt know if I should be worrying as much as I am‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think It would be malicious if I hadn‚Äôt have been honest with HR at the end‚Ä¶but because I spoke up I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll try to jeopardise me.

TLDR-bad run with last employer, spoke up, had to put them as a reference, worried they may give me a bad one out of spite"

My boss (55 M) is a white man that at the beginning was very nice and he‚Äôs in general a very charismatic person (he earns 4x what I earn) but the more I worked on his team the more I realized he treated me differently to the other colleagues that are white. For instance, he is always very patient to my other white colleagues and respects their opinion, whilst with me he looses his patience in a heartbeat, shouts at me and stares at me for minutes in a very strange way. His mood swings are completely unpredictable

Since I was raised to ‚Äúwork very hard for my dreams‚Äù I am very dedicated to my job and I always give the extra mile in a ridiculous way, working way after hours. Well, last year one of my colleagues quit and I offered to cover his position (for free) using my language skills (for free) so that my team/boss would not suffer (in a different time zone may I add (+8 hours)).  I did this extra job for almost 9 months, plus all my other responsibilities. I wanted to work hard, live the American dream and be promoted (there were no positions available to be promoted but fuck it, American dream) 

What did I get in return? Because the all our processes were never formalized because we are all too busy to fix something properly, my boss just calls me and shouts at me about this extra work I did as if I was just ruining everything. So many people didnt make an effort to even consider the time difference so I ended up working after 9pm everyday and on the weekends to catch up with my personal work. It was so bad I ruptured my intestine but was so busy I only took 2 hours off and cried the rest of it 

Because I need a visa to work, I fear he knows I can‚Äôt quit, but most of all I regret so much doing out of my work scope in order to ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù. Learn from me, grabbing extra work (and for free) means extra problems means ungratefulness to not do everything perfectly. Just don‚Äôt!!

2,2024-05-22,Mandatory meetings,u/Freya713,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cycrj8/mandatory_meetings/,antiwork,"We are in FL and I already know there are very few protections for workers under state law. 

My husband and I have the same days off. This is relevant. We are both in the service industry. I don't want to give too many details as fast as our exact jobs because it may be immediately identifiable. 

He drives the car because he has to drive around all day and sometimes be on the thruway. The scooter does 40mph max so I need to stay off of the main roads due to speed limits and safety. It stands to reason that sometimes there are things to do and places to go where we need the car and I can not get to on my scooter. 

We both negotiated Tuesday and Wednesday off with our respective jobs so that we can spend time together as well as get things done that are just part of life.

His company schedules mandatory meetings and they're always on Wednesday, one of our 2 days off. Always, and they're pretty frequent. He has attended a few but has also not attended a few due to plans and/or appointments.

These meetings are paid. If he was on the clock, he's be paid mileage to get there and hourly for the meeting. Because it is his day off, he only gets paid hourly and these meetings are at the warehouse about 45 minutes away. If you know the 95 traffic in south Florida, you know that 45 minutes can be much longer in heavy traffic.

This seems incredibly unfair as there are only a few people that have Wednesdays off. I hesitate to use the word discriminatory because of the negative connotations but it does seem that because of his days off and the meetings always being scheduled on this days that it affects him and a few others but not everyone. Others who are working get mileage and hourly pay. 

I understand that he's not being singled out here but this always affects his days off but never affects those who aren't off work those days. 

Is there anything he can do to not have to sacrifice a day off and/or have to change appointments because of these meetings? Talking to management is like talking to a brick wall even though they always say there needs to be a good work/life balance.

Can he actually be fired for missing these mandatory meetings when it always affects him but not all the others? I know, at will employment, blah blah. But if he is fired, is there any recourse available to him?

And, yes, he is looking for another job due to this and many other reasons.

TLDR: Mandatory company meetings are always scheduled on husbands days off. His mileage isn't paid the same as others working that day and those that do work that day aren't losing a good majority of their days off.

They handed most of our job duties over to their existing employees and made them our supervisors, leaving us with nothing to do every day.

As the conversation must be going at most companies nowadays, what is the best way to get rid of our most talented, loyal workers? Cross that boundary, of course. I‚Äôm not saying there aren‚Äôt good workers that have trouble setting boundaries and tolerating unnecessary bs from their company- but that is absolutely what companies are hoping will happen.

Companies are experts in negotiating so that workers end up with the short end of the stick- then the company says, let‚Äôs whittle away at the end of that short stick. When an employee expresses ‚Äúhey, that short end of the stick is really difficult for me due to personal circumstances- how can I work to still meet your needs as a business and my needs as an employee by approaching this in a different way?‚Äù Instead of engaging with negotiation, nuance, or a DEAL of some sort, as one would  often have to do in a real negotiation, said employee is met with very one-sided, arbitrary policy.

And policy is just words. Actions speak much louder than words. How many people actually feel motivated by a half-attempted buzzword filled email that someone got paid millions per year to write? Do words like ‚Äúsynergy‚Äù and ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù motivate all of you to suddenly jump out of bed, and rush into work, happy to start your day? Jeez. You‚Äôd think business people would be good at persuasion, selling, and convincing others to be motivated. To me, bad leadership IS disconnect, it IS being out of touch with your employees. Isn‚Äôt your whole purpose in showing up to work to convince others to do so as well? Eventually, that disconnect will get in the way of company talent, and therefore profits. It has to.

If you work hard, if you bring something of value to your work, recognize it. You have negotiating power. If you are being stonewalled, LEAVE. Learn to say no to them- see how they like their stick dust of a company they have left over from all their whittling. If one bigger company is giving you problems and can‚Äôt see the path to innovation, there are 20 other companies that can and will.

The United States work week should be a standard 4 days, 32 hours, for the same salary or adjusted hourly (eg $20 at 40 would be $25 at 32). Men and women break their backs working manual labor jobs doing 20 hours of overtime because that's the only way they feel they can earn enough to afford to feed their families, because they aren't getting a fair wage. Well, maybe overtime wouldn't go away, and it certainly should not considering you're using YOUR FREE TIME TO WORK THOSE EXTRA HOURS FOR THEM, but instead of working 60 hours (40+20), you'd work the NEW STANDARD 8 hours, 4 days a week, plus every hour you go over on a daily basis would be 1.5x pay. They want you to come work on Friday, when the standard is to have off (in a 4 day worn week)? 2x pay. This is the only solution, labor is worth more than they're willing to pay and our freetime is the most valuable thing we have and if they're going to steal it from us then they better be willing to pay dearly for it. Also, on am unrelated note, $17 per hour should be mimum wage...that's $30k after taxes. If you can live on anything less than that as a single adult, you aren't really living, because you're probably working two jobs."

I am a year into my position and all of them have been horrible. I could go on about all of them but let me just speak about my most recent:

1. Supervisor constant messaging on chat. God forbid it‚Äôs my work from home day. That escalates to x10. 

2. Constant ‚Äúplease remember to‚Ä¶‚Äù messages for routine duties. 

3. ‚ÄúDid you check out the email I just sent you?‚Äù After literally having sent it like 10 seconds prior. 

4. Random unnecessary updates such as XYZ person/departnent is short staffed. 

5. Never replies to me in a timely manner but if I receive a message sends an IMPORTANT icon on chat and never stops messaging. 

6. My coworker literally texted and called me on my PTO days asking me where I put a file when it was my coworker‚Äôs file to begin with. I still responded and once they found out it was theirs they ignored my call and said ‚Äúsorry I found it‚Äù via text. 

7. Coworker made a rude comment to me about a new system I was learning during my first three months and said ‚Äúcome on, even the intern knows that.‚Äù To which I responded, yeah cause anybody who has been here long enough would know. This is to do with software, not accounting. 

8. I have been called on my hour lunch break if someone arrives and needs something, they will disturb and ask me where an envelope is or what happened to something. 

9. The door is CONSTANTLY buzzing with people trying to come through and they expect you to get up and go answer it. 

10. Another supervisor asked me a personal question to which I semi answered to try to change topic and they made a very personal assessment of my family life that was unwarranted. 

11. 100 things going on at the same time and everybody acts like everything is so urgent so you can‚Äôt actually get anything done and end up making mistakes with constant task switching. 

12. Suggesting me when to go to lunch because ‚Äúit may rain‚Äù or a general ‚Äúmake sure to go to lunch right now‚Äù instead of when I want to go. 

13. Constant popping up behind you while you work to startle you to ask you about something random. Umm how many times do I have to be zoned into work as someone pops up behind me with a loud voice and comments if I did xyz? Unwarranted. 

14. I forgot to do something I was asked because the person interrupted one task of mine then as I went on to do their task another person interrupted that task. Then the person who requested the first task messaged my supervisor to ask me why I didn‚Äôt finish XYZ and then writes ‚Äúmake sure next time you do as asked‚Äù

I‚Äôm so exhausted and fed up. Is that what this field is? I don‚Äôt even want this anymore. I‚Äôm so exhausted. I worked from 8 am to 7:30 pm today and still didn‚Äôt finish. I am sure tomorrow I will hear about why XYZ files are still sitting there.

From the people I've talked with so far, no one is happy about the forced conversion to be salaried employees or pay cuts that have come along with it in the interest of ""cutting costs"" but my two decades of experience are actually around the average for my position - there are a LOT of people that have been around for 15-40 years.

1) I understand that management is typically excluded from union contracts. What if we are trying to fight for proper pay and go against being salary, and trying to actually promote the good of our employees and customers over corporate interests? Basically there are about 12 of us who I'm close work-friends with who are all NOT on board with the corporate atmosphere and want to fight to change it.

2) How do I find someone to talk to? I know there are resources online but it's so overwhelming to sift through. Do I need to know of a retail workers union? Can I just find my nearest teamsters and walk in (we do employee a decent amount of CDL Holders/Truckers)?

I don't know the first thing about this but I, and others, are fed up and would like to get back to enjoying our jobs if possible instead of leaving it behind. But this is basically the last effort we can make before a lot of us walk, and are forced to watch the company we loved working for be relegated corporate nothingness."

However, I feel like l've outgrown the job very quickly and am no longer learning anything new. My current boss seemed fine until they made a couple of comments here and there that are making me question things.

When I was working my boss asked me why I picked my industry. I said I liked to give and bring joy to people. My boss then replied with, ""oh so you like people pleasing then."" I was taken back by that comment since that felt like a very negative way to frame why I like my work.

Another instance, I was talking about how I was hesitant to date someone in my same industry because there's a chance for competitiveness and that they may just want information to further their career. My boss said ""respectfully, you're in no position to further anyone's career, and any information you know can just be found on google."" I found it really disrespectful that they say my years of schooling for my degree is the same amount of information as what anyone can get on google.

My boss was doing a project that I had experience with before. They had never done this kind of project. I offered a few tips and they completely ignored them. The project didn't work out, so they're redoing it, but I know exactly what went wrong and why, I know they won't ask my opinion.

They told me to use my break to take a shit on or to pee and that's just none of their business when where or how often I use the bathroom. I am a human and I have the right to shit when I have to go. A man's gotta go when a man gotta go lmao. What drew the line was however when the lady boss (who wasn't as bad before this incident) scolded me for using the bathroom and said I'd be receiving a write up for taking too long in the bathroom the next day. I had to take a poop after that like 15 minutes after because ya know coffee, and early mornings and such... Then this is where it ends: she told me that I had to LEAVE EARLY to go get a doctor's note and that if I didn't have one when I came back to work the next day that I would be wrote up EVERY TIME I had to use the bathroom. Long story short I didn't return the next day. Never got a termination letter or anything I just didn't go back because I felt uncomfortable in their presence. That was humiliating and every coworker knew about this too and saw the BS I had to put up with. Should I pursue legal action against this for lost wages and bad management?

Story: 
So I'm a public service employee for a Government department in Australia. I help run the social media for some of the biggest areas of government for the state I'm in. 

A secondment position came up for a month in another government department running their socials but at a higher level. My direct manager and I spoke about it and said it could be a great opportunity to do some stakeholder manager and upskilling. I'm also the most senior in my team so was really the only person suited to the job. 

I moved over at the end of April and tomorrow is my last day in the secondment. 

In the first 2 - 3 days I realised I'd made a horrible mistake. The job suxked, the approval process is completely broken and I was expected to do about 2 or 3 people's worth of work. Knowing I was representing my manager who I really like and my team and cos I'm not an idiot, I tried really hard and did good work. 

I've been almost treated as a consultant. Among the jobs I'm meant to be doing, they asked me to run significant reports and put together presentations on the current state of their channels (something the person in the current job should be doing). 

I did all this for them and more. 

It now being the end of the job, I've never received a thanks for my hard work, or barely even a mention for the effort I've put in. 

I've been expressing my feelings to my manager about how bad it is and how I can't wait to get back, and they're also very excited to get me back. 

But today I couldn't believe it. The Director of the floor emailed the Director at my previous position (Directors are like 4 places hire than I am) - If I can stay on, or if I can come back and do another month or two later in the year. 

They didn't even ask me or my direct manager? Like I could be going overseas, maybe having surgery, any number of things. But no thanks for anything and went 4 steps above me to see if I can come back. 

My manager and I both said no. 

Am I justified in being furious, like that's complete bullshit isn't it? Just testament to know that the grass isn't always greener.

Needless to say I love my job and I have a good relationship with all of them. After asking how my vacation was, they reminded me that today we had an invitation from a rooftop hotel to hangout with them. I said something like ""Oh yeah, sure, I remember"", so it was taken as a ""yes, sure, I'll be going"".

Thing is that my shift ends at 4PM, and my last coworkers finishes at 7PM, so in the meantime we will hang out until she finishes the shift, and then, we will go to this rooftop. I don't mind having some drinks with them and that but it really bothers me having to wait 3 hours just to ""get started"" on the main ""event"". I'd rather head home, do some chores, clean my house... just alone stuff that I enjoy, but I don't know how I will be portrayed if I tell them ""no"" today, with no prior notice.

Thanks for any advice! :)"
8,2024-05-23,"I'm 28, and I don't know what I'm doing",u/Kiltenth,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cym867/im_28_and_i_dont_know_what_im_doing/,antiwork,"So here is my story. I'm currently 28. I first went to university at 18, I was studying Software Engineering. I had to drop because of financial issues. I worked as a waiter for a year. Then, my family forced me to study again, so I started university all over again and I was studying Computer Science. But I dropped again because I was losing interest, and I felt like I wasn't even learning a single thing but I was trying to keep doing my best. Until I saw how corrupt was my university. And they were giving awful points to some students projects and I was one of them. They accused me of plagiarism on a project I singlehandedly worked for a month. And the authorities didn't do a single thing when I object the situation. I dropped this university too.

Stayed jobless near my family for 3 years, and when I was 27 I finally found a job at a company's accounting department and they agreed to teach me. So I got hired as an accounting assistant. It's been 5 months now, and I'm 28.

At this point I do not know what I'm doing and where to go in life. I keep doing my work with invoices and taxes and reporting what is necessary to our financial advisors and all that. But even they tell me that I'm currently only earning money. They are telling me that what I currently do is just simple stuff and I need to make a decision if I want to pursue this career or not. But I do not know if I want to. The workload is already overwhelming me. I have around 4 hours of free time daily and I just cannot do anything that I want to do in that time. I also study for associate degree exams. But mentally I'm so done.

Like, I am unable to give answers to our advisors when they ask me what I want to do because I do not have a single idea if I'm liking this or not. I cannot pursue any of my hobbies too because I really don't have any fun when I'm struck with thoughts of how my life is going in the middle of my hobby.

Also, at this point, I feel like I'm the only person on the damn world who doesn't have any drive or motivation and doesn't know a single thing about what to do with their life. I'm so lost."

Tonight was the final straw at my job. I currently work multiple part time jobs because it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to achieve full time work nowadays. For the past two years I‚Äôve worked a job in event planning. Tonight we had a sporting event and let me tell you I hate working those events. I‚Äôm grateful management has never given me an issue but the customers are animals. They get so drunk and entitled it‚Äôs gross.

Anyways I was minding my business when a group of men twice my age came in. I was on my phone when one asks if I was looking at porn. All I was doing was checking the time I told him his comment wasn‚Äôt funny and he was like ‚Äúyou need to be nicer‚Äù and all that dumb shit. I tell him to leave my area as I refused to serve him and his friends. Time goes on and he comes back I tell him I‚Äôm not going to tolerate their obknoxious behavior. They took it very personal and I called security. Security of course takes forever to get there. The guys decide to start filming me so they can post it online to catch me in some ‚ÄúKaren moment.‚Äù 

I walk over and gently ask them to please put the phone down as I do not want to be filmed. The guys mistook it for me trying to hit them and all of a sudden begin to choke me in front of all these guests and staff. People ran away and I was able to get myself out of the situation and run. I collapsed in the lobby. The police came in and I had to be escorted out for my safety.

I typically deal with a lot of teasing, verbal insults like how a customer told me that I should go and kill myself because I didn‚Äôt get his order in time. The fact it got physical this time has me terrified and angry. The issue is I have no back up job with consistent income. My parents have been supporting me too and one of my parents is unemployed so we pretty much live on our savings. After tonight I want to leave because enough is enough but at the same time god knows how long I‚Äôll be unemployed for with the very little savings I have. 

I‚Äôm grateful that my bosses have been understanding but I can‚Äôt put myself in spaces where my safety is at risk. These customers are such assholes and entitled. I don‚Äôt know what to do."

My direct manager is difficult to tie down cos he is always travelling or in meetings.

My other colleagues have been really helpful. But having nearly come to the end of week two, I still felt like I hadn't really done anything properly productive.

So I thought I'd use my initiative and reach out to some people, set up some meeting with them, just short ones, to introduce myself and ask lots of questions.

In a short catch-up call with the BIg Boss Man yesterday , I mentioned what I'd done, and he immediately said ""I'd rather you didnt""

He then told me to cancel any meetings I had arranged.

Now I look like an ass.

...and I'm still unsure of his grand plan for how I'm supposed to learn the job if I shouldn't meet with people without his consent, and he's not available.

Their policy is that if you work less than an 8 hour shift, you only get a 10 minute break. I was told during my interview that it was a part time position, no more than 25 hours a week. But I‚Äôve been consistently getting scheduled for 35-39 hours, with 7.5 hour shifts. So that‚Äôs just a hair under full time, on my feet on concrete floors, with no legitimate breaks. 10 minutes is barely enough time to take a piss and scarf down a protein bar. 

They‚Äôre also really strict about the cashiers (me) not being allowed to have any kind of beverage with them at the register. But the cashiers also aren‚Äôt allowed to leave the register. I was told that i have to keep my water bottle in the break room and if I needed a drink, I have to page another employee to come cover the register while I‚Äôm gone. Which is proving to be a problem because most of the other employees will either not answer pages or if they do finally come up to cover me, they‚Äôre rolling their eyes, sighing, telling me to hurry up and just generally having an attitude about it. 

There‚Äôs no panic button at the registers or protocol in place for if someone tries to rob the store. I live in a small town so I didn‚Äôt anticipate this being much of an issue until the other day when a guy came in acting extremely sketchy. I brought it up to the store manager and asked her what I‚Äôm supposed to do in that situation and she laughed at me and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be fine‚Äù. 

Also, the few times that I‚Äôve worked the sales floor instead of the register, I‚Äôve listened to most of the other employees complain about the person on the register asking for their break or to go to the restroom, purposely making them wait and laughing about it, and then talking shit about them. 

So basically, I‚Äôm leaving every shift exhausted, dehydrated, and in pain. Being stuck at that register for 7.5 hours straight and not being able to sit down or take a drink and having to hold my bladder for hours feels like torture. It‚Äôs taking a big toll on my physical and mental health. And I only make $10/hr. with no benefits. Maybe I‚Äôm just being a big baby about it but I‚Äôm seriously debating no call no showing. "

I know that most of the essentials are done for them, but you still need time to visit grandma, the kids,family events etc etc. Those make up most of my holidays.

Even so, if they were so essential, intelligent and in general, a step above the rest in terms of importance, I'd expect them to be on their work laptop,in meetings and sleeping at the office all year around, with one two week holiday a year.

How DO they have the time?

Do they,perhaps, in fact, not work as hard as us? Are they, perhaps, not as irreplaceable as they want to appear?"

My commute is also 45mins - 1hr (more depending on traffic) twice a day, every dah. I eventually changed departments but I‚Äôm dealing with more people and more toxic behavior and it‚Äôs really just not worth it anymore. My mental health is plummeted and it‚Äôs hard for me to enjoy life out of work. I can‚Äôt leave without some backup plans because the health insurance is important for me as a chronically ill individual. I just got all of my healthcare providers set up and I enjoy most of the people I‚Äôve chosen for my health. What are my best options for insurance? How can I do this without burning bridges while also finally giving this place the big ‚Äúeff you‚Äù it deserves? In many instances I‚Äôm lucky to be there (the money is decent especially in this current financial climate), but at this point my mental health and happiness is more important. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm living, I just feel like I‚Äôm surviving at this point. Any advice? "

First thing first, the way I got the job was a bit weird. Th company hired a recruiting agency, and the recruiter during the entire process was praising how my years of project management experience will make me a great fit for this role. She did a really good job emphasizing how this is a PM role. Now after I join, I realize it is not, I‚Äôm more like secretary, since it‚Äôs an administrative assistant role. I was like whatever, pay is decent, and i need a job.

So at the end of week 1, my boss wanted to go over a few things with you. She mentioned when we had an in person session, how I should have cleaned everything up, rather than just leaving. Now I only do that, because I saw the facility people come in who started cleaning, so I thought it should be good and I should be on my way. Anyways, she told me to really think about it, since this is an admin work, not a PM work. She also told me to book a daily one-on-one with her and another person in the company in the beginning so I‚Äôll get used to the company better. 

Fast forward to this week, week 2. I decided to just be a good soldier. But this week, she‚Äôs asking me to work more as a PM. I was like okay, no problem, but what happened over the weekend to go from admin to PM. But what I found to be the most weird thing was everytime we would have our one-on-one, she would ask ‚Äúwhat is this for‚Äù, and then I look like standing with my dick in my hand, because I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúyou asked for this, you tell me. Guide me Jedi master, I‚Äôm still new‚Äù. Another example, she asked me to book a meeting, more like a placeholder, for people to come in and discuss their ideas for this project. I swear, the way she said it, made it sound like, it‚Äôs for people to just drop by. I even asked, do we need to be there and she said, not necessarily. But when the online time started, she told me after, I should have been there leading it, because I booked it.

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, the organization is great, the people are great, but she started to sound a lot like my intern boss. This guy I worked under, everytime I‚Äôd ask for help, he would say ‚ÄúSteve jobs said, we hire people to tell us what to, not tell the, what to do.‚Äù I was thinking, bruh I‚Äôm an intern. I‚Äôm literally here to learn and follow guidance. So yeah she sounds like someone who‚Äôs smart, but sucks at people management. Anyone got any advice?"

It was advertised as WFH on Fridays. I took it with a grain of salt but still, why did it say that? I wait ages for an offer and finally receive one. I have nothing else offered so I accepted and of course upon accepting, they tell me the WFH has been revised and will only be every other Friday and so heavily monitored it isn't worth it  

I know it sounds messed up to say and maybe because my EI helped keep me afloat but I am not looking forward to going back to work. These eight months have been stressful in terms of finance and employment stress but also so relaxing and nourishing for my soul. Not having to push myself to do things, being able to grocery shop in the day, having time to do laundry and cook. Soon, I will spend 40 hours a week in an office doing something I could be doing at home in an office, surrounded by a bunch of politics and dumb rules. 

I swear, the only thing that keeps me going is the thought that I'm just trying to build my resume until I can work a true Hybrid/WFH job.

Also, you'd think with the cost of gas and food and the climate crisis WFH would be more embraced but let's just keep polluting the air, wasting gas money, childcare money and precious time"

My days are spent driving all around town to different houses, checking up on maintenance requests, putting notices on doors, doing inspections. Basically trying my best not to be a slumlord in a company that barely pays me enough to get by while making millions off of my work. I started this job about 3 months ago. Before I even started, I was promised that I would receive gas reimbursement since I am using my own car. The term that THEY used was ‚Äúgas reimbursement‚Äù. My first week goes by and I say ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôve been tracking my mileage, who do I turn it into?‚Äù That‚Äôs when I‚Äôm told, no it‚Äôs actually a gas allowance that‚Äôs deposited once a month. I‚Äôm about halfway through the month when I started so I sucked it up and ate ramen for dinner, trying to get by until my fist paycheck and until my allowance hits my account on the first. The first of the month comes and I get a messily fucking 60 dollars in my account. That probably covers me for two weeks. I live in an area where work is hard to find so my husband and I weigh our options and decide it‚Äôs still worth it to stay even though I‚Äôm only making fucking 15 dollars an hour in the first place but we need me to work to get by. I just got an email this morning that they want us to check every single maintenance request that is put in before we send someone to fix it and to take a picture of whatever is broken and then go back out and take another picture after it‚Äôs done. The issue is that 12 of my properties are in another town an hour away. The buildings are built like crap because they are slumlords so I get 5 or so maintenance requests from here every week, they also want a 24 hour turnaround on these work orders so it‚Äôs not like I can go once a week to check them out. I have to go almost every single day. With a fucking 60 dollar gas allowance. "

Basically they'll take up more of your time communicating things that should be maybe 1 newsletter posted in a yammer group.

Of course if you complain about PTO, working equipment, and online tools that are outdated nothing happens about those. They will look into it. They are investigating things. They sympathize with you and know you will figure out a way to work around it. 

So here's a survey. If you complain about anything we'll go overboard or do nothing. Thank you for your input."
1,2024-05-23,I keep getting more work and no promotion (who would have thought?),u/Radiant_Bottle2425,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cyvav9/i_keep_getting_more_work_and_no_promotion_who/,antiwork,"I‚Äôve been at my current job for over 2 years. I work from home and things have been fine for a while. Occasionally I‚Äôll get a random extra task that kind of takes me out of my comfort zone but I‚Äôm usually good to take care of it and then go back to my daily responsibilities. 

Management has always said ‚Äúif you‚Äôre comfortable where you‚Äôre at and just want to come in, do your job, and leave at the end of the work day, that‚Äôs fine.‚Äù They‚Äôve told me time and time again that I don‚Äôt HAVE to move up if I don‚Äôt want to, and I have told them multiple times I am not interested in doing so. 

Recently, however, that seems to have been a lie. Instead of getting to do my daily tasks like I normally do, I‚Äôm getting pulled in different directions to help with other stuff. It started as a way to ‚Äúbuild my knowledge‚Äù so I would be able to help with new hires, which I think is fine. I enjoy helping the new people get started because this I ob can be pretty technical and it‚Äôs easy to make mistakes. I‚Äôm just confused as to why it‚Äôs suddenly my responsibility to take new hires ‚Äúunder my wing‚Äù as they tell me, when management is responsible for training. 

Today I was hit with yet another thing I‚Äôm going to be responsible for moving forward. It‚Äôs not exactly difficult work, but it could cause problems if not done correctly. Usually the person that handles my new responsibility is someone who is higher up than me on the corporate chain. The work that I now do usually comes with a promotion and I am assuming a pay raise. I have not gotten the promotion nor have they approached me about moving up even though I‚Äôm already doing the work of people who get paid more than me and have more experience. They have explicitly told me more than once that I am considered to be on the same level as people above me, though. Not to mention, I‚Äôm still expected to do my regular work on top of this when I have the time.

I am so tired of this job. I do not want more work. I do not want to move outside of what I‚Äôve been tasked with already. It‚Äôs exhausting not knowing if the work I do will cause an error 2 months down the road and I‚Äôll get yelled at over it when I don‚Äôt even remember doing it because I do 3 other things on top of that.

I should also mention that I‚Äôve gotten 1 ‚Äúraise‚Äù since starting this job over 2 years ago and it was a 65 cent raise based on my performance (which might I add, I got nearly a perfect score on my annual review). This is a multi million dollar corporation that always boasts about the millions in revenue they bring in each quarter. Typical corporate bullshit. I‚Äôm just tired of all of it. I want to be done with this job but I don‚Äôt have many options these days. "

1,2024-05-23,Work/Legal advice needed - disability,u/ElijahKay,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cyvhlh/worklegal_advice_needed_disability/,antiwork,"So, this is going to be a bit of a long one so strap in. I am potentially considering some legal recourse, or at least a personal (by myself) social media reaction or something cause I ve been left quite peeved. Any experience you might have, advice, support or words of encouragement would also be welcome.

I work in marketing, and I am solidly a medium-level employee (in terms of duties and responsibilities) after 6-7 years in the industry. Also for reference, I ve been working and living in the UK, for the last 11 years. As it is also pertinent to this event, I have a formal diagnosis of AuADHD and have gone through years of therapy and medication to be able to mask sufficiently well in a professional environment.

Two months ago, I was hired (lets call them company A) by a very large American-based marketing agency (through their UK branch), to work full-time for one of their big clients (think top 500 Forbes - lets call them.company B). The role was basically being a quasi-contractor. I did operate almost exclusively with company B, and have my own email with them etc. I only had a 15 minute call per week with company A, to discuss my progress. 

I had disclosed my disability with both HR in company A and with my manager in company B, albeit I think that said manager might have thought it was a salsa dip option, consider her actions.

Pretty early on, I started facing some pretty weird behaviours that had put me slightly on edge. I ll mention them here in no particular order.

- On my 2nd week on the job, my manager was on AL and I had asked a colleague for support in a project I didn't feel confident dealing with. She had responded with ‚ÄúIt's your job to manage your deadlines, not mine!‚Äù

- A director raised my communication skills with my manager while she was gone. I had asked her department for some document, about 3 times, and got ghosted. I messaged her privately, and explained the situation over 4-5 small messages on slack (that's on me, I ve yet to cope with small messages and info dump quite often, giving more information than might be needed - autistic trait I am told). I had told her that I am being pushed by my team and needed the document for an important presentation. She started aggressively asking me to give the names of the people who pressured me, and told me the project is not important.

I told her I am new, and a bit unsure. And apologised if I acted stressed. She said its no issue. And then has a call with my manager specifically to discuss it. 

I was directly then told that I overcommunicate and give too much information (another AuADHD trait). Was told that other people might think that I am not working if I am talking to them (I had strictly only ever talked about work). I wanted to give a good impression soI stopped talking to people after that, unless absolutely necessary.

- I had an idea about a way to optimise a process at work. Told my manager during a 1-1. Was told ‚ÄúLet me give you the best career tip I can. Learn to swim in your lane.‚Äù

- I was told by two separate people on two separate instances in my first week ‚Äúbe very careful, this place is very political‚Äù.

- I was having difficulty with one coworker, cause she would supply 75% of my work, but would videocall to give me the brief. I told her I have an issue staying focused on calls and whether she could send me the task over email (I ve started transcribing every call and tried to keep notes but it's very very difficult with ADHD).

She responded almost verbatim ‚Äúcollating this information is your job, I won't do your job for you.‚Äù the 2nd time I raised it she said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, you just gotta get better at keeping notes‚Äù.

- While working on a particular project, I discovered that the way we did surveys for the last 3 years was non compliant. I approached two other departments and went out of my way to make sure I wasn't wrong. I was congratulated by another director on going beyond what is in my duties to resolve this. When I briefed the same coworker on this, she told me ‚Äúdo you know how much work you ll generate for us? Its not your job to create work for other teams!‚Äù

- I had a really early call at 9 with my manager one time and said ‚Äúsorry, I don't usually have meetings at 9PM‚Äù (I accidentally said PM instead of AM). She responded with ‚ÄúIts 9 AM, please focus‚Äù. In fairness, this hurt a lot, because I ve gone through years of therapy and medication. I can manage my symptoms but not alltogether avoid them.

- During another, half an hour call with my manager, she had mentioned during the start of the call ‚Äúby the way X coworker will be on AL from tomorrow.‚Äù

I completely blanked the information (I can pretty much keep 75% of what I am told in a meeting in my head, especially if its low importance). I asked her about 20 minutes into the call ‚Äúso, when is X going on AL?‚Äù

She acted in shock, and said ‚ÄúI mentioned it in the start - you need to focus‚Äù. It was a minor comment but she is a very direct person, and I couldn't get the sentence out of my head. If I was a paraplegic I wouldn't be criticised for not being able to run a stair fast enough. 

-

Mind you, I am great at my work. Focus issues aside, my last manager said I was the hardest worker he met. In the past, I ve been brought on to client meetings, simply because of my insight and ability to break down information.

When these issues started cropping, I went to my manager (who was also the vice president of HR in company A). I pretty much would report all of the above and would be given advice such as:

- ‚ÄúIt sounds like It's the culture there. I know I wouldn't be able to work there. I can't tell you to quit, but you might want to consider it.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúReasonable requests can only be arranged if they don't impact on the work of another coworker. If they re having a negative impact, then it's not fair on the others.‚Äù (When I asked how to process the coworker email issue).

- ‚ÄúWe can only make accommodations on your ADHD if you had disclosed before accepting the role. Since you accepted the role, you confirmed you can do the job. It would be disingenuous if you asked for support now.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúLet me ask X about Y.‚Äù (regarding how to talk to company B about this. Weeks went by and nothing happened).

-

I was getting nowhere, so I spoke to a coworker in company B about this in detail. She told me to directly go and have a talk with HR in company B, and went and had an initial talk with them herself.

I had a meeting with company B HR, which I had asked them to understand that I want it to be informal in nature.

I told them all the above, and asked if they could provide some ADHD training to the team, or perhaps facilitate a discussion between myself and the team. I said I don't want to make any trouble for anyone, and that everyone is lovely, but that I wanted to see what we could do to improve the working conditions.

Two days after that, I get a video call request from company A. They said that there has been a breakdown in communication, and that I shouldn't have gone to HR in company B. They said they re letting me go effective immediately.

And the weird part is, they offered me an extra week of pay if I didn't talk to company B. The letter that arrived half an hour later said I was let go for ‚Äúperformance reasons‚Äù.

So that's it really. Got let go, on my 2nd month of my 3 month probation, for going to HR for reasonable requests/bullying.

I know I was in probation, but I think, even in this case, being fired has to make sense right? To me it seems quite discriminatory, but I don't understand employment law.

Is it worth getting in contact with a union or contacting a lawyer?

Towards the end, I kept recording conversations so I could have transcripts for work, for myself (as part of keeping notes). 2-3 of the above comments have actually been recorded on my phone.

Anyways, sorry for the long read. Any tips/advice/support you can offer?

I do not hate the work I do, I like the people I work with, I am paid below the median but fine. I did recently have a glowing review where I learned that  ""the compensation review is not aligned with the performance review"" aka, we do not get merit-based raises - we get raises whenever admin sees fit, or something else no one has been able to explain transparently to me. We also have wildly limited PTO for our industry, for context. 

My apathy at work has been out of control ever since, honestly. Last night I couldn't sleep, dreading my morning meeting. I went through a list of injuries I'd be willing to incur to skip work for a substantial period of disability or sick leave (not that I'd hurt myself, just, if given the option I'd probably not decline).

- Broken toes (small ones, not the big toe)  
- Fractured wrist or arm (only if simple and quick to heal)  
- Bad flu or other virus (I had a bad bout of covid once, took months to recover but maybe again...)

Again, I'm not in danger over here. Just desperately in need of time away and unable to take any vacation.

Makes me think about previous workplace expectations...,u/Argentum1909,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cywtm1/im_trying_to_figure_out_how_to_ask_my_manager_for/,antiwork,"So the gist of it is that I've taken on the extra duty of training a new hire for another location. I've trained 2 or 3 other people before, and it hasn't really been a huge deal. I've been working with the new hire for about a month, and this particular training is driving me nuts. No fault of the newbie, it's just that I'm more introverted and this guy TALKS, not to mention he's in his 50s and kinda slow on technology....anyway.

The point is that the whole thing is making me want to ask my manager for some kind of bonus or incentive based on that extra work that I've been doing, and I'm so goddamn nervous. I've had previous jobs where I've definitely been taken advantage of and other coworkers were straight up abused and forced to do illegal shit. I didn't ask for payment for the last couple trainings I did, it didn't even cross my mind to ask because doing extra tasks was the norm at my other jobs. I'm still a doormat in a lot of cases that I shouldn't be. I refuse to engage in personal or life talk with my coworkers outside of the most basic shit because people at my previous jobs would use that against me. It's like, no wonder people don't want to ask for basic accommodations when you have jobs where the managers laugh in your face before sending you off to do menial shit, and your coworkers won't side with you when you talk about how unfair it is. 

I've been putting off this email for a week. I know it isn't true but asking for this extra pay makes me feel like a selfish bitch who hates her job. I want to trust my manager, the worst thing she can do is say no. Or fire me, I guess lol "

I have been taught how to work during a rush by my boss and other managers but this woman who's above them came in and apparently I was doing everything wrong, of my own fruition, apparently. Nobody owned up, I knew if I said it was anyone elses fault they would double down on me or at least my boss would blame me even more.

this was for the only 2 hours I work this week. next week is also 2 hours, So I've already started applying for different jobs because this is rediculous and I pay 350 monthly for medical treatment and blood tests. So up to like 30 some dollars a week isnt really adding up very well for me. 

He blatantly wants me to either quit or go full brown noser but the disrespect is insane since day 1. I could have a full mustache and he still calls me ""she"", probably informed everyone else to call me that too or something because It is genuinely so weird. 

 His blatant love for humiliating me in  front of others is crazy. He does it to others but he seems to pick ""favorites"" as there was a kid on the grill that was struggling more than me but he didn't say a peep about him. 

Its probably a discrimination thing, he told me to ""work on speed"" and he talks so loud with other people that I can barely pay attention to my headset which is always at full volume.

How should I quit though? Over text like a bad breakup? I dont need this as a reference so I was just going to leave after next week when I dont have any hours in the way. I never quit a job before because I never had a boss this tyrannical and spiteful. Hence why I dont want to do the whole ""put in my two weeks while I make nothing for longer"", he doesnt deserve that kind of respect and my coworkers work perfectly fine without me for every other day and hour without me, he keeps hiring more people so I am sure I dont need to stay."

Then companies are consolidating roles, taking 3-4 jobs and throwing it into one and paying that one the lowest possible salary. We all work for money not because we love your shitty company. It irritates me that some guy in a corporate office is making 4x what I make but working a fraction of how hard I am.

Prices of rent keep increasing. $1600 for an apartment when a few years ago it was $900. Groceries are unaffordable like a bitch. $50 would get me a weeks worth of meals a few years ago. Now $50 might get you 4-5 items. 

I really don‚Äôt want much. I just want to provide for my family. I want to look my girl in the eyes and tell her everything will be alright and actually mean it. But right now I don‚Äôt know if everything will be alright.

Small group of about 5 people max(call center). Since ive been here theres been a lot of turnover. My initial manager left and was replaced with another person(k) back in 2022. So during the times we would hire people. Sometimes a person would quit or get fired and itd just be me and her for weeks on end. Then we'd retrain somone just for it to happen again. Luckily we are more filled out now. 


The problem is now that we have our dept more occupied, my coworkers told me that they think my boss doesnt really like me because im a guy and/or shes jealous of me? I thought they were joking...

They explain that they see that she gives me a harder time than everyone else. Tells me to get started on reports and stuff while she doesnt with others. When i attempt to call out, she usually tells me that im needed and if there is any way i can make it later in the day;  its like pulling teeth, guilt trip, etc(i assumed she did this to everyone since were so small but, not the case). She also asked one of my coworkers if she thought i wasnt pulling my weight, my coworker told me that she vouched for me and said i do so much. 

I feel hurt. Ive been loyal to her and have been here through the tough times. Never got a raise, never got a promotion(although ive attempted). I have even gone through the effort of learning some of her reports so i can help out when shes out(today im not doing it). 

Like i said, the higher ups(including her boss) have given me praise and customers too but, i get nothing out of it. Id rather get no praise so i dont have to deal with this. I guess i dont know if im blowing this out of proportion or not. Feels lonely being the only guy in this department but at least my coworkers have my back.

I'm very far behind everyone else at work in terms of my salary. I'm at least 20% behind everyone despite being the senior (I've trained two). Before the two new workers joined I've also led my team of two through a very busy period, with up to 400% increase in revenue.

I requested for a 20% payrise during my annual review which I require to get my visa renewed. They've always promised to get my visa renewed and help me with my PR application which is why I've stuck with the company through thick and thin. My manager responded that 20% is too much and that I'm too young to get everyone else's pay which is total BS. I'm 23 and one of the person I trained is a year older than me (24) but he was also hired with a salary 20% higher than mine. In regards to 20% being too high, I've notified them multiple times so they had plenty of time to stagger the increase if they had planned ahead. She even suggested that if I were to get that much, I'd probably have to sign a bond with the company. 

Hesitant to sign the bond if it comes down to that because I plan to do my Master's in the future.

Perfect attendance for the first 90 days. Then, in January, my Papa, who lives in Chicago, (I‚Äôm in MI), got really sick after being diagnosed with Leukemia of the blood and unfortunately passed away a week later‚Ä¶
It was a brutal winter and a couple of weeks after my Papa passed, my Nanas pipes froze and she didn‚Äôt have running water. My Dad (her son) decided we‚Äôd go there for a weekend as a family to check on her, fix the plumbing, do a couple of other repairs she needed done, and make sure she had running water etc‚Ä¶ We visited and all was well. 
A little while later, I requested a weekend off in late March to go to his Memorial Service. They approved it and I went. Fast forward to March and I get my review. They gave me a GREAT review AND A RAISE, and when I asked for tips or suggestions to be better, they said I was doing great. 
Three weeks later, I had a stomach virus. I called off bc I legitimately couldn‚Äôt stop SHITTING MY PANTS.  When I spoke to the supervisor, she said I had to come In bc she had another call off and had no one. I told her I was sick and not coming in, (I‚Äôm a part time cashier, how is it my problem you‚Äôre not properly staffed?) She told me I had to bring in a Dr note, and to be honest, I had no intention of doing that, bc wtf can a Dr do for the stomach flu?! 
So, needless to say I never sent one in. 
I was scheduled and showed up for my shift. I went to clock in and it said I couldn‚Äôt clock in for an unscheduled shift. Checked my schedule again I was magically off of it ( it was a Friday) but I was on the schedule for the next two weeks after. 
Monday I check the schedule again bc I figured they were dicking me around, and sure enough - I was off the schedule. 

ALSO; in Feb,  I rang myself up for a water and left the receipt at my register. (Because obviously I wasn‚Äôt trying to hide anything. I bought it with my money. I paid it full and everything). Anyway, I go to the bathroom really quick and when I come back, I find out weeks later from someone else that the woman who had trained me originally, took it upon herself to go over to my register and take a photo of my receipt and give it to management to try to get me fired or get me in trouble. No one ever mentioned anything about that to me, even at my review.


So here‚Äôs my question. since I didn‚Äôt technically abandon my job or get fired (I never signed anything and no one from management ever called me), are they doing anything illegal? I always assumed companies had to have you sign anything regarding changes to your employment status. 

A couple of weeks have passed and I just tried logging on to my App‚Ä¶and I can‚Äôt log in to ANY of it, so now I have to contact them to get any record of my employment.  

I just feel mind fucked. I mean if they wanted to get rid of me, fine‚Ä¶But at least give me a chance to improve whatever the fuck I did that was so wrong lol

I arrived for an interview, and the woman who I assume is the owner or a general manager who greeted me was very rude, asking abruptly what I needed. When I told her I was there for an interview, she didn‚Äôt even introduce herself. She sat down and jumped straight into questioning me about my knowledge of Japanese food. I admitted that I had limited knowledge, but she took this as if I claimed to know everything and began asking detailed questions that I couldn‚Äôt answer. She then became visibly upset and criticized me loudly in front of the guests for applying for a server position in a japanese restaurant without extensive knowledge of the cuisine.

When the topic of salary came up, I provided a range and mentioned it was negotiable. She demanded a specific number, and after I gave one, she repeated it loudly and rudely asked for an answer to her question, which I had already given. Abruptly, she stood up, shouted in front of everyone that she didn‚Äôt think I was a good candidate, and walked away without any respect or acknowledgment.

Her handling of the situation was incredibly unprofessional and disrespectful, especially in a public setting. It made me question how she must treat her employees if this is how she conducts herself during an interview. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt give a shit about this but the fact that she treated me very poorly in front of the guests/employees really felt humiliating and I feel pretty bad right now. If you guys could leave her a honest review maybe she will learn to treat people better that way. Thank you in advance for helping me. https://maps.app.goo.gl/nhpgeEwq1DdCqZVE7?g_st=i"

A little later, in late March, I requested a weekend off to attend my Papa's memorial service. The request was approved, and I went. When I received my review in March, they gave me a great review and even a raise. When I asked for any tips or suggestions to improve, they said I was doing great.

Three weeks later, I came down with a stomach virus and couldn't stop having bowel movements. I called in sick because of this. However, when I spoke to my supervisor, she insisted that I come in because they were short-staffed. I told her I was sick and unable to come in, questioning why it was my problem to solve the staffing issue as a part-time cashier. She then asked me to provide a doctor's note, but I had no intention of doing so because I didn't believe a doctor could do much for a stomach flu.

Needless to say, I never submitted a doctor's note. I was scheduled for a shift and showed up for work. However, when I tried to clock in, it said that I couldn't clock in for an unscheduled shift. I checked the schedule again and magically found that I was no longer on it for that Friday, even though I was still scheduled for the following two weeks. On Monday, I checked the schedule again, thinking they were playing games with me, and saw that I was completely off the schedule.

In addition, in February, I bought a water bottle and rang myself up at the register. I left the receipt there because I had nothing to hide. I paid for it in full with my own money. When I quickly went to the bathroom and returned, I later found out from someone else that the woman who originally trained me took it upon herself to take a photo of my receipt and give it to management, apparently in an attempt to get me fired or in trouble. However, no one ever mentioned anything about it to me, even during my review.

So, here's my question: since I didn't technically quit or get fired (I never signed anything, and no one from management contacted me), are they doing anything illegal? I always thought that companies had to have employees sign something regarding changes in employment status.

A few weeks have passed, and when I tried to log into my work app, I couldn't access any of it. Now, I have to contact them to obtain any records of my employment.

I just feel confused and frustrated. If they wanted to let me go, that's fine, but at least give me a chance to improve whatever it was that I did wrong. It's just a bit mind-boggling."

At a workplace, whenever the big boss or other upper management is scheduled for a meeting or inspection, everyone goes into overdrive.

To me, it feels like a lot of smoke and mirrors‚Äîpresenting an image that isn‚Äôt really reflective of our day-to-day operations. It‚Äôs frustrating because I think consistency and genuine effort are important, not just when the higher-ups are around.

- married by 20-21
- kids by 25
- home owner before 30
- living large with a single income in the family 

Yet here I am, staring down my birthday tomorrow, with a recently completed bachelors in a field that my province decided to reduce funding in (yay for me /s). I‚Äôve got resumes out everywhere and a dry inbox. I spend hours filling out those stupid online applications that are essentially a repeat of my resume anyways only to be met with crickets. I even took the time to perfect my linked In profile.

Two weeks ago I moved into an apartment and within 4 days my mental health dropped so far off the deep end that I had to move back home with my mom (it wasn‚Äôt great before and all the new change made it worse). 

Rationally I know I‚Äôm not ‚Äúbehind‚Äù in life, but when I look at my current situation all I hear is my younger self yelling at me to catch up. It‚Äôs easy to say that someone my age has time and people achieve goals at different speeds, but when it‚Äôs yourself, it feels like a lie you tell yourself out of comfort. 

I‚Äôm watching my friends and family struggle to pay rent and basic needs despite having good jobs. Im watching people 70+ going back to work because their retirement plan no longer covers their expenses. 

How does one handle this? How do I juggle my lack of hope in an economy that is failing so many other people?

People using pto or trying to, and getting push back or denied. And then there is vacation time, ugh.

For people in unions, is it any better or no?

We work hard to earn it, it's ours to use. I get that everyone one likes to have optimal workers on the clock, etc but emergencies happen. If it's a slow day of the week or season, why it a problem in their eyes? Aside from mangers being micromanagers to justify your existence? 

Why even bother offering it if you are going to be difficult about it and prevent people from using it? 

I understand it is a standard part of the benefits package and so it's expected to be offered. Also, it's required by many states, I believe?

I also understand it's part of the work hard until you die and never take time off because you are a dirty peon and don't deserve to take time off like us golden special executives.

Closer to home, my employer is starting to deduct points for times called out and for using pto. Apparently this is legal. I'm not a chronic call out kind of person, but it pisses me off. 

Also, if we want to leave early we now have to check with our manager. She doesn't care. I work at a spa and if no one is scheduled for your last hour, she's fine with you leaving. We used to just be able to tell the front desk, hey block my 5pm, I'm going to go home early. Now we have to get permission. 

We can stay and do deep cleaning duties, but most of us have a set schedule and do that to our assigned room on a specific day. For me, it's at the end of my last day of the week. For some, it's the hour before the beginning of their work week. Plus not everyone does their fair share. I've stopped going above and beyond keeping my space clean. 

I get that someone, somewhere is abusing the system. But to punish all of us for 1 or 2 people seems excessive. I really do not like these new owners, if you couldn't tell.

I'm just glad we have a good manager who doesn't micromanage us. But if ever she leaves I will quit if they hire someone more agreeable to their policies.

And she will, the pay sucks. They usually only last 3-4 years before getting transferred to a different location or take a better job.

Anyway, thanks for letting me rant. I guess I do know the reasons, I am just hoping  there was a deeper reason other than greed or micromanaging. 

Maybe I'll email my senator and ask him to look into it. He loves doing stuff like that."

My dad passed away in December. We were very close and it was out of the blue, it was very rough. Still dealing with the aftermath with my stepmom. I work as a finance professional and have for 20 years. My current job is basically my dream job and sector, finally making the salary I deserve and everyone is great, and I feel like I'm failing. I don't feel like myself - I'm not nearly as sharp so I miss mistakes or I make them, I'm more scatterbrained, major imposter syndrome which never was a big issue for me. This has been noticed by my manager and the exec that oversees our department - mistakes, attention to detail lacking. I work from home most of the time and they made a comment about how it doesn't seem like I'm working full days because there have been times where I shut off my notifications by accident and didn't respond to them until a couple of hours later. Even though I was told at hiring that they don't micromanage and expect me to manage my time. And one of those times I genuinely didn't feel well and laid down early (4pm). They're dissatisfaction is palpable, but it's also not the kind of place where they give you praise. I'm not on a PIP but I wouldn't be surprised if that happened.

And they have every right MOSTLY to be dissatisifed, except for the fact that when I started I basically received no training and the outgoing person stayed on freelance to train me due to an executive shakeup. It turns out that in some things she trained me in the incorrect way. I found out later that she had performance issues. Then shortly after my boss moved up and a peer took her place. Because of the transition still ongoing I have very little direction or guidance and their response is ""just ask for it"". I have to chase after them and they are in back to back meetings every day. We have a very complex structure so the learning curve has been huge. One of the main reasons I took this job was to work under someone with more experience and to learn, I've always been kind of solo at smaller businesses.

Anyone have this experience? Will it ever end? Is it the grief or something else? I'm trying so hard and I just keep missing something. I have acknowledged the issues with my managers and committed to doing better. I just found out that one of my lifelong friends is terminal, will I ever work normally again?"

I‚Äôve served as an RN Administrator for a local home health agency that has been on its last leg since before I started. The owner recently ‚Äúsold‚Äù the company yet there has been no legal change in ownership, primarily just control. The new owner came in with pipe dream promises from salary + shares to raises and full benefits - too many to list here.

When I joined this company a year and a half ago, a clinical manager also joined with me and is facing the same mess - there was never any notion or hint that this company was in financial ruin. The original owner knew the ship was sinking and made false promises to have us blindly join her team. Since, she has had one issue after another that has affected our reimbursement. The lack of revenue has not been an issue, her business sense and spending has. We have worked hard and done our part to bring in business and ensure cash flow.

Our paychecks have often times been threatened or late, we were never offered promised benefits, 401k contributions stopped in an effort to save company money, we had hours cut, I am on call 24/7 and not reimbursed for on-call (no, I‚Äôm not salaried either) and now we‚Äôre being told our upcoming paycheck will be late (supposedly will direct deposit Tuesday when it‚Äôs due this Friday). It was also stated that this will be our last paycheck until ‚Äúthey get some money coming in.‚Äù And then presented us with an ultimatum.

Tuesday, we were given ‚Äòthe ultimatum‚Äô to either continue to work for an ‚Äúequity share‚Äù in the company versus an actual paycheck moving forward and they‚Äôd pay this weeks payroll or if we declined the equity share, we could transfer the patients out and close the doors, without this weeks paycheck.

Unfortunately equity shares is not an option for us and definitely not what we signed up for. We both have families that require a steady, predictable outcome. 

Closing the doors and moving on sounds like the most logical option, however we are required to give Medicare and our patients a 30 day notice of business closing and then have to transfer patients to other home health agencies. 

Finally, We were also offered a $5000 sign-on bonus. The remaining $3000 of the bonus is now 3 months late and no signs of being paid anytime soon. 

I feel as if I am stuck between a rock and a hard place - if I want to file unemployment while I search for other jobs, I cannot quit my job however I‚Äôm also not guaranteed to get paid.

My thought was to call the Department of Labor, (after we get our last paycheck) & file a complaint but would still need to follow Medicare policy in transferring patients and how do I accomplish this and still get paid?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. üòë

She kept saying I was the perfect candidate and the hiring manager wanted to extend an offer but that the news came in from the CEO that they're not hiring anyone who isn't working full time (fear of laid off employees) but to still finish out all interviews. 

What?? 

This whole thing was so odd. I never take verbal offers seriously but the whole thing was... Weird? Maybe there was an internal hire? No indication of that but still... Anyone have this experience?

tl;dr Was abruptly told that my lack of work since January meant I was risky even though I have proof of contract work on my resume. "

My current job I'm making $21 an hour but due to slow production I've been getting sent home. I've been wanting to get out of factory for a while now due to hating the 12 hour shifts, being away from my kids, and getting up at 4am only off 4-5 hours of sleep it's just I've had enough. Me and my wife were talking and she suggested I come work with her at pizza hut. As a driver and a cook. I'd work 35-40 hours a week and with some quick math, we figured out we'd still be able to afford our bills and help my mom out in the process. I talked to my parents about my decision and they flipped out, saying I'd be stupid to do that.

(She likely deserved the raise too, but they'd rather shoot their own foot off I guess, or are hurting for money that damn bad.) I knew she was frustrated with things. I could tell. She just wouldn't speak out to management like I would. My corporate experience showed me it was good to be open, but I guess not at this silly place that is ""TRYING"" to go corporate.

Furthermore, they also let go of 4 CSRs. I need to meet up with this guy for a beer and figure out which CSRs they let go.

Usually, I wouldn't post, but I'm in need of advice and knowledge. 

My company is going through a merger, and while the paperwork is ""pending"", there seems to be the general consensus that no pay raises, incentives, or bonuses can be given at this time. 

What I'm struggling to understand is, there seems to be no shortage of ""additional responsibilities, jobs, and duties"" available for those who seem reliable and easygoing. 

How is it that work load and responsibilities can change, including, say, position, but there is no allowance for hourly employees to earn justifiable payment increases or be paid fairly for taking on additional tasks? "

In the meeting where she met the staff she literally introduced herself by saying, ""I'm not a micromanager at all!"" My stomach sank. I knew only micromanagers say that.

She's worse than I ever imagined. Grandboss emailed me and copied her, and 14 minutes later she emailed me to ask if I saw it. Both emails were before my scheduled start time, so I suppose now I'm expected to be working while driving the hour from my house to work. 

Then 10 minutes before my leave time she sent me an email with the subject line ***urgent - please read***. It was not urgent, and as I was doing what she asked in the email, she called me. FIVE MINUTES after she sent the goddamn email. ""Did you see my email?!"" 

Everything I do, I have to explain to her in an email and then do an in-person check-in to explain it again. I was already looking for a new job because this one is awful, but now I feel on the verge of a breakdown. The funny thing is, I'm a SUPER fast email responder and am literally always checking my work email. I have some colleagues who take 6 to 8 business days to respond to anything, so I hope she gets on their cases instead. It's a large staff she supervises, and at least 4 of my colleagues do absolutely nothing. Meanwhile, my job's responsibilities are split among two people in most other units at my company. 

I'm thinking of being maliciously compliant. The moment she sends an email, I'll reply, ""I see your email! I'm reading it!"" Or I'll immediately call her or go to her office and declare that I did indeed receive her email."

But within 2 months, as cost cutting measures, they've changed schedules and working hours.

 First they eliminated a 4 hour gap on Sundays, as well as 3rd shift on Friday. They kept the 12 hour day shifts that rotate 3 on/4 off and vice versa the next week. But, those who worked the 10 hour Sunday-Wednesday schedule were moved to a Sunday-Thursday 8 hour days.

For me, I was on the night shift version of the 12 hour days, I was the only one as my department kept that shift. Working Sunday- Tuesday, 6 PM To 6:30 AM, with every other Wednesday. . After they told us Sundays start at 10 for night shift, I took on a 4 day work week, 8 on Sunday and 12 hours the rest of the week with Thursday-Saturday off.

This new schedule was dropped on us only about 2 months since the last change and the made it seem like it was an across the building thing. With there now just being 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shifts. Though, there was a weekend shift of 3 days/12 hours. Seemed like that would be its on shift.

Our department had people on that 12 hour day shift, as well as 10 hour nights due to scheduling and the lack of a need for a full crew at night. We all got forced into this new schedule. No one was happy.

The other day. I was talking to someone about her promotion to a supervisor, and she said she got to keep a 4 day work week. And made it seem like the 12 hour day shift crew also got a this new schedule to work Sunday through Wednesday. 

This whole policy was about ""shift uniformity"" and came across as a sweeping change for the entire building.  You either worked 36 hours on the weekend and had the week off or had a 40 hour/5 day work week. 

I guess I'm just irritated that not only were we forced to accept this, with no input or negotiation. But, I feel lied to, which, a company lying to their employees? Shocking. I believe in a 4 day work week and that extra day off was beneficial in many ways and now I've lost it. 

Unless the person I talked to was misinformed, I'm heated that they get that schedule. If want uniformity, the make it across the board. 

I guess I'm just rambling and maybe this isn't a big deal. But, it certainly doesn't sit well with me and at least it's giving me motivation to look for another job/take steps towards improving my life and taking some risks on adding value to my existence."

Basically, I was at an event and approached one of the other tables during a break time. I ask if they could direct me how to report a sexual assault that happened at their establishment. They told me to report it to admin but also to go away because apparently there were other people listening.

Can they fire me for this? I‚Äôm in an at-will work state but I think I might have a case? I mean, I don‚Äôt have my termination in writing and all I got was a phone call and then they said I ‚Äúbadmouthed‚Äù and that‚Äôs why I was fired.

That is the ONLY interaction I ever had with any of the business partners at the event, so it HAS to be that.



Additional context: I am considered a ‚Äòcontingent resource‚Äô which means I am contracted to Wells Fargo from a talent agency. Do I sue Wells Fargo or the talent agency?"

Contrary to the smug protestations of those who claim there can never be UBI because the oligarchy will never give people a nickel, the reality turns out to be oligarchs want their enormous shareholdings in companies like Tesla to still mean something after no human is employable any longer post-AGI/ASI.

So more people need to push back on those saying UBI will never happen because ""the rich won't allow it"". Realise: these fools are lying to you. Why do they lie like this? We can only speculate: they may be sociopaths or dogmatic capitalist fanatics who believe in ""punishment for lazy people"" and see anything resembling a ""handout"" as outrageous and a slippery slope to humans being happy, they may be people who don't actually know anything about economics pounding the table about ""inflation"", they may be old Reaganites/Thatcherites who see socialism under every bed and their only understanding of economics comes from slogans like ""the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money"".

1,2024-05-24,Co-worker constantly uses me to release her anger,u/hhyiko,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1czgkhl/coworker_constantly_uses_me_to_release_her_anger/,antiwork,"I work as a waitress in a restaurant and I have a co-worker who is constantly bullying me. The upper management knows about this but only offers mere ‚Äúwords‚Äù for me and does nothing towards her.

I got promoted to work in the floor (front desk) last year which is the same position as that co-worker. The first time, I asked her if she needed help carrying some heavy glass and this was her passive aggressive response:

Me: ‚ÄúDo you need help carrying that?‚Äù
Her: ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúYeah, I think you might need my help.‚Äù
Her: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to do it then don‚Äôt do it. There‚Äôs no need to pretend.‚Äù

Then, she went to my co-worker and said something about, ‚Äú(My name) only helps you voluntarily but not me.‚Äù and she also went to my boss to snitch that I didn‚Äôt want to help her. Of course, I didn‚Äôt confront her about it because I was new that time.

The second event was when I was helping the guests get seated, she came up to me and was like,

Her: ‚ÄúWell, why did you let them get seated at table 5?‚Äù 
Me: ‚ÄúBecause Boss did tell us that we should prioritise letting people seat at that area first before we fill in the other places.‚Äù
Her: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to use ‚ÄúBoss‚Äù to threaten me. I don‚Äôt care. I am not afraid of him.‚Äù

Then she proceeded to tell every co-worker about how I used our boss to threaten her. However, I was merely following what was instructed.

The third and many times were when I just talk to other wayyy nicer co-workers, she would harass me by saying things like ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you listen to me‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy it seems like you prefer X person more‚Äù, or ‚Äúyou are not allowed to talk to X person‚Äù.

Yesterday, the final straw was when I went to drink some water since it was not busy, the other nice co-worker came out from her toilet break offered me something to ear. Then, that crazy co-worker was like,

Her: ‚ÄúWhy do you always follow X co-worker?
X co-worker: ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt follow me. We only met here coincidentally.‚Äù
Her: ‚ÄúYou know that Y co-worker in front doesn‚Äôt do work.‚Äù
X co-worker: ‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs her problem so why are you blaming her (me)?‚Äù

That crazy person just kept quiet. However, she went in front of start yelling at me in front of every customer with words like ‚ÄúWhy do you always follow X co-worker?‚Äù

I defended myself and said that we met there coincidentally but she said ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm observing you the whole day and you always do it.‚Äù

I was so annoyed and wanted to reply with ‚Äúcould you stop being so obsessed with me‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you confront Y co-worker instead of letting your anger on me?‚Äù

Then, of course, I didn‚Äôt said it because as mentioned earlier, it‚Äôs not like the upper management will do anything against her despite always saying empty words like ‚Äúwe will fire her‚Äù which never happened."

In light of the recent wave of layoffs by major corporations, it's clear that many companies no longer view their employees as humans but merely as tools or even less. This systemic issue stems from deep-rooted capitalist values that prioritize profit over people.

I've written an article where I delve into the exploitation of workers under capitalism, drawing on historical and theoretical perspectives to explain how and why this exploitation occurs. The article discusses the role of culture, money, and power in sustaining these practices and suggests ways through which we might understand and challenge these norms.

I believe this discussion is especially relevant today and would appreciate your thoughts and any personal experiences related to this topic. Let's have a meaningful conversation on what can be done and how we can better understand the forces at play.

13,2024-05-24,F*** Corporate America!!!,u/ramblis,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1cziz7a/f_corporate_america/,antiwork,"Just need to RANT- here is a little background. I worked for a managed service provider that was purchased from a regional ISP. Started on their support desk as they were in the managed service business as well and 4 customers came over with the purchase. 6 months later I moved to a new team installing and deploying VoIP systems for business customers. 2 years later the company sold the managed service part of the business and we moved to the ISP still installing and supporting the VoIP systems.

Over a course of 6 years, I managed / supervised and built an excellent team. People in the company was unsure what my team did except for sales of course. Will fast forward several years the ISP was purchased by a larger ISP that covers 26 states with their own hosted VoIP platform. My team (9 humans) was promised we would merge in and my role would be more than what I had been doing. Well 2 weeks ago my manager‚Äôs director contacted me on Teams and stated first that this was going to be a difficult discussion. I was thinking they wanted me to get rid of my 2 contractors I have had for 5 years and kept trying to bring them own but was always told we are thinking about it or it is not a good time. Well, he started telling me that me and my team‚Äôs positions have been eliminated. What? He then proceeds to tell me that my manager‚Äôs position has also been eliminated. WOW! She turned over backwards for this company.

So, I will be leaving my job in a month with a small severance package (I‚Äôm grateful, don‚Äôt get me wrong). It is a little better than my directs but I feel bad for my team. Till we leave we must train the call center techs on how to do our job supporting the customers. We offer our customer base great customer service and they rely on us to support them. The support they will be getting will be terrible in the future as the techs we are training can‚Äôt even do their job properly. We have a daily meeting (soul draining) to go over all the aspects of my support teams‚Äô job, it can get very technical. They are paying our replacements half of what my team receives. Most of my team are very experienced and are at an engineer level. Still in disbelief and it is what it is. Just cannot believe it.

I have always been anti corporate, and this is why. When I asked who made this decision, he said I did with a cold look on his face.

We feel so disrespected for how this turned out and it is a struggle to stay another month. I‚Äôm at the point I don‚Äôt care, but I must stay if I want my severance package. WTF, feel like I‚Äôm in prison.

I will say it‚Äôs been a good run for 10 years

FUCK CORPORATE AMERICA!!!!

Idk, maybe to some people that sort of life is appealing but I don't get it at all. I can't say that I think I'd be a bunch happier living that life than living my non-billionaire life.

I obviously get the part where you don't have to work anymore and don't have to worry about money, but you don't need to be a billionaire for that. Just maybe 10 million and that'll do. You can live a decent life and you never have to work again.

But why would I need a gigantic mansion? Why would I want a superyacht? Why would I want anything like that?

Especially if I knew it came at the cost of millions upon millions of people living their lives without enough food to eat. Or living in squalor.

I just don't understand it.

Especially in Dubai where there's basically an underclass of people who are barely above slaves that make it all possible. I would rather see those people being able to have food every day than to have a superyacht.

Not to mention, extreme levels of wealth inequality are extremely destabilizing to a society. So if you're super wealthy, you constantly have to worry about whether there will come a day when there's revolution and they come to murder you. I wouldn't want to live like that either. It just doesn't seem worth it.

I'm perfectly happy with the idea of just having a reasonably-sized house. I don't get even wanting to live in a huge mansion, let alone having millions of other people live in poverty to make that happen."

For a little background, I work at a liquor store that currently has one other location that is getting ready to close. Because of this, all the staff from the other location is switching between working at my location and the other location. Well just now, one of our receivers came into the break room and looked miserable. So I asked her if she was okay and here‚Äôs how the conversation proceeded. 

Me: ‚ÄúHey Coworker are you okay?‚Äù
Co-worker ‚ÄúI have to throw up but someone‚Äôs in the bathroom and I hate throwing up with other people in the bathroom.‚Äù
Me: ‚Äúwell I can leave if you wanna use the sink‚Äù then it dawns on me and I follow up with ‚Äúwait why aren‚Äôt you home?‚Äù

I received no training, and my role was not clearly defined.  I didn't really care at the time because I just finished grad school and was desperate for a job.

But every day I wake up and instantly feel anxiety knot up my stomach. Even though I have two ""supervisors"", I'm being managed by 5 different people who all want me to have their thing be my highest priority.  The person in charge constantly says they don't want to micromanage, but gets upset if they aren't kept in the loop for every single decision.  I'm frequently asked to do something, only to find out after the fact that what I'd been asked to do wasn't what was really wanted, like I'm supposed to be able to read their mind instead of listen to their words.  I feel like I'm constantly being asked to dance across a minefield and then get blamed for not knowing where the mines were.  I'm given vague things to do, with no clear deadlines or even clear outcome, and then criticized for not magically knowing what was expected.

I made it through a PhD program, widely known for ruining peoples' mental health, without too much stress.  Never in my life, before taking this position, have I woken up so terrified and anxious about doing my job.

I'm *desperately* trying to find new employment, but I'm not getting call backs from anywhere I apply.  Every day is a struggle not to quit because I can *feel* my mental health crumbling, but I need the paycheck.  So every day, I make myself a little sicker and a little sadder, and I feel like there's nothing else I can do to try and dig myself out of the hell that is this job."

My entire working life has been either self employed or working for smallish local firms within the installation and maintenance sector and its always been a struggle to have a work/family balance and earn enough to be comfortable, the job I walked out of at the beginning of May for example was for a company with around 10 employees and all engineers had to be on site for 9 1/2 hours so with travel you could be looking at an 11 1/2 hour day and schedules were so tight you often weren't able to give customers the finish they deserved due to time constraints, the vans were all beaten up and you never knew what horrors you were walking in to.

On the other hand I have just started work ""in house"" at a large corporation doing the exact same thing but to their own properties, I have a brand new van and they supply all tools meaning my son can borrow mine as he's an apprentice chippie, I get a 33% discount at all of their establishments, I get to choose my own start time within reason and best of all I only have to do seven hours a day from leaving my house to getting home meaning I can actually be there for my kids growing up!

3,2024-05-24,Remote worker moved out of state [NV][CA],u/Sweet_Speech_9054,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1czp0cn/remote_worker_moved_out_of_state_nvca/,antiwork,"One of our employees transitioned to full remote work a few months ago. They‚Äôre great and we have full confidence in their ability to work without direct supervision. They have continued to work well in our company and would be a loss if they left.

The circumstances of their move to remote work had to do with caring for a family member. They had a few months of FMLA but once that was up we couldn‚Äôt afford to keep paying them for time off so we negotiated a contract for remote work. It kept their pay, reduced their vacation time a little, but part of the contract was that they promised to reside and work in Nevada.

The problem is that they moved to California to care for their family member, which we didn‚Äôt know. They still have their house in Nevada and that is the address on file. It sounds like their adult daughter lives there now and forwards any important mail to them in California.

California has stricter laws and income tax that Nevada doesn‚Äôt have. We already pay for a computer and internet (the computer is company owned and the internet is an extra $200 a month that we expect the employee to use on high speed internet.) but we don‚Äôt usually keep time cards for remote workers and California has strict overtime laws. They are also not set up to pay California income tax, and we don‚Äôt even know for sure if they‚Äôre supposed to be paying them.

We don‚Äôt want to bring them back to the office or even back to Nevada, they will probably just quit. And we‚Äôre really not interested in punishing them. We just don‚Äôt know what our liability is as an employer and how we can/should adjust our policies to account for this scenario.

Also, our in-house counsel, who specializes in patent law, is looking into it, but has a lot on their plate and might not get back for a week or two so I‚Äôm just trying to get ahead of this and be prepared. 

EDIT: so the rumor mill is not quoting and only making things more complicated. The rumors seem to be that they don‚Äôt live in CA, they just went there to visit family and are taking a while. Or that they are checking their family member into a hospice center and will return soon. Or that they drive back and forth a couple times a week (it‚Äôs an hour and a half drive so it‚Äôs plausible). Or that nobody was right and someone got confused and it‚Äôs actually the daughter who moved to California. So basically there is no reliable source of information. 

We don‚Äôt have IT, it‚Äôs contracted to a third party who charges extra after 6pm eastern so we‚Äôll check tomorrow. But our programs took a look and said the IP address we have been seeing on their computer is the same it‚Äôs always been. Unfortunately that means they‚Äôre probably using a VPN or something because they should have been logging in on different networks so that is probably a dead end.

But I‚Äôm tired, I have phone call with the employee tomorrow at 9 so any real updates will probably come then. I might be responding to comments in the mean time but I‚Äôm not going to let that stop me from opening a beer or ten. 

Update: after speaking with the employee we found out they took their family member to visit other family in CA. It was supposed to be an overnight thing so they didn‚Äôt think to let anyone know. But their condition worsened and had to be taken to the hospital. They have been there for two and a half weeks. They are either pulling the plug on their family member or transferring them back to Nevada this Saturday depending on their doctor‚Äôs recommendation. I put them on paid FMLA (yes, we pay FMLA at our company, it‚Äôs paid at 75%) and we will reevaluate on Monday. Our in-house counsel said they will get a consultation with an employment lawyer in California but since it‚Äôs a short trip we think we can just skip under the radar for now. "

I also tried to get a new flat but that seems impossible if you don‚Äôt have enough money to pay rent for 3 months in advance or if you‚Äôre not rich enough to just buy the flat/house that you want. My last effort to find one was rewarded with the fact that someone paid 250k out of pocket for this flat and i was out.

I have what I thought was my dream job. It checks every box I've wanted in a career: positive and ethical product, room for growth, freedom to make decisions, management trusts me and I trust management, good communication, nice bonuses, good benefits, free lunches, great coworkers, the list goes on. 

I have been at this job for close to a year and put my heart and soul into my work. I'm talking brutal 18 hour days with no overtime pay for months. But I love our mission so I was happy to do the work. Unfortunately we are a startup that has run out of money. We have a few weeks left to stay alive before we potentially merge with another company. I've never been a part of a merger before and I don't know what to expect. In order to survive after the merger we need to figure out how to raise additional funding (something we haven't been able to do beforehand which is why we are in this position). 

I have a job offer from another company. The pay is better, it's a more stable position, I won't have to work insane overtime for free, but it sounds so boring and it's the opposite of my passion. 

If I leave my current position it is going to put the company in a very bad place (if they survive). If I stay I risk being jobless.

11,2024-05-24,Interviews are 50/50 at best,u/Constant_Mortgage404,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1czt2vo/interviews_are_5050_at_best/,antiwork,"tl;dr - I'm venting, interviews suck.

Hey everyone, 

  
I was laid off in February of this year and have since gone 0/52 on job applications. One of those turned into an online assessment, and another actually resulted in 3 rounds of interviews.

I was told today that they would be moving forward with another candidate and I'm beyond upset. The first interview I had with this company was over the phone and with the hiring manager. I think it was supposed to be a ""here's more information about the job, when can we schedule a formal Zoom meeting"" kind of thing, but we hit it off immediately and ended up speaking for around an hour. Solid start, I thought.

Then we had the Zoom interview, and it again went very well. We ran over by about 30 minutes and I thought I had the job in the bag. Given how things have been going for me, I've really tried to remove any emotion from applying/interviewing but I'm a human and couldn't help but feel a bit optimistic. 

I also thought that would be the final interview considering it was with the hiring manager, but they let me know that I would be hearing from the recruiter (who I had not heard from at this point) to schedule a meeting with their boss. 

The recruiter reaches out, we get a Zoom meeting set up, and everything is moving accordingly. This is where the problems begin.

20 minutes before the third interview is supposed to begin, I get an email from the recruiter saying it's actually going to be over the phone. This normally wouldn't be a big deal, it's really not that different, but it knocked me off balance. I'm not really sure why I felt this way, I'm probably out of practice considering my lack of success thus far.

They call me and I can immediately tell we don't mesh. They start asking questions, I answer them to the best of my ability, and I can just tell that either I'm not giving them the answer they want to hear or they aren't that interested. In between some the questions they're asking me, I ask them questions about themselves. They admit to me that ""they aren't very involved with the team that I would be under"" and I have an internal explosion. I have no idea why I'm on the phone with this person, they have no idea why they're on the phone with me. It was incredibly frustrating. 

I got the rejection email today, but I knew it was coming. I guess in this market 2 perfect interviews with the hiring manager isn't enough to actually land the job. For reference, I also had 3 internal recommendations for this position, 2 from VP level employees. 

No idea how I'm actually going to get a job. Everything I see says you need to network, but I tried that and it didn't work.

So after a while of interviewing with this company, they have requested references from¬†**direct managers**¬†from my past two roles. My most recent role is fine because I have a good relationship with them and trust them to vouch for me. The problem is my direct from the company prior. I left on poor terms (the workplace was unfortunately highly toxic and also had a reorg where they laid off 30% of people).

The program that the company I am interviewing for is using¬†**Crosschq**. I never had issues giving references in the past, but now that I am forced to use a direct's reference in contrast to my coworkers or other managers I've worked with (just not a direct), I'm panicking as to what to do.

My friends are stating to just lie and make a past coworker/friend a ref and have them listed as a direct, but I've never used Crosschq before and have no idea what to expect, and definitely do not want to be caught lying. 

Wanted to see if anybody came accross or had experiences with crosschq. 

TLDR; company i am interviewing for, asked for references for past 2 directs, for one i have a poor relationship, debating on having a friend pretend to be a direct be a ref but since it is throught this platform: crosschq, have no idea what to expect

This came fro. The company president, who seems incapable of speaking conversational English. It's all corporate double speak.

Loosely translated, they've determined that the front lines can learn how to do multiple tasks currently assigned to discrete departments so they can reduce staff, but ""scale up,"" meaning more automation or offshoring work (we're already having trouble with those mofos not formatting input so the system can read it no matter how many times they're forrected).

Think of the economy as a tube of toothpaste standing on its head. At the bottom is the opening where the paste comes out. Those are the workwrs/cosumers/taxpayers. At the top is the sealed end of the tube. That's the execs, the ""job creators"" (like they wouldn't be replaced if their companies fell). The way the system's been rigged with tax cuts, stagnant wages, and lost jobs, the toothpaste has been moved up to the sealed end and away from the opening, so there's little coming down through to flow out, and even less if they had their way. Good luck brushing your teeth.

This book by David Graeber was such an influence in my way of thinking about working that I've read it three times, each one making me realize that a bullshit job is not just a temporary sacrifice for something else, or a intermediate step towards something, it's a destruction of our existence as a human being, as we are reduced to a machine, as if trading-off electrical energy into results with no aspirations, dignity or any reasonable input of what is being done whatsoever. The moments we could be enjoying, not knowing how long our lives could least, are traded into absolutely meaningless hours of repetitive tasks or, as brilliantly pointed out by the writer, employed in acting that we're busy when we have nothing to do, which is the worse kind of intellectual punished ever thought.

So, what are your stories about bullshit jobs?"

Been working for a company as a temp for a year and busting ass and making things happen in a position that requires a lot of knowledge, soft skills, tech skills u name it. Temp agency said they were going to offer me the same amt as they had been paying the agency.  Well, now we‚Äôre talking. This is no entry level position but that‚Äôs the amount they offered me when I was called into HR. And it will be hourly. Clock in and out. Nobody else is hourly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all we can afford to pay. You are doing an amazing job.‚Äù

Well, just as I was onboarding, surprise, the company was acquired by a very large, powerful, well-funded company. Nobody saw it coming.  New HR says to take any issues to our local manager and try to resolve. If unsatisfactorily resolved, walk into the doors or the new HR to discuss. (And you know they don‚Äôt actually mean that‚Ä¶epecially in a red, religious state.) 

I went into have a calm and rational request to make a wage adjustment if that made sense. I have an entire career in another area. I had some life trauma and was taking a break from that level of responsibility. But, they asked me to tack on the things I have education and experience in. No, said the current HR said ‚ÄúSorry, can‚Äôt help you.‚Äù Okay, so I took the new company up on their offer and went in. I had ONE day to do so. The unwritten rule is not a surprise is it? You are NOT supposed to advocate for yourself. No no no. 

New HR listened and said ‚ÄúWow! Your resume. Yes, we want to look into this.‚Äù I said no hurry and not trying to make waves but I‚Äôm not even making a living wage. 

And yesterday was a corporate meet and greet off-site in the afternoon. If anyone thinks this is not mandatory, i have a bridge to sell. You bet your butt you must attend. When I got there, a low-level busy body asked if I clocked out. I said no. I‚Äôm used to these types
of things. No salaried person is being docked in their pay for clocking out early and attending. Why would I take a hit in pay? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre supposed to clock out.‚Äù

Then, as the groups cliqued, I was by myself and met the new CEO who loved chatting with me. She gave her speech and then joined my table for the rest of the evening. She wanted me there. That is breeding grounds for jealousy. I happen to be good at socializing about non work topics. She loved that.  I had nightmares and suspected there was trouble.  

I wasn‚Äôt wrong. I had a mtg. request early in the morning to discuss ‚Äúyour job responsibilities‚Äù with the person above my supervisor. It was exactly as I predicted‚Ä¶to shame me and tell me
off. No more Mrs. Nice Person. Ranting. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ungrateful and unprofessional!‚Äù

No, I am experienced. I know that the less you are paid, the worse you‚Äôre treated. I have never gotten anyplace good in a corp by following the oppressive HR way. Never. She said that the person above her said to fire and replace me. I said okay. Small thinking. That is retaliation and I will find another job but not before I run it to the CEO. 

Stay tuned. 

Final was an email from HR. Those grub worm petty power types. She cc‚Äôd the yeller.‚Äù To clarify, you are not paid to attend voluntary corp events. We will pay you until 5P this one time.‚Äù Yes, you do that little one. You didn‚Äôt get an invite to the adult table.

A few weeks ago, I had an employee accidentally drop a 26ft piece of tin on my knee. I only needed 10 stitches and had to drive myself to the doctor. The owner made sure to tell me not to tell them it happened on the job (pretty sure that‚Äôs wrong) and out of fear of losing my job I accepted his offer to cover my medical bills and lie about where I had the accident. When I went to leave the ER, I ripped a stitch when I moved knee. So they put me in an immobilized brace so I couldn‚Äôt bend my knee while I waited 14 days for the stitches to stay in. I drove myself back to work and told the owner. He agreed to pay me out of pocket the 14 days after bitching and moaning about not making money off the job we are currently working (sorry dude, that‚Äôs what workers comp is for?) 

So the second week I‚Äôm out of work he only pays me for 20 hours (he told me 2 weeks at 40 hours of pay while I was unable to work) and his reasoning was ‚Äúthe rest of the guys couldn‚Äôt work because of rain. Whatever, I can dip into the little saving I have to cover the pitiful check I got. 

Then today, after being back for a full week, I see that on the last day I was out (the day I got my stitches taken out) he didn‚Äôt pay me any hours. I had to show him the work release order that instructed me to return to work the next day. He thankfully wrote me a check for 10 hours that the crew worked that day, then decided to let me know he was docking my pay from the raise I got 2 months ago. Supposedly, I haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúperforming to the expectation that was given to me‚Äù when I got my raise.

I have a family to take care of. My wife, 1 year old daughter, and my little brother in law who I have custody of with no child support from his parents. I‚Äôm in a bind financially and it‚Äôs because he really kind of screwed me by not paying me his promised amount and docking my pay.

You're interested in applying to work for us? Great! Here is all you need to do to apply. It is literally as EASY as PIE!!!!! First, you're gonna fill out an application, obviously. Plus you need a resume, too! And you better have at LEAST a doctorate degree and 50 years of experience, even though this is an entry level retail job that pays $7.50/hr (Even though we advertise the starting price as $25/hour, making you think you're about to make pretty good money working retail but we are dedicated to making your life a living nightmare, so we'll screw you over and pay you minimum wage. And no, you are not allowed to complain to us about your pay, because you will be immediately fired and blacklisted everywhere, so you'll be completely out of work too. Sorry not sorry). If you don't have a doctorate, sorry LOL, you're outta luck. Oh, and also we're gonna make you retype your entire resume into the application, and no, you cannot just put ""See resume,"" because we don't feel like checking your resume. But we'll still require you to upload one anyway.

After you finish your application, we'll make you take a 20 question personality test. It should only take about 5 minutes, and then I promise you can get on with your day. But you MUST take this personality test, because it will determine if you are willing to let us walk all over you. Trust us, we would TOTALLY pay you less if we could, but the law says we can't pay you less than $7.50/hr. Go figure. But we'll ask if you're willing to work for free, just as a hypothetical question, JUST in case we find out a way to get away with forcing you to do that. After you take your SUPER easy 5 minute 20 question personality test, you'll think, yay, I'm done! Now I can continue applying to more jobs! But wait, you're not done yet!!!! I know we told you it would only take 5 minutes, but there are still more personality tests to get through. We'll make you take one of those Traitify exams, where we show you a LOVELY stock photo and you have to tell us if it's you or not you!! No, we won't tell you how to do it, so good luck. And this test is 200 questions long and will take at MINIMUM an hour of your time to complete. But we appreciate your time. We know you have more jobs you could be applying to because you're literally about to get evicted and nobody has hired you so you desperately need money, but we know you're not just wanting to work for us because you'll get paid. Obviously you will GLADLY jump through all these hoops for the HONOR of working with us, because we're just that awesome. I mean, you should be paying US for investing this much time into submitting an application. And for the honor of working for us, should you be lucky enough to get hired!!!!

After you finish your Traitify test, we'll make you take an IQ test just for funzies, then a test about a bunch of other bullcrap that has nothing at all to do with this job whatsoever, and we'll even throw in the entire Bar Exam and also the MCAT, just because we feel like it!!!! Then another personality test for good measure. And then we will make you take an endless survey about your experience with these exams, and you better give the most positive, GLOWING answer ever or else we'll throw your application in the trash.

After you get through all this, assuming you still have an ounce of sanity left, we'll let you know if you passed or failed. Even though we didn't tell you beforehand that you were being scored on all this. If you failed, sorry LOL, sayonara, but don't worry, you can re-apply in 12 months!!!! If you pass, we will send you a link to complete a HireVue interview because AI makes us more money!!!!!! We don't care how bad AI is at making hiring decisions, as long as we get more money that's all that really matters. Anyway, we'll give you a total of 50 questions, and you only get 5 seconds to prepare for each one. And you must answer each in under 30 seconds or else you're not hireable. And you BETTER not move a SINGLE muscle other than your mouth, because the AI will detect that as you not being hireable for this job, and you'll also be put on a blacklist from every single other job everywhere in your area (The AI does that, not us), forcing you to relocate to a different area just to find a job, even though you literally cannot afford to live in even your current super cheap apartment, let alone be able to get approved elsewhere given your financial situation. Because OBVIOUSLY this is important for pushing carts!!! Oh, and you only get one shot at each question. If you mess up, too bad so sad.

Once you get through all 50 of these questions, we will contact you in about 5-7 business days at minimum. We might take longer though just because, if we feel like it. Or we just might not contact you at all. If you're lucky enough to make it past this interview, we'll send you an email that makes you think you have the job but upon reading you realize you're just going to another round of interviews. We'll take another week or so, give or take, to contact you, and then the process repeats about 10, maybe 100 more times.

We appreciate your interest in working for us! Thanks for applying!"

I took 05/15/24 off due to being sick. Went to Urgent Care, received a doctor‚Äôs note, and canceled my visits for the day.

Background: I work in Family Services. My job consists of meeting with clients for motivational interviews (formerly SBC) and then meeting with families for supervised interactions. Our company is contracted for 10 visits a month for each family we work with by the state. 

My boss is now telling me I need to make up the visit, even though he used one of my PTO days for it. My question is, do I actually have to make this up? I asked my boss why I had to make it up, and he said ‚ÄúBecause you have time and it needs to be made up‚Äù. My last day with the company is 05/31/24, and I‚Äôm worried if I don‚Äôt make up the visit they‚Äôll forfeit my paycheck for June (we get paid a month late, so if you work all of April you get paid May 31st. My work this month will be paid out June 28th, a whole month after I‚Äôll have left the company. Would this be retaliation of any sort if they did try this? 

Extra note: this wouldn‚Äôt be the first time my supervisor has been shady. I am a salaried, EXEMPT employee and he attempted to tell me I did not have enough hours last month (due to CLIENT cancellations) and I would need to accept more work to make up for it. This was 2 weeks ago and he has yet to mention it again. I‚Äôm just wondering if any of this goes against labor laws, etc. 

TIA for your advice/thoughts! "

He also told me he loved the crm system I built from scratch after the other director bailed because he didn't know how to create fields. I've got an entire program mapped and about 2 weeks from going live.

He has never once asked to see this system, even though I've sent him multiple PowerPoints about it. I even invited him to a meeting to verify he approved of all of the workflows and he didn't show.

Am I going crazy or am I going to lose my job because the program director doesn't understand my job description? He said he's changing my job description next week - can he do that?

Also, I'm female over 40. Bc of course I am.

I've already started applying, but all the listings seem to be fake."

I put 3 weeks' notice in about 2 weeks ago now, since this has easily been the most toxic workplace I have ever been a part of. Constant backstabbing, lies and deception, carrying too much unnecessary weight/too many daily tasks.

Well here comes today, where I find out that this coming Tuesday they are forcing all staff (clinical and admin) to participate in a lip-sync to ""boost employee morale"". Not only do we have to memorize the song over the weekend, but we need to come up with a 3-minute long dance/movement piece to accompany it. The song? ""Love Me Tender"" by Elvis Presley. 

I asked to not participate in this, as I found out this would be posted on social media, well after I would be gone (last day is next Friday, this would not be posted until at least mid-June). Boss told me that participation is mandatory and that we need to do this in order to boost social media engagement and ""drive sales our way"". The utter grossness of seeing healthcare as ""sales"" aside, I continued to refuse to participate, citing my discomfort with being on their social media page.

  
This eventually escalated to the point where my boss threatened that if I did not participate, the company may choose to let me go sooner than my stated end date due to ""insubordination"". I tell her that this would be a hilariously ridiculous reason to fire someone (not sure if illegal but that's another story) and that if I were forced to participate or be fired, that I would consider that grounds for my immediate resignation. She says, ""we'll see about that"" and ends the conversation then and there.

  
Basically, I just want to post this just to make sure I'm not alone in thinking this is fucking insane? I feel like my job should not be in jeopardy just because I don't want to mime Elvis on the company's Facebook page."

Sometimes I also think ""f.ck this sh.t. humans aren't meant to work so many hours (currently 70 h a week in my case) or in such hard conditions. Too many people have a hard time at work every day of their lives. But a few of us have a job that is actually needed for society to function properly. Garbage collectors, food providers (farmers, food distributors etc), health workers, bus drivers, engineers, infrastructure builders, electricity providers and the likes. Many work fields that couldn't do without people. So if everyone militated against work as a whole, how could society functions properly? We would always need the efforts of some humans to benefit people as a whole. What are the tenets of this anti work mindset applied to real life?

I help people get benefits if they qualify. I love helping people. Today marked my one year with the company. My supervisor was off today to enjoy the hoilday weekend. The supervisor from the other team made it a point to leave a card and pocket token with encouraging words for myself and my team. So I was appreciative of her doing this when she didn't have to so I sent her a email thanking her and letting her know it brightened my day.

Well a few hours later I'm warming up my lunch in the break room and she comes over to me and says I've been wanting to tell you something but didn't know when would be the right time. She let me know during my hiring that they did not want to hire me. They hired someone who applied after me. They are no longer with the company.But she fought to get me hired.

She wanted me to know but waited till now to tell me. üôÅ

She said I wanted you to know because it was shady and wrong.

( I also want to add that she doesn't like my supervisor and I don't either but I can't change that she is my supervisor) I come to work do my job and go home. I feel she told me this so I will leave. But can't get over her bothering to tell me this all of a sudden and how calculating it is.

Also, I have been applying to jobs for a while now because I know this company is toxic.

Looking for any thoughts on why she would choose to tell me something that is hurtful. Was it to clear her conscious or was it something else?

First a little context, i am trying to getting out of South America and moving to Italy becouse i have family there. I only want to move for the relatively better economy.

A few months ago traveled there to start with the citizenship paperwork, and also visiting my family. 

I went out on dinner with probably my future boss (which happens to be also my uncle) and he ask something on the lines of: ""Imagine you work for a company that didn't sell enough this month and they are not able to pay you, what would you do?"" 

I was really perplexed, i more or less answered what he wanted to hear becouse i will need the job at least to start out but now, i know without doubt that i gotta run out of there i soon as i can.

Like don't hate me but i think real capitalism (not the actual corporativist merchantilism) is the best possible sistem but what this guy pretend of an employer? To be a literal slave? 

I mean i can't go to the grocery store and tell the cashier ""sorry my company didn't earn enough you should support them becouse they give me the gift of work"". It doesn't even make sense.

I just wanted to take it out of my chest.

How would you answered this in my situation?. I mean not getting the job is not an option."

My office job involves helping the public which includes taking payment be it check, card or cash and there's a machine that takes in and gives out money. This machine has about as many problems as my state since a tech is regularly here to clean it, free the jams, replace a part, and other miscellaneous tasks required. As with some other customer facing jobs we are required to maintain a proper till of cash and ensure that opening and closing amounts reconcile properly, until it doesn't.

See, this machine is only operated by supervisors and some are ignorant of the issues this machine has which means whenever there is a jam or when money is deposited too soon or too fast some currency may be lost. In my case some of the coins and some of the bills were miscounted as the machine has a very small window with which you are allowed to deposit after which it may take the money but not register anything. After getting the deposit slip and saw I was short on the slip I asked what happened to which the supervisor said that they didn't know what happened and that they will figure it out later. When asked what will happen if they don't find out what happened to the money what would happen to me, as it is my till that is being affected. 

""Well if we can't figure it out then it's your error""

My error when I have no control over the deposit? My problem if someone else or the machine fucks up? My job on the line if they can't figure out what happened? After I was told to trust the process and not count the money before opening and closing?  Well I was having none of that and printed out all the receipts for all the cash and did the math on what went missing. Not surprisingly the amount from the receipts added up with the starting cash to how much *should* have been deposited. When presented with the receipts I was told to not worry about it that they would take care of it. 

What choice do I have? I left the room and soon after walked by the office of management and the supervisor was in there, most likely, talking about me and coming up with some excuse to get rid of me like insubordination or hurting their ego or doubting their ability to do the basic fucking minimum. Oh right and I was written up for not taking my breaks on time even though I was doing my damnedest to get the customer finalized with everything they need but that story or stories are for another time.

My wife gets 6 weeks, and has the normal FMLA protection required by Ohio law. The policy includes a pay back clause the states if an employee quits after taking leave for an ‚Äúindefinite period‚Äù after returning to work she will be required to re-pay the paternity leave. 

I understand having a pay back clause, but the phrase ‚Äúindefinite‚Äù is giving us pause. We‚Äôve considered having her stay home, and tightening our belts a bit with a single income but haven‚Äôt fully made a choice.  My wife likes her job and would like to go back, but is more concerned about the longer term potential risk of how this is phrased.

Seeking feedback and insight if this is legal and enforceable for a non specific amount of time and how toget clarity from the org with out making is sound like shes planningg on leaving.

My baby girl is due to arrive in August and I have had a terrible pregnancy. I have gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and hyperemesis  Gravidarum. Because of these issues my doctor said I would need to be in the hospital for four weeks post birth to monitor and make sure my body does not go into cardiac arrest.

I work remote and I think that is the only thing saving my sanity. I received no training on our software products and was expected to learn it on my own. Part of my job is to train this product to clients outside of the company. It's bizarre. There have been two instances that have been red flags for me. The first was a department meeting were we were told my team would partner up with other department leads to teach them how to interpret our clients emails and to assist with answering questions back to those clients. I was there two months at that time. I received no training whatsoever wasn't even answering emails at that point because I had no clue how to answer them. 

Last week, I was told that I would present our product to new hires so they could better understand and ask questions. This is the same product that I received no training on and the kicker is I started the same week as these other new hires. I was told to watch product videos and learn from those videos.

Next week, I have a meeting with the technical team. The meeting is to go over my role step by step to create a manual. I am suppose to bring any documents or ideas that I feel should be added. The odd part is that we have three products and three people in my role individually handling each product. There is no structure/procedure difference in each role. The other two team members have been there two years. I have been there 90 days with barely any training.

The pay is good. I work remote. Otherwise, I would be looking to leave ASAP. I also just left my last job months in and can not risk looking like a job hopper.

Can someone give thoughts on why I am being asked to do this and not my peers? I do think my manager is horrible and part of the lack of training is to keep herself ahead of us."

The conversation went from their standard questioning to a guilt trip. 

'We had so many plans for you'
'We're getting these new departments & positions'
'I've heard negative things about where you're going'
'Don't burn bridges cause this is a small community'
'We took a chance on you despite ""that"" happening'
'Leaving after 1yr may make you un-hireable in the future here for ANY position'
'You'll be bored over there compared to here'

It really irked me because it was 'I understand, but [insert negative thing]'. For reference, I'm leaving the position to advance my career because my current job doesn't have the role I need and it'll be years (if ever) before it's implemented. My new job has the role as well as other areas of advancement. Mind you, I don't know who told them where I was going. I had such an internal struggle about leaving this place, but after this, I wish I could leave right now. But I don't want to be blacklisted from applying to a different position in this company after I get the job experience and education.

My employer previously wae sending me on work trips each and every 2 weeks without paying me even for my food (12 euros per day if the client doesn't give you free food). My transportation such as in train don't count as working time unless I'm actually working from the train or the plane. So needless to stay these trips are basically a nightmare and I end up paying for food from my pocket. My job description is even related to design and I felt pretty much tricked after my interviewer said some few trips per year. The company is multinational. They were previously happy with me and wanted to offer me a bigger contract with more contract hours. After my pregnancy announcement, I got criticized heavily in my performance review. I had to announce earlier because they wanted to send me on trips and I'm having complications in my current pregnancy. Two people were involved in this performance review and the one with more weight is a guy that had a pregnant wife at home and is taking a 6 months leave to stay with his wife. He was even taking some off days to go with his wife to hospital. He was kind of criticizing me for not going to sites and that in second trimester I should go since I will feel better. Bare in mind the visit is for months in another country and in very tough site conditions (even not in my job description). He left for 6 months parental leave after giving me a bad review. My other boss that I speak to almost daily told me this reduction by email claiming that he is busy at the moment. I'm doing well in my job although I took over after the main man's messy management. I'm solving all their problems, and I'm involved in all aspects, they just need to ask the main project manager. I'm just here to vent as I know HR are useless, the amount cut is really pathetic to argue about, I'm not in a good moment to stress now while pregnant.

5,2024-05-25,Ex supervisor issues,u/Beneficial_Yam9213,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d099xv/ex_supervisor_issues/,antiwork,"Posted to r/work as well.

So, I have been working hybrid since 2021. The first 2 years I worked under a supervisor, let‚Äôs call her Lina, and I believe she was not trusting of me soon after hiring because we were working remote a lot. I worked at a slower pace to start. It took me some time, and not because I was slacking off but I just had a hard time fitting phone appointments under 15 minutes, or half an hour depending on the appointment with a client. I did ask for help sometimes, from coworkers that finished early (as I was instructed) and things were going fine as I learned the ropes and got a better at the job.

However, Lina thought I was taking too long and there must be some other reason. I have to mention I had small kids at the time. I had help at home while I worked though, and I made that aware. Anyway‚Ä¶Lina has a meeting with me in office about me needing to have better time management. I understood, I tried to improve. My schedule was part-time, so some weeks I worked Monday Tuesday, off Wednesday and resumed Friday (etc.) and I also had different start times which depended on whether or not we had a meeting.

Well, because I had a schedule like that, it was hard to keep track of work meetings. Sometimes my schedule was rearranged because we had a random meeting thrown in. She would reach out and wonder why I wasn‚Äôt on, to which I would truthfully reply ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt receive the invite.‚Äù (They‚Äôd forget to send it) or I was out the previous day, so I didn‚Äôt check my email until my start time (meeting would start earlier in the day)

This was 3 months into the job. She was upset. Rightfully so I guess, but she accidentally texted me instead as of a fellow supervisor complaining about me with an emoji. I never mentioned it, and neither did she‚Ä¶but then later she goes on to call me another day asking why my assignment hasn‚Äôt been completed fast enough, to which I have to remind her that I am working on the time sensitive ones I have also been assigned that day. (The other supervisor would assign tasks) So‚Ä¶she was watching how fast I would complete appts.

Lina then later called me to inform me that upon reviewing of my application, my educational background was misunderstood upon hiring. She said ‚Äúhiring managers‚Äù believed I had a bachelors, but I never said I did. I said I graduated from community college. HR was going to require I pay them back, for wages that had been paid under the impression I had a bachelors. Please note, many people I work with do not have a college education. It varies in my work field. I still wonder why this was looked into 6-7 months after I was hired. I had to pay back 700 bucks in wages.

Anyway. She transferred me to a different supervisor for ‚Äúpromotional‚Äù reasons in a way. I don‚Äôt want to give too much detail in case Lina is out there reading this. I have been happy where I‚Äôm at, but still see Lina once per month at a meeting. Lina sends feedback to my current supervisor depending on how she feels I am behaving or what I‚Äôm doing on the other side. Once, I had my mic off and excused myself from the kitchen where I lived, turned the camera off and went to a less distracting area. She reported that back as me being very distracted with other things. She has also reported back my camera being off the entire meeting (it was fine on my end, but the team couldn‚Äôt see me which I believe could have been tech issues) but instead of asking me about it she just reports it. Yesterday, I turned my camera off here and there while I completed other work for a huge task I needed to leave the meeting a bit early for, and she messaged me ‚Äúturn your camera on or leave the meeting.‚Äù Please note that I was still actively participating in the meeting and engaging in the chat. I excused myself and explained that I had to prepare for a huge assignment that I would be leaving early for anyway.

I asked a fellow coworker who always, ALWAYS has her camera off if she also received a message (then or even some point before) and she said ‚Äúno, I haven‚Äôt. Why? Is my camera off a problem?‚Äù I explained my reason for asking, to which she was very surprised as well.

Does Lina have something against me? I‚Äôm not sure if I should talk with my current supervisor about this. Or am I just imagining it? Idk."

They originally said it was WFH on Fridays but upon me signing the offer they said it was now every other Friday with permission. 

I am not surprised but obviously irritated. I have noticed that companies use WFH as a way to make people work when sick. I have not ever had a job where WFH is an option but I've noticed this.

It seems like lots of companies with WFH don't let you use it easily but when you are sick, they tell you to WFH. Thing is, we've all been sick enough that we just shouldn't be working. 

I'm 34 years old. I am so done with getting sick and then feeling so anxious about telling my employer and then possibly dealing with some sort of pushback or them trying to make me work.

If I am super sick, I'm not working, remote or not. If I'm sick and out of sick days I don't care, don't pay me. I am so so tired of being an adult but being questioned and interrogated when sick. So although I don't wanna mess up this new job, I'll put my foot down"

My brother and I are having a conversation about our minimum wage law. 

So, per the minimum wage bill that passed, it states that minimum wage is mandatory for anyone who basically isn't salary, service, or tipped employees. What we are trying to figure out is, if you are hourly + commission does the rule apply to you as being paid the new minimum wage + your commission. Or does the commission take over to ""balance the minimum wage?""

So, for instance the new minimum wage is $15 an hour. But you are paid $8/hour + your commission rate, which was what you were getting paid when the original minimum wage was 6.75/hour. 

If state matters, I will post it in the comments."

The job was easy, the pay was great, so I loved it. After Christmas last year, my paychecks dropped by 200-300$. I live in a college town and chalked it up the students leaving, which is why my tips had dried up. I made a base pay of 9$ an hour, and without those tips, my paychecks were horrible. When the students came back, I picked up some extra shifts and pulled some doubles on the weekend to help the strain on my finances. I made a base pay 600$ paycheck. I only made enough in tips to cover taxes. I was confused, until random customers came in asking if we were getting our ut tips, because they had heard that our management had been taking them. This was the first I heard about it, so I asked around. My manager for the day CONFIRMED that they get to take some of the tip pool. My paychecks never went back up, and a few of my coworkers were also complaining. We had people quit over it. Come summer time, everything slowed down, and only 10 of the original service staff of 30 was still employed. I had to get a second job to make ends meet by then, and my first job wasn‚Äôt respecting my new availability. I was scheduled to work six days a week, some of my coworkers were scheduled to work multiple doubles a week to help out, and the tips got even worse. When I saw that they were hiring for our position, at a higher base pay. I lost it. They only had 3 of us running the restaurant a few weeks ago, and sent home someone in the middle of a rush. So it was me and one other coworker serving customers, taking orders, busing tables. It was awful. I left at my clock out time without permission from my manger, then quit the very next day."

Especially since this is on r/antiwork. 

It‚Äôs entirely the point of US employers pitting workers against each other. 

* Create a shortage of positions
* create a shortage of coverage when time off is taken
* create a shortage of time off through various means such as poor workers rights
* especially in retail, force the employees to work it out amongst themselves. 
* Low wages forcing dual incomes which is more time away from children

Now THIS might be the ‚Äúunpopular‚Äù opinion, but when they say ‚Äúchildren are our future‚Äù and ‚Äúit takes a village to raise a child‚Äù, that‚Äôs the truth. We SHOULD be investing in ways for parents to take more time to spend with their children. We SHOULD be demanding better rights including employers being responsible for coverage (a lot of this varies by state). We SHOULD be having higher minimums when it comes to pay and time off for EVERYONE, not just parents. 

It‚Äôs intentionally driven to be dog-eat-dog so that childless adults feel vilified for valuing their own time, which they shouldn‚Äôt. Similar parents will inevitably feel unassisted, and left behind, their children get less care and time with their parents. These are things that lead to children having tough less rounded upbringings and causes repeating societal issues. 

We shouldn‚Äôt be vilifying each other, because we ALL deserve time to ourselves, time with our family, time away from work. 

We are aok overworked and underpaid. And we SHOULD be demanding that children are prioritised in that there‚Äôs available care and quality education and available time off. 

Childless folks need to be fighting for this too because it‚Äôs other people‚Äôs children that will be inheriting what‚Äôs left behind, that will be taking care of us when we should be retiring. And parents should not be vilifying or making childless adults feel guilty or undervalued simply because of their choices or for valuing their own time, because we all deserve time away from work.

So when we‚Äôre mad, restructure the conversation over who‚Äôs to blame: our elected officials not supporting workers, and our employers for lobbying and creating this issue."

Dont even get me started on the alerts that fire up every couple of minutes which have thier own dashboard too . The platforms are gigantic and I was extremely overwhelmed,  my training was basically like 3 weeks for 8 hours straight everyday then I'm off to my own. It was pretty much a ton of information and hearing someone talk for hours have caused me to have a brain freeze.  Now obviously I'm making alot of mistakes due to the huge diversity of the platforms that we use but I found out that they have been keeping track of every single mistake I made in every ticket and it went something like we can't have other people keep fixing your mistakes and you are slowing us down. What the actual fuck? Bitch I make 24/hr we get no bonuses. The only incentive for this job is the fact that it's hybrid. We get two days in office and it's voluntary if you needed a quite place to work. 

 they basically wanted someone who is a database engineer/ software dev/ software engineer/ devops/support . That's an entire department not one person.  Documentation in this job is horrible. Everyone can just go create an article about whatever process then we come to find out later that it's documented incorrectly which is how I followed this process then got dinged for it.

End of March rolls around and I decide ""well maybe I can request an unpaid day off to see the solar eclipse. It was approved. Then my dad needed emergency brain surgery so I called in to be with him and the family.

The next day I was called into the office and told my eclipse day was denied because the new supervisor (relatively new, she'd been there about 6 months) noticed I'm taking too much time off, I'm still in the negative, and it's impacting the department.

I said ""but I was sick!? And my dad got sick! And you wouldn't get me a WFH laptop! This is just one day and it's once in a lifetime!""

Also my coworkers said my ""repeated absenteeism"" was not impacting them because in spite of it all, I got my work done. I put up a stink and went crying to the Ops manager who approved it. But then a day later I received an email from the VP saying going forward until I'm no longer in the negative they will deny ALL time off, which is allowed per the employee handbook.

Anyway, found out my emotions were at the max in April because I was pregnant! I took time off for ob/gyn appointments because they can't deny me that. Mid April I had an ultrasound that said they couldn't see an embryo and I might be miscarrying but to wait a few weeks in case my conception time is off. I had told this all to my supervisor and most of my coworkers knew. I didn't tell my manager yet.

Then May 2nd I was fired. I was such an emotiona, hormonal wreck that I didn't hear their reasoninf, I just kept screaming ""YOU CHOSE NOW? THIS WEEK OF ALL WEEKS!? YOU COULDN'T WAIT ONE WEEK!?"" since it was the week of my 'miscarriage or not' ultrasound. My supervisor and boss were there but HR wasn't. Boss explained he had their approval to terminate me without them present... But anyway, my supervisor did most of the talking. Said this wasn't an overnight decision, my attendance wasn't where it needed to be and I was behind on my work. Everyone is behind on their work there, some worse than me.

I told her to shove it up her ass and I stormed out. Grabbed my plant, sobbingly told my coworkers I was fired and I'd miss them, and left the building. My supervisor chased me down and told me I was in no condition to drive. I threw my badge at her and said it wasn't her problem anymore since she just FIRED ME.

I worked there for almost 4 years with no complaints. Four years of loving that job, my coworkers, the higher ups. It felt like a family atmosphere. Then they began hiring supervisors for departments that didn't need them and suddenly in 6 months I had three ""manager discussions"" and a write up which I even told them wasn't even partially me. Literally, they cited 2 instances of a failed thing. One instance I took responsibility for, the other was actually the girl who sat beside me. When I demanded they change it before I sign, the boss just stared at me and said ""well I can say you refused to sign it.""

Been a month of job searching, being told I have an embryo, and miscarrying anyway. I miss my coworkers. I miss my friends in the other departments. I wish they never hired that fucking supervisor but I know she's just a mouthpiece and the true villain is my boss. He was my third boss since they used to promote from within and he just never took to me I guess, despite always being nice.

4 years, down the drain. All because I got sick and took time off to heal."

I work there for around 2 years, I got this job due to my involvement in the firm (during internship so to say). I love everyone that I work close with, I love this place and I really try to be helpful and carry out my duties, but I got reprimanded. Why you may ask? Due to lack of involvement in my new position (even tho I still have my ""old"" duties).

Let me explain. So the branch that I started out don't have enough positions to make my job stable, they've organised a training and 1,5 month internship for me to just get the grip of what I will be responsible for. My management promised more training since the 1,5 month is insufficient (due to specification of the work that I'm doing). There was no more training. I'm working at this new position 3 days a week, and 2 days at my old one, but they still pressing me to work more in each of them. Managment often plans tasks that need more people than is available, so I need to work in my second position during the time that I should work in the new one (and vice versa). Sometimes I work during weekends and holidays just to get everything done. It makes me not giving 100% of my attention to any of them which they see as lack of commitment and poor planning skills. Management still haven't provided me with necessary supplies (workwear, cleaning products and other more or less relevant equipment). I paid for those myself, I paid for further courses, I'm working overtime even tho they don't pay for those. Overworking led me to making some mistakes so I got reprimanded, and I was told that they have an eye for me and I could be either demoted or fired. Am I the problem? I know that I can't live like this for much longer but I don't see any way out. "

Full timers work every weekday of the year, while part timers don't work summer/fall/winter breaks. I chose part time for personal reasons (fully aware of the risks and loss of money) and won't be elaborating.

Some time ago, they announced they'd be getting rid of all part time positions forever, but that pre-existing part time workers wouldn't experience any changes. They had the option to opt into full time if they wanted, but it was not mandatory.

I'm handed my evaluation this week, and tacked at the bottom, I'm informed that I will be starting full time hours effective the start of the school year. I'm then told that every other part timer has been or will be told the same thing. I said I didn't consent to it, and the head just shrugged and said that it was ""better for the computers"" if every employee worked the same amount of days.

I'm not even entirely mad about the change of days worked because i was going to opt in after the fall anyway. I am, however, extremely pissed off about being told I have a choice and then having that taken from me. I'm a bit stupid and don't know much about workplace stuff, but this just doesn't feel right to me at all. Its not what I or anyone else agreed to when we signed up for this job."

So i started a new job in retail just as a ""stylist"" for a semi-small piercing and jewelry store in the mall. When I applied and did the interview they said the job mostly involved picking jewelry for customers, piercings, and the regular retail activities plus some merchandising. 

I've been working retail for a few years now and know how these environments work. However my first day, I was trained on wayyyy more jobs than I thought. I was given training on manager duties such as bank logs and deposits, as well as communicating with other stores about merchandising and sales and more. I have NEVER heard of a retail job requiring associates to do these types of tasks,  and when I asked about they said ""oh well we don't have alot of people so everyone is trained on everything."" So then I was thinking if we all have to do manager roles that were NOT listed in my job description and are over my pay rate why should I stay and give them all my energy. On top of that the girl who trained me was an associate and she tells me this is only her second week and she works alone and she doesn't know much either. Then when I am leaving another girl comes in and tells me she had a mental breakdown and cried throughout her first week but ""it gets better""??? I was like what the hell is going on in this store?

This week I met a few other people in the mall too who told me corporate and the company is very shady as well as others on reddit who quit because the company is crap.

My second shift is this monday and I am absolutely DREADING working Memorial Day there and have been thinking of not showing up. Would I be wrong to quit this way or should I give a headsup that this is entirely not the right environment for me."

It was possible to be rehired for some positions, but I lost out on the job that was replacing my job to a friend (and someone I supervise).

Funny because the hiring/general manager has no degree and the assistant manager just got his degree 1 week ago. Even the guy hired thinks it's a fucking dumb reason to hire him. 

The company is going to shit, it's grossly in debt, and corporate is cutting store hours even more after the layoffs take place. The store in general is going to be a lot more short staffed while handling even more services.

its so annoying to me because in the last 3yrs or so ive had this job, its been a great time. little pressure from management and working with people that i now genuinely call friends, whether they are still working with me or not. from sometimes being genuinely excited to go to work i now dread it. whenever Bob is around i feel hostility, and uncomfortable doing the same job ive been doing. im scared hes gonna find any little reason to call me out and ‚Äú‚Äùhave a talk‚Äù‚Äù as he already did TWICE just during my shift earlier tonight.

Also apparently my schedule was actually Tuesday-Saturday, but at the same time they were trying to make this work for another person in a different position -forcing my position to be M-F. i get. i get. but this lack of communication is making me nervous if i continue working here.

I‚Äôm just so anxious and so depressed. I slept 12+ hours these last few days. the thought of of going back makes me so sick my stomach hurts and i just wanna sleep. but the more i sleep, the more time wasted and the faster it feels that i‚Äôll be back at work.

I mainly do not like that I was lied to. perhaps i can let go and get over it, but being sick and anxious doesn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôve felt this way since day one (before i knew about my schedule change)  also i‚Äôm already looking at other jobs that i qualify for.. which im noticing get paid more

also i was pushed to start this job ASAP. i get it, but highly important paper hadn‚Äôt gone through yet. if i didn‚Äôt tell them this, i feel like they would‚Äôve had me working in a safety position that could have caused a ton of problems for me and the company if something went wrong.

I have been working as a barista for some months, and I actually REALLY like the drink making aspect of it, especially making latte art, which is what I wish I could have been doing for more hours of the day during the shift.

But the manager at that workplace is the textbook example of what capitalism does to you. He would make you work 6 days a week, for 9-10 hours, because no one wants to work for him and he is incapable of finding staff as well. Everyone hates him. People even admit to being in love with the work itself, but are leaving JUST because of him. He would often threaten us with fines whenever we wouldn't be following his 100s of nonsensical rules set in place. He is controlling, and legit spends 8 hours a day at work AND also looks at the cameras at home. Talk about Big Brother. This position that he has gotten is his WHOLE life and he even admitted at some points that he would give me days off work just so I could work more later, not cause he actually cared about me being ill.

I had enough of it when he fined me for NOT COMING TO WORK because I was so overwhelmed and stressed from both the work and personal life issues. In the last 40 days I have spent 4 days being ill, even though I am sure even my body is demanding more rest as well. And he ended the massage with: If you don't show up tomorrow, the fine will become bigger.

When I tell you that I started FUMING. And you can most likely see it as well through this post. I straight up refuse to ever work under anyone like this ever again, or under anyone in general. I know that being self employed has It's own set of troubles and issues, but I don't mind THE WORK. I mind the work environment, bosses, managers, the whole horrible system from the bottom up.

I will be 100% honest with myself in this confession. I have always been an artistic person who has just been aftaid of following their dreams, ideas, and projects. So I have been stuck working at some places that are just not for me, and ended up with what is the biggest PUSH to live the life that I want. Which was this whole situation at work. So this message is to anyone who has the means to take risks and has somewhat stable support system, PLEASE go for it. The world needs more creative, passionate people, new ideas, different movements. We legit all need you, and even If things don't change for the next centuries, everything starts with small acts of rebellion. And creation IS rebellion. Creation goes against what is, for something new to be born.

I know I have gotten really passionate in this post, but for fucks sake, If this isn't just another sign for myself and for someone else, then I don't know what will be.

I believe in all of you.

Good luck, and stay passionate. "

So, I work at this mid-sized company where the upper management acts like they're gods or something. Last month, they made this massive mistake in handling a project that led to a significant client pulling out. The whole department had to pull double shifts to make up for the loss, and it was just brutal. People were stressed, overworked, and the morale was in the gutter.

Instead of acknowledging their mistake and maybe compensating us for the extra hours we put in, what does the CEO do? He rolls up in a brand new supercar. Yep, you read that right. The guy shows up in this flashy, bright red Ferrari. And he has the audacity to park it right in front of the building, as if to rub it in our faces.

It‚Äôs not just the car, though. It's the sheer lack of empathy. We‚Äôre busting our asses trying to clean up a mess that wasn‚Äôt even our fault, and he‚Äôs out there flaunting his new toy. No apologies, no bonuses, not even a thank you. Just a shiny new car and a smug smile.

This is the kind of thing that makes me lose faith in corporate America. We‚Äôre the ones doing all the hard work, and they‚Äôre the ones reaping all the rewards. It‚Äôs infuriating. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the fact that he‚Äôs probably getting a massive bonus while we‚Äôre struggling to get a decent raise.

The whole situation just reeks of entitlement and greed. It‚Äôs like they live in a different world where the consequences of their actions don‚Äôt affect them at all. And the worst part? We‚Äôre supposed to be grateful to even have a job. How did we get to this point where this kind of behavior is acceptable?

I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm seriously considering my options. I can‚Äôt keep working in an environment where we‚Äôre treated like expendable resources while they get to play around with their luxury toys. It‚Äôs time for a change, and I‚Äôm ready to make a move. If anyone has any advice on how to handle this situation or knows of any companies that actually value their employees, I‚Äôm all ears.

Thanks for letting me vent. I needed that."

Boss rarely meets with me, but does with everyone else.

We haven't had a good one on on meeting since my interview. (She had hired me on the spot)

Don't get feedback on task until weeks later if lucky 

Boss outsourced without telling me for a few task I was brought in for. Probably because they had to do with her products and not the other clients we work for. Which showed how much she trust me? Like why hire me? 

People also sometimes outsource me, so I get it. I prefer that. But I hoped she saw the great deal she was getting by having me do tons of work at a lower rate compared to what I would normally charge my clients.

She also brought in someone that does similar tasks as me, which is cool, but I'm not sure if she told this employee to manage me? Cause she acts like it. 

Again, no communication.

Boss rarely communicates with me. And when she does it's usually through groups chats/apps when pissed about something I already completed. I think she just enjoys calling people out for stuff in group chats.


Boss stopped assigning task for weeks now.

Boss sent others to tell me that my entire job description would basically change. I requested a meeting about that weeks ago. Nothing.

(Also my job description didn't really change. They just added tons and tons more to it. Like answering phones for stuff I wasn't trained for, but still manage because I have experience in customer care. But now many employees don't bother answering calls and wait for me to do it. 

Everyone at the office thinks they're my boss and give me lots of non constructive criticism.

Everyone ask me for help. Even the other offices out of the country. And I don't mind helping. 

I do multiple jobs. Many I didn't sign up for. 

The pay stays the same. We haven't met about that after first 30 days like she mentioned.

I'm always the first one for a good hour at the office at the time we open.

I sometimes am sent out to travel for the company and I'm expected to compete several tasks. Hardly get lunch breaks. 


They're ""hr"" virtual person who has no contact or name? Lterally went back and edited/reduced my hours recently because they felt like. At least that's the manager told me. They entered breaks where I didn't take breaks.

 Example, for whatever reason, they decided on one day to look at cameras and saw I left office, but was still clocked in....I was in the next room working....after hours...

We also don't get OT. Only some employees. They have erased my OT hours as well in the past.

I need full time money for medical expenses, housing / moving in a few months to a cheaper place, food, etc.

A coworker, she‚Äôs a team lead (HA) who doesn‚Äôt like me (manager asked why she doesn‚Äôt like me and her response was ‚Äú I just don‚Äôt,‚Äù) sabotages it by dumping handfuls of unnecessary packets on top. 

I generally don‚Äôt fix the things that she messes up but I was bored today plus I need proof of it for HR. I talked to the manager about it and she said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how we have always done it.‚Äù I replied something like, ‚Äúif it needs to be replenished I understand but if there‚Äôs no need to do that, it feels intentional.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt even mind if someone dumps them in there IF it needs to be replenished because I don‚Äôt expect everyone to have them stacked nicely and all facing the right direction but it hardly needs that. 

For context, there are at least 100 packets in each section the way I do it. We may sell 10 coffees a day on a good day. Normally we may sell 5 or 6. There is no need for 200 packets for be stuffed in there. 

We also sell lighters of course and I made them
color coordinated so people could see all of the colors and choose the color they want. I come back and someone dumped them and made them all jumbled again. I did it twice and she did it twice.

To paint a better picture of what she is like, two days ago they were training a new manager and apparently she thought the new manager was staring at her so she confronted the manager and said something to make the manager quit first day. I could go on with stories but I wanted to give context so you can see the type of person I‚Äôm working with.

While I enjoyed some of the people I worked with at Tesla¬†the work environment was abhorrent. I started in 09/2021 with Tesla, at what I thought was a merit based environment. What I've found was that your merit is only as good as the leader vouching on behalf of that merit. I've found this out when my first year at the company I was told I should be happy where i'm at for a 25 year old as I was skipped over for a promotion that was given to others based on their age and merit in OTHER COMPANIES not this one. The same leader who told me this was an alcoholic and made disgusting sexual remarks. I know he was an alcoholic as I lost count at the amount of times I've smelled alcohol on his breath, watched him nap in his car, hide behind cars late night while drinking a miniature only for him to see it was my car when I unlocked it. While I would like to say I emailed HR and this was resolved, it went more like i emailed HR had a meeting and nothing came from it. this manager hid behind others performance and claimed it as his own while pushing his faults and loses onto said same employees. He was moved to another location where he continued to drink while at work (every tech and sales employee at this locaiton could smell it everyday) and do everything listed above, except this time he crashed a performance model 3 INSIDE a showroom. this manager knew I had reported him multiple times so when my fiance started employment at this company (which I had advised against) he had tried making her life miserable. From being put on a performance improvement plan after less than 2 months of being there, little to no training and still being top of the leaderboard in her store to being written up for being 5 minutes late a couple times while others were coming in close to an hour late every single shift. she quit as she could not handle it anymore. during my 3 years of employment they moved me from sales to delivery my 2nd quarter with the company to help with delivery CSAT after which asking me why my sales had dropped. I was then asked to move into a mobile technician position to help the mobile team pick up some of the backlog (they thought since I had previous experience working on cars I could do it) and I did that for about 6 months ( mind you throughout all these changes I was never once promoted, had a change of title, or a change of pay) I still had a silver linings attitude and was willing to do any job as I believe that's what makes a good leader. after this I was then moved back to delivery as CSAT took a hit and they needed to recover. for my last 6 months at Tesla I was moved back to my retail sales location where we got a new manager who boasted about not caring about anything and he cant get fired all they can do is make him a TA5 which he claimed he would love as he would get paid more. him not doing his job made ours 100 times more frustrating with dealer tags being stolen, test drive cars taken by employees for multiple days, etc.. I was frustrated and just wanted to do my job normally so me and another tenured teammate agreed it was best to report the tags stolen and get new ones as well as alerting all neighboring store locations incase they had the tags. We had essentially taken over his role while our leader was messaging customers for us (even though no one wanted him to because they were there and if he got to them first it meant we werent quick enough and should be happy about him helping us) for christmas eve I was leaving work at 10 pm and saw 2 of ours tags hanging still and to avoid them being stolen the next day while we were closed I took them home with me. I knew I shouldve reached out but I was tired stressed and in my mind if he had a question about the tags he would reach out to the person helping him with tags his entire time at the company. I got back the next day on tuesday and put the tags back but saw a new employee hop on her phone in a hurry and run outside (this new manager had hired her and 3 others from his old job and had been trying to manage us through her even though she had only been there 1 week and was still being trained at a position below everyone else's) months later he asked me to step in the office and then asked me to join a meeting with HR and left the room. they asked me a bunch of general questions, and I knew then I was in the process of being let go. a month goes by and I convince myself I'm not getting fired, tell my manager I found a really good deal on tacoma (so good anyone would take the price and APR in a heartbeat) but for some reason he kept insisting on me not buying the truck. I talked to 2 of the people he hired that night as I was friends with one and the other one called me to ask about how the car show went. I explained it was great but I was upset I had left my backpack at the dc location. They both tried getting me back my backpack that night harder then I cared to try and I had thought that was weird. The next day at work I had told my manager If anyone from DC was coming to our location today to let me know so they can bring my back pack over. He said no but would let me leave a bit earlier later in the day to grab it then disappeared. He came back about 30 minutes later and asked to have a meeting and discussed HR concluded their investigation and I was no longer employed as of that moment. He also explained he got my back pack ubered over and handed it to me. Through out my 3 years at this company everyone I've worked with was in constant fear of getting fired and major anxiety about being liked by ""the right people"". I'm sure they would try to discredit everything I'm saying by saying i'm not a top performer but you can't be a top performer in a rigged game. Managers transferred sales into TAs names to give sales to people they liked the most and called them ""top performers"" there were real top performers but for some reason they never get anywhere at this company. Another rule is they forbade people from getting virtual sales but selectively enforce this law. while we only had a sales license for the state of maryland you would find fake ""top performers"" consistently selling virtually in other states (texas, florida, etc..) which I'm pretty sure is illegal. The goal was for every TA to have 6 sales ops captured a day, 5 test drives a day, and 2 car sales a day with no thought going into how this would be accomplished, how we could do it consistently week over week, how we could do this and not ignore customers after they place their $250 order deposit. to say working at tesla was disappointing would be an understatement. There is a saying that little people with a little bit of power are the biggest tyrants and I witnessed that first hand at this company. I hope nothing but the best for all advisors at this company and hope leadership holds themselves to the same standards they hold their teams. I dont think a lawsuit would do anything but just wanted to share my experience.

P.S i left out al lot for the sake of space and time."

Sure, some may end up financially secure after busting ass for decades, but they might not live long enough to enjoy their yachts. Or they might end up with awesome health insurance from their employers, and maybe they will be able to afford healthy food and live long. 

It‚Äôs just sad that so many people are willing to constantly work, work, work. They seem to enjoy the struggle. I don‚Äôt understand the mindset. It seems masochistic to me. 

For context, I grew up being told that ‚Äúidle hands are the devil‚Äôs workshop ‚Äú. Well, the devil, according to the Bible, never killed anyone. God did, after telling humans to not kill.

For what it's worth I'm college educated, have steady employment history, and would have a clean background check/drug test if performed.

Is anyone else having similar experience? Why do employers list open jobs if they aren't interested in contacting applicants? I'm staring to take it personally at this point which really stinks, it's all such a beat down!

I started out as a package handler and after a few months was promoted to two positions higher. 

I started working for a different manager and things were going well for a few months. After a while the manager started asking me to scan things in the system saying we return them even though we didn't. This would happen when we couldn't find an item. The items were then returned the next day. Side note, this only happened with items from a particular manufacturer we had a contract with.

One day I was asked to scan in three large items saying that we place them on the truck. I did as asked. Around that time I had a health scare and found some lumps on my chest. I am a male but the doctors were concerned enough to tell me to come in. Over the course of a few months I saw several doctors and specialist as they thought there was a possibility it was cancer. 

I took time off using my sick time. Most of the sick time was only for a few hours and I would come into work late. All of these hours were pre-approved weeks in advance or so. 

For some reason my manager starts getting upset with me and singling me out and picking on me. She then decided to write me up stating that if I took or use any more sick time that I would be terminated. All of this was in writing. 

Now I'm pretty good with the law, so I asked for a copy of the write-up. She told me she wasn't allowed to give that to me. A few hours later she ended up giving it to me. For the next few weeks I started noticing she would put me on a performance plan, watch my every move, write me up for weird things even though other employees were doing the same stuff I don't weren't necessarily breaking the rules. 

Part of my job was running a safety team. I tried to set a meeting with the people under me but was told by the general manager to just wait and give them a break. That's when I realized I was going to be terminated soon. 

I decided to reach out to HR and ask for a transfer due to issues with my boss. I tried to get ahead of it to see if I can save my job. I that I will be having a meeting with HR and management that following Monday. Now I knew I was being terminated as the HR lady wasn't going to drive 2 hours for some normal meeting that can be done over the phone. 

Now as I said I'm pretty good with the law so I knew that her writing me up for using my sick time was illegal. I spent that Friday going through the email server pulling up every single email where my boss told me to scan packages as in being returned. I also spent the day finding every email and text messages from my boss asking me to do things that were against policy and whatnot. 

Come Monday I get called into the office. They said that I'm being terminated because I scanned some items saying they were on a truck and they were never returned. I explained to them that I know for a fact these items were returned due to their very very large size. They explained that it didn't matter and that I scanned it as returned and it wasn't returned that day. 

I then looked at HR and told her that my boss had asked me to do that. Of course my boss denied everything. But little did they know........ I had documents because I documented everything from the time I started there. I gave them printed out a text messages and emails from my boss with everything she's ever said to me that broke policy, laws, etc. 

Right on top was the email or she told me about these very large packages and what to do with them. The dirty looks HR in the general manager gave her where priceless. She stood there in shock she had just got caught in a lie. 

I also explained that she wrote me up for using sick time that she approved, and that I still had over 10 hours of sick time left. I also showed them the printout of the law that says I am allowed to use my sick time. Of course I included the emails where she approved my sick time. They looked at her again and her face went even more pale. 

They still decided to terminate me which I can't be too upset because I knew I was breaking the rules Even though I was being asked you by my boss. Side note I didn't break any laws. 

A few days later I filed a complaint with the department of Labor. About a month later HR from that company reached out and tried to ask me more questions. Of course I ignored them. About a year later the department of Labor finish their investigation and found that the company did break the law. The company decided to settle And we settled for a good chunk of change more than I would have made if I hadn't missed the time from work. 

Now because I was very good with management when I was there, i knew their policy regarding lawsuits and settlements. Any lawsuit or department of Labor complaint that ends with a settlement or the company being found liable will result in immediate termination of that particular employee and their manager if they are aware of the issue. 

So not only did I receive a nice chunky change but that manager was terminated and blacklisted. I was able to confirm this anonymously. 

Well that's all, if your company wants to fuck you over don't be afraid to do the same to them."

I am hired as remote, so they sent me a laptop and a docking station. They don‚Äôt bother sending a mouse, keyboard, monitors, or anything else to actually use the dock or laptop in an actual workstation setting. Luckily I had monitors and a keyboard already so it wasn‚Äôt a cost, but I had to purchase a mouse myself. 

I am required to travel as well as part of the job, yet they don‚Äôt provide a laptop bag to carry the computer in along with the charger, yet I‚Äôm expected to protect the laptop and carry it around, so now I have to purchase a laptop bag as well. 

Then, on the rare occasion I need to go to the office, their dress code is business casual. This means now I have to spend even more money on collared shirts and nicer pants - which comes at a higher price than normal everyday clothing. 

Finally, I am expected to set up Duo security on my own phone, which now means that my personal device is just apparently theirs to use to protect their own accounts instead of figuring it out themselves.

I pled guilty to ensure my family's safety, despite having no prior trouble beyond a few speeding tickets. Since then, I've worked in finance, mainly in project and engineering roles, and have never faced any legal issues again.

I've had three jobs since the incident without disclosing my past, and I believe only one did a background check, by which point I had already proven my work ethic as a 1099 contractor.

Now, I'm applying for a position I really want with a real estate group. I've made it past the final interviews, and I'm confident this company will conduct a background check.

Should I disclose my past arrest? If so, when and how should I do it to ensure the best possible outcome? Does the nature of my work in finance and project management, which requires a high level of trust, change how I should approach this? Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated."

I thought it would be a better opportunity for a more career-oriented role, more money, benefits, etc in exchange for having to work in the office. 

I fucked up guys.

In the last year I've had training that amounts to ""just try it and ask if you have questions"" (reminder, I review loans, so you can guess how great that training has been for me). The specific team I'm on has 2 people plus a manager, and they treat us like the garbage pool of the department. Have a task ypu don't want to do? Throw it at them! 

On top of that stress I'm now spending from 7am to 6pm outside the house either driving to, being at, or driving home from work. I'm a very nervous driver and the weather here has been torrential storms and tornado city for well over a month. By the time you factor in getting ready for work and making dinner afterwards I spend from 530am to 730pm Monday-Friday before I get a moment to do anything at all not work related, amd I'm too exhausted to do anything, much less look for another job.

They refuse outright to send home a coworker who is constantly sick (has coughed nonstop to the point of vomiting and peeing themselves multiple times a day, comes in with a fever, won't even wear a mask). I've had covid and countless smaller illnesses from them. Right now I'm on day 11 of my 2nd serious respiratory illness in a month and still cannot get a full breath. I've been to the doctor 3 times and missed 10 days of work.

I'm at my wits-fucking-end. I've done probably 200 applications in the last couple of months and heard nothing back. I'm on the verge of just quitting on the spot but I don't have any savings to fall back on. The company refuses to allow work from home even though we are literally remote from our cubicles.

269,2024-05-26,story time: I finally snapped after the evil boss screamed in my face.,u/warinmymind94,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d1hidi/story_time_i_finally_snapped_after_the_evil_boss/,antiwork,"Tldr: worked for a retail company in a management position for over a year. Evil boss retaliated at me for months and screamed in my face - I walked out. 

Before taking the job, I had health issues that left me struggling for money. I was vulnerable and my roomate helped me find a part time job at a retail store. I took it, because the other jobs were taking too long, I couldn't afford to keep looking. 

I did an ""okay"" job, but always made sure to show up and always was clean and presentable to work. I made sure not to go above and beyond, I didn't rush myself, I made sure to not catch onto stuff too quick. I was quiet, kept to myself, and only made small, friendly talk. No one knew much about me or my personal life - just how it was supposed to be. I actually really started to like my coworkers and they all really liked me. Work started to become overall on the enjoyable side, and some coworkers were especially entertaining. 

I needed the money, so I'd pickup extra hours when possible. It wasn't much but I was able to still, barely pay my bills. 

Then I was offered a promotion - better pay, different location, full time hours and some benefits. Seeing as how much I was still struggling to make ends meet, my situation put me in the position to have to accept it. I still dreamed of going back to selling things full time on ebay, but I just simply didn't have extra money to get inventory and I didn't have enough time to grow my store back to a livable income. So I took the promotion and met my new boss. We will call them the ""HM"" aka the ""heat miser"". If you've seen a year without a Santa Claus, this person looked and acted just like the heat miser.... she was too much. 

At first, the HM and new job seemed doable. The HM seemed especially friendly and overly happy for my arrival. The HM trained me to work according to ""her standards"". The 2nd week she showed me more, and I immediately became concerned at how lax her standards were - they were not following anything that we supposed to do, and her standards were things that could get me in trouble. I told her I was hesitant and that I would be trying to do things up to the real standards. 

Very quickly, I started coming into work and noticed that there were messes left, things not done, and safety issues left for me to handle. I'd contact her to let her know this was happening and that I needed to spend extra time fixing them to have a store that we could safely have customers in. I realized it was her and noticed that whenever she was ""working"" she was always sitting on her bum, scrolling on her phone, and talking to her friends and husband. I would go to the HM with questions or to ask that I was doing things correctly, and to just get feedback my projects. She never lifted a finger and never gave me training or coaching like she was supposed to. Every time the HM would act bothered and dismiss me, saying ""its fine, just do whatever.""

The messes started to get worse. The HM got lazier by the day, and grumpier. She had a coworker she loved to pick on and would frequently yell at. The coworker was disabled and didn't understand everything and struggled to do their tasks, respectfully. The HM began trash talking him and then would take advantage of him, making him pick up all her slack. Then she'd flip out on him even when he didn't do anything wrong. She gave him dirty, hard, jobs and then micromanaged him and nitpicked his every move. He became more and more confused and upset, but would then work harder to try to win back her approval. This became a viscious cycle. 

The schedule changed then and I hardly saw the HM. shed touch base with me, but I maybe only saw her once a week and it was brief. The store started to dramatically improve under my reign. I had taken the coworker she bullied under my wing, and worked with him a lot. He was a wonderful person and a good employee and we accomplished so much. The customers were loving the store and loved to come in and see us. Sales went up. I created a rapport then with all my coworkers and looked out for them and became good buddies with all of them. I especially looked out for the younger ones, because they'd tell me how bad of situations they were in and how they needed the job and how the HM would be mean to them. 

More and more, my coworkers started requesting to only WORK when I was scheduled. Its not like we goofed off either. We got a ton done, and we did a great job. One coworker actually complained to me that the HM wouldn't give them anything to do and that they were bored during their shifts. Same coworker also said the HM was never working always on personal calls and goofing off and that the HM would trash talk about the one coworkers disabilities to them and other employees. I advised them to report it. I also reported it. Nothing seemed to be done. 

I noticed then that I never was scheduled with that coworker again. Someone called out and when I went to call them asking if they could cover, the HM said I was not allowed to ask them. The HM effectively separated us. The HM made an ofd handed remark that she wanted me working alone and hired a new coworker so I couldn't coach/train the disabled employee. She started firing anyone that enjoyed working with me the moment they got sick or had a car problem. 

Then a higher up visited the store and told me that they wanted to further promote me - giving me the same job that the HM had. They proceeded to scold the HM and I overheard that. The higher up though praised me and was very happy with my work. It wasn't that I worked hard - im lazy af - but I know how to make things look really good and I was a master of delegating tasks and asking for help with things. Thats how the store always looked good. I also stayed out of people's way, and generally gave the customers what they asked for, so no one complained about me. 

But the HM became sinister. She started getting more and more in trouble and started telling others how she was at risk for getting fired. I was her biggest threat. She started always being at work- Every single day, she basically lived there. But still, she never lifted a finger and did any actual work. She recruited other employees to cover up her mistakes and took work and literally threw it away. 

She wouldn't let me stay home or go to the Dr when I was sick. She wouldn't let anyone call out. She'd try firing them. She started giving more and more hours to the two worst, meanest, laziest coworkers that were basically mini versions of her. Nothing was getting done. These minions of hers would give the customers awful times, were rude, lied to them, hassled them, and would even make degrading comments. When I finally got to witness it, I finally was able to create a write up for the minion. The HM flipped out on me and defended the minion. My coworker who had just about the same amount of authority /similar position as me said the minion needed to be written up, they'd get multiple complaints and the minion was frequently rude and didn't listen to them. 

I started wanting to quit then. I made an escape plan. I cut back on expenses and started looking for someone as a roomate. Saving money was almost impossible though. I an every changing schedule I was always getting it changed last minute, being threatened to get fired if I couldn't be ""flexible"" and when I'd report or call anyone else I was ignored. The job left me so exhausted- it took all my time and energy. I would barely get a day off even so it was just to sleep in, then run errands, pay bills, and try to do chores as my house kept getting messier as I never had energy to keep up. I became a wage slave. I struggled to find time to apply and couldn't get off for interviews. The ones I did go to, didn't lead to getting hired. I felt trapped in retail hell. 

I needed time off. I lied and told the HM I had ""appointments"" that were related to my scary medical problems of the past. She huffed but I said I can't show up this day, and I already have coverage. She said okay but then retaliated. She lied to me about my benefits and hassled me to use any. I had to call higher ups to fight for them, while job hunting, while apartment hunting, while trying to save a buck. 

Even the customers all started saying I was being exploited and that I should take the HM job. They all hated her too!

I compromised with myself and scheduled vacation time. She tried messing with that too I had to keep watching her and making calls, fighting to use the benefits given to me. 

She lied about the days I had off and ended up calling me in then, changed around my schedule. At this point, I had a place and roomage lined up, and I had a small inheritance that was coming. I knew I could finally have my chance to get out. 

I ended up going in in my one day off after she threatened about my other days off. I covered for her and did the dirty work that day. We were in the midst of finishing up and had just started the clean up phase. She decided to randomly show up to work and walked in. Something had fallen, and like I said, we had just started cleaning up. There was another mess we had just started on. I literally had a mop in my hand. Coworker has getting the rest of the supplies. 

Thats when she stared at me, and before I could even greet her, she just SCREAMED at me. Screamed about how the place was falling apart (after me and one other employeee covered a 6 person job alone! After how him and me both came in on our day off, after we just finished the massive project, and we were cleaning up the things that happened- that weren't even our fault). She didn't ask, she didn't let me speak, she never let me or him explain. She just screamed at me and degraded me in front of him. I threw down the broom and just walked off. I went out to wash my hands quick (they were nasty from the tasks) and then I headed to grab my stuff and I heard her trash talking me to all the other employees. 

I didn't think twice. My coworker appeared who I just did the project with and he was saying something but no one of it registered. I told him he wouldn't see me again and he also grabbed his stuff and he walked out. As I was walking out, I saw a glimpse of the HM one last time - she was sitting on her bum, now on the phone with her friend, and I heard her talking very loudly about how awful I am and how messy I made things and how I just ""let it be"" like that. 

I walked out. Called hr, got paid out for everything. Three more people quit then when I left. More people reached out to me, saying they heard nasty things from her about me and saying none of it sounded like me. They begged me to go back, to transfer locations, etc. 

After the sheer disrespect and exploitation for such low wages I could barely pay my bills on, i would honestly rather move back with parents or live out of my car than to deal with being a wage slave for an awful company that doesn't listen when you complain, that doesn't properly staff, that lies, steals, and covers up the actual theft of bosses including the HM. 

IF you have to work, lie so you aren't available, don't be flexible, and only work part time. Seriously do whatever you can to avoid working for this messed up modern day wage slavery system. It really is designed to keep you broke and dependent on It, you won't be able to save up or work a 2nd job, you won't have time and every to look for a different job. You will only exist to work and pay bills so that you can continue to keep working for them. They will demand more and more of you but won't pay a dime more. 

I will never judge anyone for doing whatever they can to avoid this system as much as possible. I will instead applaud that they can avoid it. God speed to you if you've read all this."

I've read so many of your stories and I know that quitting and changing direction is not an option. Keep being angsty.

At the same time, I hope you all keep striving. Make sure you don't work so hard at your job that you don't have time for yourself. Challenge the realities set for you by friends, coworkers and bosses.

I live in NYC. I was a food delivery guy for a long time. Many roommates, many hungry nights. But I was young and had a dream of being a comedian. 

Through the years I was able to gain some connections for advertising writing gigs through comedy. But even then, I wasn't out of the hell of corporate culture and BS. I was lucky enough to have a few mentors who taught me how to build an LLC and start billing as an independent contractor. Even now, I still have to rage at the work culture and societal expectations of working class people. Costs of living, etc. 

My point isn't ""If I can make it, so can you."" Not at all. I'm insanely lucky and would hardly say I've made it. I don't own a car or a home. I hardly have any savings. I just get to ear and have a roof over my head and not work that much. 

Again, I'm bringing this up not to say it's possible for anyone, but rather to point out that the establishment makes it so fucking impossible that you have to fight to learn the rules. You have to challenge social norms and demands and question what people are asking of you. Negotiate. Know your worth. Don't work for sycophants, and if you have to, find a way out.

We all have the power, both individually and collectively, to bargain for a better tomorrow. 

Don't ever stop fighting, or dreaming. I appreciate you all!"

I wanted to ask what your thoughts were on a united effort to push employers to offer more work at home options. During covid it seemed like a lot of progressive thinking and discussions were happening about allowing employers to work hybrid or remote. Unfortunately people were weary and did not want to push too hard, rather they wanted to return. And employers definitely took notice of the lack of pushing and began to quickly demand returns to the office. 

I'm wondering what your thoughts are on restarting a movment and larger labor discussion about a ""post-work"" society? One that would cut down on commute exhaust pollution (isn't that what these good, climate change fighting companies want?). 

I think people underestimate how powerful the covid work at home time period was in terms of what can be accomplished and what companies are willing to offer their employees. "

I‚Äôm not tied down to the place because I live at home as a young adult, and if it really comes down to it I can just leave. It just sucks. The comment about my partner being selfish felt super unnecessary, especially when he‚Äôs had his life threatened multiple times. He‚Äôs not out playing patty cake, he‚Äôs almost died multiple times. He just wants to see his girl for two weeks before he gets shoved back out to get his life threatened for another 6 more months. Idk this all sucks and I‚Äôm having a breakdown over it.

To which I say: employers, you're not entitled to extra labor just because we finish our assigned tasks ahead of schedule.  We don't get any extra value out of you if we do more work.  We don't get an increase in our compensation.  We are not obligated to provide you with any value or effort beyond what's been agreed to upon hiring.

There's only two things which add value to the company: workers and customers.  Bosses and C-suite that don't have a hand in the actual day to day don't add value.  Ensuring that a contract agreement from 60 years ago continues doesn't add value.  Sitting idly by and reaping the benefits of someone else's efforts DOESN'T ADD VALUE.  Don't expect or demand ANY OF US to do twice the work for the same salary or hourly pay we're always getting, unless you're going to give it back to us in some way.

AND FOR THE RECORD BONUSES SHOULD NEVER BE APPENDED TO REGULAR PAYCHECKS; THAT SHIT GETS TAXED IF YOU DO."

I'm an European moving to another European country to finally live with my SO, and, everyone just says I'll find a job, specially because as a Developer because ""IT such a safe bet for getting a job"" because ""they want to hire people all the time"".

I am recently graduated and all I find are jobs asking for 3 years of experience I don't have, but I don't need, all because HR has to take an amount of years out of it's rear end. Nobody wants Juniors apparently, and less that only speak English and not the native language. Everyone says they do, and that I should ""relax"" but I just see few junior job offers. I've gotten either rejections before interviews or no reply at all.

I get that I don't know the native language, but what can I do? My SO is the one who has a roof and stable income, but they can't provide for themselves and me. 

I just feel betrayed and lied to. I've heard these constantly from everyone: ""You'll be making so much money as a developer"", ""you'll get hired instantly"" ""lots of young people like you move out all the time because opportunities are better outside"" and it seems it's all just lies.

I don't even care about how much I make. I just want to be able to live with my SO. Every internship I've been in says I'm an amazing coder/worker, I have a letter of recommendation from each. It's that not enough either?

All I get after each time I force myself to seek job offers is a head full of antiwork ideas (UBI, etc) and a deep frustration and sadness, which makes me want to try again less and less, and I don't know what to do anymore.  "

6,2024-05-27,What is the correct compromise?,u/Xerosese,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d1tk8r/what_is_the_correct_compromise/,antiwork,"So I've been job hunting since I left my previous workplace in 2021, and I've noticed an issue with the entire application system in general; It overwhelms both sides. I've send out hundreds of applications in this timeframe, filled out an excessive number of questions that could have been answered by reading my resume, and had many entire days wasted by potential employers that either ghosted me or shouldn't have bothered interviewing me in the first place. I have to send out so many applications to get even a single interview that I can't really put special effort into any of them, I kinda just have to spray and pray.  


On the other side of this, my mother used to manage a gas station convenience store in a relatively small, local franchise. They had less than thirty stores total, and only about 20 people in their office. They didn't even have a dedicated hiring manager for the office because it was too small. When they posted a listing for a partial remote job based in their office (I can't remember exactly what it was, something HR related) they received over *1700* applicants. Those are actual attempts to apply, *after* filtering out all the spam fake applications. If the person responsible for hiring someone (who again, had other responsibilities) spent just 10 minutes reading each resume, then it would have taken more than **35** work days, clock in to clock out, just to read them all.   


Naturally, they went with a filtering solution and added several of those insufferable questions to the application, just to make it realistic to go through them all. The problem is that these automated systems are *awful* and can't read resumes for shit. OCR isn't good enough to really use for this, especially since there is no formal standard for the format or even file type of resumes. An employer can end up with a mix of PDF, DOCX, HTML (for some reason) and web resumes, in a basically infinite number of possible layouts. OCR and ""AI"" tools simply can't adequately read resumes, and they shouldn't be used in the process until they can do so reliably. So they put in stupid, repetitive questions instead; There is no other realistic way to get all of that information in a way that can be consistently processed.  


So what is the solution here? The current system works for no one involved. Applicants have to send out hundreds of applications to even get noticed, and waste many hours answering the same questions over and over. Employers need a way to filter and process applications that isn't manual because applicants have to send so many applications that every job listing gets drowned. Right now, everyone loses. What's the actual compromise that can be made? Any ideas for what the company could have done differently? "

The title is a reference to ‚Äúno one wants to work these days‚Äù lol

I wanted to share my own anti work story. I was a full time cashier with too many men around me, and I needed an environment change. I had worked with children on the autism spectrum for 2 years prior to this, so I wanted to go back to childcare. 

I began to call different daycares nearby, and got an online interview with one. Awesome, right! They decided they liked the interview, and asked me to come in for a second interview. 

I go to them in person, and am instantly belittled. It was a different interviewer. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of current world events as I look middle eastern/of Islamic origin off the bat with my appearance, or if they didn‚Äôt like my vibe? But they were extremely belittling. I was asked about my high school diploma, I told them I have my college transcript as my high school doesn‚Äôt reply to my voicemails about mailing me my diploma (I graduated during covid). She goes back and forth with me about how if I don‚Äôt have a high school diploma, how am I even working right now, and etc. I‚Äôve never had an issue with employers, even got a job right now that I begin tomorrow (with benefits) as they verified my college transcripts, proving I graduated high school or at least had a GED to continue on to college. She began to be more interested when she asked for my experience in the past, and I explained my experience with children. It was a complete 180¬∞ shift. They went from considering me for part time as needed, to promising to give me full time hours. Okay, awesome. 

I complete the paperwork, spent $100 on fingerprinting (required in NYC as a background check through identogo) and emailed them all the paperwork within a week. I had to go to Staten Island, from Brooklyn, for this damn appointment. 

Once I submitted everything, I had absolutely no reply. I was waiting on their background check application with the department of mental health and hygiene to proceed with me. I finally got a reply when I was asked for additional signatures, but was informed no 2 year old‚Äôs had signed up for their program! Wtf? Why would you hire someone prematurely, promise them full time hours, present paperwork, make me sign stuff just to tell me there‚Äôs no work for me? Along with this, their wording was very odd. They had mentioned they had contracted workers from the department of education working with the older children. I didn‚Äôt ask. I guess they mentioned this to indirectly tell me I‚Äôm too under qualified to work for them. 

Okay, whatever. I got a new job after 2 interviews and begin tomorrow, so it all worked out anyway. But it‚Äôs so weird to me. Not only that, I had told them I spent $100 on fingerprinting and expressed how I felt it was all a bit unfair, asking if there‚Äôs anything else I could do to work for them, and they offered to reimburse me. Awesome, cool. Tell me why it took them 3 weeks to reply to my emails asking about the reimbursement, and once they finally replied, I got the check two days after they replied. 

All in all, it‚Äôs definitely a learning experience, and now I know which red flags to look for in employment search. It‚Äôs just, why interview me twice and make me sign and send all this paperwork, to just tell me since I‚Äôm not in a contract with the DOE I cannot work for you guys, for $1 above minimum wage in NYC? While initially I was upset, I laugh at it now. If I was an employer hiring, that‚Äôs one thing I would neverrr do‚Äî *promise* a job and not actually have anything lined up. Wtf is this business model? Lol

I graduated in 2020 and started a job at 2021 and decided to quit at 2022 due to horrible management.

I could not find a work for one year (this is normal in my country), but out of pure chance I applied for my dream job this February and got accepted. I signed the contract in April (the contract lasts for 6 months) . I get paid twice the minimal wage in my country, and the working environment is professional and friendly 

Today, I was informed that person whose job I was responsible for documenting (my job is basically based on this person) is leaving soon, and the company decided that the position for this person is no longer needed, which will directly impact my work

Lol to be honest I am in tears right now, it seems like whenever things start to get better and when I finally found a decent job, my life falls apart once again. If I lost this job, to be honest I don't think I have anything to live for anymore, this is the last straw 

I contacted the HR and told him to schedule a meeting for tomorrow so we cal discuss this, I can't sleep because I am horrified of him telling me that I will no longer be needed in the company.

I am beyond devastated, all I want is job security

If anyone can offer me any advice I would be really grateful "

Couldn't even get interviews, despite the fact that my CV is good (has been checked by recruitment services etc). I'm an immigrant and I've been told that here it's very much about who you know rather than what your experience is and I'd guess that's true - I applied for dozens upon dozens of jobs I'm more than qualified for and got rejected straight off the bat. I was eventually interviewed by a woman for a sales position. The retainer was next to nothing but I was promised I could make a tonne of money in commission. What followed was 8 months of unhinged insanity. My boss was a pathological liar. The work I was promised dried up a few months in. I'd get these crazy phone calls and nasty emails from my boss about completely bizarre stuff, where she'd get mad at me for doing stuff the way she told me to, or using templates she'd sent me to use. I finally had to quit 2 weeks ago for health reasons. The stress of my financial situation has caused some real neurological issues. I sent my resignation along with the invoice for the last 6 weeks of work and... nothing. I didn't even get a response from the owner about my resignation - they just cut off the access to the systems and my email. And, surprise surprise, they haven't paid the invoice. It's not even a huge amount - less than ‚Ç¨500. I'm so angry and upset right now. I haven't been able to pay rent since December and now here I am... right back to where I was just over 2 years ago except now all my savings are drained. I signed back on to unemployment but the system takes a while to grind through the gears and it's one of those systems where if they offer you two ""reasonable"" jobs and you don't take them, you don't get any unemployment cover. Except now I have these debilitating neurological issues that I'm still trying to see specialists for but the waiting times are months, so they might not even take them into account when assigning me jobs they consider reasonable.

I don't even know where to go from here. I just needed to vent."

I changed companies recently from one small regional bank to another.  My usual location at this company has 8:15 am to 5:15 pm M-F work days with 1 hour unpaid (our own time, supposed to be uninterrupted) lunch breaks.  I will be covering at another branch in the area tomorrow.  Their hours that day are different, so I will be working 8:15am -4:15pm.  This leaves a half hour lunch break for this workday.  There are only two tellers scheduled at all for any day.  I hear thru the company talk that the teller I will be working with gets really passive aggressive if you leave the premises for lunch.  But I have an errand to run while I am in the area tomorrow and 100% plan on using my personal time to accomplish this.  Get mad if I don‚Äôt get back in time, then I have caused a problem. 

Tomorrow in general is going to be interesting.  The other two times I was scheduled to be there I was removed from the schedule.  I heard from co-workers that she (the teller I will be working with tomorrow) threw a fit about working with someone ‚Äúnew‚Äù.  My position tho is a float teller.

",u/gaycat21,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d1w5zo/i_have_unprocessed_trauma_from_my_last_workplace/,antiwork,"for context, I worked at this startup as my first job. I left it around a year ago. I was in operations and even though, the PTO and WFH policies were great, I was highly depressed while working there. I had applied for the job since the JD emphasised on a lot of growth opportunities within the company and traveling was a perk! It looked so great on paper, I was ecstatic when I got the position.

However, nothing of the sort happened for over 2 years. I was stuck doing the same tasks over and over again, every single day from 9 to 5. There were no breaks from this monotony. It was a lot of work too! I had asked my manager repeatedly to assign me different tasks so that I could learn & grow but she would give me something to calm me down for a couple of days and then I'll be back to the same shit. There was no traveling, I watched my co-workers get the opportunity to do so and it used to kill me from the inside. There were no complaints from the upper management about my work either. All of my holidays were utilised in taking mental health days. It was so bad.

At the end of these two years, I had become incredibly resentful and angry. I had massive mental breakdown and I shouted at a client because I couldn't take the sexist jokes he was making. Ofcourse, I was forced to resign. I knew this day was coming. On my last day, my manager said I should have done more to prove to the seniors that I was capable of doing more for the company. I was so confused after hearing this, I had done nothing but begged them to give me more opportunities. I felt so manipulated. The money wasn't much either, minimum wage to survive in a city. 

I can't help but think now, was I being ungrateful? I mean there was PTO and WFH and I was still not happy about working at this startup. Am I being too whiny? "
0,2024-05-27,I quitted from a restaurant as a waiter ,u/Plus_Trip5001,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d1wjqe/i_quitted_from_a_restaurant_as_a_waiter/,antiwork,"Just wanted to share this messy experience. 3 weeks ago I started working at a small restaurant as a waiter. I was pretty hesitant when I considered working there since the owner posted too many posts begging for people to work in literally every site and it‚Äôs rated as 2,9/5 stars on trips advisor. There are too many negative reviews calling it a tourist trap, that the manager and staff is rude and disrespectful and that they fight in front of the customers because they can‚Äôt work properly. However, I hoped that maybe this years things could change. 

The environment was too toxic. The owner clearly didn‚Äôt like me and used to criticise me rudely in front of the other colleagues, (they work with each other 2-3 years) creating a hostile environment against me. The waitress that works there 2 years is very lazy and seems to hate her job. Instead of admitting her mistakes, she used to criticise me to the owner everytime there was a problem. There were 2 more new employees that got hired recently and they quitted after 3 days. The owner and the manager couldn‚Äôt communicate about a stable system and they were too many misunderstandings. I used to do what the manager told me, while the owner decided for me to literally do the opposite without letting me know and everyone used to criticise me until I called them out. 

One day, the owner told me that I make everyone‚Äôs life hard and I hold back the entire restaurant and staff, and asked me if I‚Äôd like to continue working the next month with less hours and salary or to work until the end of the Month and stop. Then I told him I‚Äôm quitting right now since according to him I ruin the whole restaurant and I don‚Äôt want to harm his business for even more days. Then he tried to change my mind because It would be inconvenient for him to select the papers for quitting and he needs to at least find another person but I insisted. My manager literally begged me to stay off at least the end of the month and that I‚Äôm doing great at my job and I really help them and to not listen to him and trust him, since he tried to change him mind about me. But I didn‚Äôt want to keep working for an ungrateful, disrespectful and incompetent owner. "

I had requested my manager to put forward a request to move me up a level as I felt I was working at a higher level than my current level and wanted the move up.

My manager met with the other managers last week and they denied her request on the grounds I had too many sick days in the past 6 months.

Just for context in December and January I got hit by two separate colds which took me out of commission for 1 week per cold.

I had a different manager during this time and I had asked her if I could work from home for the period of my sickness. She advised me if I was well enough to work from home then I was well enough to be in the office and instead advised me to take time off to recover. She also made note that if the sickness was legitimate then I had no concerns about the time off impacting my performance.

I relayed this to my current manager and she said it wouldn't make a difference and I would have to reapply for the level up on another 6 months.

I just feel so defeated. All the hard work I put into this job when I am here feels completely neglected due to the fact I was off on sickness and not given any alternatives to work from home instead of being off."

I'll make this brief. I was to collaborate with the admin on sending out an email to new volunteers in June. I asked her to tell these volunteers to arrive 30 before service so that they can get situated, ask questions and overall just be prepared since it's the first time for them. She argued that 30 minutes is too long and that 15 would be more appropriate. I explained that they are usually supposed to be there 15 minutes before since that is when check in begins, but for the first day, I want to give them extra time to settle in. She argued with me that these ladies used to serve many years ago and that the person then ran a tight ship so they know what they are doing. I said, ""Well then they will understand that I also run a tight ship and expect them to be there 30 min before, especially since many of them don't know me and it's been a while since they last served."" Then she softened herself, listing the people on there as ""good rule followers"" and that they really shouldn't have to be there so early. I explained again the reason I want them there early and that was final. She threw down her clipboard and told me ""Well then I am not going to send it. I can't ask them to do that."" I said fine, I will send the email, just give me their names. She refused, saying that she does not want me to do that either and she will give them to me when I come to my senses. I went directly to HR who has already written her up for insubordination before and will be having a talk with her about whether she can handle this job or not. "

Genuinely what is so hard about letting go of a little wealth so the next generation can prosper with it? Why is it so hard for 55+ to understand that there are 8 billion mf‚Äôs on this earth now when they grew up with 3. SHIT ISNT EASY!!! I still remember it being a big deal when we hit 6 billion, then 7. And when we hit 8 I didn‚Äôt even see a single headline!!!!

Inflation is bullshit, the economy is bullshit, capitalism is exclusively for the few and against the many, and I‚Äôm fucking sick of everyone acting like that‚Äôs okay because they have a sliver of a piece of a tiny iota of a chance of being one of the big ones. There‚Äôs not even anything stopping anyone from abusing and harming those that they build their fortunes off the backs of! 

I live in the United States, and I would like to apologize to the world for winning against socialism and communism, because it has stunted our growth as a society. The idea of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs mine is mine and what‚Äôs yours will me mine if I‚Äôm manipulative enough‚Äù is fucking sickening. Call me autistic, call me idealist, call me anything but stupid because it would take the intelligence of a rock to believe that there‚Äôs anything worth saving about the systems we have in place. Meritocracy and Socialism are NOT two separate things, and simply allowing a minimum level of human quality of life for others will NOT prevent you for succeeding, unless you SPECIFICALLY RELY ON THE FACT THAT OTHERS MUST SUFFER FOR YOUR SUCCESS.


And if I have learned anything about having a mother who is 65 and a father who is 69 while I am 26, it has taught me that they do not understand the concept of a changing world. They expect you to grow up and understand things in the same way as them due to complete ignorance of the rapid progression of change. We have the most INSANE computers in our hands and I remember my first phone being a flip phone, so trust me, this shit is insane. That was 20 years ago. The 60‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs didn‚Äôt change NEARLY as much nor as often.
Not only that, they have the concept of ‚Äúyour money is not my money, so do it yourself or else you‚Äôre a failure to society‚Äù. For reference both my parents are doctors, and could easily afford a shit studio apt and food bills for me, if they wanted. But since I didn‚Äôt wanna go to college and instead do work in random industries and art and basically anything but the route they took, I have been unworthy of help. Very specifically, even if I took out a student loan (which I would have to in order to get a degree) I would lose all access to any potential inheritance. Not to sound selfish but I can‚Äôt even convince my mom to pay a nurse more than 15/hr, no benefits included. A REGISTERED OPERATING ROOM CERTIFIED NURSE.

We will be fucked until they drop like flies. Just look at the stats‚Ä¶ Second Thought on YouTube radicalized tf out of me recently. And idk. I might start radicalizing mutually assured support for others"

1,2024-05-27,Ex-employer demanding repayment?,u/gavin92,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d27t8u/exemployer_demanding_repayment/,antiwork,"I worked at a place on a Fixed-Term Contract from 6th November to 31st March. I was given leave hours which renewed in January and took all of my allotted leave which was approved by my line manager at the time.

I signed a contract extension before the end of March and ended up working until 11th April before resigning. After my resignation, I was emailed to say I needed to pay back a huge amount as I had gone 76 hours over my entitled leave. This left me confused because my annual leave was approved by my manager. Plus, we were working on a contract of only 6 months so it's not like I had to accrue leave. Either way, the manager shouldn't have approved any leave I would not actually be entitled to in that case.

In the Employee Handbook and Offer of Employment letter there is no mention of paying back any overtaken leave. They make mention of a contract of employment I was to receive within two months of starting but I never received that contract. Nothing I have signed has mentioned I need to pay back any overtaken leave. They have acknowledged this but said ""No, it does not mention this, but it does mention what you are entitled to, and you went over this limit.""

In the Handbook, this is what it says about annual leave:

""The Company's holiday year runs from 1st January to 31st December (incl). Annual entitlement is 25 days + Bank Holidays FTE and pro-rata for part timers, effective 1 January 2023. NB holiday leave entitlement will no longer increase with service, effective 1 January 2023. . Please refer to UK Bank Holidays to find out the dates of holidays for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. If a public/bank holiday is on a weekend, a ‚Äòsubstitute‚Äô weekday becomes a bank holiday, normally the following Monday. If the employee works less than 40 hours per week their entitlement will be calculated pro-rata by reference to full-time hours (FTE) of 40 hours per week. Please refer to Workday for your entitlement. If your employment starts or terminates part way through a holiday year, the Employee's entitlement during that holiday year shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis rounded up to the nearest half day.""

What do I do? I don't have the money to pay them back and I was never once told I had taken too much leave as it was within my allocated leave hours and all approved by my manager. For reference, this all took place in England, UK."

36,2024-05-27,"My former assistant manager told another store manager not to hire me, and I feel extremely hurt.",u/_Alpha_Mail_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d28fwe/my_former_assistant_manager_told_another_store/,antiwork,"For the sake of clarity, I am going to be using names in this post but rest assured that they are not the real names of the people involved out of respect for their privacy.

So, I work retail at a shopping mall. I am going on two years of working there. It was over a year ago that I expressed interest in moving up into a management role, mainly for job security and better hours. My assistant manager at the time (who we will call Claire) was the first to know, and at first she seemed ecstatic in my interest. She and I had quite a few talks about it and she even encouraged me to talk to the store manager about the opportunity.

Flash forward a few months, and Claire seemed to have an attitude shift towards me. For reasons I‚Äôll never know, I guess she built up a resentment towards me. She became very condescending towards me at work and even scolded me several times in front of customers. By this point she was temporarily the store manager while the actual store manager was serving as a temporary district manager. So, needless to say, she was no longer interested in my goals.

My supervisor, however (who we will call Pam), still seemed invested in my aspirations and despite not having the authority to influence any decisions regarding me being promoted, she still had a lot of faith in me and encouraged me to continue working on my goals. 

Pam‚Äôs greatest talent is she builds bonds with a lot of customers, and one of the customers she‚Äôs close to happens to be the store manager of another store inside the mall. We‚Äôll call her Daisy. Daisy was talking about how her store needed a supervisor because no one seemed interested in applying and her current associates weren‚Äôt interested in the role. Pam vouched for me and convinced her to give me an interview for the position, and I was very grateful for the opportunity.

I did the interview with Daisy and it went really well. She knew that I had no management experience but had been working on the required skills. Pam particularly wanted this opportunity for me because she figured the position would help me attain a management role at the store we worked for. I was supposed to interview with the district manager the following week, but then that week came and went and I never heard from the district manager. I texted Daisy several times about it and even stopped inside the store but I kept being given very unhelpful responses such as ‚Äúoh the DM has been very busy‚Äù and ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt gotten around to reminding her about the interview‚Äù.

I eventually give up, but I find that a couple of months later the position is still open so I once again ask Daisy about the position, telling her I was interested. Daisy said that we would talk about it the following week, but then again, that week came and went and I never heard from her. This time I didn‚Äôt bother pressing the issue because I figured I guess she didn‚Äôt want me working for her.

Flash forward to just last week, I was rounding out my shift and Pam was the manager on duty, so I was doing my end of shift chat with her when Daisy comes in to buy something. She looked familiar but I didn‚Äôt know who she was. Then as she leaves, Pam says goodbye to her, using her name, and I ask: ‚ÄúWait a minute - is that Daisy? She keeps ignoring my applications to work for her.‚Äù

This is the plot twist you‚Äôve been waiting for. Claire worked with Daisy as her assistant manager before working for us. After Pam had convinced Daisy to give me an interview, Claire went to Daisy and explicitly told her not to hire me. Pam told me all of this and said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably why she‚Äôs been ignoring you.‚Äù

And at first I just felt shocked. I knew Claire didn‚Äôt like me, for reasons that, again, I‚Äôll never know. She ended up leaving the company last fall and her and I didn‚Äôt end things on a good note. She yelled at me in front of a customer and afterwards when she tried talking to me about it I snapped back at her, which I never do to managers but she shouldn‚Äôt have approached me while I was very much still flustered by the situation.

But after I had some time to think about it, I felt really hurt and betrayed. Claire talked to me about the position several times. She told me how pleasant of a manager Daisy is and that she talked to her, putting in a good word for me. Claire encouraged me to ask her questions about the role and the store itself because she wanted to help me slide into the position. Then to find out all of this time you were just leading me on? You made me think you were on my side when in reality you didn‚Äôt want me in that role and made sure of it by talking to Daisy?

I believe Pam and what she said. She has her own flaws. She‚Äôs very conceited and sometimes displaces her frustration onto others, but she‚Äôs also a very honest person. She would have no reason to lie to me.

So I guess I‚Äôm just pissed. Pissed at Claire for playing me like a fiddle and wrongly interfering with the hiring process of a company she no longer worked for and pissed at Daisy for being a cowardly manager and not addressing her concerns with me directly. I would love to confront the both of them about it, but unfortunately Pam asked me to keep it hush-hush, and I respect her enough as my supervisor and as a person to honor that wish. But still, it‚Äôs absolutely BS and I hate when people play me for a fool because it just gives me really bad trust issues and paranoia. I suffer from depression and anxiety and already spend my everyday worrying about what people think of me. Why would you act in a way that just proves me right?

In conclusion, I absolutely loathe workplace authority and the fact that there is no accountability system in place for managers."

They also want your webcam to be always on in Zoom.

You'd think with their paranoia they would at least provide their workers with company laptops.. but they don't. How surprising.

They pay slave wages of $15, and sell your skills to train AI for tech companies.¬†

There are NO benefits of any sort. You are a contractor.

They use Wise to pay people in USD, so if you're working outside of the US, be prepared to pay conversion fees and other Wise fees.



ONBOARDING

I applied to them in April 2023. They emailed me May 2024, and rushed the entire onboarding process.

During the 3 hours long onboarding process you find out about their invasive tracking slowly



PROS

The onboarding videos of the owner, Francis Pedraza, obsessively repeating how AI will make everyone ""creative and strategic"" is idiotically amusing



CONS

Slave wages, invasive tracking software, micromanaging, no benefits, no advancement, no work life balance"

I‚Äôm a barista. I‚Äôve been one since I was 15 and I am now 25. I am good at my job, know a lot about coffee, and provide excellent customer service. I just had my one year review at the coffee shop I work at and left feeling kind of bad about myself. 
For context, I always show up to work early and in a good mood. I never complain. I do what I‚Äôm told to do. I feel like I‚Äôm pretty efficient in my work. Everyone has off days and while I‚Äôve had a few, I feel like overall I do my best and I provide good work. 
My bosses are kind of picky. Well, no, they‚Äôre very picky but lately they‚Äôve kind of been cracking down the whip on everyone. They‚Äôve been shadowing our opens and closes and pinpointing what we do wrong/what we can improve on. While annoying, I kind of just brushed it off and did the best that I can. 
Well, now they‚Äôre giving everyone ‚Äúreviews‚Äù and ‚Äúratings‚Äù on their performance. They have categories for everything and rate us from 1-7 on how well we‚Äôve been doing. 
I got mostly 5s which felt disheartening because it felt like my work must seem very mid to them. I feel like I bust my ass and at least deserve some higher numbers, but I guess I‚Äôll take what I can get and it could‚Äôve been lower. 
But what really left me feeling bad is that at the end of the review they told me my bathroom breaks are too long and I need to shorten them. 
This is the first time my bathroom breaks have ever been brought to my attention at any job I‚Äôve ever worked. 
I do use the restroom quite frequently because I stay very hydrated and so I constantly have to pee. But I always wait until there‚Äôs a break in service. And without being too vulgar, I also have IBS and coffee triggers it so sometimes when I‚Äôve got to go I‚Äôve got to go. I truly don‚Äôt think my bathroom breaks take longer than normal though, minus maybe a few times when I‚Äôve had a very upset stomach, but I‚Äôve been there for over a year now and that was only once or twice. 
Am I wrong to feel discouraged and down about this? I just feel like I bust my ass and no matter what I do it‚Äôs never good enough. And now to think about how they‚Äôve been paying attention to my bathroom breaks. Most of the time I don‚Äôt even take a lunch break. I‚Äôve been feeling extremely anxious about it and feel like I can‚Äôt even take a bathroom break at all now without being monitored. I‚Äôm also quite embarrassed that they think I take long bathroom breaks so I haven‚Äôt even talked to anyone about it, not even my husband. "
4,2024-05-28,Automatic HR Hiring/Denying (And a partial story),u/RealFatherShark,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d2an7h/automatic_hr_hiringdenying_and_a_partial_story/,antiwork,"Why do so many companies bother putting a place for you to apply if they intend on just automatically denying you via computer system. I understand to some degree if it's a complete mismatch, but are the days where missing one skill still made you a qualified applicant if you were willing to learn gone? 

I am in a niche field that works because we're restless and have an intense desire to learn and discover (archaeology. US). You also need higher education and lots of specific technical skills to do anything in the field. We all enjoy going out and digging in the dirt and working not necessarily for an income but we do need it to survive. Many of my friends are also archaeologists, all of which are insanely talented. 

I've been in career archaeology much longer than many of my friends, who have mostly just stuck to staying on school and doing academic archaeology. Now that we've all graduated with our graduate degrees, everyone is spreading out for work in the ""desperately hiring"" field. I was antsy because my company was telling me they weren't going to be able to promote me and I went searching for other jobs, one of which offered me 13k over industry standard. I was offered the promotion at my other job, and I turned it down. My boss and I both knew they'd never be able to match the offer I got. This is because our company recently got bought out so it's a super mega company now. And the only reason I even wanted to work for the company any longer was because of my boss. But money talks. 

I recommended my friend. She's insanely talented and has a strong recommendation from one of the most respected archaeologists in our region as well.  She applied to the company and they immedietly rejected her because of her lack of field experiences. My boss didn't even see the resume even though she personally reached out and asked to speak to my friend and had her apply. So now my boss has to bend ass over backwards to get HR to recent their denial so that she can at least be interviewed since she was PERSONALLY ASKED TO APPLY BY A REGIONAL HEAD. 

I just don't understand why these automatic denials are even a thing. They miss out on a crazy amount of talent then complain no one will work. It's baffling.  "

Workplaces and Unions see them as beneficial because on average they help retain employee numbers. But the Early Intervention Programs often will force workers to return sometimes without the workers knowledge, or alternatively deny returns to work and stall the process as they see fit with no systems of accountability in place or requirements for explanation.

I struggle to see any benefit to the worker, in fact it seems to create unpaid workplace responsibilities outside of the workplace.

Reading my Early Intervention Program communications with my employer it basically just denies you any opportunity to advocate for yourself and forces you to use a third party that is favourable to your employer to communicate on your behalf. 

Not only has every single Early Intervention Specialist bungled my return to work and forced me to go weeks without pay but reading their communications they every single one of them is misinterpreting, misunderstanding, and miscommunicating to your employers. My reps have all made it look like I was asking for accommodations that would be totally unreasonable and it made me look like an idiot.

So what are the benefits if any? I‚Äôm starting to feel that EIP programs are so flawed and filled with procedural loopholes that they have become an anti-labour service.

Are you tired of slogging away at your desk while your boss cruises through life in their leather chair, sipping on artisanal coffee? Do you dream of earning more than your boss without sacrificing your sanity? Well, my friend, buckle up because I‚Äôve got the ultimate life hack for you: **‚ÄúDollars Per Hour: The Ultimate Metric!‚Äù**

# The Premise

Picture this: You stroll into the office, shades on, and casually clock in. Your boss, on the other hand, is already drowning in emails, spreadsheets, and existential dread. But fear not! You‚Äôre about to flip the script.

# The Strategy

1. **The Stealthy Arrival**: Arrive late. Like, fashionably late. Let your boss think you‚Äôre a mysterious productivity ninja who only emerges when the moon is in retrograde. They‚Äôll be too baffled to question your methods.
2. **The Coffee Break Marathon**: Take coffee breaks like it‚Äôs an Olympic sport. Bonus points if you can stretch a 10-minute break into a 30-minute philosophical discussion about the meaning of life. Your boss? Still staring at that spreadsheet.
3. **The Art of Napping**: Master the art of the power nap. Find a cozy corner or meeting room with tinted windows, curl up, and recharge. Meanwhile, your boss is Googling ‚Äúhow to survive on three hours of sleep.‚Äù
4. **The ‚ÄúOops, Wrong Meeting‚Äù Maneuver**: Attend meetings you weren‚Äôt invited to. Bonus points if you bring snacks. Your boss? Still stuck in the budget review meeting from hell.
5. **Looking annoyed all the time,** so that people think you're busy. Credit to our hero [George Costanza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kafq7yrKAOQ)
6. **Use the an e-book reader on your browser:** it looks like you're working, but you're actually reading [Richard Ayoade ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43207719-ayoade-on-top)books
7. **~~Browse reddit:~~** ~~on second thought, never mind this is an endless pit of distractions~~

# The Results

üéâ C**ongratulations! **üéâ You‚Äôve successfully hacked the system. Your hourly rate just skyrocketed, while your boss is earning less per hour running around looking for you.

# The Fine Print

* **Disclaimer**: This strategy may lead to promotions, raises, and a mysterious aura of coolness. Use at your own risk.
* **Side Effects**: Increased swagger, occasional guilt, and a sudden urge to buy more sunglasses."

Right now, I'm getting offers to become a sailor with significantly better pay for less work time, and I am planning to leave this crappy corporate job. Additionally, I can work remotely by notifying the group chat. Yesterday, I mentioned that I would be babysitting my girlfriend's brother's child, and then I received a long message from my boss saying that I am not taking my job seriously, that this reason is completely unacceptable, and that I am surprising him and my colleagues negatively. Every Monday we have meetings (which are completely pointless) where we were discussing vacations. According to our legislation, every employee is entitled to a vacation after six months of work (I'll hit the six-month mark in three days), and of course, my boss said, ""It's too early for you to think about vacation.""

 I was surprised by this remark, but okay. In the end, all these situations only increase my desire to go back to sea as a mechanic, and apparently, all these events at my current job are just signs that I should move on.

I'm so depressed going into work where I don't feel I'm making any impact. It's not a social role, it involves working on my own the majority of the time. 

What really did it for me is that I received an awful performance review which I thought was very unfair. It made me feel like shit and unvalued at all. I have no motivation, and just trying to do the very bare minimum so that I can keep my pay check. The temptation to quit is so high. 

Why do employers think that you can just act so harsh to people, as if that will make them want to come to work happy and motivated? It doesn't. It just makes them absolutely resentful.

That said, I have a coworker who works crazy hours because he is committed to research, but also by his own admission has OCD. During this last three day weekend he sent out numerous updates via chat about his progress on a non-emergent issue. This is pretty common for him. Usually, no one else responds, but if they do it's usually perfunctory and to the point. 

I understand that we're professionals and are supposed to be on hand for emergencies. But this guy just goes too far, I believe. He's kind of a friend and he really ought to be spending time on other parts of his life. I also kind of fear he may be sending expectations so I'll for the rest of us?

anyways, i was supposed to work yesterday and i couldn't find anyone to cover me. my manager went in for me. she texted me while i was at the er ""i need a doctors excuse from you"" and ""you called out for your shift, i had to work it."" it felt like she was trying to guilt trip me for something potentially fatal.

this morning she texted the work group chat (which only her and the assistant manager are allowed to speak in) that she wouldn't be covering anyone again and we don't consider what she has going on in her own life and our applications say we can work and if we ""refuse"" to do so we aren't of any use to her.

well, i have a shift in five hours. the only two afternoon shifts that aren't working today haven't responded to me. i don't know the number of one of morning shift so i can't ask her.

Over the past week both the CEO and my boss have said openly and publicly that this company is a ""shit show"" and totally understand that people are unhappy.

  
Color me shocked.  In my 30 years in the workforce I have *never* heard anything like this, or at least not publicly.  I've been a part of a few toxic environments (thankfully not too many!), and usually you make friends with a couple of your co-workers and gripe about things *privately* -- then let the company's leadership whitewash and cheerlead about how things are supposedly going great... before they experience a tsunami of resignations, to their collective surprise.

  
The best word I can use to describe these disclosures is ""negligence.""  What potential upside is there to telling the entire company that putting in all of this effort isn't worth it -- without providing any real solutions?

I took over a store for a cellphone retailer, knowing full well the store history and the fact It was brutally hemorrhaging money. 

I accepted far less pay than I would of liked in the spirit of being a ""company guy"" (stupid I know) 

I built the store up with 0 investment from owners. $0 marketing budget. Developed a close relationship with not only my employees but a large portion of the small town community. I got texts for weeks after from customers, some which drive 40 minutes to my current location. 

Fast forward to now. The store is crumbling. They thought I was the problem and removing me with someone ""from the area with a background in marketing"" would bring it to their unreasonable expectations. 
It's been the exact opposite, the deficit which I cut in half is now right back up to where it was prior to my arrival. 

I was told in secrecy they are just waiting out the lease now and the location will close. 

I'm a bit torn, I put in a few years of solid work there with no support from the people who should have cared the most. I still feel like I could have done more, but I'm also thrilled it failed without me. Which in my opinion showcases what I brought to the table.

In 2019 I started working in a tip-based position for a company that had expanded out of Las Vegas into Massachusetts, where I lived. Now as one might expect for a brand new branch, staffing was a little bit chaotic, and overtime was given out freely. Of course Massachusetts differs from Nevada in several key ways, one of which is requiring overtime to be paid out at 1.5 times the HOURLY minimum wage for all staff, with no exception for TIPPED employees. Thus, an employee with a tipped hourly of $5, would get paid overtime at $22.50 an hour. 

Of course it took a concerned coworker to notice the discrepancy, but 18 months later, triple damages minus attorney fees I got a five digit check for a wage settlement. Paid for my honeymoon and the downpayment on a house.

I'm talking about loud screeching laughing, today someone kept laughing for an entire 5 minutes. 

I asked my manager if ear plugs are fine, because honestly it's so distracting and really grating. And she came back to say that her manager said we need a GP note about it (how do I even ask my GP about writing a letter saying I should be allowed ear plugs lol)

And I'm not talking about listening to music or earphones/ear buds. I could get some and be sneaky about it, there's some really discreet ones, but I don't want to rock the boat plus the point is that it is ridiculous to require a doctor's note for ear plugs out of all things.

I needed to call the GP for an appointment tomorrow so I will bring it up to them, I'm not even sure if they'll be bothered to take time out of their day to write me a note.

I don't know the point of this post I was just fed up of listening to those people laughing loudly and nobody says anything. Apparently a lot of people asked about ear plugs. I get our office day is about 'socialising' but something should be said when it's disturbing other people's peace.

31,2024-05-28,My CEO is not making time to discuss my raise,u/rumpletuffin,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d2qaa4/my_ceo_is_not_making_time_to_discuss_my_raise/,antiwork,"Let me start with this, I started this job in March 2023 as the first full time, non freelance role out of college. Also as a note, my current company has around 400 employees (this will become relevant later). My last job worked with government entities so I could not include that work in my portfolio. I was understanding with my hiring manager when they said that I would start about $5k under average market value for my role because of this. He also said that we would revisit my salary at the year mark and my raise would reflect the practical knowledge that I have. In my first year here, I built out website integrations that saved the company nearly $100k/year, revitalized their trade show presence and made myself available for one off projects and learning wherever I could. Hell I was even in the process of teaching myself Unreal Engine so that I could make a VR experience for trade shows.¬†



FF to March 2024, I research market data on what my role and experience would fetch on my local market and write a presentation sheet with this data and a proposal of a raise that would put me slightly above average for the market. Now this equated to about a 23% raise but I feel I proved myself and with taking a cut at the start, I felt that this was fair.¬†



A week later, I heard from the Chief Marketing Officer that as a rule the company does not roll out raises greater than 10% to anyone. On top of that, a 10% raise would not be viable and he recommended a proposal for 8%. I was understandable upset but I thought that it still beat 2023 inflation so I would take what I could get. So I redrafted my proposal and submitted it. My final proposal was accepted by the CMO and the CFO. The next step was for the CEO to personally review my proposal with the CFO and the CMO.¬†



Why the hell does the CEO have to personally review every raise request in a company of 400 or so employees?



Anyways, I thought, ‚Äúokay no worries, it is already approved by 2 important people the meeting should only take 5 or so minutes so it should be done by the end of the week.‚Äù Then the meeting got pushed¬† to next week, then the following. At the end of the first week of May, they spoke with the CEO about my raise and he said, ‚ÄúYea that sounds doable, just shoot me the hard numbers and I will get it approved.‚Äù Imagine my shock when it‚Äôs nearly June and all I keep hearing is, ‚ÄúOh they should get to it by the end of this week.‚Äù¬†



End rant



TL;DR



CEO has to personally approve every raise request in a company of nearly 400 employees, keeps postponing the meeting for over 2 months now.¬†"

I'm in a location where no one is really hiring for anything. I'm in a very rural area and there's only maybe a dozen businesses with employees in my whole county.
I'm basically a stay at home wife right now, I have a lot to do at home, but I want to find ways to work outside the home or meet new people and learn skills that will be useful in the future.
How do I volunteer my time to others without undermining the paid workers at those businesses? I don't want to take hours from them. But the reality is no one has the money to pay an extra worker, so volunteering is all I really have. I was hoping to ask a coffee shop if I could work there, and if they say no then I'll offer to work for non-tipped minimum wage (so basically volunteering my time). I was also looking at asking a local small farm if I could help them out.
I'm already volunteering for a charitable organization, but it only takes a few hours once a week.

How do I do this legally without just being paid so little that it hurts the current workers? Should I respect my own time more and try to find a job that pays well, even if I end up getting nothing?"

Iowa Republicans intentionally wrote a provision into the law that doesn't protect employees from being fired, even with a card. ([Iowa Code 124e.21](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code/124E.21.pdf)) I didn't use or possess my vape on work premises, I wasn't under the influence while on the clock, I didn't fail a drug test. I simply asked if there was a policy around the use of medical marijuana and a week later I was let go. The moral of the story: Whomever said honesty is the best policy was a know-nothing jackass. Don't mention your medical cannabis status to your employer and certainly don't ask for policy clarifications. My cannabis card is prescribed for a well documented disability but because marijuana is still federally illegal, there are no ADA protections, either, so I can't request reasonable accommodations and Iowa law (linked above) even says employers don't have to accommodate use. 

So f\*\*\* me, I guess. I don't need money, right?

In case they won't hire me, do you think that going to volunteer across Europe would be a nice idea?   
I like traveling and I like helping people, or animals, but I haven't done volunteering before so I don't know how it really is. 
In Europe you can register to a ""youth platform"" and find different programs in a lot of countries, they give you food and a place to stay, and also some pocket money.  
Being useful makes me happy, and adding a button to a page is not rewarding at all.  
If they won't hire me, should I try to find another job in IT? 
I don't have a real bachelor degree and working experience, beside 2 internships. So I'm a bit afraid that if I take a gap of 4, 6 months or even a year it would kill every chance to have a nice career.  
Have any of you volunteered? How was it? And how do recruiters or people in general view it?

I‚Äôve worked at a grocery store for the last couple of years on and off as a college student. It has seemed to get worse. 

Starting wage is still $12.50 which is a joke especially with a union. I pay $27 a week in union dues too btw. 

We‚Äôre supposed to get quarterly $0.25 raises every 3 months (even on leave) this has disappeared. 

To make matters worse, they just cut my department by like 90%, which is the curbside pickup and delivery service and turned it into a mega warehouse that distributes orders by trucks throughout the Pittsburgh area about 5-6 times a day. This is inefficient as it‚Äôs literally logistically impossible for this to be efficient. 

The union didn‚Äôt even bother trying to fight this. The fact that I pay almost $30 a week for them to basically do nothing inclines me to believe they‚Äôre just threatened consistently or are paid off by the company.

I picked it up while between jobs, and am now in a salaried office position where I am treated very well. In other words, I'm in a position to do something here. 

I'll describe the weird situation, and then will go into the confirmed wage theft below it.

The weird situation: Pretty much since I've started, I've watched as people lose hours they *need.* I was hired full time, and then slashed down to 23 hours. I believe it was maybe a week after that, that a new hire was brought on. To be honest, I'm pretty sure my hiring caused slashes in the hours, too. The store is extremely overstaffed. Most stores (including high volume) work their best with 3 people, 4 max. That's not corporate schlock, that's coming from me working at other stores, and seeing/ hearing it. My home store is low traffic, and typically staffs 5 people, with 4 already being more than needed. But people keep being hired on FT hours, and dropped down to unlivable hours. Also kind of weird, is that she lets anyone split up the tips, and product is all pretty much free without limit, to employees.

I feel like this is some kind of scheme, but I'm not sure what it is.

The wage theft, comes in the form of her telling us to cut her in on all tips. When I was at another store, their GM alerted me to this not being allowed. And when I looked into it, it is in fact illegal in my state. GMs may only take tips, if they are the only person handling your experience, from the kitchen to the bill. Which is not the case. 

I did bring up the tips, to the DM, and I know he spoke with her. But I am 1000% certain that no one's wages- physical or digital- have been returned. And she is still employed. Gets overtime hours, while everyone else is scrounging. And yes, she is paid hourly.

She put me on the schedule this coming weekend, and part of me feels I shouldn't go. But regardless of that, what could this all be? Does anyone recognize this behavior?"

The interviewer thanked said they could only start me at $12 per hour. My thoughts were ‚ÄúThey just lost this candidate, I‚Äôm going to troll them since they just insulted me.

I proceeded to do all the onboarding forms except for the tax information. I also did the background check. I emailed it back to them, the manager called me saying that me background is clean and asking if I could start the next day. I said I will be there ready to be trained. So the next day came I blocked the companies number and never showed up.

The red flags were there from before the interview even started 2 years ago. Not on time, couldn‚Äôt find anyone for 30 minutes, almost left, etc. 

Anyways, the workplace was quite toxic to keep it simple. Felt very marginalized in the beginning. Was talked down to significantly, blamed for things totally out of my control, given enormous workloads for absolutely nothing in return, and just general poor treatment and weirdness. And of course intensely low pay. 

One of the veteran employees literally harassed everyone almost daily about iPhone vs android and how all iPhone users are such idiots etc it never ends. To the point that things almost get physical between people. 

After I was treated like garbage and given outrageous workloads in the beginning by the previous maniacal nonstop cigarette smoking / alcoholic boss (who ended up dying while I worked there suddenly), I made a pact to myself to become the most valuable and highest performance employee in the company, which I did to the best of my capability, specifically so it would hurt them as much as possible when I randomly decided to pull the plug on the bad relationship. I had the highest production everyday continuously for probably 10 months straight. Other drama made me start quiet quitting and caring less. 

But anyways. I just quit, out of nowhere, on purpose, in a blaze of glory, laid it all out in the letter. Not sure what my purpose even is in sharing this other than to maybe give other people who feel chained the bravery to say fuck it finally and fully stand up for themselves and take back their own lives‚Äô.

I have a master's degree in Human Resource Management and I'm desperately trying to get out of the restaurant business but for now I need whatever job will pay at least most of my bills while I continue to look. 

We had a great general manager. She was kind and listened to us and took feedback. She was positive and would work with us on schedules and would always boost us up and acknowledge everything we did that was good and she would compliment our hard work. Our assistant manager was just like her and it made a shitty job a lot better. 

Corporate fired our GM because she was too positive and it was ""toxic"". They wanted her to basically constantly harp on any small mistake we ever made, harshly discipline us using draconian rules and policies, and to rule with a heavy fist. Our assistant manager quit immediately after finding out, and this is after our opening manager was fired a week before. She was also a delight to work with. 

Morale is awful. Corporate is there every day now and nitpicking everything. They have racist uniform policies, nobody is brave enough to challenge them, they nitpick everything. Women's makeup is scrutinized, our jewelry, (not for food safety reasons either, it's for conservative reasons) they even check our socks to make sure they are black even if nobody can see them under our pants legs. They have even sent notices about how we need to wear certain undergarments so they are staring at the women's chests and crotchs and butts. This is a freaking fast casual place similar to chipotle. 

They make policies that are NOT workable in a restaurant and then complain and berate us when they don't work. We can do $12,000 in business in one day, have 10 customers rave about how amazing the service was in our online surveys  and 1 customer complains they were missing a 35 cent sauce cup and the ONLY focus is how we screwed up horribly because of the sauce cup. Only 5 star reviews count, anything under 5 is counted as a 0. 

Now they are cracking down on the attendence policy and it's ridiculous. 

2-15 minutes late is 2 points
>15 minutes late is 5 points
*Proper* call offs with *excused* absences are 5 points 
Improper call offs are 10 points

A ""proper"" call off means you offer up your shift on the app, and calling the store at LEAST 4 hours before your shift starts. So if you have an emergency and call off 3 hours before or you wake up sick and are an opener so you can only call off 2 hours before your shift, it's 10 points. 

If you're sick and have a doctor's note and call of properly it's 5 points. 

15 points is a verbal warning 
20 points is a coaching and write up 
Anything over 20 points you're fired.
So if you're sick with the flu and have a doctor's note too bad you're fired if you take 4 days off. 

You can knock points off however! If you pick up someone else's shift, that knocks off 2 points. If you come in early or stay late at the request of a manager (not on your own!) it takes off 1 point. Heavy eye roll. 

Every 12 weeks the points are reset. But any verbal warnings or write ups stay on your record. 

And they encourage everyone to come to work sick with signs everywhere saying if you are sick with (any contagious symptom including vomiting and diarrhea) to come in and speak with your manager that day so you can be placed in a position where you're not directly handling food such as register or dish. 

I hate it here. Good ol USA where it's normal to give no sick leave and then punish people and even fire them if they do get sick. "

I work 12 hours Saturday and 12 hours Sunday.  Sunday pays double time.  My base pay is $29.45.  

So I'm making about $55k a year working two days a week.  

Typically we are always able to pick up M-F hours.  For the past decade I've been on this job I will pick up anywhere between 12 to 48 hours per *month* for extra cash. 


At the moment though, for the first time in the decade I've worked here, we are in a situation where we've overproduced (and no, the company is not in a crisis, we continue record profits).  

So there are no extra hours for me.  This is expected to last until around January of 2025.  


Long story short, I decided to look for some part time work in jobs that should be ""easy"" to get.  Retail, fast food, etc.  I like having extra money in my pocket to enjoy myself and not worry. 

Nobody will hire me.  Burger King, Taco Bell, Five Below, JC Penny, Spencers, Home Depot, etc. etc.  

I've interviewed with all of these places.  They were all fine with me not having weekend availability, they needed weekday staff.  

The minute they find out I'm just looking for ""extra money"" though, and have a job that pays well already.....the tone of the interview changes **drastically** and I'm all but ushered out the door within a few minutes.  

Apparently I have to lie to them and not let them know I have a decent job already, and this is just supplemental income.  

It's just insane to me.  I'm more than willing to show up to work for them on every shift they schedule.  I'm more than willing to put up with their bullshit.  I've never implied otherwise during interviews.  

The second they realize that, ""Oh this guy doesn't *need* this job....he's not *desperate*"".....they're done with me."

The job I'm still with has a verbal agreement to be in there for 2 years before moving internally elsewhere in the same firm, but others have quit prematurely no problem. The 2 year agreement is more of an informal agreement, nothing about it in written form for the job offer. We are told that we will have the opportunity to job shadow other departments in the meantime if we do well and how we can apply internally to another position after those 2 years.

I'm finding out that the whole workers' comp system is rigged against the person who gets injured. There are three people I am dealing with right now: my employer, the insurance company, and the insurance appointed case manager. All of them have an incentive to shorten my care and close my case as I am going through this life changing injury. The employer's rates go up the more I use the workers' comp insurance so they're pushing me to go back to work or quite. The insurance company is trying to pay as little as possible and wants the case closed. The case manager is incentivized by the insurance company to close cases quicker.

This brings up the lawyer who is supposed to be on my side. I personally do not have a lawyer because they tell me to wait until I dispute anything with the insurance company. However, I have the feeling no one will take my case because the payout settlement won't be enough for a lawyer's time. Having a lawyer might be a benefit during the process, but in the end, they are taking a cut out of the money the insurance company determined for your future medical expenses (final settlement).

When the whole case is said and done, they will offer you a paltry amount that, on the surface, will seem adequate to some. But if you think about the big picture, it is not worth it. For example, my ex's dad used to do construction in the 90s. He got permanent back damage, and after the doctors could do all they could, the insurance offered him around $100,000. This was during the time they would hand out opioids like candy. He lived on state disability and died from an illness caused by the opioids a few years ago. He used the $100,000 to buying a house, but once it was gone, he still couldn't find adequate work. He was living off the government, and his children's childhood was affected. $100,000 was a lot of money back then, and it might seem a lot to some now, but it does not make up for the change caused by life-changing injury. I'm seeing online that my injury paid out around $10,000 to other people. $10,000 for a permanent injury is an insult; it's less than a quarter of what I make yearly, and I'll be dealing with the issue in unforeseen ways for a lifetime.

To summarize everything: My current boss is a bishop at an LDS Mormon church and is trying to get his missionaries to recruit me to his church. At my interview he was acting friendly and eager to bring me on. He offered a position that very same day but I was too stupid to notice the red flags. It‚Äôs a salaried position that‚Äôs supposed to pay me $1650 every two weeks. But I only receive $1350. I also work 6 days 10hrs a week, but only get paid for 5 days 8hrs. 

When I was reading over the employee handbook, I noticed it said in bold letter ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ever speak to another employee about pay or it will result in automatic termination.‚Äù 

Long story short I get paid biweekly and my last paycheck was 5/17, which means the next one should be 5/31, but my boss is telling me that‚Äôs incorrect and I‚Äôll be paid on 6/7. I told him I absolutely need to be paid the 31st so I can renew my lease and he said ‚Äúthis shouldn‚Äôt be happening and I don‚Äôt want to have to give you an early paycheck again.‚Äù ‚ÄúSince I‚Äôm doing you a favor I want you to work on Memorial Day‚Äù. 

Today is the day after memorial so I brought my paycheck to his attention again and said I absolutely need it. He then said ‚ÄúI will talk to Gloria (the only office worker) to see what I can do‚Äù. I know he‚Äôs using me and is probably racist because before me he hired two Hispanic workers for a year before they quit and got fired. My most likely guess is he‚Äôs using minorities to make a quick buck while trying to convert them to Mormonism, and if they don‚Äôt submit he starts turning on them.

If I don‚Äôt receive my paycheck by 5/31, I‚Äôll be evicted and will quit without notifying him. But to mess with him I want to take the GPS tracker out the work van and park it in a shopping center overnight so it gets towed and is a hassle for him to recover.

Is this illegal to do? Or is there a better way to mess with him since he‚Äôll want me to return my work truck, with the equipment, and customer check?"

A quick look on the job sites shows my current role elsewhere is now offering on average ¬£10k less than my current salary with additional responsibilities and worst of all they‚Äôre all hybrid 2/3 days in the office (instead of fully remote).

For those of you who have found yourself in this position before - what did you do?

And for those of you who got laid off without warning - what do you wish you‚Äôd have done if you had been given prior notice?

The most obvious thing I can think of (other than looking for a new job) is to transfer all my important files & intellectual property on my computer before they revoke my access.

(I also wanna give props to my manager, he‚Äôs not being let go but is quitting in solidarity as he‚Äôs totally against the decision. ü§ù)

Anyone deal with something like this?,u/lumpytorta,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d30rb1/disabled_and_pushed_to_resign_or_get_fired_anyone/,antiwork,"I posted this on r/legal advice with no luck as everyone just downvotes everything there with no explanations. I was recently diagnosed with cancer and have some underlying autoimmune disorders too like SLE, MS, NSLE etc. and was basically placed between a rock and a hard place when I pretty much became disabled at f28. Has anyone been through something like this? 

This really just makes me feel like another cog in the machine and only cements my beliefs that these giant corporations don‚Äôt give a shit about their employees and all the stuff they tout as their mission statement about empathy and all that is bullshit. 

TLDR at the end. 

‚ÄúIs it legal for your employer to threaten termination for lack of FMLA papers when you have a disability?

Im just wondering if I messed up here because people keep telling me I could have had a case had things gone differently. 

I went on a LOA from Nov-Dec that was approved signed by my psychiatrist at the time because I was going through a lot at home, struggling with my mental health and overall health as I have some underlying autoimmune disorders like SLE, MS or NSLE.

My psychiatrist usually filled out my fmla and accommodations paperwork but for me to get my other accommodations & LOA for my health conditions I needed my rheumatologist to fill out the forms. I was advised by my rheumatologists office that it was $300 out of pocket for each set of forms that needed to be filled out so I was always hesitant about doing so and kept pushing it back because I didn‚Äôt have the money. Insurance wasn‚Äôt an option for this either. 

I was going to go back to work after the new year started so I had ‚Äúended‚Äù my leave at the end of December. Come new years and I got really sick and started to flare again but more intensely. I had to apply for a new FMLA LOA starting on January and at this point needed my rheumatologist to fill it out but I had no income because I was on a limited income to pay for the forms from the disability insurance. 

I was trying to save money for the forms or even borrow money but then I get a surprise $400 bill from the lab that I go to for bloodwork which refused to do any tests unless I paid the full amount and I couldn‚Äôt just show up to my rheumatologist appointment without doing my labs. 

At this point I tried contacting my employer to explain my situation because it was considered an ‚Äúunapproved LOA‚Äù. The manager I had spoken to really wasn‚Äôt empathetic and didn‚Äôt care that I was becoming disabled because of how bad my flairs got, they just wanted me back at work and told me that if I didn‚Äôt get the forms I‚Äôd be fired. 

Two days later I ended up at the emergency room and was at the point where I was to fatigued, weak and disoriented to walk and was in constant agony from abdominal pain, constant bloating, lack of appetite but gaining weight. I was miserable. The ER found what was making me sick (a 14cm ovarian tumor) but they misdiagnosed me as having a ‚Äúdermis cyst from birth‚Äù despite giving them documented evidence that contradicted that diagnosis. Had I been diagnosed correctly, admitted and treated I could have had my disability forms filled out by a doctor. 

I knew the diagnosis was incorrect and deep down I knew I had cancer so the next day I made an appointment with any gynecologist I could for an ultrasound to confirm if it was cancer. I was able to find a doctor to take a last minute appointment and he did confirm that it had a lot of malignant qualities. 

I asked him if he could help me with my LOA forms as well because I was reaching the deadline and even tho I was pretty much disabled, he refused to put me on LOA because ‚Äúcancer can‚Äôt cause systemic symptoms‚Äù. I even explained to him my situation and how I thought the cancer was exasperating my underlying autoimmune disorder and he refused saying he wasn‚Äôt going to put me on leave until I had surgery which wouldn‚Äôt be for another month or two and I would be fired by then so I‚Äôd lose my coverage. 

I feel like I‚Äôm const discriminated by doctors because I‚Äôm young and ‚Äúseemingly healthy‚Äù and it‚Äôs frustrating that these doctors just think I‚Äôm trying to get free government money when I‚Äôm actually disabled and need this. 

After that appointment I had turned in a resignation letter stating that I was resigning for health reasons. I thought it was the right thing to do as I really liked working for that company and wanted a chance to work there again in the future but maybe at a different location. I‚Äôve told friends this story and everyone tells me I should have let them fire me because they‚Äôd be firing me for a disability and it would be discrimination. (They actually have a history of doing this to employees with disabilities apparently and I‚Äôm just now starting to find out.) I was scared of getting fired and felt cornered. 

I‚Äôve lost everything that I worked so hard for because of cancer and the autoimmune stuff going on. I got paid well, had good benefit, 401k match and worked for one of the biggest companies in the world, I was really proud to work there and loved my job up until this all happened to me. Multiple managers knew that I had multiple health conditions going on too but I‚Äôm not sure if that was documented or anything or how I could prove I was facing discrimination. There was always a lot of ‚Äúsilent discrimination‚Äù that I was kind of oblivious to in the past but only now starting to realize. 

Should I have let them fire me? Could this be a case or did I mess up in resigning? 

Right before I went on leave I was trying to get the disability accommodations established so I have emails trying to set it up but then I had to go on leave suddenly due to my niece going missing and dealing with a schizophrenia psychosis and my own mental/personal health. I feel so shit out of luck and I‚Äôm angry at the multiple systems that failed me when I really needed it most. 

Any advice or comments are helpful. I don‚Äôt know where to start. Sorry if I don‚Äôt make sense or if you need clarification on something, my brain is weird on chemo and from the neuropathy. ‚Äú

TLDR: Struggled to get FMLA paperwork signed and approved by three different doctors despite being physically disabled and sick. Forced to resign as I was scared to get fired. Lost everything. Turns out I had ovarian cancer and some underlying autoimmune conditions @ 28. Dealt with a lot of silent discrimination etc. very mad and hate corporate america and the health care system. "

I think one of the reasons why it's hard to find a job right now is because it's not a ""job market"" but rather a ""business acquisition market"". It seems like businesses are liquidating, selling, or buying up other businesses. I feel like one of the reasons why networking is so pushed is because it's not just a matter of who you know, but rather it's a matter that you were once an owner of a small business. It's networking between bourgeoisie. I know a few small tech companies that specifically random selves under just so they could be bought out by the big leagues in FAANG. Restaurants in my hometown specifically ran themselves poorly and sold high and make out like bandits.

I was moving up the ranks fairly quickly and as an hourly worker I was working 6 days a week to get a little overtime to make ends meet. Then I was promoted to a salary position which was still a decent jump on the pay scale and a few less hours. Great! The company gets bought out a few years back and the change my role from salary to hourly and that was fine too because i could get overtime again. Then I get a promotion a year later into another salary role. Only problem is that they wouldn‚Äôt budge an inch on their offer. I took the role knowing it would be a good resume builder.

 Now I feel like they have my trapped in a role that I‚Äôm under paid by at least 20-30k a year. They also are paying my student loan which I thought was nice but I‚Äôm under contract that if I leave I have to pay back a years worth of payments‚Ä¶. Just over 5k

My situation is 8 hour work days, 1 hour unpaid lunch, 5 days a week with 2 days off a week.  So take this as the absolute best case scenario for people. I‚Äôd reckon most out there have a far worse situation working. 

I spend 8 hours a day working. 

There are 2 hours of each day I consider lost hours.  Lunch and the hour getting ready in the morning.  These are neither personal or work hours as you‚Äôre too stressed for work to relax in the morning and at lunch.  That leaves me with 6 hours each day spent on me. 

I spend 8 hours sleeping a day. 

This means I spend each day:

33% of my time at work. 
25% of my time on me. 
33% sleeping.
8% lost hours. 

That looks bleak as hell.  But the 48 hours off each weekend make up for it. Accounting for sleep, and weekends, works out like this. 

38% of my week on me. 
23% of my week at work. 
33% of my week sleeping. 

But we have to keep in mind that the 38% of the week on me is including cleaning, cooking, other chores, showering etc.  so it‚Äôs likely less. 

I am currently awake when I should be sleeping attempting to revenge procrastinate some control of my life back and was wondering how much time I spend at work vs home.  I am now stealing from my 33% sleep to add to my 25% me time.  

Don‚Äôt know what the point of this was.  Just dreading tomorrow.

As someone who grew up in Europe, and spent around 2 years working there, I will never EVER complain about western work culture again. 

The managers here are egomaniacal dictators, knowing that they can replace the majority 90% indian workforce on a whim, they expect you to come in early and finish late, give everyone way too much work and seem to think its okay to call you after hours to do 'urgent tasks'. There are people like this everywhere, but what infuriates me is that everybody thinks its normal, and nobody is willing to say or do anything about these toxic behaviours. 

  
I get dirty looks when leaving at 5.30pm, which is still 30 minutes later than I should. I even had my manager give me a dressing down over the phone when I had a minor operation to correct an issue with my hip, saying that I should be in the office despite not being able to walk or drive!! Our whole team has been bollocked for 'taking 20 minute coffee breaks instead of 15', and so many other things i cannot list them all.

  
I guess thats how Dubai is the way it is, through a subservient subcontinent slave workforce that (unfortunately) knows they can be replaced in a heartbeat. I as a westerner working with these people feel desperately sorry for them, and I am counting down the days for my secondment to end. 

  
I have already lost control of my own mind, many toxic habits and behaviours resurfacing due to how much I hate it here. I really do hate working now. My physical health is also really starting to suffer, I am getting much more violently ill whereas previously I only got minor colds. I have as a result of this experience developed a hatred and understanding of these big companies 'outsourcing' to people who unfortunately can't have any better. Being worked to death for some idiot CEO who takes all the profits for him and his twat shareholders, while you 'do your part' for the business. Just fuck off.

PLEASE PLEASE think carefully before moving to this hellhole. Capitalism and materialism is no substitute for your mental and physical health. "
12,2024-05-29,My supervisors are bullying me and management does nothing about it ,u/princeofallcosmos92,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d34vuq/my_supervisors_are_bullying_me_and_management/,antiwork,"There's a much longer backstory, but this is a snippet of the toxic behavior. I work for a small business, so no union. And no HR. 

I've been trying to get out for nearly 4 months and I've applied for over 100 jobs and I've had 6 interviews and I have had no luck. I have two degrees. I gave up on trying to be a teacher in my 20s because it was too hard for me to even be a special education paraeducator. I had to start over a few years ago at age 26-27 after I had a mental breakdown at 24-25 that left me unable to take care of myself. I was then diagnosed with autism, social anxiety disorder, and PTSD. I may also have ADHD, but that hasn't been diagnosed yet. I'm working on that, too...I'm working on so much. 

Here's what happened today: I was making two Italian sodas and I already had two spoons in my hand to make them when my supervisor was handing me a spoon. So I said, ""Thank you!"" In a customer service-y voice because I could tell he was trying to help. I figured he didn't see that I had two spoons already. I was in the middle of making them and I would have had to set two spoons down to pick that one up. He asked what I had said, and I said, ""Oh, I just said thank you because I already had two spoons."" He just said, ""Interesting."" And walked off. And he was rude and even more short for the rest of the day. I wasn't challenging him at all and I don't understand why he took it that way. 

Today was also particularly depressing..I felt like I wasn't really spoken to much by any of management and then when I was done around 4:45/4:50, I took a few minutes to read through Slack and then I clocked off at 4:54. I decided to check other messages in that spot until 5:02 because nobody needed it and my manager assumed I was sitting there still on the clock. It kind of sucked. I just said I had clocked off at 4:54 and I said I was sorry for the confusion and I left. 

He and the other supervisor also have major issues with me asking clarification questions when it's been clear for literal YEARS that this place doesn't communicate consistently with everyone. They act like I'm dismissing their personhood and authority when I ask fucking simple questions about how things are done. 

Other coworkers have said that I am often not told things and I always seem confused because of it. I told them it could be because of my autism that I didn't pick something up, and they said, no, they really just don't tell you. At least one other coworker has gone to management to tell them that they think I'm treated unfairly. 

So, it's clear that I'm not wanted there. I'm doing everything I can to leave. I have a job coach. I have a therapist. I still can't fucking seem to get out even with support. 

All of that is just the tip of the iceberg. Job hunting sucks. My job sucks and it's a fucking joke. I've overcome so much trauma only to have to deal with this petty bullshit that manages to trigger said trauma. I'm just trying to get a better job with benefits. I feel like it shouldn't be this hard. And yeah, I don't dream of labor, either, but I have to work to live. 

It's awful to have to put up with toxic behavior because you literally cannot leave because you need the money. "
0,2024-05-29,My job interview from hell ,u/princeofallcosmos92,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d34zdk/my_job_interview_from_hell/,antiwork,"This happened a week and a half ago. 

I also posted this on a subreddit for autistic adults. I am both autistic and living with cptsd. 

I had the worst interview of my life today...it was truly the job interview from hell.

It was for a local coffee shop and I had been following their story on social media for a while. The owner is about to get their own shop and they were looking for baristas. 

I have been unhappy at my job for a while and I was looking for either a new job entirely or second job that I could eventually completely switch over to. 

I was offered the barista position on the spot, which had never happened before. I inwardly panicked and said yes. I didn't even get a chance to really tell her my availability and she already wanted to on-board me three days from now. 

She never asked when I could start and there was no discussion about how many hours I was actually available to work (I am trying to stay part time, under 25 hours, so I can keep Medicaid until I can get a job with benefits). 

It was just a lot all at once and I feel really stupid for not advocating for myself. I was just overwhelmed. I wish I had been honest, but I panicked. 

Her job listing talked about needing someone for 10-12 hours with the potential for more hours. I didn't think the job would start the literal following week even though I would be splitting time with two employers. I figured that today was just an interview and I wouldn't even know if I got it for at least a few days. 

The listing did say that there would be an availability of other shifts over time...so I was hoping to transition over there over time from my current job.
 
Unfortunately, everything was thrown at me, I was told that she wanted people who were constantly bubbly and happy, and she said it was going to be super loud in there all the time with loud music blasting. 

Sensory overload has been an issue in my current job, too, so I knew at that moment that I would have to refuse, but the interview was so awful that I just wanted to get it to end so I could get out of there. 

I ultimately lied and sent an email two hours later saying that I had talked to my employer and they said it wasn't going to work - but I know it wouldn't have anyway since she needed people instantly and there was no talk of, when can you start?

I was on the verge of crying from being overwhelmed but my boyfriend talked me through all of the possible scenarios and he helped me come up with a polite message to send and turn them down nicely. 

Why else was it awful? 

She took several phone calls while I was there and I was only asked maybe two actual interview questions in the entire hour I was there. I spent most of the interview just waiting for her to come back. I felt like she didn't really see me at all and I was just a body to her. She even said that I was the only person who fit all of her qualifications and it sounded like she didn't even interview anyone else. 

I was alarmed and I froze...badly. And my strategy was to just fawn/people please with her until I could leave. It felt like a nightmare.

On top of that, I am on my period and feeling more emotional than usual, trying to set boundaries with my dysfunctional family, and it was my third interview in two days. 

I almost broke down crying in my car from all of the masking I have had to do lately.. and I felt sick after this particular ""interview."" I'm so disillusioned right now. 

I was a very good student growing up...but it all seems so pointless and stupid now. But, I have to play this stupid game to live.

Most anywhere you go
And his holdings are in Texas
And his name is Diamond Joe

And he carries all his money
In a diamond-studded jaw

He never took much trouble
With the process of the law


I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys
Did offer him my hand
He gave a string of horses
So old they could not stand
And I nearly starved to death, boys
He did mistreat me so
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe


Now his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat you couldn't chaw
Nearly drove me crazy
With the wagging of his jaw
And the telling of his story
I Mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder
That could lie like Diamond Joe


Now, I tried three times to quit him
But he did argue so
I'm still punching cattle
In the pay of Diamond Joe
And when I'm called up yonder
And it's my time to go
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe"

Six weeks ago Jessica‚Äôs  aunt (who raised her. 70s F) came in several days in a row to volunteer, and it was like a switch flipped. Like one day everything was normal and we were comrades doing our best in a shitty system. And the next day Jessica couldn‚Äôt stand me and was acting super out of character. It has become so toxic in the last 6 weeks I have no clue why. 

Like I walked in the third day Jessica‚Äôs aunt volunteered and the first thing another aide told me was that Jess sent a nasty gram email to the principal about the janitor, saying he never cleans. But that‚Äôs not true. I know bc I‚Äôm there everyday when he comes in.  Turns out her aunt walked in that morning and started going off about a disgusting smell in the bathroom (which only she could perceive. No one else smelled anything) and Jess responded by firing off an email claiming our janitor never cleans anything. It could have lost the dude his job if the security cameras hadn‚Äôt shown him doing all the things she claimed he didn‚Äôt. 

The same day she sent that email, she stopped talking to me. Like if I ask her a question or share info about a student, she just started saying, ‚ÄúOk‚Äù and nothing else. Like I could say, ‚ÄúThis student just punched me and my nose is bleeding‚Äù and she‚Äôd just say ‚ÄúOh. Ok. Cool.‚Äù And ignore me. That same day her aunt yelled at me in front of students for ‚Äúslacking off.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know what I did. I‚Äôm doing the same work with the same kids I have all year. Yhe kids and parents have no complaints. Jess didn‚Äôt either. The only thing that changed was the week her aunt volunteered. Another aide told me that her aunt was ranting about how I wasn‚Äôt working hard enough ( I have breast cancer and have to sit down most of the time, but I‚Äôm always tutoring or helping kids when I do) because I wasn‚Äôt on my feet as much as she was.

And now suddenly Jess is belittling me at every opportunity. Like she started saying no to all my suggestions and ideas for students, but will say yes to the same idea if someone else brings it up. And she gives me one syllable answers to every question (usually, ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù),and leaves me out of meetings and discussions about the kids I‚Äôm assigned to. 

On Friday, I interrupted one of those meetings when I heard they were asking what strategies help a specific kid I work with.i interrupt them and say I can answer that question if they just ask me and include me. And suddenly Jess is yelling at me. She just kept yelling ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the magic bullet??  Tell us. Since you know everything! Tell us! Tell us!!‚Äù 

And I‚Äôm so shocked she‚Äôx yelling  at me in front of all the other aides. So I freeze. Shw keeps yelling at me and I‚Äôm trying to keep my cool. So I count to ten and quietly tell her I need a couple minutes to collect my thoughts and communicate clearly. And she rolls her eyes, throws her hands up, and yells that she doesn‚Äôt know why she puts up with me. Students and coworkers heard everything. She stormed out of the room immediately. 

Since then, she refuses to speak to me. Won‚Äôt look at me, or respond to verbal questions or emails, nothing. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt exist. 

We have parent teacher conferences next week and I know it‚Äôs going to be passive aggressive and more of the same.  The parents deserve better than being just another way to punish me. So I‚Äôm meeting with the principal tomorrow to discuss how her giving me the silent treatment is hurting the kids most of all and ask for help working throigh all this hostility. If I was inconsiderate of her aunt somehow, I would totally apologize and make I t right. But the other aides say I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, and this happens every ear when her aunt volunteers ‚Äî she nitpicks Jess and picks a scapegoat. 

I feel crazy and need help knowing what to say to the principal. Like how do I protect myself and sound reasonable when the problem is ‚ÄúMy boss is being mean to me because her auntie doesn‚Äôg like me.‚Äù I‚Äôm looking for a new job but need this until  I find one.And it‚Äôs not fair for the kids and parents to have to deal with this passive aggressive crap.

Where they can't automate, they're ""restructuring"" to be considered a casual part time job with a full time workload and we're not suppose to notice. They want the option to kick people out without warning and make people tolerate garbage conditions.

It was the 90s about the time I got my first cell phone. My imidiate boss gave me a job to fill out some wiring diagrams from some printed sheets. This is essentially just typing, tons of numbers, tons of opportunity for transposition\\human error. Not to mention boring. So I called the field engineer (that created the printed list) on my cell phone and asked for the digital source files which he sent to me, no questions asked. (It was common in those days for every desk to have a phone but this employer didn't provide any because it would distract from your work...) 

I took the digital docs and wrote a simple program to extract the text and paste it to the appropriate wiring diagram turning weeks of work into a 2 day job. Faster and 100% accurate. Efficient worker right? Hero on the job? Wrong. I was reprimanded for not doing as I was told. On top of this insult, I was reprimanded for talking on my phone. 

In the middle of the process a higher boss, department head came through the office as i was watching my program run, 100 times faster than manual typing. noticing I wasn't working because my fingers weren't on the keyboard. I was fired the next day.

Fine with me. I don't want to work with you pricks anyway. But a fellow employee told me later that they brought everyone into a meeting and told them it was ""my way or the highway"" . You do as you are told or you can leave right now. The new guy they hired to replace me got up and walked out that very minute, in the middle of the meeting...

I am working in a truly toxic workplace. Colleagues are dropping like flies because they either quit or fall ill. Most of them for the same reason as why I am feeling depressed: a toxic workplace with a boss who favors their ‚Äúfriends‚Äù over those who actually work and a human resource department that is incompetent and non-understanding of people‚Äôs situations. Because of this, our department is filled with toxic colleagues, mostly her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, who have this belief of superiority and ‚Äúmake scenes‚Äù on the daily.

I'm a Senior Engineer with a large, multinational chemical company.  The previous Principal Engineer left the company 2 years ago.  We also lost 2 other Senior Engineers within that month to transitions, so I was doing the work of 4 people.  It took 10 months before 2 replacement engineers were hired and complete training. I was the only person on call, weekend and nights during that time, including Hurricane coverage during 2 storms (near miss, thankfully).   Since then, I've started taking on the Principal Engineer's tasks and leading an LSS Black Belt project.  None of which is in my job description.

When I agreed to the BB project and the Principal Engineer's tasks last October, I told him I expected a promotion to Principal Engineer.  2 weeks ago, during our one-on-one meeting, I reminded him of the tasks I had accepted and the promotion.  He said he put my name in for promotion, but couldn't give me a timeline.  Yesterday, he grilled me on my BB project.  Timeline, what the expected savings were, etc.  It wasn't a casual conversation, or a typical catch-up conversation.  It was rapid-fire, question after question, like he was looking for holes in my project or looking for excuses not to support my promotion.

After sleeping on it, I set up a meeting with HR to find out if he even put my name in the hat for promotion and what the expected timeline is. I'm fully prepared to demand a transition to another department and start over as senior engineer, and immediately squash my BB project and Principal Engineer duties if he lied about putting me up for promotion, in addition to kicking this higher up the ladder.   If denied promotion, I for damn sure am dropping the BB project and PE duties.

Just frustrated and feel like I'm being strung along."

472,2024-05-29,Fired after reporting a coworker,u/unicorn_dave,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d3et1s/fired_after_reporting_a_coworker/,antiwork,"I was fired recently after reporting an incident where a coworker attacked and threatened me. It's a small food-packaging company, and I was left alone in the warehouse with this coworker who I'll call Steven. I'd had some previous issues with Steven -- when managers weren't around he liked to shout orders at me, even though he'd started several months after me and wasn't my ""superior"". I'd asked Steven to speak more respectfully to me and told the manager about Steven shouting at me, but nothing was done. 

Anyway, one day recently we're left alone and Steven starts in on me again. He wants me to help him with something he's working on, even though I'm busy with another task I was assigned to complete before helping him. He calls me a lazy bastard and a stupid f*ck. I tell him to watch how he talks to me. Then he gets in my face and bumps my chest and points his finger at my eye and asks what I'm gonna do about it. I tell him he needs to back off. He shoves me and walks away, hurling insults over his shoulder. At this point, I take out my phone and begin recording, so that I can show the manager his behavior and maybe something will finally be done about it. When Steven turns around and sees my phone out, he gets livid and rushes at me, shoving me and trying to rip the phone out of my hand. I wrestle it from him and walk away, and go outside and call my boss. While I'm on the phone with the boss, Steven again comes up to me trying to grab the phone from me, grabbing on my arms and shoving at me, shouting at me and trying to shout to the boss through the receiver not to believe what I'm saying. I hang up and out the phone in my pocket and Steven gets in my face again and tells me how if he loses this job because of me, he'll have nothing else to lose and nothing to stop him from coming to my house and ""f*king killing"" me. 

So I formally report all this to the boss. Then, the next day I come into work and the boss takes me aside. He asks if I really want him to investigate the issue, and explains to me how much work it'll make for him, and how busy he already is. I say yeah, I want him to do whatever he needs to do to make sure Steven's held accountable. He says, ""It's not like he boxed you in the nose or anything."" I inform him that you don't need to box someone in the nose for it to be assault. He says, ""In the past we've had situations where employees had a fight and they were able to work it out between themselves, like men."" I'm flabbergasted by this. I tell him I think Steven's behavior was unacceptable and that I don't feel safe being left alone at the warehouse with Steven and that I sincerely hope they'll consider disciplary action for him. The boss, as if he hasn't heard me, says, ""OK, well why don't you take a couple hours to consider what you want to do and meanwhile I'll call the HR company and see what I'm supposed to do.""

So I go about my day, stunned by the response. Then, on my lunch break, the boss comes up to me and hands me a sealed envelope and tells me to take the rest of the day off to cool down.

I open up the envope and it's a formal letter saying that I have a mandatory performance review meeting scheduled for the following day, and informs me that if my performance is determined unsatisfactory I may face discipline including dismissal.

I'm five months into working there at this point. My probation period is six months. Up to this point, I've never had a review meeting. I've never been given any negative feedback or points I've needed to improve on.  So a sudden performance review meeting on such short notice, just after I've reported an incident at work, is highly dubious. It's clear to me it's a pretext to fire me in retaliation for reporting the assault.

Which is exactly what happens. When I show up to the meeting the next day, the boss reads off a script, reminding me of the terms of my probationary period, and telling me that they've observed unsatisfactory performance on my part. I ask for specific examples. The only example he gives is that I was observed using my cell phone at work and breaking company policy by recording a coworker. I ask him if he's referring to the video I took of Steven while he was attacking me. He says yes, that was a breach of policy. ""Even though I was recording for my personal safety?"" He says yes and tells me I'll hear from them about their decisionin the next couple days. 

The next day I get a letter terminating my employment. "

I've been trying to break into something tech related since my degree isn't much help, so I figured I could gain some skills and grind my way to something resembling a decent paycheck. After getting some CompTIA certs a few months ago I finally snagged a field tech job at a small firm. It had a lot of local government clients, which promised stability you don't usually see in tech. I thought I was well on my way! Or so I thought...

My first clue this firm was going to be difficult was that they took their sweet time sending a confirmation+contract after they said they'd hire me. I was sweating out having to walk back the two weeks notice I'd given to my then current job, a dysfunctional operation where the relief shift workers were constantly late and never punished for it (It was also next to a chicken slaughterhouse and dog food factory, 0/10 do not recommend).

It was only after they found time in their ""busy"" schedules they finally sent me the email (which needed to be corrected to the actual state I'd be working in). Eventually I got a phone call a few days later as they suddenly remembered they needed to give me some training and equipment for fieldwork. After a week or two of in office and field training, mixed with some hands on work to clear up issues that had cropped up since the last field tech had been at the sites, I figured was set with a decent paying entry level job that would lead to bigger and better things. 

Except as the weeks creeped by I realized I was in a dead end job. And not just any dead end job, but the most dead end job I had ever worked. All the issues at the clients sites were basically handled by the end of the first month. In fact I had so little to do my commute time took longer than my daily ""preventative maintenance"" visits (I had a long commute to be fair). Some clients actually got annoyed I visited them so often because my company would rather keep me busy with make-work visits than just have me on call. The equipment I was working on was nothing special, and honestly I felt my skills atrophy as the only thing I ended up doing on most visits was to make sure windows was updated on the computers.

Now I'm not stupid, I realized I would be first to be made redundant if the company cut back. But I figured I'd wait at least until the six month mark before putting my resume out there because if my tenure was any shorter it might send red flags. And to be frank I wanted a little time before going back onto the grind of a job search. I was covering a whole city and helping set up operations in another. Plus the company was talking a big game of expanding their clientele now that they had me covering the area, so I figured I had some time.

That is until one afternoon as the work hours were winding down I found myself locked out of my work email suddenly. The next morning I got the phone call confirming what I suspected, they were terminating my position. There really wasn't any incident or warning, just the company CEO politely telling me I didn't have a job there since they didn't need me anymore. I went from hired to fired in four months. It was cold comfort I wasn't the only one since I had seen notices that one or two other people weren't with the company anymore the same week.

I guess it was naive to think I could skate by for much longer like that, but it feels ridiculous that they went through all the trouble of hiring me and training me just to let me go so quickly. I had to buy new car since my old paid off one was on it's last legs, so now I'm stuck with the payments without an income to support it. I'd almost call it malicious if I didn't know how incompetent they were. So now I'm unemployed and I'll be having a heck of a time applying for benefits since I was working in multiple states so I'll have to untangle that mess to figure out if I'm even eligible for any. 

The job wasn't the worst I've ever had, but it was probably the most disappointing. Getting a foot in the door just to have someone slam it shut and break your toes is no fun. If there's any lesson I've taken away it's to trust your instincts if you think your company is dumb. I could tell my companies software didn't really provide much value (mostly because the clients barely used it.), so I knew pretty early I wasn't getting any busier anytime soon. 

I've bounced back from worse, so I'll probably be fine. Just remember folks, lots of companies have dead end jobs that can turn into grenades if you're unlucky enough to get hired for one. Just another minefield to navigate in the dystopia we live in."

I've never had patience for that sort of bullshit, never in my life, even before getting interested in politics/socialism.

I got weird stares at a dishwashing job from coworkers because I dared to listen to music on an iPod (after getting yelled at 3+ times for it, for zero justifiable reason) rather than just stand there, a policy enforced for zero justifiable reason.

At a pizza place they gave drivers these new GPS tracker things which poorly monitored your speed, acceleration rate, etc and broadly, proudly displayed a ""standings"" system with everyone's ""driving quality"" ""score"" and location on a giant screen. Completely ruined the job, now you basically had a boss over your shoulder every second, you couldn't take a break or even go with the flow of traffic because they expected you to be going 55 on the freeway. I would always try to use the broken ones so I wasn't constantly tracked while getting paid $2.50/hr for the privilege and the most reddit-ass bastard I ever met IRL kept making a big deal about it. Got 'written up' (as a 24-year-old man with a job, incidentally) and stopped showing up. The boss was also a massive dickhead and smug racist. (I tried to get time off for therapy and he jokingly wondered if it was because I was gonna blow the place up otherwise (I'm brown but not that sort of brown)). Good one.

And now I'm currently dealing with this hellworld of ATS resume scanning keyword optimization, and the tone I usually see on social media is *'oh I'm glad I know!'* [that they were blindly rejecting me because I didn't say ""culture"" in there], rather than *that is insane, this is pseudoscience, this is practically phrenology*. Can't we at least be *upset* about it, broadly?

It's like people think there's great shame in admitting you're too ""weak"" to comply with orders, any orders, no matter how belittling, the only virtuous act is to happily submit. Being treated harshly is a sign that you're tough, it seems. It seems like some people cannot get enough of that type of thing.

265,2024-05-29,Working 40-50+ hrs a week indefinitely is so exhausting it has driven me to become anti-social. My friendships and family relationships have been decay because of this and I hate it.,u/ComprehensiveRoll484,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d3gdyv/working_4050_hrs_a_week_indefinitely_is_so/,antiwork,"Today, my anti-work mentality is around how much of our daily lives we are expected to work. Even the average of 5 days a week is far, far too much in my opinion..

There is really stupid term I hear ""work vs. life balance"" but no one can explain to me how you can balance 5 days vs 2 days  on a scale and make it balanced. You cant balance 8 - 10 hours (possible commute) into 3 - 4 hours of personal time if you even have that much. I am exhausted almost all the time. And it has been commented on often so I wont harp on it too much, that even in our 'free time' is often spent just doing chores, errands, cleaning, etc and other responsibilities that are required or not able to do the rest of the time because you are working so much.

When I was in school, I had many friends. I am not trying to brag in any way, I just mean to say that I was a very social person. I also went to a private school with a different schedule routine so I was able to hangout with friends more often. Even outside of school I would go to these friends houses sometimes for multiple days in a week. If I would convince my parents, I would leave school go to Billy's house, sleepover, carpool or take bus to school, then go to Jimmy's house the next night, and maybe swing by another party and so on.  I went out a lot and had many interactions, parties, concerts, and genuine social moments with friends and family. 

Flash forward to today and after working fulltime almost constantly for 10 years for with very little time off. ( I also had a medical issue, went on ShortTerm Disability, but this forced me to used up all my PTO I had accrued for years at my last job. that day I learned if you go on disability you are forced to use all PTO ( at least in the US, in state and company I worked in. ) 

So anyways, I have about 5 friends left that I still talk to. I think mainly because I turned down so many more invitations to hangout and events over the years I couldnt attend because I was working all the time. Or these friends or events would spring up and difficult to plan around  - they call me up and say ""hey want to go X place and do this?""  on a tuesday and me: "" yea I do but  I am working right now or have to go home and cook/clean/setup for next work segment in 7 more hours from now""  

Like I could drive 1hr 30 min to see a friend, hang out for 1hr and then just have to come home. I COULD do it. and sometimes I did, for the few friends I was able to keep. But that is exhausting and with the amount of friends I had from school, it wasnt really viable to even do that if I wanted to maintain other responsibilities alongside work. I really felt like for my physical health, I had to *pick and choose which family and friends* that I had the energy to spend time with. Thats kinda messed up right?

I know there is talk of 4day work week push, but I still dont think thats enough... And some are already willing to compromise with making those 4days contain the 10hrs ( i. e. you still working those avg 40hrs just added to your 4 days making longer days.

For some types of jobs, and salaried positions, on call, time sensitive work. I fear this will not be resolved with the 4day work week. I think we need contracts in writing - that worked can fully shut-off all work devices and communications on those other 3days off.

If am being real, I think 2 or 3 days would be healthy work week. I understand thats unrealistic right now, and that perhaps only rich people are able to do this right now.

But if I had to pick what I think is a *reasonable* amount of Work vs Life balance? it would be completely flipped. 2 or 3 days a week, or 20 hours of work per week I think for me would be a HEALTHY amount of time for the rest my mental health and physical health.

And to be fair, If you love working and have a job you are passionate about. Thats totally fine! I am not saying you shouldnt be allowed to work more than 20hrs. If you love your job, and want to work more (maybe an independent artist/craftsman?) then by all means, you work as many hours as you want to. 

My point is about mental health and physical health and becoming anti-social I think was negative for my mental health. As I shut myself in because I am depressed and exhausted all the time from work that I struggle to make time for friends and family.

If I had more free time, I would make an effort to visit friends and family more often. I would also like to volunteer in my community, but I dont have much time for that either.

If I ever get in a position where I can decide how many days or hours one should HAVE to work to survive, I am shooting for the stars. 3 days I am serious.

Sorry for the ranting. I just wish there was an end in sight, and wish I could afford my own home with two median incomes.."

I used to love working there this first few weeks, the cooworkers are amazing but this boss is just a menace. She screams at me for any small wrong thing i do. I literally feel like she hates me. I am constantly stressed when she comes there and she made me cry multiply times already. She also says something and then changes is in next few weeks. For example when i came there first time she said that she can give me 2 weeks off at summer time. Now she is saying that she told me it was only 1 week which is not true because i remember this conversation and after that i told my parents and partner it was 2 weeks off. Another example: when we were walking home together she told me she could even give me 3 weeks off because she wouldnt pay me for it anyway so i thought it would be nice to have 3 weeks off and travel to my boyfriend so i ask her about it and she kept saying that im wrong and that originaly it was supposed to be 1 week and all rhe screaming. And i have another example: she told me to wash the bathroom but she never specified when so i washed it in the next day and she screamed at me for that. Like she actually made me cry because i wasnt supposed to clean the bathroom then but in a week which nobody ever told me. Since then im very jumpy around her and sensitive. Anything she tells me makes me wanna cry. I hate her and i know she hates me. I dont know what to do, how to please her. I think our personalities are just not connecting well.

The last time she missed work was because she was admitted to a hospital, the one she works at, for an infection and covid. She let her boss know that she was in the hospital and provided a note from the hospital, that she both worked at and was admitted to. to her boss. When she returned to work she was fired for absences and denied unemployment for ""misconduct"". I told her to request a hearing. We did ten minutes of research to find (what we already knew) that, missing work because you went to the hospital and provided a dr's note is generally NOT misconduct and cannot serve as the basis to deny a UIB claim.

Vibe does not care to fix kitchen equipment such as fryers, ovens, replace things such as seasoning shakers, ect or even bother to fix infrastructure (our ceiling was caving in for about six months even after I told our district manager that it been slowly saghing and caving in more), we had no doorknob on the back door for two months (we had a literal hole where it used to be so someone could just slip their hand in and slide the deadbolt on the door if they really wanted to and rob us during the night), and almost everyone in upper management is awful. 

I've worked for two different companies franchised out by them and it was miserable. Work place bullying and harassment isn't cared for until the one doing the bullying doesn't show up to work, raises are non existent even if promised, and verbal and emotional abuse from management is 100% allowed. I once got a call from the former district manager berating me for making a prep item two hours before open just because he saw it on camera I was doing it in the lobby. I wasn't supposed to be there that day. The tables and lobby were clean and I was wearing gloves. It wasn't some major contaminant for food safety. I was making ranch. 

Want to report wage theft, sexual harassment, abuse, health violations, ect ect ect to HR? DONT BOTHER! HR will let the phone ring until you threaten legal action over email. One of my former coworkers is a minor with them knowing he was a minor and they decided fo make him a general manager (he was 15) despite the fact I'm pretty confident it's against the law in the state I'm in and heavily violates company policy. The best part is that they've stolen countless hours of overtime from him in the past and I've seen it. Two months ago (he was no longer in management lol) he noticed that he was missing an entire eight hours from total pay period and sure enough when I looked someone had deleted an entire shift he had that day that he had physically worked. He didn't even bother contacting HR because they constantly ignored his calls and even higher ups ignored him. Coworkers in a different company I worked for under Vibe had a massive, massive day drinking problem and would even give it to minors. Both HR and upper management knew this and did nothing. 

I'm only writing this post because I'm no longer working for them by tomorrow. If any of their media scanning dickheads are reading this or see this. Kiss my ass. Oh yeah, did I also mention they try to track your social media?"

Unfortunately, I lost all contacts from my military service, and my supervisor at my previous job had a hostile attitude toward me after I submitted my two weeks' notice. They will contact the references directly, so I will provide you with more details about my background if needed. In exchange, I can serve as a reference for you in the future.

 I generally like my job and my colleagues. Upper management is toxic in my department though. Ultimately,  it's one bad leader overextended himself into a position he should have never had. He bullies, micromanages, believes might makes right. Disrespectful to the team, constantly negative, and EVERYTHING IS URGENT!!! He's made some comments about having his ass handed to him by his boss, so it seems like he's on somebody else's shit list. He's not very well-liked with upper management and lower level people alike.

 I need this job and don't want to risk it, but I also wish others were aware of the situation because it's becoming untenable for me. I'm close to breaking."

It‚Äôs too complicated now to prove anything above meets expectations. They also want to enforce a MINIMUM of 65% of employees be meets expectation. 

All while stating that because our expectations are so high, it makes sense. Okay, but what about compensation?

Today we were told that they will continue to not take into account inflation/cost of living for pay increases which was the one thing everyone was asking for. They also want to ‚Äútake back meets expectations‚Äù to rehabilitate its image as a punishment - but if the raise does not at least match inflation it is a reduction in pay and it IS a punishment.

After that was brought up, the presenters talked about how we are basically responsible for choosing where/how we live and that the ‚Äúsunshine tax‚Äù on living at a certain standards is our responsibility and not theirs. It was giving ‚Äústop buying avocado toast and lattes.‚Äù

They showed off some chart with no labels to try and drive home the point but I am happy to say many people did not fall in line with their thinking - all management in the meeting, so hopefully we made enough noise‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not optimistic. Insert some fluffy explanation about how this will encourage competition between employees and we need to GRIND for the company (neither of these align with my leadership philosophies).

Instead they are going to roll out ‚Äúalternative incentives and rewards‚Äù for employees - wonder what toppings we will be able to get on our virtual pizzas."

Our company was acquired a while back, and this year we qualified for company raises and their bonus program. 

Since, then they acquired another company that specializes in another part of my field. 

Come to find out they were brought on because of a high value client that promply ended their contract.

They set organic growth goals in the upper 20%... last year... we're in tech and marketing...

Because of this, our raises were capped at 3%. I ended up making 35 extra dollars every two weeks. 

So of course we didn't make our ridiculous goal, but the company was ""kind enough"" to offer a 3% bonus instead of the original 13% off we got our goals. 

These bastards took the 3% out of the 13% instead of our base salary. My bonus is 200 before I get taxed for the bonus. 

But wait! It gets better! We're salaried employees that are supposed to be capped at 40 hours. They haven't hired anyone (besides a shit ton of c suite and pm/ industries people) and the new acquisition is still sucking the cock of the client that leaving so they have no training on our side. 

There's no way we are going to meet deadlines without going over. I volunteered to do overtime or overtime in lieu pto. I was told they're probably going to bring in a freelance contractor they know that is going to cost god knows what and isn't familiar with our campaigns.

I work for a fairly new company. It's just me, my manager, and a couple other people trying to get this thing off the ground. I originally took the job because it paid well, and I was doing my manager a favor. He's a family friend, and I was happy to help him out. We'll call him Dan.

My job has quickly grown beyond just ""helping out"", and while I'm grateful for the opportunity to grow with the company, Dan's idea of jobsite training is ""figure it out."" For context, I work in an office job. I have no business training (other than a few basic courses I took on my¬†*own*¬†time), and even though I've been to uni, my degree is in a completely different field. I can say with confidence I have no idea how to build a company, and don't have much insight when it comes to the business field. But I try my best with what I know, ask questions when I have them, and do my damndest to make sure my role benefits the workplace.

Welp, earlier this week I found out that wasn't enough. Dan called me into a meeting, and the room REEKED like beer. Dan was obviously super intoxicated. He proceeded to say that I was not living up to the expectations he'd had when he hired me. He'd been hoping I'd be someone who could provide insight into building the business and helping it grow, and I wasn't doing that. I had no idea what to say. Hell, I didn't even know if he knew what he was saying.

Up until this point, I hadn't been aware there had been any problem with how I was doing my job. Dan likes to brag to customers that I'm the heart and soul of the operation, so this genuinely threw me for a loop. I asked him where I was failing to meet his expectations, and he couldn't give me an answer. I repeated the question several times during the meeting and he would always deflect. Honestly, I don't think he has a clear idea of what he wants from me.

On a side note, I am fully aware that Dan is drinking his family to ruin, so seeing that he can't even keep the beer to after hours pisses me off. I understand addiction is a bitch, and is incredibly difficult to beat, but the man isn't even trying.

So, if anyone has any tips or advice what to do in this situation, hmu. Right now my plan is to grin and bear it until I can find a different job that will allow me to keep putting food on the table."

My manager was not present, in fact only HR and my previous manager was (even though I do not report to her) and they mentioned that I had not made improvements since April (yet they gave me a 1.5% raise last month?). So from April to May, how the fuck am I supposed to make drastic improvements with only speaking with my manager twice? She is not involved in any of my projects and our status meetings moved to another Sr. Program manager where I requested below; see link.

During my performance review (April), I was frustrated as I have the highest success rate in my department and my manager said in June we'd work on my development in the company which never happened. Additionally, my coworker mentioned that they were hiring more people in the same role as me from Argentina (1/3 of the cost) and 1 of them is starting in June. I haven't filed for unemployment as every time I try to fill out the application I'm stricken by grief. 

I feel this is unfair and to top it off, they said my benefits are only covered until end of May which is 3 days. As I'm writing this, it feels strategically executed. Has anyone else gone through this before or can you offer any advice?

I install alarm, door and camera systems for very big military industrial complex sites, pretty much all of the ones that come to your mind (US)

  
Well a part of these installations involve a very thorough yearly inspection with intense documentation. These inspections seem miniscule and a PITA to the technicians performing them and the escort that brings us through these top secret rooms but people in very high places have a big interest in these because of government regulations on these rooms. If they were to ever get audited on their SCIF rooms these corporations run the risk of decommissioning these areas - meaning lots and lots and lots of weapons wont be shipped to unalive brown people in foreign countries (less money to be made) 

  
When I started my job at this company, during my training period I was paired up with our only service technician - whom was very vocal about active job seeking - to conduct one of these inspections at a site with 5 buildings (believe it or not this is actually pretty small compared to some of the places ive been but they bring in a lottttt of service call money) 

  
Of course he half assed it in bizarre ways that I tried correcting him on, such as making the escort sign and date one sheet of paper and then printing that page for every room inspected, Not taking note of the date or time any of the rooms were inspected and not double checking with the monitoring company that they've recieved all signals among  other crucial details. Keep in mind this inspection occurred over the course of almost an entire week that the customer paid us for. Anyone with eyes could tell this thing was basically forged within a few seconds of skimming. 

  
Believe it or not its not my coworkers fault. They basically through this massive binder at him and said ""get it done :)"" because the tech who normally performs these things quit. 

  
Anyways months go by and I get a hectic phone call from the sales guy telling me to meet with pretty much everyone involved internally with the inspections. Blah blah blah its forged blah blah blah we cant do that and we basically came up with a plan to ""forge and forgive"" where we'd basically redo the paperwork based on the alarm signals I had forwarded to my email - because you know, I was the only one who stopped to think ""hmm these sound important"" 

  
And because I was the one with the signals and because I have a knack for being thorough and brief I was opted for becoming the jockey for this thing. What's funny is there wasn't a single shred of hostility in that meeting because they knew how serious correcting this was. 

  
**The companies entire top secret credibility in the entire state basically relied on me forging and signing off on these documents**



*Well technically they could probably get away with it for a little while more but in the case of an audit my company would be completely fucked and would be stripped of their certification for this stuff and this client in particular has had it up to here with us so no doubt they'd at least skim the documents*



Originally I was okay with it because I was gonna use it as ""encouragement"" for a hefty raise but time went on, I was still a tech and was never slotted any time to do these things and we ffw to today, mid busy season where Ive had it up to here with all of the mismanagement 

  
Ive been applying for jobs for about a month now because they simply dont pay me enough, especially for all the stuff I gotta deal with. 

  
Accepted an offer today, although the pay isnt much greater or what I wanted, its at least a union gig and they'd honestly have to try to be worse than this company



As I was at my final call I get a text message to revisit this project with a ""its okay if you run into overtime :)"" - I live an hour away from the shop btw and I started today off early. I'm assuming that this means they are running out of time to get this done. 



I havent accepted the offer at this point because the pay mentioned on the call was significantly lower than expected but I had a message from the guy saying ""please call me"" - called him at a gas station after that text and it turns out that he read last years rate and they actually bumped it up a little this year. I'll be making a dollar and change more than what im making now. Kinda disappointing tbh but its something, and they do bi annual reviews for promotion so at least theres a little hope, and they seem to be more collected than this place. 

  
Accepted the offer after I heard that and drove to the shop to ""get started"" 

  
I immediately noticed several rooms didn't have all of the alarm signals come through, meaning the rooms didnt pass or we never got to them.

The recently promoted manager had been an AGM for about a month, but never received manager pay for this whole time. Dave stopped into the store, and from what I‚Äôve heard (I was not in), called the new manager entitled for asking him to make up the money she had earned. The manager of 8 years apparently backed her up, and Dave went on to say that he and the rest of the team are ‚Äòeasily replaceable.‚Äô Mind you, this is a week after him noting that things did not run smoothly when the original manager was on vacation. Not only did he steal money from one of my former coworkers, but had the gall to call the guy who keeps the store afloat replaceable.

My last day at this job is in two days, and I start my new job in five days. They've known for nearly a year that I wouldn‚Äôt be here for the rest of 2024. I even told them when I started interviewing for new positions and kept them updated throughout the hiring process. Four weeks ago, I informed them that I received a conditional offer pending a background check. Yet, they still haven't hired anyone to replace me or even posted the job position!

I've been with this company for nearly 10 years and handle many responsibilities. My coworkers expect the owners to be in big trouble when I leave and are ready to watch the chaos unfold. Now, just days before my departure, they're scrambling to schedule training sessions to transfer my duties to others. (I made sure my coworkers asked for raises to compensate for the added responsibilities.)

I've been worrying about leaving this place, maybe because I've grown weak in my old age...  but then yesterday, I overheard the main owner calling the sick owner, asking when he would return. I asked my coworkers to let me know if the sick owner came in before my shift started. Sure enough, this morning, I received several messages saying the sick owner showed up and he's sick as all hell. At that moment, I realized how glad I am to be leaving.

The last time this owner came in sick, literally just a few months ago, the entire office was out for two weeks! I immediately called the main owner and told him I wouldn't come in unless the sick owner left. You could hear the frustration in his voice, but I wasn't fuckin around. What was he going to do? Fire me? I have a new job starting in less than a week and can't afford to get sick now. Imagine starting a new job and having to call in sick on your first day‚Äîthat is not going to be me.

I'm so glad to be done with this madness and so glad to have found this subreddit. ohhhh the stories I have to tell."

- they have 6 people working for the company and 20-30 UNPAID interns working for them at once.
- upon asking, they have no open positions and do not plan on hiring the interns, with no track to hire after.
- they plan on ‚Äúsharing any job in the industry that sounds cool‚Äù with their interns. They might know someone to refer them.
- the person overseeing the interns (1 person) is responsible for overseeing all intern departments from graphic design to social media to marketing to business. Where is the growth potential to learn? 
- they have a number of major names/companies listed on their site but upon asking what they did for these companies, they said they could not provide ANY details as there were numerous NDAs.
- they have mandatory daily zoom calls with all interns on the call at once, no other check in structure other than a shared Slack channel.

Sleeping in Attic

Hello everyone, just for context, I moved in this place for rent   and it is on the second floor with an attic that I believe was a ‚Äúkindergarten‚Äù hence the children stickers on the wall, it has carpet (that we asked the landlord initially to professionally clean) , drywall and electrical. However, the house was built in the 80‚Äôs and the attic smells stuffy.

 Anyhow, there is a room below available and I initially setup my bed there but I realized my neighbour below us snores sooooo loud it‚Äôs insane and hence I resort to sleeping in the attic, would it be safe to sleep in that attic long term? I am having chest congestion lately and not sure what to do, how can I know if the attic is ‚Äúventilated ‚Äú. 

How can society expect me to ‚Äúwork‚Äù when this is my living condition."

So my first agreement was that i was available Mondays y to sundays (i asked that only from 4pm i could work on weekdays and full time on weekends), this arrangement was alright at that moment but in my these last trimester i have more subjects on the weeks, just can‚Äôt work these times bc of timing.
 I explained the situation and asked if i could have fixed shifts on weekends, the duty manager told me that she couldn‚Äôt ensure having me on weekends only. The general manager asked me to request him on email to do a contract change so in the agreement it states my availability on weekends. I did this on the 9th of feb before starting my trimester and i got no reply till today, telling me that because of low season he may not roster me on weekends because of ‚Äúover staffing‚Äù. By the way all these time i been rostered on weekends and nothing about the subject has been mentioned. It doesn‚Äôt feel right, i have my hands tied with this.

They recently paid 3,000 to move me to a new state in a new market (Pennsylvania) to work under a boss that I use to work for in the old market (Minnesota) My old boss said he needed me because the market (Pennsylvania) they moved him to was underperforming I trusted this guy so I said why not I don't like Minnesota anyways.

I can't handle any more days, the place is horrible and it has taken a huge toll on my mental health these past few months and I want out, but this contract is holding me hostage; if I quit tomorrow let's say, I have to pay them back about $1500 (my wage is about 640 a month before tax, that's a lot, and I mean a lot where I live).

You think to yourself ""all I can provide for my wife is a crumby 1 bedroom apartment that gets no light from the sun, and we can't even afford a car."" This is my experience, frequently enough. I'm so sick of it.

People seem to love the story of Stardew Valley's creator. A single guy, living with his wife in his parents house, making this game over 6ish years of time. They struggled, but he did it! Now the game sold and went big and he can retire. Hoorah!

Retire? This guy profited, after taxes and partnership expenses, $122 million dollars! I would have had to be punching the clock for 3,430 years to make what he has made in his checking account. Back before toilets existed I would have to be scrubbing them.

I don't care how ""hard it was"" for you to make your business or product, what you ""sacrificed"" to get there. You do not deserve nor have you provided over 40 lifetimes worth of labor in value.

I've been working hard for about a decade now, and I \*still\* have $200 in my ""savings"" account. This is nonsense, 40 hour weeks for 10 years for no growth, no improvement in living conditions.

I feel like I'm failing, but I'm just average.

Edit: The responses seriously prove the misconception of what happened. People should be frustrated with the system that allows one person to profit thousands of years worth of labor for virtually no effort in relative terms. 6 years is **nothing** in comparison to 3,430."

Sometimes it‚Äôs funny, like when someone asked for ‚ÄúThe Scarlet Sweater by Nathaniel Hawthorne‚Äù and got upset when I asked if he was thinking of The Scarlet Letter. Sometimes it‚Äôs less funny, like when I got screamed at by an old man for following policy and checking that the dvds he was buying were in their cases and my manager saw what was happening and ignored my request for help. Aside from being emotionally draining, it‚Äôs physically draining work. I‚Äôm constantly shelving books, which is kind of like lifting 5lb weights above my head all day. I‚Äôm also lifting 30-50lb boxes multiple times a day. We actually just got in trouble with our mail carrier because we were filling up bags of outgoing orders more than 50lbs. It gets busy in the store. Today I did 43 register transactions in a single hour. 

My boyfriend works from home. He makes more than twice as much as I do. My days off are never on the weekend, so I‚Äôm home while he works. He gets paid twice as much as I do and does a quarter of the amount of work. He‚Äôll sit and paint models or play video games all day while he waits for clients to respond to him. He‚Äôs not a slacker. His boss has called him ‚Äútop talent‚Äù to my face. He just genuinely does not have as much work. His corporate drama sounds so benign in comparison to being threatened with a knife by a customer. He gets to wear pajamas. He gets a fucking paid lunch break.  

I‚Äôm trying to get out of my job. I‚Äôve been applying to places for over a year. Nobody wants to hire an art school dropout who‚Äôs been stuck in the same dead-end job for 3 and a half years. 

The grass on the other side of the fence is most definitely greener, but there‚Äôs an electrified barbed wire fence keeping me from it."

I like to read from the shadows. Please try not to judge me too harshly.

I have been seeing a lot of posts lately regarding companies asking employees to donate PTO to individuals who need pay but do not have the PTO to cover. I absolutely get the concept that a company can make a choice to just provide extra PTO or pay the employee, but I would like to maybe take this a step further.  
  
Here is my thought‚Ä¶.

The maximum amount of time that you can accrue for the most part is up to the company. Obviously, some states/countries have laws requiring a company to provide a specific minimum amount of time. However, outside of those laws, it is up to the company to decide how much PTO they will provide employees.

Now, PTO is paid out based on the hourly rate or salary rate broken down to the hourly of the employee who has accrued and is taking the time. What that means is that when I take PTO it is not going to pay the same as when you take PTO. ¬†There is an actual monetary value to that PTO time, and it is not the same value for me as it is for you. So, should this apply when donating PTO as well?

Here is an example for you:

The company sends out a request for PTO donations for Jane. She requires 8 hours of PTO. I am willing to donate 1 hour of my PTO to assist Jane. But I make $20 an hour and Jane only makes $10. Should that now mean that 1 hour of PTO specifically donated by me then turns into 2 hours for Jane?

Let‚Äôs turn this example around:

The company sends out a request for PTO donations for Joe. Joe requires 8 hours as well, but Joe is the CEO of the company. I say what the heck, I will help Joe buy his yacht and donate 1 hour of my PTO. I still make $20 per hour but Joe makes $40 (I know, I know so unrealistic for a CEO) so should that now only cover 30 minutes (1/2 hour) of PTO for Joe?  
  
I know that this logic isn‚Äôt foolproof and there are a lot of nuances to PTO varying by state, country, specific laws, etc. and this way of thinking may have so many holes in it. But I just can not help thinking that this horrible practice of donating PTO is even worse if you put it into this perspective.  
  
Let the discussions commence. Enjoy!"
405,2024-05-30,"Boss told me I needed to take a vacation, I asked if he had vacation money",u/Koriino06,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d3yjvp/boss_told_me_i_needed_to_take_a_vacation_i_asked/,antiwork,"During our Mid year assessment my boss told me I had too many vacation days saved up (I have 22 days I HAVE to use by EOY) and I needed to start using them soon since he didn‚Äôt want a bunch of us waiting until the end of the year to use our time. I told him I didn‚Äôt have a reason to take time off and would probably do so when school started back up so I could be more active in my kids school and their happenings. He responded by saying ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you take a vacation? You could go somewhere nice like Florida or Alaska, even traveling out of country isn‚Äôt that expensive!‚Äù I literally stopped what I was doing and said ‚Äúdo you have vacation money for me?‚Äù He was flabbergasted that I couldn‚Äôt afford a random vacation for an average sized family. 


Backstory: I‚Äôm decently employed, hate my job I guess as the people I work with are idiots and the only person I genuinely get along with is my immediate supervisor (we were friends before this job, we worked together previously and kept in touch after leaving previous company, ended up at new company together years later within a day of each other). Benefits suck but at least I have them and the rest of my family are covered in case something happens. Main benefit is working from home (told us to come back in office but only one person complied so that demand died quickly), basically being able to set my own schedule (ie as long as my work is done and emails are answered no one cares) and I WAS decently paid. I say WAS because this year our company decided not to do raises or bonuses (about $20k altogether that I‚Äôm losing out on for the year which is a lot of money) but cost of living has increased exponentially in my area. I‚Äôm talking about my expenses increased by almost $1800/month including rent, insurance, food, etc. Luckily I could almost afford the increase (it takes all my monthly disposable income and I had to stop paying on my credit card) but it‚Äôs hard to do anything that cost money as most of mine just goes to bills. 


Anyways, back to the convo: he was shocked to say the least. He asked why I didn‚Äôt have anything saved up or put aside for something like this. I asked him how he was able to afford his stuff and he said he wasn‚Äôt affected too much by the lack of bonus and raise because he owns everything and all his money goes to investing (his investments pay for his monthly expenses so he literally doesn‚Äôt use his check for anything) and that if I owned my car and had a house (I rent) then I could afford to do a vacation. Long story short I tried to explain the difference between his growing up and mine in the current economy and it quickly turned into a boomer v millennial showdown. I gave up and told him I wasn‚Äôt going to be taking a vacation and that I‚Äôll be saving it up until the end of the year so they‚Äôll have more to pay out when I leave. Havent heard from him since. My immediate supervisor said he‚Äôs freaking out because he thinks I‚Äôm trying to leave and should be grateful for being in a better position than most. Her response to him? ‚ÄúMaybe you should invest in his vacation since you don‚Äôt need the additional funds?‚Äù Apparently he is contemplating it so may be a win for me?

After working in the front desk of various hotels, I finally got a back office job at the commercial department. Everything was great. 9-5, not having to work on weekends or bank holidays, and I get to see a total 0 customers/clients throughout the day, which is a BIG relief.

However, I do not understand why my company (european) does not let us WFH. It's nonsense since I do not have to deal with any meetings (really) or do any visit in my hotel. But since WFH in my industry is not a very common thing, I kinda let it go.

But, and this the reason of my post, I do not understand why:

1- We have to wear uniform (shirt with a tie, black dress pants)

2- We can't wear a polo on summer. Thing is, people working on the rooftop wear polos. It is common sense since it is almost summer, temperatures are high and they may sweat. That's fine!! But for whatever reason, upper management can't allow me, an office worker, to wear any kind of short sleeved polo/shirt. 

I told this to my boss, who (I want to believe) told the hotel director. I don't know when did this ""request"" happen, but her answer was that him (hotel director) wasn't giving in. 

Fair to say that I love my job and I really like what I do, along with my office mates. But this kinds of things drive me crazy. I had to let it all out and if I'm wrong, let me know. I'd like to know your POV."

I graduated with a degree in finance years ago only to find getting a job with few connections to be nearly impossible.

It wasn‚Äôt the worst thing in the world though, i was a restaurant server in a high income area making pretty good money and it paid the bills. However, I still wanted more, some sort of fulfillment. And, yeah, I wanted to live well and make a fucking boatload by doing something interesting.

I bought into the bootstraps bullshit, the ‚Äúhard work will pay off‚Äù bullshit. I sat in coffee shops every day off and became productive for hours. Some days I would read new shit, others I would try to take Udemy classes to learn new skills, many days I would apply for jobs and cold email recruiters and hiring managers.

Well, eventually I was able to land an entry level gig in accounting making okay money but probably less than I was making as a server. And that was fine cause it was just a start and I would show what I could do.

Well that was when the corporate politics hit me like a freight train. My ‚Äúteammates‚Äù were two early twenty-something girls who pretty much made my life a living hell from day one. I was treated like shit pretty much on a daily basis, I would be thrown under the bus constantly. They basically teamed up on me to promote themselves and make an example of me. Eventually my manager began to treat me like shit too because of them and it was just a misery. Not to mention they expected you to pull 60-80 hour weeks with no OT.

In November I reached a breaking point and contacted my old job where I was a server and they took me back and since then I‚Äôve been so much happier. It has its own bullshit but what I was doing was so soul crushing that I haven‚Äôt looked back.

Unfortunately, my mother doesn‚Äôt feel as I do. She refuses to say it but she is definitely looking down her nose at me and feels ashamed that I‚Äôm a lowly server now and not doing something with my degree. I keep telling her I‚Äôll look for something else, but the reality is, I‚Äôm so disillusioned by the whole idea of corporate bullshit that I don‚Äôt know if I even want it anymore, even though I wanted it so bad before. I rather be happy doing this, instead of being miserable but doing something that people think highly of."

I used to lurk on this subreddit a ton about \~10 months ago coming out of uni. It took me over 7 months to find a full time SWE job post graduation. I majored in CS w a minor in math which was fairly difficult for me so my GPA wasn't ***amazing*** for the programming jobs I was applying too and I didn't have a strong network. With that being said, I went to a T2 university in the US and had several internships under my belt.

I'm guessing the layoffs in my industry didn't help, but I eventually landed something. Since then, I've been working as a SWE in San Francisco for the past five months and I've made some observations from recent developments that I think might be somewhat interesting to people here.

**AI Screening All Resumes**

* This is obvious to most people, but I don't think everyone realizes how advanced this has actually gotten. A year ago, your resume was being screened with certain keyword identifiers (E.g. in my case, looking at my GPA, school I went to, etc.). It's becoming substantially more advanced though.
* In the near future, your resume is going to be screened from top to bottom and assigned a quantitive score based on criteria and be given a subsequent score; it will also be weighted against all other resumes that come in.
* I've literally talked to people in the valley that are actively working on tools that can have an AI autonomously look into your socials and flag it if it comes across any undesirable content or information. This can even be extrapolated out to a recruiter or company analyzing all emails the come in from cold emails from potential hires and automatically looking at their LinkedIns and providing a score. I think this part will be adopted slower because there can be a lot of areas this could go wrong.
* We all know the phrase: **""Qualitative to Quantitative""**. The reality is, the goal is to reduce everyone to a number. This is already how dating apps work with ELOs, it makes complete sense the job market is on this trajectory as well. My point here is that what we've seen so far will only become more automated. This isn't even mentioning the AI startups working on creating hyper realistic sounding humans that act as interviewers to initially screen candidates before a real person does.

**AI Finding jobs and autonomously filling out Job Applications**

* Phase one of this has effectively already started. At first, I think this conceptually sounds amazing, but it also has serious implications that I'll elaborate on after I walk through an example of how it's happening that I found out about last week.
* The team behind PayPal (Yu Pan, co-founder of PayPal) created an AI lab that is a semi-competitor to Google & GPT. The company is backed by Peter Thiel (former CEO of PayPal) and Roelof Botha (former CFO of PayPal). It's an AI that you email**,** it's called Mindy ([**Source - free for those wondering**](https://mindy.com/)). It can scrape the entire internet and provide AI responses to questions. Although it's not meant to find jobs specifically, this is something people are using it for. You give it a list of companies or tell it what you're looking for + give it your resume and it will autonomously compile a list of links to apply on the website, indeed, LinkedIn, etc etc.. It's also able to give responses based on your resume for specific questions on a job application. If anyone knows of others would be curious to know as well and can edit it in this post.
* This already speeds up job search a ton as is, but over time, you can easily imagine how this can start autonomously taking actions on websites given your resume and information as input. I give it a year or less.
* Again, this sounds fantastic but there's major implications here. Sure, the first adopters of any tool benefit disproportionately. You can rapidly find jobs and eventually have an AI do the entire process end to end which helps combat the current horrible system. But what happens when **everyone** is doing this? Everyone from all over the world (meaning cheaper labor) and also fiercer competition because ideal candidates will be applying to every job.

**Conclusion:**

With rising levels of automation due to AI, job loss is going to be severely exasperated and this entire automated job screening and application process will only heighten how weird of a situation this all is. This was slightly a rant and I just wanted to share what's actually going on that's going to cause recruiting to be more weird. My only take away is use tools that benefit you while you can if you aren't already. Things are about to get very strange not just from a recruiting perspective, but societally. Only winning move is to fight fire with fire."

0,2024-05-30,"I hated work so I worked hard, saved up, and retired early, but now I'm depressed and feel empty",u/zldu,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d45j4e/i_hated_work_so_i_worked_hard_saved_up_and/,antiwork,"This is a rant.

15 years ago I was having a discussion with a co-worker, I was complaining that while I liked the day-to-day job back then, I really didn't want to spend another 40 years just ""doing work"". So I decided then that I would work hard to earn a lot of money, live frugally, save money, invest, and retire early.

So that time has come, I now basically have a passive income off of investments, I quit my job a few months ago and I'm (relatively) free as a bird (until the economy crashes and my investments are worthless). Just to be clear I'm not super rich: I can afford monthly expenses and have a little bit leftover for fun stuff, but I can't go to crazy expensive parties, buy a lot of crap, and have 10 faraway vacations each year or whatever.

It was fun for the first 2 weeks, I was doing some personal software development projects, playing some games, going outside a lot to enjoy the weather.

But ever since, I've just been depressed. I've been thinking, what am I doing it all for, what's the point? Now I'm not working for another 25 years (and beyond), but what _am_ I doing for the next 30-40 years until I die? I basically have a completely empty life. I achieved my goal of not having to work, but I feel it turns out my goal was wrong.

Work sucked, I'm glad I don't have to deal with corporate bullshit anymore. But some of the co-workers were really nice people, and I miss them a lot. Occasionally I could experience some joy by delivering a cool project. There were some fun and meaningful aspects to work.

My advice is, build something meaningful in your life (potentially _in addition to_ saving for early retirement _if possible_). Find a nice partner and/or nice friends, find out something nice to do together, have kids (or not). Don't spend all your time and energy only on ""not having to work anymore"" and then come out the other end completely hollow, unfulfilled, and with half a life gone with nothing real to show for it.

I've seen some threads here and elsewhere on ""what would you do when you didn't have to work anymore"", and I mostly see hobbies that people are already doing or ""activities"". It could well be that it's fun in the weekends, and that it can be fun for a short extended period of time (e.g. a few weeks). But do you really think that ""playing videogames"" or ""reading books"" or ""hiking"" stays fun for years and years? Try to think about it a bit deeper.

I'm going to try to look if there is any job which is somehow meaningful and adding something positive to the world (instead of just extracting money and resources out of people and the planet like most companies), and maybe see if I can still somehow find love and/or a good friendship at this age."

The timing couldn‚Äôt be worse ‚Äì just as we‚Äôre heading into winter, when job opportunities in hospitality are scarce.

I‚Äôm based in Australia, and the restaurant where I worked decided to keep two new apprentice chefs instead of me. I get it ‚Äì they‚Äôre cheaper, and business is business. But it doesn‚Äôt make it any less painful. I‚Äôve spent years honing my skills, putting in long hours, and dealing with the stress that comes with working in a busy kitchen. To be let go so abruptly, and just before the end of my probationary period, feels like a huge blow. It‚Äôs like all the effort and dedication counted for nothing in the end.

Since then, I‚Äôve been trying to make ends meet by doing Uber Eats deliveries. It‚Äôs not what I envisioned for myself, but it‚Äôs a way to keep some income flowing while I figure out my next steps. The work is physically demanding, and the pay isn‚Äôt great, but it gives me the flexibility to apply for jobs and try to plan my future.

The reality is, I‚Äôm exhausted. Hospitality is a tough industry, and the long hours, physical demands, and often low pay have taken their toll on me. I‚Äôve seen too many colleagues burn out, struggle with health issues, and get stuck in a cycle of instability. The thought of being in the same situation when I‚Äôm 40, 50, or 60 years old is frightening. I don‚Äôt want to spend the rest of my life in this grind.

In a bid to change my future, I recently started a digital marketing program. It‚Äôs a completely different field, and to be honest, it‚Äôs a bit intimidating to start over. But it‚Äôs also exciting. Digital marketing feels like a chance to reinvent myself, to find a career that‚Äôs more stable and less physically demanding. I‚Äôm hopeful that this path will lead to better opportunities and a more balanced life.

Making this transition isn‚Äôt easy. There are days when I doubt myself, when I feel overwhelmed by the uncertainty and the financial strain. But I‚Äôm trying to stay positive and focus on the long-term benefits. I‚Äôve already learned a lot in the program, and it‚Äôs giving me a new sense of purpose.

To anyone who‚Äôs been through something similar, how did you cope with the transition? How did you manage the financial and emotional stress? Any tips for someone who‚Äôs just starting out in a new field?

I know I‚Äôm not alone in this struggle. Reading stories on this subreddit has shown me that many of us are fighting to create better futures for ourselves, despite the challenges. I‚Äôm hopeful that with perseverance and support, things will get better.

Thanks for reading, and for any advice or encouragement you can offer. Let‚Äôs all keep pushing forward and supporting each other.

Stay strong, everyone!"

The companies on our list will get a label which they can use in their publicity and everyone willing to support them with their money will be able to check the list and buy from them.

They recently started up a trial run of a four-10 hour work week with Fridays being overtime. Sounds good, I volunteered for it, a lot us did.

 Now we have literally no to very little  work in my department and in others, but still since last Friday was the ""free day"" we have to come in tomorrow.

It‚Äôs such bs. Why can‚Äôt they rotate staff so not everyone has to do it every year, or do it on a volunteer basis? It‚Äôs going to totally suck and I‚Äôm already dreading it. "

This litigation has been ongoing since @ 2019, because, I believe, the defendant, after the EEOC ruled that they did not find grounds on which I could sue, believed that I would not. 

But I did. Fast forward to a few months ago, when I had my deposition. This was a first for me. I prepped. Beforehand, my attorney told me that opposing counsel was an asshole. This made me chuckle because it is nice to know attorneys are human. 

Preface this with after the deposition was finished, my attorney told me that I was one of the best deposition witnesses that he had had as a client. - so, approximately seven hours into my deposition, the opposing counsel really starts to hammer on me. Crazy questions. Trying to attack my credibility. I know it‚Äôs his job, but finally, I told him this: I decided I do not want to reach an out of court settlement if one is offered and that I look forward to either a bench trial or jury trial because my story deserves to be heard. 

LOL. One month after this they settled. For nearly everything, not everything, but nearly. 

I signed an NDA. Can‚Äôt name the company, settlement amounts, individual names, etc., standard stuff. But I can say that I am pleased with the decision. So I said it.

1. Waiting time penalties for late payment of wages
2. Misclassification of employees as independent contractors
3. Refused to give me my tax forms
4. Invalid paystubs (the manager just hand typed our pay stubs herself using excel)

I have tried dealing with this through the DOL and I‚Äôve tried talking to the IRS and filing an SS8 form. Neither of these attempts were helpful or lead to anything at all. 

I‚Äôve tried working with two different lawyers, both of which dropped my case because they just won‚Äôt make enough money from it, also because my old boss has been incredibly uncooperative, impossible to work with, and quite frankly over the top ridiculous in his responses (to the point where my last lawyer thought he was insane.) My old boss has said that he‚Äôs going to escalate the matter to federal court and claim that he‚Äôs a sovereign citizen. This was the point when my last lawyer decided to give up. But I‚Äôm not giving up yet. 

So I‚Äôm representing myself now. I have a date to go in front of a judge coming up on June 7th. But I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. I don‚Äôt know anything about the court system or how it works or how to represent myself. I don‚Äôt know what anything means or what to do or expect. What‚Äôs in my favor though is that I know I‚Äôm in the right and I‚Äôm confident the judge will see that. My last lawyer sent my old boss some kind of forms demanding that he either admit to or deny the allegations against him to which he chose to ignore; my lawyer said this was an admission of guilt. Before he dropped my case my lawyer gave me all the documents from my case for my use, but it‚Äôs a huge stack and I have no idea what any of it is even about. 

I could use any ELI5 advice I can get on what to do or what to expect. I‚Äôm not even sure exactly what the consequences of his actions will be, I just want to bring his actions to light so he can face them. "

My work has two sides, a sales side, and a warehouse side. The manager is over both sides, but doesn't actively run the warehouse. We have a warehouse lead that basically handles all the day-to-day operations. The guy is a smart guy, good at his job, occasionally comes in a little late, but otherwise has been a great employee. I should note that right now because of staffing issues, he's also basically the ONLY warehouse guy we have.

A few months back, he asked to take a week off. He was giving three months advance notice about it, saying that he was planning on taking a vacation with his wife. The manager gave him grief about it because ""we are understaffed, you have to think about how this will effect your coworkers, it's gonna be really hard for us if you this, why don't you put it on hold for the good of the company?"" My coworker, younger, not really aware that he can stand up for himself, says ""okay, I'll hold off until we get more people hired.""

Last week, our driver said ""hey I'm taking a week off next week."" My boss tried the same thing with him, and his response was basically ""I'm not asking for time off, I'm telling you I'm taking it."" Boss folds and says ""okay, I guess."" Because amongst other things we really are extremely short handed, so having an employee who takes time off or calls in is better than having no employee at all.

However, now the warehouse lead is FURIOUS. He went about it the ""right"" way and asked for time off, and basically got shut down. He wants to quit over it.

10,2024-05-30,Am I wrong for leaving?,u/AuntieLili,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d4fidg/am_i_wrong_for_leaving/,antiwork,"Hey community,

I'm reaching out for some perspective because I'm too close to the situation to make an objective decision.

About eight months ago, I transitioned from a retail job to a corporate role at the same company. Since then, the company has undergone significant changes, and our team is entirely new. Initially, I was overloaded with tasks, including:

1. Learning two new HR systems.
2. Creating scripts to print letters depending on type of employee movement for 20,000 employees.
3. Developing payroll reports from scratch with no training.
4. Creating guides for various processes.
5. Handling 20 cases per day.
6. Answering phone queries.

Despite receiving no training, I managed to tackle all these tasks. I consistently volunteered for extra tasks and helped my teammates, all for only $100-$200 more per week than my retail job.

Recently, my manager criticized my performance, even though I have the second-highest closed cases on the team. He mentioned negative feedback from his manager but provided no details. When I asked why I wasn't given a chance to correct my mistakes before raising concerns, he said this was my chance. I was taken aback by his approach. The next day, I took a day off, and my colleagues reached out, knowing my 1:1 meeting hadn't gone well. My manager also hinted that they don't see me around much, despite no explicit expectation to be in the office regularly. My team leader has acknowledged that I've 

I get paid very little, have done a lot for the company, and received no appreciation‚Äîonly criticism. However, I have messages from various colleagues and even a senior leader complimenting my hard work. I even receive d two shout-outs (internal award system) acknowledging my hard work. These shoutouts are visible to everyone in the department.   
  
My partner and colleagues are supportive and advised me to grow a thick skin and move on. But I‚Äôve lost my passion for this job, I'm tired of my manager's treatment, and I feel underappreciated.

I‚Äôm considering quitting and returning to retail, where I had more freedom and my managers valued my work. I might need to dip into my savings until I find another job, but I'm not too worried about that. Should I just quit?"
2,2024-05-30,W or L?,u/jakegrose,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d4fxua/w_or_l/,antiwork,"Opinions?

Started a new job in December after my layoff in September.

New job was a step down from leadership to being a rep again but wasn‚Äôt a concern to me as I was happy to stop being in charge all of the time.

Hired on as a Hybrid employee with the understanding from the hiring manager that I was hybrid at my own schedule (100 miles round trip) and every third trip they would reimburse my gas.

Ignorantly I did not get this in writing.

Beginning of May my manager pulls me aside and states that the company that acquired us is requiring that I am 3 days a week in office and no longer able to reimburse my gas every 3 trips. HR stated that any agreements made by the hiring manager (who had left at this point) were not valid and did not follow company policy.

I sent a note to HR, my manager, and his manager to state the cost of gas solely not including wear and tear to my vehicle driving an additional 300 miles a week would be a 7.5% decrease in base pay and asked for accommodation. They denied this and stated it‚Äôs my own fault for taking previous managers word. (Valid because I should have gotten it in writing but damn)

Manager has consistently been asking if I was planning on leaving to which I stated I wasn‚Äôt sure yet.

Now:
Found a new job that doesn‚Äôt require in office for at minimum the next 1-2 years (in the contract). Pays $30k more a year base salary.

Signed the contract yesterday and let my manager know yesterday. 

Gave my 2 weeks notice to show no hard feelings and be available to help with open deals.

Get a call today stating that my boss, his boss, and HR decided today would be my last day and that they‚Äôd pay me until the end of my 2 week notice. Once I agreed I had a meeting with my team to inform them I was leaving and they shut off my systems immediately after.

I‚Äôm feeling great about this but idk if it‚Äôs a win when they are so readily available to just throw money at me to leave?

 Not going to complain though as this will allow me to work on my house, hangout with my wife and dogs while also doing some things that I love while getting paid."

My direct boss is the owner though he was transitioning ownership to his son in a position above mine (his son who I put money and effort into bailing him out of jail and whatnot). I had also just gotten a $3 raise.

In the past few months the son has been hiring his buddies instead of qualified workers which has become a big issue costing us a lot and one that I brought to the owner multiple times. They recently fired me via text with a message that said ""we don't really need you anymore, we're fully staffed."" They had 5 workers total and no one did what I did except the boss' son who was on the same level as me before he convinced daddy to give him more power. We had talks just a week prior about recruiting more people because we were so understaffed but we were not to the point of shutting down, far from it.

The whole time I was working for them I was also doing University. I was sacrificing study abroad, internships, etc to work for them since it was reliable work and I needed it to pay for my university. They knew that and appreciated it (or I thought they did). I knew I was underpaid and I saw many red flags but thought I was important and valued enough to be kept since the owners wife and I had become good friends and he treated me like a daughter. For example, they 1099d me for a whole year without my knowledge which I  ended up paying a lot of money for but it was his son's doing and the owner tore into him once he found out. The owners were people I trusted but now I see my foolishness. 

I never even received a message or anything from the owner after his son let me go which is the most disappointing part of it. I'm not even certain he found out until much later. I was loyal and sacrificed a lot and earned them a lot. Now I'm homeless and frantically searching for a job living out of my car and they haven't even said a word. I feel used and betrayed and I know it was my own fault for not leaving earlier but I just didn't have the energy or resources.

I grew up being taught that loyalty and hard work would get you places but now I know it's all a big lie used to lead on workers who don't know better. Not sure what my next move is, hopefully I can afford to continue my education and move on but everything's so unstable now that I don't really know anymore."

>The United States has created the greatest industrial system in the history of the world, but that system has concerned itself almost entirely with profit, and has been blind or selfish insofar as the welfare of the mass of the people is concerned.

16,2024-05-30,Planning on putting in a month's notice this Monday at a job I love with management that I can't stand. Any advice on how to deal with retaliation?,u/BiscottiFrog,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d4izyb/planning_on_putting_in_a_months_notice_this/,antiwork,"So I plan to give a one month notice this upcoming Monday for a job I have really come to care about, but I cannot stand management any longer. I care about everyone and everything about this job, but the management aspect. Overall, there's been a lack of empathy and borderline illegal intimidation tactics when it comes to management. Including several worker's rights violations. I was recently offered a position in the same field, with a lot more benefits who are willing to salary match. Because I care so much about the people at my work, I want to offer a month's notice to quit, particularly as the busy season starts very soon. I want to hopefully help onboard the next candidate if selected prior to my departure. I have plans to develop a basic handbook for my position and prepare our clients for when I leave. None of was done when I was first hired.

However, my boss has a history of retaliation and bitterness to employees who quit. Everyone who has left the organization since I have been there has cited management as a reason for leaving. Because management has been so deep-rooted in the organization, no actual action has been done to correct any of the complaints brought up. I am fearful that my boss will retaliate against me during my final weeks. Although the employee handbook only specifies that 10 working-days notice is needed to be eligible for any vacation time to be paid out, I genuinely want to stay on longer to help all my other coworkers with the transition. Ever since the last employee left, several staff members have said things along the lines of ""Oh, \[BiscottiFrog\], I really hope you stay here for a long time, you are the future of the organization."" and even my boss has asked several times, ""You're not leaving anytime soon, right?"" 

I know that despite the mistreatment, my boss feels like they've invested a lot of time and resources into my development as an employee. I truly am grateful for the opportunity to work here, as my field is really competitive, and this was my first full-time job out of college. I know my departure is going to hit them out-of-the-blue, and really mess up plans for our small core staff of eight people. Any advice on how I should handle my boss's likely angry response? Is there anything else I can do to not burn a bridge at a place I truly love, but just cannot stand to work at anymore?

TLDR: I am quitting well-loved job I have had for several years, but I have a boss who will take it personal and is unprofessional with people who quit. How do I handle the anticipated backlash from management while trying to support my other coworkers for the next few weeks?"

People die from stress related illnesses over nothing because of this.

Let‚Äôs use my job for example, I‚Äôm a compliance manager. I‚Äôm in charge of the pieces of decorative cardboard in our store, renamed ‚ÄúPOS‚Äù to sound more important for the sake of keeping ourselves grounded let‚Äôs keep calling it cardboard. Customers obviously don‚Äôt base their sales on this cardboard and it‚Äôs not built with care as it often falls apart. But head office marks us down on store inspections if this cardboard is missing, they‚Äôll personally insult you for.

Buuuut‚Ä¶ Store inspections don‚Äôt actually have any bearing on the stores ability to stay open, only major profit loss does and safety violations. And not having this cardboard up isn‚Äôt a fireable offence for someone in my position, not by fair work laws set up in Australia. 

I‚Äôve been there too long now and have become disillusioned by all of this but I‚Äôve seen people pushed to the brink over getting in ‚Äútrouble‚Äù over this cardboard during store inspections but their job is still in tact, there‚Äôs no actual consequences. 

They‚Äôre crying and work and developing stomach pains, I‚Äôm not above that unfortunately cause try as I might to remind myself what the actual situation is I still feel the anxiety rising over the cardboard that fell off this particular part of the wall and the cleaner sweeped it up cause it‚Äôs dirty cardboard on the floor.

So is this level of manipulating one‚Äôs perception of significance torture or straight up brainwashing? "

11,2024-05-30,I may have to quit my job because of a psychotic coworker/former manager and I'm scared because no one is hiring,u/WeStanPlankton,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d4kkv6/i_may_have_to_quit_my_job_because_of_a_psychotic/,antiwork,"So I work at a law firm and there is this person that has been an absolute terror to me and to the rest of the office. Let's call her K. K used to be the assistant principal of a school in Washington DC, but then she quit for ""moral"" reasons and got an entry level job as a demand writer at our firm in Texas. I was hired the day before her in the same position. K became the manager of the demand writers, because she is older and is good at organizing. the demand writers are usually law students or people fresh out of college. I changed industries, I'm 28 so a little older than the average I guess, but I fit in.

K has hated me since day one. There was originally no system for proof reading and there were spelling and grammatical errors in my work and she tried to get me fired and cornered me in a conference room to lecture me about how she believes that with every degree, there is an implied standard of knowledge that you have otherwise how did you get that degree? And if you prove to your employers or coworkers that you do not meet that standard, they should have the right to contact your university and have your degree taken away. And then said I should go back to the industry I came from, but since I clearly burned out from that one, maybe food service would be better. I reported her and I was basically her whipping boy from that day on. it came to a peak when she called her husband and talked bad about me on speaker phone in front of other coworkers. she got demoted back to demands writer and her replacement became her new target of harassment.

Glossing over a lot here, but basically ive tried to find another job but my boss pays me really big bonuses and gave me a big raise recently so she knows how to win me over lol. I don't talk to K at all, we're not even in the same office anymore because the new manager reported her to the boss and the boss moved her elsewhere. K has since changed offices 4 different times for similar problems. On my end, it was all good and great until K got her friend hired and ever since, her friend has basically tried to steal the new manager's position when she doesn't constantly report our every conversation and movement to K. K apparently has been tracking when me and the new manager come and go.

K has always dumped her work onto the other writers. She basically is like her work more important, she does so much more work than us, she is a more critical thinker than all of us, she is too busy so we need to take things off her plate. It's all a lie because its the exact same work we do, and she is terrible at it. She dunks on my work, but literally everyone says mine is fine and hers is full of the errors she attacks me on because she refuses to allow anyone to proof read her work. She did this when she was manager and even after she got demoted, would lose her mind and bully everyone until they gave in but refuse to help when someone else got overwhelmed because she's so busy.

The last few weeks, our boss went on a big vacation. K lost her miiiiind. Recently, she has started doing some other jobs like handling correspondence for our boss and doing random little tasks for her because she seems to have set her sights on the office manager position. The office manager is an older lady but has no intention of leaving, but K is AFTER her and its wild to see. K has not stopped texting our boss with everyones movements, complaining about the office manager with a lot of lies that she's been exposed for.

The big problem currently is the demand writer manager had a medical emergency the day we had some new hires start training. K took over that training, but when manager came back, K and her got into this weird tiff where K said she clearly can't be trusted because she left so suddenly (she had to have emergency surgery). Not only that, but the new people are extremely confused because everything K is teaching them its wrong but K has decided to extend their training because they clearly can't be trusted with the delicate art and science and DUTY that is writing demand letters. We've had two quit already, one called our boss on vacation and went ballistic on her and is demanding a meeting when she gets back. K's friend that has been snitching on us has been telling K that me and the new manager are always on our phones and are teaching the new people bad habits, which she has been texting the boss as well on her vacation.

There's a loooooot more but this is the gist. There's been two conflicting stories of what the boss has said so far. A new hire shared a voicemail she got from our boss where she told the new hire to not quit because when she gets back she and K are going to make some major changes to the law firm. But when I complained about this mess to the office manager today, she said that the boss is livid with K and that numerous people have been making complaints and she has not been able to do anything on her vacation because people are constantly calling her about K. I was advised to basically line up and demand to talk to the boss about what I've seen when she gets back on Monday.

On top of all that, we are very swamped with work right now and there are a lot of demands and other assignments that need doing, K dumped all of hers onto us again and she has been rearranging furniture. Why? No one knows. The office manager is just letting her do it because she said she doesn't want to deal with her anymore until our boss gets back. She completely reorganized the copy room, which no one asked her to do and she tried to get the new hires to do it with her but our manager stole them away so they could actually do some work. But today she was just like moving furniture up and down the hallways. Like needlessly. Also her adult kids were like in and out of the office and no one knows why, they don't work here.

It's like this issue doesn't really concern me but it does at the same time. I'm very over it so I'm back on looking for other jobs but I have a sweet deal right now where no one cares what I do except K, everything was fine for a solid year or so and I just got to abuse their very generous overtime system and rake in fat bonuses without doing any difficult work. It's all potentially going up in flames, all my work friends are leaving, and if K or her friend becomes any kind of manager I am leaving on the spot but like I'm scared about not having a job again. I only recently got on my feet and I'm in a good spot and I'm scared to lose what I've gained.

TLDR; an absolutely deranged former manager has completely lost her mind because our boss went on vacation and now everyone wants to quit. I don't want to lose this job because I have a pretty sweet deal that I would like to preserve.

I need advice but also wanted to get this off my chest. If it seems disjointed or chaotic, now you know how I feel. I'm also just very very tired and I don't want my job anymore but also I do but also I just need money but also I don't want to work anymore and aaaaaaag"

Was hired at $18/hour last year in an administrative coordinating position for a healthcare company.

Took it because I was DESPERATE for a M-F ‚Äúbank‚Äù hours job due to childcare.

Since being hired I have gone above and beyond to the point that, since our shitty operations manager was demoted to essentially the nursing case manager (let‚Äôs call her Sheena, since she‚Äôll be mentioned later), I‚Äôve been tasked with operations manager tasks (apparently actually hiring a new one for our location is out of the budget).

So, I‚Äôve been doing payroll close outs, overtime and holiday billing, all service code billing, end of month reports, payroll adjustments, etc.

On TOP of that, I just got told (not asked) I will be ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù/moving to what is essentially the nursing case manager position, to take on half the case load of Sheena.

Sheena makes $21/hour. I still make $18/hour.

Figured cool, when the promotion takes place I will get that wage.

Nope. Annual eval today! Yay!

I ranked at 97%. ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù. Exceeding. Asked to make more than $18/hour.

Nope. Got 3%. $.54 cents. FIFTY FOUR CENTS. ‚ÄúAnything more will need moved through the channels, but it‚Äôs very unlikely‚Äù. Told her to try anyways. Doubt anything will come of it.

But the cherry? Got told ‚ÄúI hope you stay on, because the CSC is one step below operations manager. Once we build the office up again, a that position opens, we want you to do it‚Äù.  Come to find out, Sheena was told the same thing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve shown growth and determination, and you have done the position before, once that opens, we want you to do it‚Äù.

Recently, we had a patient who became irate, threatening to fight staff after previously being noted to sexually harass female patients in the facility. On my end of the building, there is a door that should only be able to open through a key card. The door has been finicky on one end, and on the other end, the door opens like a normal door (this is not how it is supposed to operate.) On the day I worked, that door had been propped open due to not opening correctly. This allowed for this patient to approach and essentially corner me, unannounced and angry. My office is in the very back end of the building, where I am mainly alone and it would be difficult to get help if anything went awry. It ended in the patient threatening to fight staff, and the police were called. I spoke with one of the higher-ups, asking if the door would be fixed soon or if we would have a code for the office in the back, bringing up this situation and how I felt unsafe and was met with being told that it was not a concern and that ""as a professional"" I should be able to deescalate the situation and, ""I don't know what you want me to do.""

  
Situation B: At this detox facility, we have in writing that if a patient decides to AMA, they are not allowed to have their cellphone/wallet. Many of these patients are admitted while under the influence. This information is purposely not told to them directly, but in the forms signed. My question is, how can that be taken as consent if they are not sober? Also, we have a strong low-income population, so while the intention is \*cool\*, taking away a patient's cellphone and wallet seems weird when they don't have friends/family nearby to get them? 

  
Are these situations technically unethical or am I overstepping lol"

The staff and the owners have been at an impasse about coming back into the office full time. Obviously me and the other employees are absolutely against that. We have been working at home since before Covid. We answer phones and do scheduling for a small real estate firm. 

I was pretty sure this zoom call was gonna end in me being fired. Especially when my boss opened her mouth and blatantly dismissed a coworkers concern about the cost of coming in full time. I stopped the conversation ‚ÄúAre you dense?!‚Äù

I‚Äôm pretty sure time stood still at that moment. No one said anything and the conversation went on for another hour. 

I was asked to hop on another zoom call before my shift ended. I texted my Mom I was getting fired. I was ready for it. 

What I wasn‚Äôt ready for was for them to cave in and to also give me an $2 an hour raise. 

I guess my point in sharing this story here is we won‚Äôt ever get what we rightfully deserve without speaking up. 

I‚Äôll never again allow myself to be treated like that in the workplace and I hope the quiet ones like me start making noise.

Problem is I'm actually not that good at my job because I just can't seem to forget how hard the job is from when I worked on the floor and I don't make unreal expectations of the staff. 
Unfortunately this correlates with the boss underemploying us recently by replacing members of our team of staff of full timers with casual part timers as they resign. This makes the work unbalanced for the remaining full timers.
What started as a team of 7 full timers when I took the position is now 4 full timers and 2-3 part timers on various shifts, expected to do the same amount of work to the same standard of course.

I'll tell the boss I'm worried about overworking the employees and that I have concerns about burnout and he hates that word, he'll say shit like ""We can't let them control us but threatening to leave"" then when they do burnout and inevitably quit he's the surprised pikachu. 

He doesn't consider the obvious problem though, he's just gets pissed off he wasted time training them and tries to blame them for being lazy and me for not convincing them to stay. How are you suppose to convince people to stay in a toxic environment? You don't unless you're a complete liar I guess.

Overwork is bad and burnout is real, just cause you can in theory rework the work of 6 people down to 3 doesn't mean you should. "

This letter, published in Jon Krakauer‚Äôs 1996 book Into the Wild, contains a passage that just hits me and it suits this sub perfectly: 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to repeat the advice I gave you before, in that I think you really should make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been to hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man‚Äôs living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. If you want to get more out of life, Ron, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see it‚Äôs full meaning and its incredible beauty. And so, Ron, in short, get out of Salton City and hi the Road. I guarantee you will be very glad you did.‚Äù

1,2024-05-31,My boss is so hot and cold should I quit?,u/aBeautifulDream95,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d4rwyt/my_boss_is_so_hot_and_cold_should_i_quit/,antiwork,"This is my second ""real"" professional job after graduating. I actually enjoy my job (engaging work, autonomy, flexible, payment aligns with market), but my boss is very manipulative to me despite me being the most senior/highest ranked person in my small department (4 years at the company).

She isn't the same person who hired me too, so I think that might play a role (pride for the people she did hire) into this. Although, she became my boss a year after I stated anyway. Here are some recent things that have rubbed me the wrong way (feel free to call me out if I am being too sensitive).

- Praises my male coworkers who she hired directly for completing basic tasks, but reprimands me in front of them for any minor mistake. Will excuse my male coworkers when they make mistakes or exhibit bad habits, but will drill into me if I were to do something similar. I've noticed when she first started at the company she would praise my work in a similar way and over the years the positive feedback and encouragement progressively declined.

- I am given the largest workload in my department and get blamed for not meeting deadlines, despite my boss being aware of everything I am taking on. She will even say of x coworker does such a good job managing a project knowing I am the one who is given the most work. I feel like if I was given the same amount of work then I too could focus on the snowballing deadlines. This also carries over to how are days look, mine is full of meetings while still being given multiple projects/tasks at once, where my male coworkers only have 1/2 (or less going on). My boss supports them taking personal time off/leaving early/studying for certifications, but I struggle to find time to even organize my files/emails given the amount of work I am expected to complete.

- Even when I do meet deadlines, the work is never good enough and my boss always has some gripe about the way something was performed. While I appreciate the little to no direction my boss gives me, it's very irritating when I keep her updated (we meet almost daily) on my tasks and next steps, then she turns around and uses it against me later on.  Why didn't you do x, y, z thing?? How did you miss this? Why didn't you do this instead? Moving targets. Lately she has been setting up checkpoint meetings with me for every single milestone (this is fine), but when she asks about timing to complete something she will reduce it in half. I try to push back and she minimizes it saying x,y,z thing is so easy and just get it done, etc. Then will turn around when I don't make that date to say we need to be more realistic...!!

- She can be very two faced, she is very nice to other leaders in the company in person, but then will speak poorly about them to me behind their back. This is usually a personal attack (she's even made fun of one for a medical condition and subtly jokes about one being gay) or she will tell me confidential things they tell her. She also does this with my coworkers (the ones she supposedly thinks are so amazing) when they make mistakes or make certain personal life choices. I am sure she does the same to me with them.

- I find when she isn't pretending to be my friend she will quickly get into a mood and be very rude to me. She will make passive remarks like did you even get to this thing yet? Or she will have a combative tone with me and this even carries into meetings with other employees. It really makes me feel unsupported and almost like she is not in my corner. I'm starting to feel like I constantly need to have a justification for her on any little thing. I have even started screenshotting my conversations to have proof that certain things happened in case she tries to corner me.

- I get this feeling that other employees and leaders in the company think highly of me (my boss has actually informed me of feedback numerous times), but for whatever reason my own boss doesn't see it that way and is pushing me away."

It was a 5 hour drive away from home, which meant I was living out of a motel room while working 10 hour shifts overnight from 7pm - 5am. It wasn't ideal, but it was height of the pandemic and I was desperate for work.

I was sent out there to work a shutdown. For people that don't know, a shutdown is what it sounds like - the plant goes offline to allow skilled trades to go into equipment and perform necessary maintenance. They normally last for a few weeks up to a couple months. Usually different areas of the plant will be shut down in phases so that some parts remain live and still keep some level of production going through the shutdown.

The employer that hired me had brought in about 50 temporary workers, and had created a master spreadsheet of what shifts we were working and when our days off were. I was scheduled to work 19 night shifts in a row, then 2 days off, followed by another couple weeks of shifts until the end of our project. 

At the end of my shift on the 19th night I was beat, ready to drive home to spend 2 days with my girlfriend at the time. At 6:30am, I'm in my motel room, getting my stuff packed up to go. My supervisor calls me and asks me if I can work tonight, even though HE scheduled me to be off. I say sorry, no, I need these two days off, I'll see you when I get back. He says don't worry about it, I'll just lay you off then, come back to site and pick up your tools. Then he hung up.

The fucker wasn't even there to hand me my tools when I came back. He just left them at the security desk. "

Some of them are near our office, some are a greater distance. I don't drive which means I spend a lot of time on busses and trains. I was speaking to my manager about a late appointment I hadd that all notes have to be put on within 24 hours.
I've explained that because of the travel and late appointment that'll mean I have to put notes on from home, and asked whether to put in a claim for the overtime or log or as time off in lieu. The answer I got was neither. Instead it's ""just to be expected as you're making up for choosing to travel during work hours.""

Which is obviously not compatible with, you know, unexpected events/illness. 

The kicker is that I'm a therapist. I meet with my clients that are scheduled whether I'm in office or not. Management could easily see whether I was doing something shady with my schedule. My clients would much rather keep their appointment via telehealth than have me cancel. My organization's response? Cancel all your clients because no preapproved WFH. So they'd rather screw over our clients and lose hundreds of dollars themselves than let us WFH once in a while? Someone make it make sense. "

This is like 10% of clients or less.

2nd best: people who are polite/respectful and maybe offer me water or a cup of coffee, are willing to think about how they can make it easier for us, seem to have a genuine recognition of what a favor is being done for them by a real person. yes they paid for it but also it's being done by a person. i'm willing to believe that some of these people don't tip because maybe they don't have the extra cash or aren't prepared to, but the attitude of respect still is worth something to me. This is about 30% of clients.

3rd tier: people who are not home and I never interact with them except via my boss, but they keep their house reasonably climate controlled. This is about 30% of clients.

4th tier: people who are not home but leave piles of dirty dishes for me (not part of what they paid for) and/or a problem pet is made to be my problem (also seems crazy to leave your high strung pet with a stranger idk). or people who turn OFF their climate control when they know workers are coming over. This is like 10% of clients.

5th tier: people who are home, lurking but not in a nice way, acting like the cleaners are doing something sketchy (it's fair to feel like you don't want people in your space but then WHY hire us to come over! this was your decision!) plus do 4th tier annoying things. Also 10% of clients.

bottom tier: people who lurk, are rude, act like we're doing something sketchy and invasive by doing the job you hired us to do, nitpick and act passive aggressive, and then complain about bullshit to my boss after we leave. complaints include things like: ""the floor was wet after you mopped it,"" ""our son used the toilet after you cleaned it and you didn't go back and re-clean it,"" ""you took too long even though we added a bunch of tasks last-minute,"" ""you used an extra trash bag and that's bad for the environment,"" ""you left a single streak on our opulent glass shower door,"" and other craziness like this. i think it takes a special type of psycho to HIRE people to come to your house and then use it as an excuse to power trip like this. Also 10% of clients. I want to tell these people how rare and abnormal this behavior is.

Please don't spam me with ""omg wheres ur self respect get a better job"", for the time being this is literally the only job i can have that allows me to manage all the family obligations i'm also doing. i have a full life outside of work and plenty of other commitments and sources of meaning and i keep hard boundaries with this shit and make it work for me for the time i need it.

I thought I was feeling better and all I had was congestion/a runny nose so I went into work.

My work shifts are close to my home and only span an average of 3 hours. My boss even cut my shift to two hours on the Wednesday so I found it doable. But when I went in, by the end of my shift my entire nasal cavity was stuffed to the brim, which I was not expecting.

Thursday (yesterday) was my day off and I was sporting a headache and congestion still. Instead of resting, I decided to push myself to workout. Unfortunately my headache was too bad for exercise so I went on a walk and read my book at a park instead. All the while I was sniffling and my nose was running like no one's business. When I came home, I pushed myself to clean and I got so fixated on it that I did it for FOUR HOURS. I had to wake up early this morning for a work shift so I am drained, and my congestion and headache are still there.

I have another work shift later today, this time for 3 hours. After that, I have to come home and immediately get to bed so I can wake up at 5am for an all-day event (not work-related) tomorrow. The thing is: I don't get fevers. At least not when I'm sick. So there's not medical basis for me to call in. I work with kids, and it's very hard for my boss to find a replacement for me. ....

Anyway: I feel like I'm conditioned to go into work unless I'm actively dying. Right now the phlegm is so bad it's making me gag. It's pathetic that my head is so clouded I'm asking Reddit for advice, but what do you guys think I should do?"

He lied to me more than 6 times because he thought I would blatantly believe him even though I had evidence to the contrary. First he said we would recheck my salary every couple months or so. He never did. When I asked for a performance review + raise, he mentioned a ""company policy"" and that he could not do that. A year later I asked again and got no response.

He seemed super friendly and nice at first, only to manipulate my work assignments. I still have not gotten over that. I do the work he hates and the work that no one else in the company can do flawlessly.

He does not give me work when I ask for it, even though by his own words and performance metrics I am excellent at what I do.

Because he is afraid of my success and career progression, he has told me several times not to communicate with anyone at the company, but to talk to him first. This also applies to ideas that have not been credited to me.

To make matters worse, his psycho-brain has been correcting my work for over a year now. Even when my work is amazing according to HIS own words and an objective comparison, he changes it. He even changed his own work once after saying everything was perfect. But it wasn't. He torments me for God knows what reason. I think he's actually sick in the head.

I asked him to give me some sensible feedback so I can see what I can do better. I asked him mostly because I wanted to see if he was actually sick in the head or if I needed to improve somewhere, but he said he ""didn't have time"" and then never did while he continued to ""correct"" my work‚Ä¶

The boss who was interviewing me was clearly working throughout the entire interview as I could see her typing while looking back and forth between her computer screens.

I joined a tech company slightly over 6 months ago as a full-time employee. The role has been largely a training one, where we are required to get certain certs and shadow senior engineers within our practice. 

Truth be told I have not enjoyed the job since day 1, and slacked off greatly at the beginning due to some personal issues to the point where I honestly never ended up starting because it felt too late. I have not submitted any timesheets, worked through any of the material provided, and have been coasting underneath the cracks. 

I just got a new manager 2 weeks ago and he has been on my tail and been scheduling multiple meetings a week. I initially expressed interest in resigning because I sensed the end was near and felt embarassed having to show how little I did. My manager scheduled a meeting with himself, an HR rep, and me. On the call I said I would like to resign 5 weeks from today. They said no if you want to resign it must be today and we will pay you for the next 2 weeks with no severance. I said can I get a day to think about it and they said no you must tell us now. I said I will not resign.

Ever since then my manager had been sending me multiple emails a day, nitpicking everything from grammatical mistakes in my emails to giving me hour-by-hour deadlines, while copying HR and his director to each email. The thing is, I WANT to get fired, so I cam recieve unemployment here in Texas. The problem is, in our state, the employer has to approve your unemployment claim. 

My fear is if they see how little I've done, which is next to nothing, they will deny my unemployment claim. I've been randomly using PTO to avoid meetings so I don't have to share my screen and show how little I've done. What should I do so I am terminated, but also to ensure I get my full unemployment benefits while I search for a new job? "

Just to give some background- I‚Äôm a part time employee, they do not provide me with insurance nor enough pay to go to the urgent care or doctor for a note. 

So now I‚Äôm sitting here with anxiety wondering if I should just run to the urgent care, get checked out or if I should show up on Monday and say ‚ÄúUnfortunately I do not have insurance and do not get payed enough to pay for a doctors visit either so due to these circumstances I cannot provide one.

I work for a company who is contracted to perform security and other various admin positions for their company. I am fortunate enough to have a Monday-Friday, 8-4 office position. 

Now none of my direct bosses are on site, with the exception of our site supervisor who deals with the guards and is generally handoff with me since he doesn't understand my job. Mostly direction is given by the site security director and manager, who I have never had a bad interaction with and got along quite well, infact one of them was a reference. 

Last week I received a job offer for the government which I couldn't say no to depaite being about 8k less a year in salary but I need the experience. After speaking with my site supervisor I decided to put my two weeks in just to ease the pain, plus I couldn't start until two weeks anyway. 

My plan was to train my replacement which I am fine with and move on without any issues! Until today. 

The director of security who works for the company that is contracting my company (I know a bit convoluted, I hope I didn't lose anyone) is known to be a massive jerk and a known trouble maker to most employers on site so I generally walked on egg shells when he was around and didn't have much interaction besides the morning and departing pleasantries. 

I had asked him to leave early yesterday since I needed to get fingerprints done for my new position and the last time slot was when I get out so he agreed to me leaving (I would have left regardless but I didn't need that headache with a week left here). 

Today I got back from a short break and was welcomed with ""I didn't say you can leave early today, you need to find coverage!"" to which I said ""I asked you two weeks ago, and it's not my job to find coverage. That's why we have a scheduler"". He began to mumble under his breath about professionalism to which i replied ""I am going to leave if you agreed or not, I leave in a week and gave you the professional courtesy to help train my replacement. I don't need your permission and infact I won't come back after lunch."" The look on his face was PRICELESS and his response was cumbersome ""so you're going to walk out? That's not very professional at all. In your email you said you'd stay and train you can't go back on thay!"". I replied ""I'll walk out right now, it's your incompetence that will sink this department. And speaking about professionalism it's a two way street, you need to be professional too. And you of all people saying I'm unprofessional. I can pick anyone out of a group here and have them speak about your unprofessional demeanor.""

In February, I started working for a big corporation in the adult entertainment industry as a cashier. 

I got a promotion quickly. I was told & signed a document (on 4/18) stating I would receive the raise in pay on 5/2. Due to low staffing, I started the new position on April 19th without the proper 2 weeks paid training that other employees received. I did so under the impression that I would receive 'backpay' or 'retro pay' from the company.

I emailed our Payroll admin on 5/13 with a log of the hours and a description of the situation to ensure she was aware and working on it (never got a response). My manager told me she herself was working with HR to get it resolved. 

Come to 5/20, my manager texts me on my day off asking me to reapply online because ""Corporate HR will not go forward with this until you go through the steps their way"". This was the first time anyone in our department had heard of this being a part of the promotion process. So, I applied online and then obtained a copy of the promotion document I signed previously.

I continued to work the higher position while taking on responsibilities of the next up position as well.

I totaled everything and it's 240 hrs + ~45 OT hrs. The raise is only $2/hr but if my math is correct that's $615.

My supervisor came in today & gave me a check from my manager for $85, and told me HR won't go through with it. They put in the raise, so going forward I will be paid accordingly. But as for the last 6 weeks? Nothing other than my managers personal money, which I don't feel right accepting (as she's being burned by this place too).

I want to speak with HR myself after my 'Friday' shift, and see what they have to say about it. But I want to have some info to back myself up, so I figured I could ask here

What's my next move? Is there anything I can do to get the rest my pay from the last month & a half?"

It's not great but I get by. I've been in the non profit sector for 10 years now but these last few months have been hell. We got a bunch of new hires who constantly complain. Get overworked easily and always micromanage those around them.

I offered help where I can but refuse to do anything above my pay grade; and is not my job to train or mentor them. Many of the new hires are not fully equipped for their role. But that's not my problem.

Our management team has reached out to me on occasions to bring these folks up to speed but offer no compensation for training them. And so here we are. Everyone stressed, overworked and at each others throats. I like to keep my head low, clock in and out. I don't respond to coverage requests outside business hours nor respond to emails etc. I have firm boundaries about when I work and when I'm not.

I admit I've dropped the ball recently by not properly communicating recently as I've had so many health challenges come up over these past few months. My physical and emotional well being have taken such a massive dip. I've told management and colleagues about some of my health issues and asked for accommodations. I.e. extra breaks, extended breaks, etc. These accommodations are not being respected and I'm just tired. 

I loved working here but I'm done. My personal life and health have taken such a massive back seat for the past 10 years. I'm scared to quit as I have never been unemployed in my life but I feel like I have no choice. I don't even feel like giving a 2 weeks notice. Now I understand why some of my close colleagues banished with no warning in recent years. "

However, at some point, I need to leave so I can get school credit for working a job in the field I'm going to school for. This will inevitably mean leaving.

But I feel guilt-tripped into staying until the others get more experience.

My boss does understand my situation with school, but I also don't really feel like there'll ever be a good time to leave in the next long while.

Is there a way to deal with that?"

I was in management at two separate locations before I left to do an internship and decided to come back but to a different location after my last job left me in a very bad place mentally and I've been trying to recover for over a year now. I'm in my second week currently. Spent last week training under my former manager from the last location I worked at and it was smooth sailing. Halfway through the week I get an email to all the managers of the new store I'm going to from DM asking why there are so many boxes of shipment piled in the store room. This is a boutique type clothing store so 78 boxes in the back is an insane amount of shipment to not have been unpacked. Apparently they also had weeks of trash sitting as well. I get through the rest of my week at the other store just fine. This Tuesday I started at the new store and it is...unreal. I would like to state I know how to do my job. I am new to some things but most I'm very comfortable with. My first day was anxiety inducing but fine. I stayed an hour late to unpack shipment. I did the same the day after but that day was worse. I had a panic attack in my car on the way there. They have to send nightly emails about the most minuscule things because the DM doesn't trust their staff in this location. One email about any price matching we did over the day, one about credit cards gotten, and another about sales and how much shipment was unpacked. Go backs pile up behind the register all day. There is no amount of organization for anything. The amount of shipment in the back will not fit on the racks we have on the sales floor. I had to clean another grown woman that I don't know's period blood off of the floor and toilet seat of the fucking employee bathroom. 
Now I'm laying in bed all day before I go to work and am considering calling out because I feel like I took on too much. I'm being held responsible for fuck ups I wasn't even around to make, and I'm falling back into my depression pit to do it. I just want to lay in bed and cry even thinking about it. No other store I've worked at EVER has been this bad. I'm already applying to other jobs or considering taking a demotion to go work back at my home location. Retail sucks so fucking bad oh my god.

I have been working through a temp agency for two years. I am currently a Senior Healthcare Data Analyst with 6 years of experience. Originally i was getting paid $50/hr but when they extended my contract at the six month period to further review me i requested a raise through the tempy agency and got $54/hr. 

&#x200B;

Now that i am being converted, i started doing research and am conflicted about how to approach things...

1. The average pay for my career in my area is 126ish at the 50th percentile and i took a lower pay even as a contractor because i needed the job. Unfortunately though,  i was able to find the salary range for this position through an opening currently available on their site and its 80-96k.
2. I asked a current employee what she was making ( we are super cool) and she claims she makes 90k even though she has been there for 8 years....
3. However, I also found information that someone on [https://h1bdata.info/](https://h1bdata.info/) is being paid 106k last year and i know it is a new hire as well since it states where its from and i know where he is located and personally i  feel i have proven myself to be a more capable analyst than him. 
4. I also know from the temp agent that ive worked with for two years that he is charging the firm $70/hr for my services, which comes to 145k.

&#x200B;

I expect them to attempt to hit me with a 90k offer and then claim benefits are the reason but i do not value benefits enough to take such a ridiculous cut.

So my question is this: If i am making 112k, the temp agency is charging 145k, and i feel that the reason they extended an offer is because they have seen me as an excellent candidate, then what is a good number to ask for during negotiations that seems better from HR's perspective to accept rather than decline and pay a further premium through the temp agency and invest another year in another client instead?"

So, I created a folder on the desktop, which I labeled ""S Drive"", and put the documents in there.  2 days later, when Bibi told me he was going to write me up, ""For not putting the documents on the S Drive like I told you"", I protested.  I said ""Yes I did.. they are right here, see?  If that is not what you meant, please show me, so I can correct it.""

Bibi stood there fuming.. he knew that the folder on the desktop was not what his boss wanted, but lacked the basic understanding of computers to articulate what was wrong.  And his ego would let him admit that he did not know what the hell he was talking about.

I‚Äôve been able to make things work on a paycheck to paycheck basis for a while able to squirrel away a little bit of money each month.

I‚Äôve been trying to save back up what I lost and prepare myself for the massive tax bill next year, and this month I didn‚Äôt get a commission check.

My employer is really flexible if I need time off and I'm really thankful to have it. The only thing I'd trade it for is a remote job.

Why?

Because it's pointless to be there in-person most of the time. For context, I handle the social media management and whatnot. I could probably get all of the content filming done (that's the only thing I'd need to be there in-person for) in like, 4 hours total per week.

Instead, I'm stuck in my office for 9+ hours a day, 5 days a week, basically just sitting here and rotting away just because. Watching the clock tick.

I've gotten to work at home a few times (for emergency reasons), but the first time I asked I got told ""You can this time, but don't do it often. Not all of our employees get to so you can't either."" Ok, most of them have jobs that require them to be there in person. Very few of us work in an office.

Sometimes they also make me drive farther to go to the other location. I do not have an office at that location. I do not have access to the programs that I usually use at that location. I essentially just go there to spend a day wandering around and wasting time. Plus, it adds on an extra two hours of unpaid commute time.

When I asked why? ""We just don't want the other location to feel left out."" What? Nobody there even cares.

Overall, my job isn't bad and I'm thankful for it. I just wanted to vent a little about the expectation that we office workers have to waste most of our days rotting in an office instead of being in a comfortable environment where we'd more than likely be more productive. It's just goofy."

I moved offices and we all did the math:

10 managers+=$4,000 times 3 years=$12,000
1 single catered lunch=$600

After not doing any type of appreciation during covid for 3 years they finally threw us a catered lunch so they were asked to chip $60 each and they all lost their fucking minds! Some of the managers didn't even have staff to spend it on and even they were pissed af.

I will, to be fair, say that one of the directors was pretty awesome and would take their (4-5) staff out to eat all the time and spent well over the $400 every year."

The advancement team at my workplace recently implemented a time change that makes my team work 8 hours instead of 6 and later in the day. I don't want to get too much into specifics but basically, they did not ask our team for any input before implementing this change(even though my team will be the only people affected) and are not offering any kind of full-time benefits or accommodations for those in my team that now need to find childcare or alternative forms of transportation to adapt to this change(half of my team takes public transport to get the work). We used to get off work at 4pm meaning we had the rest of the day to do whatever we want but now we get off at 7pm, which doesn't give much time for those who have second jobs or other commitments. 

A coworker and I have set up a meeting with the two people responsible for this change and we want to subtly undermine them as much as possible. Last time we talked to them they were incredibly dismissive & didn't take us seriously. Some things we thought of were to call them the wrong names(Sarah instead of Sierra or something like that) and not blink while making eye contact with them. Any other ideas would be helpful!

To me, I feel like this was just something that they needed to get done because it kept appearing in the HR interface. I don‚Äôt feel any personalization nor any satisfaction with her response. I almost feel like I may be on the outs. They laid off three of my colleagues three months ago, indicating there would be no more layoffs, however, I feel this may not be the case.

My question is what would you do with this? Anything? Or would that motivate you to either leave or look for further clarification to management.

If an employee is given extra duties not list in their job description then I'm of the opinion that those duties should be optional and all aspects should be fully disclosed, ensuring the employee is aware they are choosing to take on extra work without compensation and have the right to refuse. 

Are there any legal grounds or workers rights laws in place that reference this? "

9,2024-05-31,A rant on recruiters...,u/Donna_Matrix699,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1d57biu/a_rant_on_recruiters/,antiwork,"I applied for an internal role for a well known food delivery company about a month ago, my friend that works there pushed my resume through and I was so thankful. Within a day a recruiter had emailed me to select time frames for a zoom interview, I was instructed to select 2-4 slots. I selected 2 and waited. About 3 days later I got an email stating that they were not proceeding with my application. About an hour later the recruiter emails me and tells me to disregard, there was a technical issue and I need to select new times. No problem, shit happens, so I selected new times. I got my confirmation and calendar invite the next day for a few days from then.

 The day before the interview, I'm asked to pick different time slots. Okay.... Starting to feel wary but I need a job so I don't complain. The morning of the new interview, she does it AGAIN. I have to pick new time slots. I tell the recruiter this doesn't sit well with me and makes me wary about proceeding. She gives me a bullshit answer now they are having issues aligning the interviewers with those time slots. Then when do I keep receiving confirmation emails? No response. This happens TWO MORE TIMES. My interview got pushed a total of FIVE TIMES. I got petty at this point and picked time slots for all hours of everyday of the week, no excuses from them now. The slots the recruiter agreed to were a week and a half away. I asked if they could do something earlier so I'm eager and don't want to miss my chance, no response.

Nearly 25 days after initially applying, I finally have my interviews. I thought they went well, left me with a bad feeling due to the unprofessionalism of the set up and actual interviews, but, again, ya girl needs a job. 

During the interviews, one with a supervisor and one with a team lead, most of my questions were met with answers of ""oh your recruiter should know that or should have told you already"". Nope. She did not. After my 2nd interview I asked what the next steps look like and how long I should expect a response. She said the recruiter should have set up a 3rd interview with HR already. WRONG AGAIN. I email the recruiter immediately after it ends and ask her about this. No response.

 This morning I get an auto response saying all spots have been filled and they are closing my application.
If this dumb ass recruiter hadn't made me wait NEARLY A MONTH to interview, I could have got it. Why are recruiters so fucking incompetent. I used to work at a staffing agency so I'm well versed in how genuinely disconnected from the world most recruiters can be. Not all recruiters, I have worked with some genuinely great ones over the years.

Just a rant, sorry for shitty formatting. I've been out of work for nearly 7 weeks and this was my first and only lead. And now I've had my time wasted due to negligence. I want to go off on this recruiter and find her higher ups, but I don't want t to jeopardize my friend that referred me. I didn't really want this job, but I'm desperate and would have accepted it out of necessity if offered. I hate the job market. "

Well I was within a 10th of a percent of the right score for the month and each 100 percent score I got only inches me up a fraction of a percent. Well just got off the call with a customer who wanted a 50 percent discount for no reason and he gave me a 0% and my score dropped by 8 points. And the month is over today. So I get zero of my hard earned commissions because they value irrelevant negative feedback a whole lot more than positive actual helpful responses!

Stupid me didn‚Äôt think to discuss wage in the interview because the ad was pretty clear and I was fine with the low end of their range.  

I text the manager to question the disparity and he says that he put the wrong numbers in and changed the ad ten minutes after posting and that I applied so quickly that I saw the wrong ad.

This is on indeed and I still have the ad that I responded to in my jobs file. As well as a screenshot of the ad.

I know in new York and California they have a transparency in wages thing , but this is Montana and I feel like I‚Äôm stuck.

I have a friend who‚Äôs an attorney and they‚Äôre asking one of their colleges in employment law if I have any ground to stand on, but I think I‚Äôm just screwed.

A few weeks ago there was a fatal crash that killed several young people, one of whom was a 14 y.o. Now, this girl had just gotten her first job at a well known fried chicken place that's famous on the east coast of Canada called Mary Brown's. You'd expect that the employer would send condolences to the family or some such and work on filling her position, but that's not what happened. 

The restaurant knew what a huge loss this was and decided to run a promo where proceeds from a 2 piece meal with taters would be raised for the family of the teen. Lines were out the door and waits for up to an hour at times, and almost every staff was on hand, there was such a show of support. I went back the other day and found out they had raised over 21 000$ for that family and every employee wore that like a badge of honour.
