1,2024-04-30,"Illicit drugs most potent in effect per volume naturally become the most widespread, since they are the most lucrative to smuggle. However, these types of drugs are also the most dangerous to their users.",u/DrSenpai_PHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1ch8eug/illicit_drugs_most_potent_in_effect_per_volume/,Showerthoughts,"For example, morphine vs heroin vs fentanyl. 

Morphine is the least potent and least dangerous, heroin is in-between, and fentanyl is the most potent & most dangerous.

Because a lot of these drugs are smuggled at one point or another, there is a financial incentive to distribute the most potent and (usually) most dangerous drugs, since it's most valuable per car / truck load. 

Thus, as we crack down more and more on drugs, the more and more dangerous they will become. And the more incentive there is to start distributing ever more dangerous drugs."

Think about it: Animals are a very small percentage in a vast landscape of what we mostly perceive as inanimate matter from day to day. (Trees, mountains, houses, roads) Despite this, all of the things we perceive to not move are still moving, over hours, days, months, years, thousands and millions of years tectonic plates will move, trees will grow larger, clouds will blow away.....

The inanimate objects that do move are powered by technology we have created to speed it up to move to our speed such as electricity and the combustion engine. Everything else uses energy at a much much slower rate than animals. 

We evolved from slow moving organisms and as we go bigger, the chemical processes had to become faster to sustain the trillions of cells in our body all at once

In the end, we are creating purpose in a world that is indifferent to our existence. We navigate our lives through a world that doesn't share our capacity for consciousness or intentionality."

Even worse being a pig. Litterally a sausage is like being stuffed back up your own asshole. Its so humiliating and degrading, and no gives it a single thought when we go shopping each day, I mean yes people do give eating animals a thought but not the fucking grotesque and degrading proces we put them through.

My idea is that our identity is fundamentally shaped by the values we represent, which means accepting our actions—past, present, and future—based on the values we hold. 

This includes acknowledging our mistakes, learning from them, and adjusting our behavior to align with our core beliefs.

 As we move through different roles in our lives, our values might evolve. 

We have the choice to either adopt the values associated with these roles or reject them if they conflict with our fundamental beliefs."

You can’t learn to soar like an eagle if you’re listening to chickens all day.

Ok so I drive an old Volvo XC wagon and I feel it is a superior vehicle as an affordable civilian accessible road tank with full 360 driver visibility. However, it is very low to the ground compared to the new standard huge lifted truck with ultra bright LED headlights 2 feet off my tail in the right lane. 

Idea: get an ultra-reflective fabric with a dowl on a pull string and create a back window shade, effectively a headlight reverse card. 

I guess I am debating if this would get me road-raged to my death or if it would be an effective deterrent from assholes.

Human throughput of thoughts and our information transmission bandwidth are limited by our ability to speak, which is about 150-200 words per minute. This is a bottleneck compared to our faster thinking *(at least 3x, but potentially 10x or 100x!)* and our audio, speaking, and reading comprehension abilities of 2-3x speed"

It could be super fast paced and trippy to watch.

Wind: Wind is caused by temperature gradients in the air. The only cause for wind is the sun heating certian parts of the Earth's air, causing a pressure difference.

Fossil fuels: prehistoric plants harnessed the sun's energy, turning it into chemical energy which we now burn.

Fake ID people buy beer saying they 23 or 24 not 21 exactly (in US)

So I start seeing scam ads all the time putting ridiculous salaries that nobody has (okay some people do but I've never met one IRL maybe 1 in 500 people), but they never say 100k, always 80 or 90. Once I saw a few scam stickers in places I realized this is the 13 inch thing again.

What other numbers do you see for crap people make up? I have a few more but they are more controversial :p i.e. there's an archetype who says they are always 29 years old  "

In the real world, (gimme leeway to assert my own view without argument) broadly nothing is more than the sum of its parts. A table is a macroscopic description of phenomena also microscopically describable in terms of, say, purely elements of the Standard Model of particle physics. If you have insane computational power and compute the future of the system that includes the table by predicting what all its little parts will do, then that's that! That's what will likely happen. It *being a table* doesn't matter.

But in a magic world, what an object macroscopically is really does matter! A universe that in some way responds to *intent* is a universe that responds to a macroscopic object *because* of what it is at a macroscopic level. It's like if a coin behaved a certain way because of the kind of coin it was, and being able to predict what it's microscopic, constituent parts will do won't help you! In that kind of world, the laws of physics may be ceteris paribus clauses—they only say what happen if nothing is interfered with. And plenty of macroscopic objects or beings can interfere—witches, relics, etc.

So in a world where broadly what happens in the future is much more strongly affected by the macroscopic behavior of beings and objects that don't care about fundamental laws of physics, you're stuck trying to predict what will happen using disciplines that are likewise macroscopic and especially agent-oriented. You need personal disciplines, like psychology, sociology, and etc, and physics takes a bit more of a back seat.

A world where macroscopic agents are what matter and microscopic laws are regularly violated or just don't exist is a fundamentally less knowable world."
