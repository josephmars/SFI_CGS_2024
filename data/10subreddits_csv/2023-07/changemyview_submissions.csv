it led me to consider how many innocent people in these red states, those who would never cast a vote for a republican,  are suffering for no other reason than the fact they can‚Äôt afford to migrate to a blue state. 

hartmann went on to say the republican party has regressed to a local party, its national aspirations to turn our nation into a theocratic plutocracy blocked by the public‚Äôs general distaste for the what it offers, hatred of anyone who isn‚Äôt a straight, white christian (preferably male, though straight, white christian females are given a seat at the table, provided they know their place). 

i believe that this country - and even the world, i imagine - would be markedly improved if republicans were prevented from holding office. 


all manner of human rights - for women, gays, racial minorities - would be strengthened. 

environmental awareness in red states would improve, with regulatory measures enforced so as to prevent communities (such as what we have recently seen in mississippi, and what was observed in michigan - under snyder - before it became blue) from being poisoned. 

literacy rates, which are the poorest in red states, would rise thanks to greater funding of education.

can anyone here convince me that outlawing republicans from holding office wouldn‚Äôt greatly improve the state of our society?

These guys think that a relationship is the highest point of a friendship. But they are completely separate. A bestfriendship is supposed to be a nice arrangement of two or more people having a light hearted connection where all involved get to have fun without having to put in serious effort and occasionally when something goes wrong in a friend's life, the other friend or friends are supposed to have his back. Kinda like Close Siblings connection. It's to avoid feeling lonely in this world. 

A relationship is a commitment where both have to put in effort to build a life or a future for themselves. It's to create something bigger than yourself. Like a family or a lineage. Sounds corny, but in the grand scheme of things, it is that way. In a way, a relationship is kinda like a business relationship where it can be high risk, high reward.

So, often times, a dude makes friends with a woman who he wants to build a life with. After years of low risk, medium reward (That's what friendship is) out of nowhere, he wants to jump ship and turn this into a make or break deal. That's risky.

Think of it this way, many of the guys that hangout with their female friends wouldn't do that if they were unattractive. It's always the hot looking girls that have these fake male friends. And they would get offended if the girl were to call them a brother. But they wouldn't get offended if a male friend called them a brother. You see where I'm going?

So, the true test in a male female friendship is if the guy can say he cares for her as he would for a sister. But instead, the guy starts acting like a boyfriend without getting any of the boyfriend benefits. That's just disrespectful to the woman and exploitation of oneself.

I've been in this position once. In 10th grade. I convinced myself I'm her friend. I wanted to hangout with her ""as friends"". But, I had absolutely no interest in talking to her other friend that had the exact same personality as her. Because she was unattractive but the one I wanted to hangout with, was attractive. Then I thought, ""I give so much attention to this girl and would do anything to hangout with her even platonically, yet I'd never hangout with X, Y or Z. All because I don't have any attraction to them. Even though they are exactly the same""

So, it's pathetic to be friends with someone only because you like their appearance. If you as man truly want to know whether your friendship with a woman is true or not, you have to accept them as a sibling like you would for a male friend. Similarly, you have to question if you would hangout with a person who is the same as her with a body that is not within your preference. If not, you are lying to yourself. And you are disrespecting your ""Friend""."

1,2023-07-01,CMV: Forcing borrowers to pay back student loans is literally worse than theft.,u/Pupusa42,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ntfnv/cmv_forcing_borrowers_to_pay_back_student_loans/,changemyview,"Like many people, I am upset by the recent SCOTUS decision on loans. I believe that not forgiving student loans is wrong. Not only that, I believe it is so wrong, it is theft, and a particularly perverse type of theft. Since this belief causes me a lot of distress, I'd like to take a shot at changing it.

A common sentiment is ""You agreed to pay the loan, so you should"". I think that, in general, people should pay loans they agree to take out, and that in general, they should honor contracts they enter. However, if one party commits fraud to get a contract signed, that invalidates it. If I buy a car and the dealership tells me the car has undergone a 100-point inspection and is in excellent condition, but it's then revealed that Danny Devito rolled back the mileage with a drill, put sawdust in the engine, and superglued the muffler on, I am a victim of fraud, and should get my money back.

The government forced me and other borrowers to go to school from the time we were small children. At the school, for 13 years, we were trained to believe that teachers and school staff were trustworthy, and were the people we should look to for knowledge. For this time, most staff members (in my case it was literally every single one) told us time and time again that going to college was the absolute best possible decision we could make in our lives, and that any degree would more than pay for itself over time. Even as a child, I remember asking a counselor giving a presentation about the difference between liberal arts and STEM degrees, and was told that while some degrees earned more than others, any degree was still a great investment and that a typical degree would net us a million dollars over our lifetimes. She even had a fancy government-issued fact sheet that talked about that.

The thing is, that number is a lie. Every study I have seen that calculates the value of college is designed in a ridiculous way that is designed to inflate the value as much as possible. For example, they never include salaries of students who are unemployed, or who are underemployed and working part-time jobs, or who are in school for another degree because they couldn't get a job with the first one. If you have a group of 1 lawyer making 100k, and 9 others working at Starbucks, they calculate the average at 100k. They also estimate future earnings based on earnings growth of past generations - never considering the possibility that more than doubling the supply of qualified candidates for a job might have an effect on salary growth. College are also allowed to, and usually do, present very misleading information about the value of the degrees they offer.  I won't go into all the shady stats I've seen here, but if you post a study, I will provide a detailed reply explaining why it's misleading, or if I can't, give you a delta.

So, we entered a contract with the government for a loan. But that contract was made based on information, assurances, and encouragement given by the government, in the most manipulative way possible (through authority figures from the time we could tie our shoes). That information was also false or greatly exaggerated. How is that not theft by fraud of the most disgusting kind?

Not only that, but the product is grossly overpriced, which is a direct and easily foreseeable result of the current student loan program. If you extend students a nearly limitless line of credit that is non-dischargeable, and if you make an organized effort to push entire generations into college, it doesn't take a Gomer Pyle to see that this will lead to skyrocketing tuition rates. So now not only is Danny Devito rolling back the odometer, but now he's adding a 0 to the price tag too.

Any reasonable member of congress should have also foreseen that putting billions of dollars on the table for colleges, completely free of any responsibility or risk, might incentivize those colleges to try to enroll more students. More students in a particular field means a higher supply of candidates, which lowers salaries. So not only do we pay so much more, but the value is so much less because of supply and demand. Not too mention the added perverse incentive to lower degree requirements to get more students through the door, which in turn makes a degree less valuable. Or the fact that we issue so many degrees that half of students who get them end up in jobs that didn't need them at all, meaning they spent all that money and time for nothing.

If I was going to design a student loan system that made a minimal effort to *appear* to help low-income Americans get opportunities, while my real goal was actually to funnel as much money as possible away from the poor and funnel it up to enrich lobbyists and my business donors, it would look exactly like the current system. The college admin are making sickening amounts of money, and a huge oversupply of graduates allows businesses to drastically cut wages. If you actually cared about helping people better their lives, there are a multitude of much better ways to provide educational opportunities to students. In fact, we would have been much better off if they had done nothing at all.

So either those who designed the current system did it in such a way to to extract wealth from the poor and give it to the rich while pretending to help the poor, which is evil. Or they made an exceptionally stupid decision that had disastrous consequences for future children, and they now expect those grown children to pay for their poor decisions, while also insulting them because at 18 they didn't have the critical thinking skills needed to realize what every trusted adult in their lives told them was not true. Which is still evil."

11,2023-07-01,CMV: There's no good argument for incest to be legal,u/NimishApte,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14nu87l/cmv_theres_no_good_argument_for_incest_to_be_legal/,changemyview,"Edit: The title is meant to be There's No Good Argument For Incest to be Illegal 

This is probably my most controversial opinion. I can't genuinely see any good argument for making incest illegal. There are many arguments but not good ones. Let me point out my main problems with some of them.

It's gross and disgusting: This is not even an argument against incest. I find the concept of open relationships and polyamory bizarre and wierd. I cannot for the life of me, figure out how someone finds any happiness in this. Especially, open relationships, I find creepy and weird, best confined to the Porn screen. But that doesn't mean they should be illegal. My disgust against open relationships cannot translate into them being illegal. Also 100 years ago, we found miscgenation gross and disgusting. 50 years ago, we found homosexuality gross and disgusting. If they weren't good enough reasons to ban those acts, this isn't a good reason to ban incest.

There will be deformed babies: First of all, incest isn't inbreeding. Incest means having sexual relations with a close family member. It says nothing about having children. Moreover, this is essentially a eugenic argument. We should ban people from reproducing because they have flawed genes. Now, it isn't immediately obvious that eugenics is bad. But then, there's a very strong case for banning people with say, Huntingtons from reproducing. In a woman with Huntingtons, the threat of passing down the disease is at minimum 25% compared to 3-10% for incest. Surely by this logic, people with genetic deformations should be banned from reproduction. 

There is sexual abuse: This is the most common argument against the legalization of incest. But this is doesn't make sense. Because incest statute doesn't ban abuse, it bans incest. These laws make no distinction between consensual and non consensual acts. So if you want incestous abuse, to be prosecuted separately, why shouldn't we add a clause which stipulates that it's only illegal if there's no consent? One person literally said it will make prosecution difficult as you would have to prove lack of consent beyond a reasonable doubt. If you want the standard of proof for sex crimes to be lowered, why not advocate for that? Moreover, power differentials exist in every relationship. Except for a rare few like doctor patient, none are illegal. 

The sanctity of the family: This again is not in any way compelling. Yes, can incestuous relationships endanger parent child or sibling relationships? Yes. But so can everything else and we don't ban that. Wills produce immense animosity and enmity amongst siblings. Should we make that illegal? If two siblings open a business together, it can massively complicate the relationship. If two siblings cohabitate together, it can massively complicate the relationship. Should we make that illegal as well? Adults should have the ability to make choices they want to. Even if they are quite risky. 

I mean, what's the practical difference between having sexual relations with your childhood bestfriend and having sexual relations with your sibling? If one is legal and adorable, why is the other one suddenly grooming and abuse? Parent Child incest is a grey area since grooming and sexual abuse is a real possibility. But surely after a point it's okay. If a 43 year old has sex with his or her parent, how is it grooming?

I don't see any good arguments for making incest illegal."
106,2023-07-01,CMV: Supreme Court Made the Right Decision: Web Designers/Artists Shouldn't Be Forced to Create Content They Disagree With,u/Adzadz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14nuhhr/cmv_supreme_court_made_the_right_decision_web/,changemyview,"This relates to the 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis 6-3 Supreme Court verdict.  
  
As a professional artist, you have the agency to craft bespoke projects that align with your creative vision and values. This autonomy allows you the discretion to choose which projects you wish to undertake, and which ones you'd prefer to decline.  
  
However, it's critical to clarify that this discretion shouldn't be employed to discriminate against clients based on protected characteristics. For instance, rejecting a project on the grounds that the client is a woman should be illegal.  
  
Conversely, it should be entirely within your rights to decline a project based on its content or message, even if that content relates to a protected characteristic. This principle isn't about discriminating against individuals, but rather about maintaining personal integrity and not being forced into expressing messages you disagree with.  
  
Example 1: An Orthodox Christian client requests that you inscribe 'Homosexuality is a sin' on a website. Your right to turn down this project isn't an act against the client's faith, but rather a stand against the message, which may not align with your values.  
  
Example 2: If a gay couple asks you to design a piece celebrating their marriage, you can refuse this project. Not because of their sexual orientation, but because the project's content might not resonate with your personal values.  
  
Example 3: A Black individual requests a simple design saying 'I like apples' on a website. In this case, you should only be able to refuse the project if you would do the same for any other client regardless of their race. If, for example, a white client made the same request and you agreed, refusing the Black client would be unlawful and discriminatory, as you would be rejecting based on a protected characteristic, not the substance of the project.  
  
The essence of this argument hinges on the concept of compelled speech: no one should be forced to create or endorse a message that contradicts their values, regardless of the nature of the client's request.

Some people seem to be missing my point, the man claim is  literally that what he believes is undeniable fact! Im calling that into question here.

I read an article today by a Yale *Finance* professor that may well be the most egregious defense of the divine I‚Äôve ever heard (read). He begins with typical Christian rhetoric on how all he needs to justify his perspective is faith. Which is pretty weak argumentation for the bold statements he makes. 

He then goes bonkers with his claims. The first statement is that there is falsifiable evidence for the resurrection. Quite the bold claim when bringing life back after systemic shutdown has never been done. This man is a professor at one of the post prestigious universities in the United States. Despite this incredible achievement displaying his intellect, he believes in the impossible. Shouldn‚Äôt any argument claiming zombification be instantly disregarded? Is it not common sense that such a thing is not biologically possible. 

It seems to me at least that this line of thinking surpasses any suspension of disbelief. With zero evidence to back this claim, he proposes that it can be rationally proven? Though it‚Äôs never been done, so many Christians‚Äô in academia support absurd claims like this. How are opinions like this treated as valid and sane? If such a thing cannot be recreated by any scientific means, and the only evidence exists in a 2 thousand+ year old book. How do people deny all sense of logic and critical thinking and make redundant statements like this without realizing their own delusion. He goes on to say that it is more likely the resurrection is factual, than it is likely 2 billion people believe in something false. 

I‚Äôve never been a fan of religion, I‚Äôll be 100% honest. However I pride myself in at least hearing their arguments and opinions, after all we are human all the same. But this feels like something that should land you in a mental institution.

Edit 1:) My choice of using delusion may be ill advised if someone can help me to find a more appropriate word for describing belief in the impossible I would greatly appreciate it. 

Edit 2:) His first bit of evidence.

There is credible evidence for Jesus‚Äô death and resurrection
Non-Christian philosopher of religion Antony Flew: ‚ÄúThe evidence for the resurrection is better than for claimed miracles in any other religion. It‚Äôs outstandingly different in quality and quantity.‚Äù
 

THE LIKELIHOOD OF A FALSE CLAIM LIKE THIS BEING BELIEVED IS VERY LOW

It is exceptionally rare for followers of a religious leader to claim that he rose bodily from the dead, if only because false claims of this sort are easily debunked.

Edit 3:) For those harping on my suggestion that such a belief could be grounds for insanity. The Catholic Church has summarily executed millions for not adhering to their beliefs. Im not going act as if I‚Äôm the monster here, unless you are willing to acknowledge the monstrosity of the church.

Edit 4:) A likely fruitless attempt to link the article. (I‚Äôm not very technologically savvy)

It's important for them to communicate well so that people know what they're thinking and what they want to do.  
  
The best example is John Fetterman, anytime he speaks he makes no sense. A lot of arguments people have are that he just can't speak clearly but mentally he is the same. I'm not convinced of that but even if that were true I still don't think he should be in office. There have been multiple times when he tried to speak in Congress and nobody was able to understand him, that in turn wastes taxpayer money and time for other issues that can be hashed out and solved.  
  
Some people would say, well Joe Biden, or Donald Trump can't speak clearly, in my opinion thats a completely different thing, at the end of the day they can convey ideas, regurgitate a scripted speech, and talk and have regular conversations with people. Sometimes they both say things that make no sense but its not consistent and not all the time.  
  
John Fetterman on the otherhand has no ability to speak, convey ideas, or form coherent sentences, and thats why I think he should resign from office, or be forced out somehow.  
  
Ive thought about Stephen Hawking and yes he was a genius and unable to speak and thats the only semi convincing argument I can think of, and if John Fetterman was able to speak through a robot and rebuttal arguments and have conversations as well as Stephen Hawking was able to through a computer then id have no problem with that.  
  
I feel like people today are way to accepting where they would even argue for people with mental disorders such as people with down syndrome being in political office. And thats where we are headed to at this point.

All these red pill manosphere spaces online and these ultra masculinity advocates like Andrew Tate, fresh & fit, and all these relationship gurus etc. but I think it's just to highlight this one fact. Men struggle with women. And I think dating is far easier for women than for men. My first reason is that men have to perform much more in dates than women do and here's what I mean. Men have to do most of, if not all the initiating. Men have to ask the girl out, then plan the date, picking the place to eat, carrying out the conversation. While the women just lays backs and approves if she finds the man attractive enough.
Women have to do very little to no work when it comes to initiating when it comes to dates and relationships I think. My second reason is that women typically get much more attention from guys than men get attention from women. You can easily analyze this with social media data. On tinder women typically swipe right 90% of the time, on social media an average looking woman gets far more messages and likes than an attractive man. I'd argue throughout life women get way more compliments and attention from the opposite sex than men do. My third reason is the rise of all this manosphere, red pill stuff. But for which gender is it mostly targeting to? Men. And the reason why you see all these relationship channels and dating coaches all focusing on men improving themselves to be attractive to women. You don't see any female dating coaches teaching women how to get men and you never see it because women typically don't struggle attracting men. At least not anywhere in comparison on men struggle to attract women. That's why you see all these manosphere spaces popping up.
Because the reality is most men struggle with women.
So because of that I think dating is way easier for women.As I said before women typically get way more attention from the opposite sex than guys. Women get way more compliments, gifts than your average guy ever would. And throughout the dating process I feel like men have to just put in way more work. Planning, initiating, taking her out to a nice place, paying for the date, keeping the conversation going, having the balls to ask her out in the first place and so on. I don't know if many ladies can empathize with this but imagine having feelings/interest in someone not knowing if they even like you back and having the courage to ask them out or tell them you like them. That can be very intimidating for lots of guys and lots of them struggle with that as well fear of rejection which women don't have to face at least not nearly as much.
Okay those are my reasons. Am I crazy? Feel free to change my view. I'd love to hear the other side."

1,2023-07-01,"CMV: The legal or occupational prohibition or the perpetuation of social taboos pertaining to sexual conduct strictly on the basis of a potential for ""power imbalances"" is rhetorically insufficient",u/Pandini23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14nzv87/cmv_the_legal_or_occupational_prohibition_or_the/,changemyview,"Sexual and marital freedoms are constantly expanding; gays and prostitutes (Nevada) have recently acquired the rights to be exempt from legal persecution for their engagement in sexual and/or matrimonial pursuits.

However, the legalization of such behaviors introduces new inquiries about the potential lack of rhetorical consistency that can be attributed to the attitudes--legal, occupational, social, and otherwise- that people commonly have. This is because the ideas of ""love is love,"" and ""born this way,"" and ""be gay, do crime"" would be considered heinous violations on multiple societal levels of conventionally acceptable forms of sexual conduct, even if there is a mutual state of consent for any party involved.

Can it not be argued that pedophiles, and people attracted to their siblings, or people seeking legal recognition for multiple active partners are not genuinely in love with their partners? Or, that they were born in a way that made them more inclined to pursue those sexual partners? Or, from a more libertarian perspective, that the government has no business meddling in the consensual marriages of anyone to begin with?

Now, this is where the view in the title comes into play. One might assert that these forms of relationships entail an inherent state of ""power imbalance."" For example, a brother might have an age ""advantage"" over his younger sister, and exploit that for his own benefit. Or a 20 year old might have a similar advantage over a 17 year old, making him a pedophile. Or, someone with 4 wives cannot treat each one equally, creating a hierarchy within that marriage structure.

All of these criticisms and objections are completely valid, but only in isolation. This is because *every* relationship that ever existed had a power imbalance. It is impossible all power factors to be evaluated accurately, or to even know if they exist. But even our most basic assumptions of what gives someone power in a relationship would lend to the idea that an imbalance must exist. No two people in a relationship can have the same exact simultaneous wealth, income, familial support, physical strength/size, age, intelligence, academic or occupational success, health conditions, mental maturity, neurological stability, etc.

The assumption, however, that there is not a spectrum or varying degrees of magnitude of imbalance of power within relationships would be a ridiculous notion. But the problem is that there is no numerical or empirical means of determining this magnitude for many aspects of any imbalance. Sure, you can measure a person's income and determine that their wealth gives them an advantage, but what if they have immense debts? What if they have poor financial skills? What if they got extraordinarily fortunate to be granted a position in a high-paying job with an expiration date that doesn't bode well for their success in the near future? 

 This is why it's complete nonsense to make blanket statements about the nature of human relationships and the moral implications therein. You might say ""Any adult who sexually engages with a minor is a pedophile, who's actions can only be described as predatory and exploitative. Minors are not mentally mature enough to consent to sex with an adult.""

Is this really accurate for any given scenario? As I mentioned before, would a 20 year old really be exploiting a 17 year old who verbally consents to sex, and by any measure of maturity or intelligence would be considered superior to him?

That concludes the proposal for which I ask to change my view.

In order to change my view, you would have to prove that there is an abnormal statistical correlation of abuse, misconduct, or chaos within incestual, pedophiliac, polygamous, or any other prohibited marriage that significantly differs from ""normal"" relationships.

The sources of information should not date back further than 1990, since data collection protocols were not reviewed and enforced as rigidly prior to that time. "

In the US, 82% of total homicide victims are male, 18% are female. Women probably endure more sexual violence, but men definitely endure more violence overall given the 4:1 murder ratio.
* Men do the overwhelming majority of the nasty, dangerous work, such as roofing in the summer,  oil rig operation, management of sewers, garbage collection, etc.

I think this speaks to the greater competitiveness of the male world: If a man fails in life, he's judged a complete fuckup,  and ends up a homeless low-status loser. If a woman fails, she can almost always just get married. 
* Men are much more likely to kill themselves [(4:1)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiw7qy88-3_AhWbl2oFHWL0B-YQFnoECBAQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fafsp.org%2Fsuicide-statistics%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DAdditional%2520facts%2520about%2520suicide%2520in%2Care%2520132%2520suicides%2520per%2520day.&usg=AOvVaw2usVLk1O1cQwWdsOeq4Wfy&opi=89978449). Although women attempt suicide more than men, men use dramatically more lethal means (hanging, gunshots, jumping). Because I'm not so sexist as to claim that women are too stupid to know how to actually succeed in killing themselves, I conclude that the difference in suicide methods reflects a difference in willingness to die. (And in any case, [even when controlling for method,](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiSyqWJ-u3_AhWOlmoFHURBCJQQFnoECBYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fsuicide%2Fsuicide-data-statistics.html&usg=AOvVaw3-9aQp5dOdMq-Lh4yZJs0Q&opi=89978449) men manage to kill themselves more effectively than women.)

(This remains true well after the children leave the nest. And no, I'm not persuaded that childcare is harder than conventional employment.)
* The law heavily favors women in child custody and child support disputes, and the institution of alimony transfers far more male wealth to women than female wealth to men. 
* Men are much more likely to die in combat; in fact, during serious military conflicts, they face military slavery (‚Äúthe draft‚Äù).  ([In Iraq,](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi75KGL9e3_AhV_k2oFHWojC0AQFnoECBAQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC3111768%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DResults%2C(793%2520deaths)%2520for%2520men.&usg=AOvVaw2TVQhdN1nXIravTRS5UAiU&opi=89978449) women were 2.9% of all American combat deaths, men the other 97.1%; in WWII, of the 292,000 members of the US military who were killed by enemy fire, only sixteen were female. Women made up only 0.1 percent of the military's 405,000 war-related deaths.) 
* Our culture automatically cares more about female suffering and wellbeing than male suffering: ""The ship is sinking! Save the women and children first!"" Male job candidates are significantly more [penalized for crying](https://doi.org/10.1002/EJSP.1974) than women; subjects express that it appears that a woman in distress is [taken more seriously](https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.1982.55.2.479) than a man in distress.
* The dating market is more competitive for men than for women; women are far more selective than men about sex partners. Imagine an attractive person of the opposite sex walking up to you on a college campus and saying, ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôve been noticing you around town lately, and I fnd you very attractive.

* The ""minimum deal"" of life for men is worse than for women. The ""minimum deal"" for women seems to be ""get married."" The minimum deal for men seems to be: become homeless and kill yourself, if you aren't murdered first. Yes, men make more money and enjoy greater prestige because men are overrepresented at both the top *and* the bottom levels of society. But the degree to which being at the bottom of society hurts you is greater than the degree to which being at the top helps you. That is, it's so much more bad to be at the bottom than it is good to be at the top. Just ask yourself: would you rather experience the greatest amount of pleasure possible for 20 seconds, followed by the greatest amount of suffering possible for 20 seconds? Our response tells us that there is not a 1:1 ratio of pleasure to suffering. How about 30 seconds of the greatest possible amount of pleasure for 20 seconds of the worst possible amount of pain? 40:20? 50:20? 

According to Christian legend, God told Adam and Eve before their ouster from the garden of eden: ""man shall live by the sweat of his brow, and woman shall suffer the pain of childbirth."" Modern technology has greatly minimized the pain of childbirth, but has it equally lightened the burden on men's shoulders?

I won't deny that men do much less childcare and housework than women, and non-custodial fathers provide little financial or parental support for their children. Also, men are the perpetrators, and women are the victims, of the vast majority of sexual violence. (Although I'm not sure what the stats at prisons do to this balance; apparently rape in male prisons is a huge epidemic and is vastly greater than rape in female prisons. Considering the ridiculously disproportionate number of men in prisons, it's possible that this balances out. 

Anticipated objection: ""But men are often the primary perpetrators of the issues facing men."" This is irrelevant to the post title, but in any case, I think this is like saying ""it's not bad that humans are victims of murder because, after all, all of the perpetrators of murder are also humans."" The identity group to which the perpetrators belong is irrelevant to whether an individual was treated unjustly if the perps and victims are different *individuals.* This simple-minded identity-politics is like saying ""someone with red hair beat me up when I was 12. Therefore, it's okay for me to beat someone up today, so long as they also have red hair (regardless of whether they are the same person)."""

Many women are also not responsible either. They are evil and choose to keep good fathers away from their children. Some just sleep around and don't know who the father is. Then, they don't have the accountability to put up with their actions and demand society treats them differently because of their choices.

In my case, it was 100% my mother's fault. She had a hook-up with a man she never saw before, never saw him again, decided not to look for him and kept him from knowing he had a child. She also never provided me with any male role models and now I have to clean up the mess she made."

By slashing taxes on businesses and individuals, we don't just lighten financial burdens‚Äîwe ignite a compelling incentive for investments that stoke the engines of economic activity.

Let's consider businesses. When they hold onto more income thanks to tax cuts, they possess greater capacity to invest in expansion, research, and workforce development. These activities are not side shows in our economy‚Äîthey are the driving forces behind job creation and economic growth. Critics may raise the specter of tax cuts as a boon for the wealthy, but this need not be the case. Tax cuts can be and should be meticulously tailored, focusing on progressivity to ensure that lower and middle-income earners reap proportionally greater benefits. This isn't just desirable‚Äîit's achievable.

As for individuals, they too benefit from tax cuts. With more disposable income at their disposal, they can drive demand by increasing their consumption of goods and services. The critics will cry foul, asserting that such policies inevitably lead to deficits and increased national debt. I urge those critics to look beyond the immediate horizon. The fundamental purpose of tax cuts is to fuel the economy to the point where the tax base broadens. Given time, this expanded tax base can produce a surge in total tax revenue, in spite of lower tax rates.

Now, let's address the matter of timing and effectiveness. Tax cuts aren't a blunt instrument, their impact can differ depending on the economic climate. I fully recognize this. A tax cut implemented during an economic downturn may yield different results compared to one during a period of economic growth. Flexibility and keen economic analysis are critical tools in our toolbox.

Critics may contend that there's no clear correlation between low taxes and economic growth, given the sea of influencing factors. But even amidst this sea, we should not dismiss the contributory role of tax cuts in promoting economic growth. They are not a drop in the ocean, but a significant current in the economic stream.

Income inequality is often a concern raised alongside tax cuts. Yet, by structuring tax cuts progressively and ensuring that economic growth creates more opportunities, we can actively address this concern for all income groups.

It is also vital not to underestimate the potential impact of reduced taxes on public services. However, if a tax cut successfully stimulates economic growth, it could broaden the tax base and augment total tax revenue, ensuring public services are well-funded.

Indeed, government spending, funded by taxes, plays a pivotal role in driving economic growth. Investments in infrastructure, education, and social services can energize the economy. The goal here isn't to belittle the importance of government spending. Rather, it's about finding the optimal balance that allows for necessary government investment while promoting economic growth through tax reductions.

My viewpoint does not downplay the necessity of taxes or call for their abolition. They are undeniably crucial for funding public goods and services. However, our focus should be on striking a balance that supercharges economic growth while sufficiently supporting necessary government functions. Tax cuts are not an economic panacea, they are a component of complex economic systems, and their effectiveness can vary. But they are a potent tool, and we would be remiss not to wield them effectively."

Give them more income through tax cuts, and watch them expand, innovate, and create jobs. Just look at the 1964 tax cuts in the U.S. ‚Äì they spurred growth rates of over 5% per year for five years straight. It's clear as day ‚Äì lower taxes stimulate business activity, and business activity fuels our economy.

The notion that tax cuts primarily benefit the wealthy is a weak argument. Tax cuts can be ‚Äì and must be ‚Äì carefully tailored to ensure the lion's share of benefits go to lower and middle-income earners. Yes, the wealthy might save more of their tax cuts rather than spend, but this doesn't discredit the power of tax cuts. It simply highlights the need for smart, progressive tax policies.

For individuals, the benefits of tax cuts are undeniable. More disposable income means more consumption. More consumption means more demand. More demand means more growth. It's a virtuous cycle.

Some will argue that tax cuts lead to deficits and increased national debt. But this perspective lacks foresight. Yes, there might be a temporary increase in the deficit, but a widened tax base ‚Äì as seen in the aftermath of the 1980s U.S. tax cuts ‚Äì can generate a swell in total tax revenue over time.

Tax cuts aren't an economic sledgehammer. They're a finely-tuned instrument, and their impact varies with the economic climate. But whether in a downturn or a boom, they are a critical tool in our arsenal.

Low taxes and economic growth are not two ships passing in the night. They are fundamentally intertwined. Sure, there are many factors influencing economic growth, but the role of tax cuts is not just another factor ‚Äì it's a major driving force.

Income inequality concerns are valid. But instead of shying away from tax cuts, we should use them as a tool to actively address this issue. If the cuts are structured progressively, we can ensure that everyone, including the most vulnerable, reaps the benefits. And yes, poorly structured tax cuts can exacerbate wealth gaps. That's why we must not simply cut taxes, but cut them intelligently.

The impact of reduced taxes on public services must not be underestimated. But don't view this as an insurmountable challenge. View it as an opportunity. A successful tax cut stimulates growth, broadens the tax base, and ultimately increases total tax revenue ‚Äì ensuring our public services are well-funded.

Government spending plays a key role in our economy. And taxes fuel this spending. But this doesn't mean we can't lower taxes. It means we need to strike a balance. It's not about diminishing the role of government. It's about optimizing it ‚Äì making the most of both government spending and private sector growth. Tax cuts aren't an economic panacea ‚Äì but they're no placebo either."

Let‚Äôs cover the different points it would have been better

To start she‚Äôs a great character. Has a unique background. She‚Äôs basically a time traveller coming from a completely different era than anyone else in the series. 

The ending of the clash of the titans arc would have been better. I thought she had some kind of hidden agenda but no she was just acting dumb at the end and seems to have been knowingly acting dumb.

I see her knowledge potentially having made the Royal government arc go differently. But she didn‚Äôt have that much knowledge of the outside world and her knowledge was outdated by many decades. A big thing is I think she could have made the revelation of Eren being about to be eaten more explicit, as Zo√´‚Äôs logic was a bit iffy when that happened.

If they wanted to keep that arc more in the dark they could have had her come back in the Return to Shiganshina arc easily. And if they did then none of her knowledge of Marley would have been relevant until after the Eldians learned of Marley themselves.

Porco was not a good enough character to warrant replacing Ymir, and Falco could have been written to not be the Jaw Titan.

I‚Äôm not sure what roles she could have had in the Marley arc and war for Paradis arc but here are some thoughts

I think of her as being fairly similar to Sasha. Less comedic but her extreme deprivation she faced means being able to live a better life after the defeat of the titans would have had a big impact on her. But she also should have arguably the biggest grudge against Marley if anyone in the series. I‚Äôd say even more than Grisha. 

She also seemingly had a connection to Ymir the first Titan. Her name and cult beliefs aside, she had a similar life to Ymir and was explicitly shown in the paths when she became a Titan. I think the idea of her being some kind of chosen one of Ymir or avatar or something makes sense. I think a storyline where she makes a sacrifice like Ymir would have been good. She kind of died in a sacrifice but in a bad way before this parallel could have been explored and without certain elements like the leadership role and being eaten by three people.

Having her sacrifice at the very end would have probably been a lot better."

[This is NOT a post about fat-shaming or anything of that nature, but just trying to take a look at the facts from an economic standpoint, would love to get other perspectives. ]",u/tuzi_su,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14o45sd/cmv_the_united_states_should_have_fat_tax_this_is/,changemyview,"Okay, about me, I am neither right wing or left wing. I am independent. 

Japan has a fat tax, otherwise known as ""Metabo Law"" that fines people between the ages of 40 and 74 for being overweight/obese, but from what I understand, the companies of overweight employees are the ones fined rather than the individuals themselves. When I first read about this, I thought it was completely crazy, but this law has actually worked really well for Japan, and the overall health of Japan on a large scale has actually improved. I think that this could potentially work in the U.S. as well.

Now, I look at some problems in the Untied States. The leading cause of death in the United States is correlated with obesity. To add to that, this can be a HUGE financial burden on the economy. More than 70% of the U.S. population is overweight (according to what I've read), and it seems to only be increasing. 

I'm aware of the whole body positivity movement, and I agree that everyone has intrinsic value regardless of their shape/size. At the same time, you cannot argue with health risks that come with being overweight/obese, and with the exception of certain health conditions where weight is out of your control, I do think people have some responsibility to make healthy lifestyle choices.  These choices do not only impact yourself, but everyone else around you whether directly or indirectly, including massive financial stress on the U.S. healthcare system.

I also get that a lot of people (myself included) have high demanding jobs that are relatively low-paying, so it's easier to get fast food and other less healthy but more convenient options. Perhaps, if companies are fined for the weight of their workers, they will take responsibility to either increase wages, educate employees on health, or create a work environment that offers free exercise or healthier food options. I'm sick and tired of only being offered free donuts, cookies, and cake at work.

1,2023-07-01,CMV: Political parties and associated voters should be able to protect their party's identity,u/Wigglebot23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14o4nze/cmv_political_parties_and_associated_voters/,changemyview,"This view is not intended to relate to RFK Jr. running for Democratic presidential nominee, nor does it bring into question either the closed or regular open primary systems which are used by the vast majority of US states, as they give parties or associated voters a choice before the party is stuck with the candidate, though there may be some issues with the open primaries. The main implication of the view expressed here is that in primaries with no guarantee of any commitment by the voter to the party (mainly blanket and nonpartisan blanket primaries), candidates should not get to freely choose their parties, as this compromises the party's identity. 

A few states such as California, Washington, and Alaska used to use a blanket primary system. In these, a voter can vote for anyone regardless of party, and for each party, the candidate (or candidates in the case of a block election) with the most votes is the nominee. There is zero association between a voter and the party's primary they may be voting in, and they need not commit to voting for one party or the other. In California Democratic Party v. Jones, this system was struck down as unconstitutional in a 7-2 majority for violating the 1st amendment's implied right to freedom of association.

However, these states have since adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary system in which an election is held where voters may vote for any candidate, and a set number at the top advance to the general election. However, these candidates are still listed as the party of their choice, and this is what I object to. This system was upheld in a 7-2 majority in Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party.

I'm not opposed to nonpartisan blanket primaries, but candidates should not be able to identify as whatever party they please. A party is associated with its nominees, and if neither they nor committed voters decide those nominees, then a party's image may be ruined by an unwanted candidate chosen by outsiders who may have been inconsistent in their party selections.

To change my view, it would probably be best to assess the rights of parties to choose their image. I understand there may be significant negative effects as candidates with a major party ID of any type have a huge advantage and parties may use their own discretion to try to shut a candidate that they can't reasonably distance themselves from (such as an incumbent who was clearly part of the party but was not always in line) to push extremism, but I think the overall principal must hold more weight."

After the event a bunch of LGBT attendees where angry at the police and asking them to leave. They showed frustration towards me and my staff.

I put myself on the line to protect these people. I got the police involved to protect THEM. TO PROTECT THERE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. Yet I'm the bad guy? The police are the bad guys? I assure everyone, if those right wingers where free to do what they want, it would have got NASTY.

I understand the past law enforcement has had with the LGBT community, but c'mon. Get over it. Is there no room for change? Improvement? These cops PROTECTED these people. There was no question that these cops where good people who had nothing but public safety in mind.  Do these thoughts leaders in control of movements like this event want people to get along? What is the goal? More fighting? Keep everyone angry and fighting with one another?

The LGBT community lost my support. Not for anything bigoted or politically. You people are just sheep. I support people, not a silly identity.

The stigma against police is one of many issues. The dismissive tone towards ""hetero normative"" behaviour is also incredibly alarming. This isn't the way for everyone to integrate and accept each other.

However, the environment must certainly play a role in shaping these preferentes and behaviors. I mean everything else from height, weight, Muscle mass, intelligence, temparament, desease, etc. seems to work this way. Why should human sexuality be the exception? If the current theories of learning and behavior are correct, people must become gay because their environment is set up such that behaviors correlated with being gay are reinforced. 

One of the arguments that I've heard is that homosexuality has been observed in nature among animals. But, are we forgetting that animals are subjected to the same environmental laws as humans. A chimpanzee engaging in homosexual behavior does not prove that they were born that way, but merely that their environment shaped their behavior accordingly. 

Another argument is that homosexual behavior cannot be shaped by the environment because the environment often punishes this form of behavior. Members of the LGBT community are often  victims to horrendous social discrimination and punishers. If their behavior is often subjected to punishment then surely they must stop being gay. We must remember that the environment is not a vacuum. While punishers are certainly present, there are also reinforcers at play. Why do people smoke, drink, stay in abusive relationships, etc? The frequency, magnitude, delay, and consistency of both punishers and reinforcers can make behavior shift in one of many directions

What about gay conversion therapy? If sexuality can be affected by the environement, why hasn't this form of ""therapy"" worked to turned someone straight? Well, it just because it's not effective. Why isn't Crystal ""therapy"" not effective in changing someone's behavior? Well simply because it's not effective. The fact that some despicable organizations still attempt to use conversion therapy is not a testament to it being a true science. I should  note however that there are some older behavioral studies that have demonstrated that sexual arousal can be conditioned. The issue is that these themes have not been reexplored in recent times. Research has shifted away from these subjects due to the possible backlash, ethical considerations, and the fact that someone's sexuality should not be something that we should want to change."

I understand how race adds on to this situation, but at that level, academically, a poor white kid and a poor black kid living in the same neighborhood would have around the same circumstances right? 

I believe there should be more in place looking at things socioeconomically, because that's what historical racial injustice at large has culminated in today. Articles about how ""I was a poor Latino immigrant and I went to college and that's not possible anymore,"" confuse me because a large part of their struggles were based on their socioeconomic status, and immigration status and those are still things being considered in college decisions today.

I have a whole new respect for women and the shit you all gotta deal with.    

So change my  mind, because I think these sort of people need sterilized or locked up.   

I think the havoc they wreak upon women is a very real damage deserving real punishment.    

You wanna hit it, be blunt and lay it out.  Shoot your shot.   I have no problem with that, but pretend to be someone's friend and manage their emotional needs purely to get sex, fuck I got so many problems with that.     

Ultimately the is behavior is the responsibility of us men to regulate and we all need to do better."

I think that voting is pointless and that my vote holds little to no value at all.

I don't believe there will ever be an election that will change because I do or don't vote. 

Other than the belief that my vote holds little to no importance, I also will never vote because I'm apathetic towards any issues that arise at a local, statewide, or national level. It seems like a waste of time and energy to put in the effort to register to vote and actually go the polls, especially when I know it won't make a difference. I think it's an even bigger waste of time to actually educate myself on the issues I want to vote on, and that is another reason I don't want to vote. Even when the issue directly relates to something that would benefit me and I believe in like the legalization of marijuana, I still didn't vote because I knew my vote wouldn't matter. 

I feel like I can understand why people would vote. I would be open to the idea of voting, but I have a hard time getting past the fact that it's a waste of time."
3,2023-07-01,"CMV: The Death Penalty is wrong, and always has been.",u/Leytonio,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14odhx9/cmv_the_death_penalty_is_wrong_and_always_has_been/,changemyview,"Background: I‚Äôm a 20-something man in Australia, where the death penalty has been abolished since before I was born.

Opinion clarification: The death penalty is morally wrong, should be abolished in every state/justice system, and should never have been instituted in humankind‚Äôs history. (Note that I am not advocating time travel)

My personal arguments for my opinion:

#1: Innocence. This is, in any approach to the topic, the most powerful argument against capital punishment imo. Even if we granted that it‚Äôs ok to execute the guilty, the fact is that it‚Äôs not possible for humans to determine with 100% certainty that someone is guilty of a crime. Has never been possible, will never be possible. The danger of even one innocent person being killed by the justice system invalidates the whole thing right away. Of course innocent people going to prison is plenty bad but this can at least be *somewhat* compensated; life has the chance to go on, death is final.

#2: Rights. Human beings do not have the right to take another life. This is a weaker argument because I admit it‚Äôs based on a personal belief system, but it goes like this. Human beings have to exist within the same moral framework. If it‚Äôs wrong to kill, it‚Äôs wrong in all circumstances, whether it‚Äôs cold blooded murder, execution, or warfare. There‚Äôs some wiggle room when it comes to things like accidents, self-defence etc but that‚Äôs outside the scope I think.

Pre-rebuttal against common reasons for the death penalty:

#1: [Some people deserve death] Maybe they do! If you asked me if Hitler deserved death, I‚Äôd say probably yeah. But do I have the right to make that decision? No. Does anyone have the right? No. There‚Äôs a difference between making a moral judgement as to what would be someone‚Äôs ‚Äújust desserts‚Äù and actually giving it to them. Humans shouldn‚Äôt have the ability to kill, neither should governments.

#2: [It‚Äôs a deterrent] Putting aside any data on the matter, and I‚Äôve reason to believe the data is at best inconclusive, this goes into the utilitarian aspects of punishment, which don‚Äôt speak to my reasons against, but I‚Äôll still engage on these terms. We imagine criminals as being deterred by the threat of what could happen to them , but it‚Äôs not threatening them with what *will* happen, it‚Äôs threatening with what *might* happen. Someone willing to risk life in prison is probably also willing to risk death because *they don‚Äôt plan on getting caught.* If anything they‚Äôll likely go to more extreme measures not to get caught e.g. murdering witnesses etc. Willing to concede this is probably not great rebuttal since I can‚Äôt claim to know how all criminals think.

#3: [It provides closure for victims/families] This argument always feels disingenuous. A few things: One, victims families (afaik) don‚Äôt get a say in the punishment in the justice systems I‚Äôm aware of. Their desire to end or spare the criminals life has no bearing on the judge, and in many cases families of murder victims are vocally opposed to capital punishment for the offender. Not to mention the guilt if that family changes their mind and are forced to live with death on their conscience. At any rate, revenge hardly seems a healthy way to cope with loss. Another rebuttal I‚Äôm somewhat sympathetic to: What about the killer‚Äôs family? Do they deserve to never see their loved one alive again? Even if the killer deserves it, there seems to be a lot of emotional collateral damage to consider.

#4: [Death penalty saves money/stops overcrowding etc] This argument is downright ghoulish and I‚Äôll come out and say you have a hell of an uphill battle changing my mind on this. I don‚Äôt care if it saves money or whatever. A functioning society has to be able to make material sacrifices in order to do the right thing. Justice isn‚Äôt a business.

Anyway, there‚Äôs my position and reasons. I‚Äôll do my best to be purely logical, but it‚Äôs clear that some part of this is coming from a place of pathos."
1,2023-07-01,"CMV: Women only like really attractive men, having a good personality or being confident don't matter",u/thatsridiculousdudee,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14odlpo/cmv_women_only_like_really_attractive_men_having/,changemyview,"I always hear people say things like ""love is in the eye of the beholder"" or ""just be confident and charismatic and girls will like you"".

What I believe is that only the 10/10 guys (often referred to as Chad's and Brads) are genuinely attractive to women. If you are a sub 5 male or below you will be ignored or brushed off.

This counts for all types of women. Some women like the jock type, nerdy girls will go for a nerdy guy who wears star trek shirts and goes to comic con, goth girls will go for the goth guys. One thing all these different types of guys have in common is they are all 10s on the attractive scale. 

You can always tell when a woman is attracted to you and when she's repulsed. It'll be in her facial expression when she sees you which is 100% involuntary. If it's a gleefull expression she likes you, if it's a look of disgust or anger it means she is completely turned off. I'm not saying that there's absolutely no hope for ulgy guys they have a better chance with a girl of their own stars. To say that a below average looking guy has any chance with a super attractive stacy is absolutely ridiculous."
9,2023-07-02,CMV: Some people are spiritually dead.,u/Real_Carl_Ramirez,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14oerk4/cmv_some_people_are_spiritually_dead/,changemyview,"This CMV post is inspired by this interview I watched on TV: [Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr Baumann on the importance of deep listening | One Plus One | ABC News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qmhKscf0W4)

I've been in an on-and-off debate with my brother for over 3 years where I am challenged to defend my irreligiosity. I always lose, [see here](https://imgur.com/a/jVrxqdd) for an example where he challenges me to a debate via Viber. And even if I were to present a good argument, he always has this insurmountable rebuttal up his sleeve:

>What about spiritual health? The health experts at the WHO say it's essential.

So unfortunately, I have no rebuttal for that. [The WHO indeed says that spiritual health is an essential part of health](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329763/seajphv2n1_p3.pdf). I have no proof that they're wrong, and as someone who completed a Bachelor of Medical Science and Master of Research, it looks very bad for me to have opinions unbacked by research papers.

But on the other hand, I have no spirituality whatsoever. I am driven by ego and ambition, not by religiosity. My brother once asked me why my mind was not opened by my travels, where I got to witness ""the positive effects of religion"", to which I told him that of all the religions I witnessed, I could not feel connection to any of them. To which he told me that I was extremely arrogant to spit on the beliefs of billions without any scientific evidence to back my point.

Going back to the TV clip about Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr Baumann. She is a devout Catholic but also touts the benefits of Indigenous Australian spirituality. I have tried to be as open-minded as possible and I've never felt any connection with either. This is not due to lack of trying - I've tried very hard to try to make myself religious because until I was about 13, I was religious because I thought it was a crime to dissent from the Catholic church.

Trying so hard to make myself religious has filled me with severe resentment against the church. I really shouldn't be resenting the church because they never abused me, and in fact, they helped my family in our time of need.

I've discussed my concerns (e.g. the fact that I don't feel connection with any religion, so my church attendance is insincere) with my local Catholic priest, and he told me the following:

* It doesn't matter if you are going to church insincerely because you aren't able to believe in God, what matters is you go
* Mother Teresa had a phase where she felt no connection to God, but she kept trying until she eventually found God
* You will never be able to find God if you stop coming to church
* Developing resentment is not a reason not to go to church, because there is no good reason to stop going to church

Hence why I would say that I'm spiritually dead. Perhaps being ""spiritually dead"" ought to be classified as a disability, similar to the people who are simply unable to be taught to read.

On a side note, I am straight, but the resentment I developed makes me empathise with LGBTs, even though it's not technically in my interest or benefit to do so. I empathise with LGBTs because I feel like me being forced to suppress irreligiosity is equivalent to them being forced to suppress their sexuality. Does this make me a traitor to straight people?"

I think it is rather undisputed that people **can be** mean if they were hurt by others before such as children physically abused by their parents ending up physically abusing their children or bullied children bullying others. 

My theory, that I want to read counterarguments to, is that people are only mean if they face such circumstances beforehand. I really want to believe, mostly because it helps justify the mean actions of others in kind of telling myself that there is a reason they are acting this way. "

But why can‚Äôt it just end there? Why does it spread beyond the two involved and then the survivor is lauded as a hero? That person just wants to continue with their life and there‚Äôs people who put em on a pedestal while there‚Äôs no telling what‚Äôs going on in their head or feel there is no consequence to what happens for them. 

By consequence I don‚Äôt explicitly mean prison matters, but more along familial matters and effects on the psyche. Plenty of reasons why I always see these matters as bad. One of which is the fallen, why do people like to condemn so much? What do bystanders get out of belittling the dead? Sure they prob had it coming, but the comments I always see are damn near sadistic. People will wish for that deceased to wake up doing backstrokes in a lake of fire but then turn around and say pray for healing instead of downfall. The contradiction just rubs me the wrong way. 

This just makes me believe that people want others to see them as good but are wolves in sheep clothing. Nobody should really get a rise out of death like that unless you really like it, way more than one would admit. The fact of people always finding a way to justify their reason to get off of repercussions is also a dubious ethic. Doesn‚Äôt help that most don‚Äôt weigh the after effect and just disregard that person entirely. With the above stated, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if someone who unalives starts to enjoy it a bit too much. The ego can definitely take over make one a braggart which invites more problems that they had no intentions of bringing. Then have the nerve to play victim.

Then there‚Äôs the family. What does one say to them? How will they take it? Even if it is valid that loss on their side still has an effect on them. 

Here‚Äôs the tldr; you are not a good person if you demean the dead person in a self defense matter either victim or third party. People who say it‚Äôs right to do like there‚Äôs no wrong fail to understand in every action there‚Äôs a risk and reward."

If there‚Äôs no afterlife, then death just amounts to a deprivation of life. If you live a life in prison, I don‚Äôt see how that deprivation could be very harmful as prison is boring at best and extremely stressful and filled with violence at worse. 

If a person who dies goes to heaven then I don‚Äôt see how death is anything but a reward since heaven is supposed to the best place ever. If a person who gets the death penalty goes to hell then I think religious people ought to believe that the inmate deserves to go to hell or else the existence of hell would be incompatible with the existence of a perfect God. Thus, the death penalty would still be relatively humane. And, if we get reincarnated after we die then the death penalty would probably give the inmate a better life than a life in prison or at least there‚Äôs no reason to think that it would be substantially worse."

The current argument seems to be over the modern  academic definition of the word, ""gender"" which has been colloquially redefined in the last decade or two to refer to a subjective, personal preference of identity that can be interpreted as one sees fit.

My argument is **not** that this subjective definition of ""gender"" is irrelevant... but rather that it is **\*redundant.\***

What exactly is this modern definition of, ""gender"" attempting to capture that, ""personality"" cannot? Clearly, not sexual preference as, ""he"" can like boys and, ""he"" can like girls, and likewise it's not capturing stereotypical personality quirks, as both, ""he"" can wear a dress and, ""she"" can wear a dress.

What reason is there for this, ""gender"" game aside from people subjectively deciding they like the sound of one word more than another word? If men can be anything, and women can be anything, why do numerous pronouns exist at all? For millennia, the word, ""personality"" was used to capture the nuances of what an individual was, and I feel like the word is being replaced (for no good reason) with the word, ""gender.""

I dont care what you're into. but if, ""He"" can be anything and, ""She"" can be anything, wouldn't the logical answer be to use two pronouns to define the **sex** of men and women instead 100 gender pronouns? (**The entire crux of this argument can be reduced down to whether you prefer to use pronouns to assume one's sex, or whether you prefer to use pronouns to assume one's (contemporary defnition of), ""gender"" which can literally mean anything, just like personaliy does.)** As people continue to find themselves in more and more nuanced gender clicks, more subtypes of pronouns will emerge until the gender of, ""individuality"" is inevitably and ultimately realized... which is what it's always been in the first place. 

The point is, if, ""He"" can mean... **anything**... what's the point of using, ""He"" at all?

As someone who tries to be extremely precise with the things I say, I don't like it when a word has a seemingly infininte number of meanings. I'm borderline on the spectrum, and that concept is just so fucking stupid to me. Even more stupid, I'm told over and over again my opinion on this is.... racist? Nothing is going to make an autist like me realize you're not worth my time than telling me my well-thought out rational ideas ought to be reduced to racism. You'll never see us borderline ""on the spectrum"" types teaming up with anyone on ANY side if, ""racism"" is the only counter-agument they can muster. Ew. Ew ew ew. 

Last, and not least, I find that the ""trans"" community emulates the stereotypical roles that men and women are expected to emulate as they genderswap far more than even the conservative community plays out tradtional male-female roles among their own these days. This is incredibly bizarre. Trans women try harder to be, ""women"" than most biological women. It's a fascinating phenomena and I don't really bring it up as a point of debate, but more a matter-of-fact (confusing) observation. In a nutshell, trans women seem to care more about the binary definition of women (relative to their external appearance) than any biological woman I know.

FWIW, I am not polticially affiliated, and say everything I do as an outside observer.

I'm open to discussion."

To me, someone rejecting someone due to which Genitals they have is perfectly fine and not Transphoic. If someone is a Straight Male and not attracted to to Penis then that's perfectly acceptable and a deal breaker. Same with a Gay Female. Or a Gay Male exclusively being attracted to Penises.

Cars could/should just be connected to a gps that let them know what's the current limit and the cars should adjust accordingly. So if I'm driving in a 70 mph limit, my car should go above that, and if I then turn in a 30 mph limit my car should slow down. We all know that lots of lives would be saved.

We can discuss on the technical details (e.g do we allow a +10-15% for emergency situations? shall the car brake immediately or  if it should give a few seconds warning to the driver, etc... 

The only reason I can think on why we don't do that is because automotive industry still plays on that ""you're better than the rest and you deserve to own the road"" message they use to sell cars.

Don't get me wrong, I would be super annoyed if that was implemented but I do find super hypocrite how as a society we are more than happy to apply technology in certain fields (e.g. remote work control, mass facial recognition) but we completely disregard other ones.

I think advancing AI will make life worse for a whole lot of people for a few reasons.

For one, jobs. Whenever the idea of AI taking jobs is brought up, people insist that new ones will be created to take their place - but I've never seen any concrete mechanistic reason for this. People usually just gesture generally at previous instances of automation, but I haven't seen any reason why suitable new jobs *have* to be created. I doesn't make any sense to just assume what happened previously will continue forever regardless of circumstances.

With previous waves of automation there wasn't so much of a problem because the new jobs created could be done by most people. I.e., most farmers were capable of moving into factory work, most switchboard operators could do any given office job. But with AI even if there is a surge in demand for AI related jobs, who's to say that they'll be jobs that most people can actually do? Lots of AI work is very technical and not everyone is mentally capable of doing it even with formal re-training.

Even if there are doable jobs created to take those that are lost, those jobs could easily be far worse than what we have now. We're already starting to see people finding it harder to sustain themselves doing work they find fufilling like art/graphic design as those things become increasingly easy to automate. Just because people can ""just re-train"" isn't a good thing if they have to retrain into soul-crushing data tagging.

Also in previous waves of automation only a few types of role at a time would normally be automated. We didn't have farmers, assembly-line workers, telegraph operators, etc all get fired in a short period of time. But with AI vast swaths of different roles are at risk, be it management or art or music or HR or whatever. With so many people needing to retrain into a small variety of hypothetical new jobs, the salary of those jobs will be in the gutter.

All the professed gains from AI seem to benefit only small number of people. People say that it will improve production capacity and hence reduce prices, but in my country increasing numbers of people can't even afford to switch their heating on and rely on food banks to survive - the past 50 years of technological development including the invention of the internet weren't enough to help those people, so why would AI be any different? It seems more likely that companies will just pocket the difference.

  
At most it seems like we'll get an increase in inane consumer goods like smart devices and apps that provide some trivial convenience, and not anything that might genuinely improve life. Most people would prefer a decrease in their rent over an AI fridge that predicts when you'll need more eggs (or similar pointless gadget).

Medical research is the only serious benefit that I see. That's great for people with diseases that currently don't have good treatments, but existing medicine is already pretty damn good for most people. Our average life-expectancies are already so long that we often suffer in old age as our bodies reach their limits. It is still great and important, but I'd say living a long and healthy life isn't really worth much if the actual content of your life (your circumstances, the society you live in) gets worse and worse.

I could go on for ages about all the new avenues for abuse it will create. Oppressive governments better able to predict and manage threatening political currents, improved misinformation, companies able to track people and violate their privacy even more effectively than they do now, even better algorithms for manipulating people (i.e, improved dark patterns online), massive increases in inequality that accompany any associated economic boom, etc etc. 

I won't go into those in detail because this post is already long enough, but there's still so many more ways I expect it will make life a lot worse for many people. "

~~The majority of these business owners already have financial superiority to these broke college graduates or dropouts yet we are giving handouts to them?~~ The excuse from the congress members against were that the taxpayers shouldn't be paying to bailout lawyers, doctors, and accountants (professionals). Why did they not carry this same energy when we are bailing out business owners (can be much wealthier than these professionals mentioned).

I have also seen that the government bailed them out because of their poor handling of the COVID 19 pandemic regulations and this was a forgiveness of sorts for having to shut down their businesses. However, the taxpayers have also struggled with the job market, insane inflation, and absolutely pathetic wages yet they simply (may have) received some cash stipends and perhaps unemployment for a few months, which could have also been claimed by eligible business owners (ones that are not too wealthy).

This is not a loaded question, clearly someone has to have agreed with the other side of this argument if the majority of our congress that has been voted in was against it.

Edit: I am contractually incorrect since repayment was in original terms of loan. I have been informed and am rethinking. But how ethically correct was it to give a handout to many wealthy business owners while giving former or current students not break on interest maturity or payment or anything at all?

Edit 2: Put a strike through my inaccurate or assumed statements. I have concluded I didn't have enough information in my original statement so the opinion was invalid, I will have to rethink my opinions with newfound knowledge."

All the pandas are owned by China which is complete BS. How do you own an entire species? Apparently there are 4000 pandas living in the wild but hunting them can get you a decade in prison. I think people should be able to own pandas if they have the resources for it, such as enough money for 40 pounds of bamboo a day and enough land for it to run on. Back in the day, emperors used to own pandas because they were seen as good luck. I know that they are a species vulnerable to extinction but they will live longer lives in captivity compared to the wild. Pandas live 10 years on average in the wild and 20 years in captivity."

I specifically came here to CMV because I have all the reason in the world to *not* want to believe this and have my view changed. I've had lousy luck in dating, and the main reason is because I have very specific, unique needs. I'll be using myself as an example to make my case. I'm a 34-year-old male.

The first thing about me is that I'm extremely physically affectionate. Okay, no biggie, right? Women are probably the more affectionate gender. But when I say ""extremely,"" I mean it. I will hold you, wrap my legs around you and not let go for *hours*. I'll rub and kiss and do all that romantic stuff all day long and never get tired of it. Quite the opposite-- I *need* it. This overwhelms a lot of women.

Next, gender roles. I hate them. I'm not comfortable paying for things just because I'm a man, for example. That's always the biggest one. Many women disagree with this, and I've been laughed at, insulted, and cursed out many times for it.

Now we're getting into the good stuff. Next issue is that I suck at sex. I suffer from ED that's actually strictly psychological and based solely on nerves (so ED meds aren't even really an option). I can get a rock-hard erection just sexting, but if she's in the room with me, I get in my own head and can't get hard. Women like sex, and this can be an easy deal-breaker.

Last, but definitely not least, I have a sexual kink called somnophilia. Long story short, sleeping women turn me on, and I like touching and kissing on a sleeping woman without her waking up. If she wakes up, it ruins it for me. I always get consent, but the issue is that the overwhelming majority of women I meet are light sleepers, so I can't get off, and I don't think anyone besides someone who's asexual could be in a relationship where they're not sexually satisfied.

So you wrap all of that up, put a bow on it, and that's what you get when you date me. For me to believe that, since there's ""someone for everyone,"" there's a person out there who fits ALL my needs, is available, in my area, willing/able to date me, and that I will eventually MEET this person, is, in my opinion, hilariously unlikely.

And this is with me being, without trying to sound too arrogant, tall and handsome. I don't really struggle to attract women, but *none* of them (of the hundreds of women I've at least said a mutual ""Hey how are you?"" in a dating context to) are compatible enough with me that we'd both be happy together in a relationship, and you can see why.

CMV. Please."
1,2023-07-02,CMV: I lean toward agreement with the Supreme Court on student loans,u/Stooven,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ot2hu/cmv_i_lean_toward_agreement_with_the_supreme/,changemyview,"I have two thoughts (legal and practical):  
The legal basis for the decision seemed sound. ""Power of the purse"" lies with Congress. It's not Constitutional to spend $400 billion of taxpayer money by executive order. I question why Biden opted for this end-around instead of passing loan relief through Congress while Democrats had control. Maybe centrists would have demanded reforms.  
I feel sympathy for people who got buried in debt. I know some who are close to retirement and are still paying loans. I would love to see them get some help. I could personally support loan forgiveness if there were some kind of cost reform to prevent this problem going forward.   
University education has become absurdly expensive and most of the reasons don't seem justifiable. It blows my mind that some universities employ as many administrators as enrolled undergraduate students. All the while, total US endowments are almost $1 trillion. That's money that they're just sitting on, with no specific purpose. Also, a lot of expensive degrees don't offer improved earnings potential. When you take a business loan, they scrutinise your credit and how you'll spend it. I have a hard time understanding how we'll give hundreds of thousands to an 18-year old without asking ""What school will you go to, how much does it cost, how were your grades, what will you study, and how will you pay this back?""   
I've heard a lot of people compare this to bailing out corporations, but when that happened in '08, they they fully repaid the loans, with interest. The government also passed strict legislation limiting the amount of risk banks could take. When government intervenes to help a sector, I think the money needs to be an admission that everything was not ok. Accepting it needs to come with mandated reforms.   


Then again, Obama seemed much more thoughtful about his stimulus spending than Biden..."

People will talk about slavery leading to suffering but that ended 158 years ago. Jim crow ended 60 years ago. How can things 3 generations ago be causing and increase now? Why are black neighborhoods still so bad and crime infested.

Black music Is all about sex, drugs and committing crimes. The roles models they have are not role models at all. And when confronted about why they are not doing better they blame white people instead of themselfs.

Everyone talks about how blacks are 5x more likely to get shot by cops but not that cops are 6x more likely to be shot by them. Many songs talk about killing the cops or pretending they are the bad people. BLM basically blames police for all things but doesn't acknowledge them needing more police to patrol because of high crime.

Poverty is a key link to many of these issue but can we really just blame racism for all of these issues? Why don't they try harder in school so they can escape and do better.

CMV:
We need community leaders taking accountability and changing it from within. We need parents not letting kids run around at night. They need to stop blaming white people for all the issues and accept accountability for  bad behavior.

I am sincere and genuinely want to change my mind. Please don't auto remove, which is what happens in nearly every single subreddit. Backstory: I grew up with Christian parents and realized at a young age when I grew up I wanted to fight for LGBT rights, general progressive beliefs and against all religions. However, I've noticed how only Christianity is criticized, never Islam (or Buddhism).  Which is rather pointless for me who is Norwegian, where Christianity is seen as a joke.

I believe that it is impossible to criticize Islam without risking being accused of racism. I think the response is when a white person is criticizing it boils down to ""That's suspicious that you are criticizing a religion and culture you are not from. Cultures and religions should change naturally without interference via exchange of ideas and empathy. All change must come from the group itself. Why don't instead you look away and focus on the issues in your local area?"" 

I think that is completely normal and great to have empathy and care about issues and cultures and people you have never met. Yet this is seen as suspicious. 

This drains me a lot, because I think LGBT rights and progressive beliefs are best enforced from the state. It's great if people change their own minds, but it should not be relied on.

I'm really struggling because I think the socialist left is right about nearly everything else. I want to be a socialist but without moral/cultural relativism and religion and that the state should enforce progressive beliefs.

For example, I think criticizing pride parades should be considered terrorism, refusing to handshake because of your religion is sexist and that there should be jail time for catcalling. When I try to explain this to other socialists they seem hesitant, which I assume it is because it will hurt low income religious people.

I'm really scared that we in our fear not to offend religion are going to slow down with state interference for progressive beliefs in fear of riots or raising taboo issues. I live in Norway we are so wealthy that these kind of issues are pushed under the rug due to the fear of discussing them, rather than that the state (if left wing) should face it head on via force.

And just to make it clear: Only criticizing dictators and authortiarian leaders and nations in the Middle East does not count. I am talking about criticizing working class people and people who have suffered, because it is still not a valid excuse to be homophobic and sexist.

Can someone please CMV? I have tried finding help, some subreddits have instant bans and rules that Islam must be criticized in the context of other religions, which I find confusing. Christianity is dying and becoming a kind of atheism while Judaism does not try to convert others.

Please help me! **I really want to CMV as I notice all other leftists love religion if it is non-Christian.**

Note that giving vague replies about ""why do you care so much about this issue? Why don't you look in a different direction or care more about your own beliefs, huh?"" will not change my view. Also, this is not an issue a psychologist can help with."

2,2023-07-02,CMV: I dont have any desire to continue,u/pessimisttears,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14oulvu/cmv_i_dont_have_any_desire_to_continue/,changemyview,"Hey guys,  
  
I don't know how to start because I have a lot to say but it feels so hard to do it. For background information I'm 23/M. I used to get bullied and left out from an early age throughout kindergarden, elementary and high-school. My whole youth was about me being infront of my PC.  
  
I always hated the way everybody was looking at me with the same eyes as if I was an alien or sth. It went so far that I always wanted to thank the cashier or any worker at the shops for not trashing me. I even remember when some of them showed support for Amanda Todd when she committed suicide but none of them cared about my well being eventho they witnessed it everyday and kinda even were part of it. I'm bad at having normal conversations and I have a hard time with making friends. I don't how to improve my social skills as I don't have many people to socialise but I would for sure love to be more social yet I have no option. Obviously I managed to make 2 friends but I rarely see them. I never had a gf and was never close to a girl in my life and I even don't know how to talk to them in the first place. I remember when the pandemic happened and people started complaining about the fact that they can't meet with their friends or go to parties meanwhile it didn't change much for me.  
  
That's another reason why I have a hard time relating to people around my age after all I don't know how it is having a friends group where you do sth together, meet new people and be invited to parties. One of my former only friends told me once that he can't help me out with my problems. I think I just wasted my childhood, teenage years and now even my early twenties. That's why I'm always stuck in my head and think about fake scenarios to cope with my loneliness. I think about people appreciating me, being happy, having fun, being loved by girls, being successfull and talented. All these things that I always wanted. I feel like I'm a good for nothing. Nothing really catches my interest. I'm bored out of everything so quick.  
  
Not even games satisfy me anymore so I keep scrolling on reddit or twitter mindlessly for hours. I used to have couple mutuals on twitter but I stopped talking to them as I saw no point in that anymore after all they live far away from me. I don't seem to be accepted there either. There is no hobby nor sport that I want to do because I don't have the motivation for anything. I don't seem to get out of my head nor of my pessimistic mindset.  
  
If I had the chance to return back in time I would do it because I would do so many things differently. I hate being invisible like no one is going out of their way to have me in their life nor did people I used to know before contact me once to check up on me if I'm still alive or if I'm ok. I don't know what I want in life and honestly I don't have any desire to continue pursuing anything because I'm not getting out of my current state.  
  
I faced so many challenges yet I couldn't share them with anyone. I'm still alone and I still don't get excited in anything I do. All I want is a couple of people around me and someone who loves me because I know there is a whole world I haven't discovered yet. Everyday I wake up with the hopes of change but those are just empty thoughts because I live the same cycle everyday and I really have no encourage to keep going on. I don't know what I need to do. It's like I haven't been crying out for help the past few years but no one cares anyway. I'm sure that there are many people like me on here as I already read a lot of other threads about it and I could relate to many of them. I hope some of yall read this till here."

There is a tiny carbon budget before we breach 1.5 degrees.

At the moment, government pledges get us to about 2.4 degrees, but governments keep reneging on their pledges. Hence 3 degrees seems a reasonable modal outcome. 

The thing is, 3 degrees also entails massively increased climate impacts. Given most extreme events follow some powerlaw (log, log) or weibull distribution, this means much more than a doubling of current climate impacts. 

We saw in covid how a large system shock sends people into a kind of enraged paranoia. The randomness of the world, and the enormous system fragilities we now have due to globalisation and environmental degradation just aren't satisfying explanations for our lives being turned upside down. 

With climate change, the impacts are permanent. Endless cycles of crop losses, food price spikes, and ultra extreme weather needing covid style emergency responses. But with no end date in sight.

Covid teaches me our societies can't handle a 3degree world, and we will end up either with an autocracy or total societal disfunction. 

Cmv! 

Ps I think a 3 degree world can be avoided, but it will require a sea change amongst our leaders and governing philosophy. 50/50 chance, maybe.

No arguing no talking over another. All respectful but still. The religious man implies God loves you snd won't force you to believe and you can choose to have a life with him or with out him. According to Christianity hell is without the presence of God so if you reject him you are choosing to live without him hence you still go to hell for simply not believing. And the religious man implies hell is where evil is quarantined. 

So even if we have a ""choice' we get punished but if we pick the one he wants us to pick (worship him) you get rewarded for it.(Heaven)


So why are you quarantined in the place that cages evil if you don't accept him.  It's almost implying that not believing him is evil and there's an ultimatum. Oh you don't believe me, okay I love you but you get to go to hell because you don't worship me. It sounds authoritarian and tyrannical to me.  Its like Kim Jong Un, you don't respect me okay you don't have too, but you can die or starve now. I don't believe that. I think there is possibly a God of some sort. But it's all loving no matter your religion or if your non religious.  I believe punishment is for those who are of true hatred, like extreme greed, racism, rape,murder.

**Cost**: in my estimation, bodywash costs about 10-20x more per wash compared to bar soap. You can buy a pack of 5-6 bars of soap for the same price as one bottle of bodywash. Can we say you get broadly the same number of washes from one bottle of bodywash as one bar of soap? I feel like even that is being generous to bodywash. One bottle of Old Spice Swagger bodywash costs more than a pack of TWELVE bars of Old Spice Swagger soap.

**Water**: The first ingredient on all the bodywash bottles I've seen is ""aqua"", which is just water rebranded to sound fancy.

**Scent**: Sure it smells good, but there are plenty of scented bar soaps as well.

**Packaging**: This is a huge one. That pack of 12 bars of Old Spice soap comes in a plastic wrapping. Underneath  that are 12 cardboard boxes of soap (recyclable). Sometimes the bar itself will be wrapped in wax paper. Compared to this, think about throwing away 12 plastic bottles (nominally recyclable but we all know plastic recycling isn't a real thing).

**Hygiene**: I see people saying bar soap is unhygienic, but I just don't accept that as a justification. Most bars of soap are used by one or two people, or more if you have kids - but those are family members and let's not  pretend we're in close proximity to the grossness of those people (who we love) anyway. If you're worried about hygiene, just lather in your hands and then wash yourself with the lather, not the soap. It's totally fine!

In  conclusion, I believe bodywash is a hugely successful marketing scam that means you're paying insane multiples compared to soap, and throwing away egregious amounts of plastic packaging, for no real benefit.

It's of course not fair for those who didn't attend college, paid back their loans, paid out of pocket, etc to pay for others so of course we shouldn't force them. I had to go without but I paid all out of pocket. I worked while going to college. But at the same time, if someone wants to voluntarily contribute their own money towards it we should let them. They feel strongly about this so who are we to stop them? If they think this is a good idea we should not stop them. They should be taxed at higher rates until it's paid off.

It's a win-win."

Just because you live in the US doesn't make you evil. However, there are a few things that the concept of America carries, that other countries do not.  
  
You never truly leave the US, even when you do. Hollywood has a monopoly on movies and adds across the world. They can influence every culture in the world with the flick of a fingers. and they absolutely abuse it. Millions of cultures across the world have died out in the name of the big mac.  
  
War is fucking stupid. Almost every war in the past 50ish years was either caused or manipulated by the US. The exception being Ukraine. But the Banana wars, Sudan, the Taliban. That's all America baby! and yet they don't stop, the military is still where all the tax money goes. I can only assume Americans like it that way. This warmongering has come to bite them back, with shootings being a daily occurrence.  
  
Education. It is no secret that most of the rest of the world regards American education as lackluster at best. This wouldn't be a problem if the USA wasn't the most powerful nation on the planet and every election dictates the economy of the rest of the world. We are literally having people most of the world would regard as uneducated make dissensions that affect ALL of us. seems like the opposite of freedom to me.  
  
Division. Are Americans allergic to the idea of people thinking differently to one another. In New-York I felt like I had to be pro-choice, and in Texas I felt like I had to be pro gun. The most beautiful to me about living in South Africa is all the different people you meet from different backgrounds and beliefs. If we cant share ideas then we are literally no different to the animals.  
  
1st world problems. Every now and then I see a black American complain about being marginalized. I'm not going to go into weather this is a non issue or not. But hey! At least your family didn't get blown up by a drone this week! At least your government isn't sending you to a fucking concentration camp! At least you dint watch as stupid fucking Americans mangled your culture and used it to tell American stories where the only reason your people are ""sophisticated"" is because they found a fancy space metal (Black panther incase I'm not making sense). I'm not saying your problems aren't worth talking about, or that you shouldn't look for a better life. I'm saying there are more important problems that are never raised by the people with a voice.  
  
Ok I'm done screaming into the void now. let me know how wrong I am. <3"

One is that I am an Asian American and I understand that may make my opinion on this topic somewhat biased. If you think that I am being biased, please call me out on it. Second, as I say in the title, I am a progressive and I believe in the existence of systemic racism, especially against Blacks and Latinos. With that being said-

The fact that Black and Latino college applicants just have a higher chance of being admitted due to their race alone is something I can‚Äôt think of a reasonable justification for. 

To be clear, I understand that those Black and Latino applicants are not less qualified than their White and Asian counterparts, that is not my argument. I also understand that Blacks and Latinos apply to colleges in smaller numbers and therefore the higher percentage of their acceptance makes up for that in total diversity at a given college. 

My issue is with the prioritization of diversity over equal treatment. In my view, a better system would not take race into account at all and would be purely meritocratic.

I understand that systemic racism makes it harder for Blacks and Latinos to achieve college at all, but I believe that affirmative action is a flawed solution to this that fails to address the actual issue. I don‚Äôt claim to have a better solution, but it seems obvious to me that affirmative action is not it."

A 20% increase in profit would be intolerable due to the dire circumstances people are experiencing. The largest egg producers had a 700% increase in profit. Pork producers, chicken, beef, milk, bread are all in the same boat. Fruits and vegetables are ridiculously priced. $5/pound for organic apples. An onion cost $1.50.

Imagine making $10 an hour. That‚Äôs like 4 apples for an hour of labor. The only food available for poor Americans is hardly even food. Hyper processed garbage is the only option.

Everyone should be protesting these greedy companies. Don‚Äôt stop eating these essential foods. Steal the food. Steal the food your family deserves. The people in this country have forgotten that we do the fucking. Do not tolerate being fucked."

18,2023-07-02,CMV: Affirmative Action for college admissions based on socioeconomic status is a better alternative to race.,u/jsxgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14p2675/cmv_affirmative_action_for_college_admissions/,changemyview,"I want my view changed because it seems like it solves everyone‚Äôs problem and I want to know why it isn‚Äôt feasible.

My understanding of the argument for AA is that some minority groups have, because of historical racism, been left at a disadvantage compared to white people (this I don‚Äôt dispute at all and is not part of the CMV). Some common examples related to the topic of AA I see are that white applicants might have better grades, higher test scores, and more extracurricular activities because their parents are more likely to be financially well off and able to afford tutors, they don‚Äôt have to have a job to support their family, etc. These reasons also make sense as to why these students might need more ‚Äúhelp‚Äù in their college admissions.

The problem is that these issues don‚Äôt only affect minority groups, even if they do disproportionately. And vice versa; there are families of minority groups that could also afford these boosts.

So if the goal is to lift children out of poverty by giving them a better shot at getting accepted to a prestigious school despite not having the same ‚Äútools‚Äù as children from wealthy families - why not focus on the real causal driver behind the lack of tools - their socioeconomic status? Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, regardless of race, get the benefit of AA while those from higher do not.

I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs because of practicalities - it should be even easier to verify family income compared to race. The only thing I can think of is that socioeconomic status is still not a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù way to determine who needs help and who doesn‚Äôt, but seems like it‚Äôs better than race."

80,2023-07-02,"CMV: France has a racial problem, French people dont want to acknowledge it, and this refusal is explaining the riots in France",u/MavriKhakiss,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14p2zt6/cmv_france_has_a_racial_problem_french_people/,changemyview,"**Why I made this post in this sub**: the situation in France is not normal. Seeing French people trying to rationalize, normalize, excuse and tip-toe around this issue is stomach churning. I think France can do better by following the example of countries like Canada and the USA, countries that will collect data on ethnic background, who will then be able to do a more precise socio-demographic profile of these population, which will give a clearer visibility on the issues they are facing, and thus enable the government to make better more efficient policies to target these communities and help them out. 

**What I mean by ""racial problems""**: some social issues have a very close 1:1 match with the demographic profile of certain ethnic groups; poverty, insecurity, incarceration rate, terrorism. ""Racial problems"" is probably a very loose, red-flaggy way of formulating what I think: some people have it way harder than others in France, these people are simply people of immigrant and former colonial background, they have been having it way harder for generations now, and having it way harder leads to problems, and these problems now stick to their demographic profile. 

**What I mean by French people wont acknowledged it**: It is illegal to collect data on ethnicity in France. French laws are founded on ""republican universalism"", with says that every French citizen is the same, regardless of ethnic and cultural background. 

The collection of ethnicity data was banned in France in 1978, under the law of information and freedom. The law bans the collection of personal data based on race, ethnicity, political, religious or philosophical opinion, trade union associations, health or sex life. Failure to comply with the law is punishable by a ‚Ç¨300,000 fine and five years in prison.

**What I mean by ""this refusal is explaining the current riots in France""**: the coupling of having an immigrant background, of poverty and disenfranchisement, as been going on for generations, but refusing to see that these issues are demographically and geographically (suburbs) concentrated and connected, has prevented the French government of effectively seeing the issue grow to what it is now, of preventing it in time, and of addressing it effectively. 

Case in point to illustrate what I mean:

* [10% of the population in France is Muslims](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi41YiulPH_AhVbMVkFHbYzApUQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aa.com.tr%2Fen%2Feurope%2Fmuslims-represented-10-of-french-population-in-2019-2020-report%2F2860769&usg=AOvVaw0c7fjcORAH3QvMsyt0oEtT&opi=89978449), but they represent [between 27% and 40/50% of the prison population.](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/are-70-of-frances-prison-inmates-muslims) That is not normal. 

I am aware here that this is mostly a result of overpolicing and lack of opportunities, and does in no way shape manner or form reflect the nature of the muslim community. *This is a French phenomenon, not a islamic phenomenon.* 

&#x200B;

* Foreigners represent about [10% of the French population](https://www.ined.fr/en/everything_about_population/demographic-facts-sheets/faq/how-many-immigrants-france/) yet are [twice as likely to be unemployed as the rest of the population.](https://www.ensemble-en-france.org/en/what-is-the-employment-situation-for-immigrants-in-france/) I can't find the source anymore, but the numbers for unemployed working-age males living in suburbs was a staggering 30%. 

Again, this isnt a commentary on the character and nature of immigrants, but rather, it is one concerning French society. 

&#x200B;

* A more specific example from the current riots: [an LGBT caf√© was specifically targeted and forced to close, simply because of its LGBT vocation](https://www.letelegramme.fr/finistere/brest-29200/on-brule-les-pd-a-brest-le-happy-cafe-identifie-comme-cible-par-les-emeutiers-6384630.php?fbclid=IwAR31AKsrBGjWTumL-OqpPtGIXa_EEPqxVRSeb_sab_snlEyLMT_GviM5iu4). The caf√© closed because someone leaked a screencap of a social media group used by the rioters:

Mehdi, Mamadou, Kaisa. Thats French of immigrant background, evoking their religion to target other minorities.

And this is specific to African Americans in America. I know this is a tired on going ‚Äúdebacle‚Äù but I hope that some BP can have a change of heart. STOP REFERRING to yourselves as the N Word then get viscerally mad when someone non black says it. Do you not understand they‚Äôre saying it to hurt you? To demean you ? Exactly why you should NOT be calling yourselves and your friends and family members such. It is a vile demeaning word. Non of that ‚Äúwe use it because it‚Äôs empowering and we took it back to mean something against our community‚Äù. This is so stupid and pure BOPIUM (black cope). I mean the black fragility is thorough the roof ! You refer to your loved ones with a word carrying so much painful generational history yet you‚Äôre ready to blow your top the moment a white person says it. You should be upset dummy, they shouldn‚Äôt be calling you that. But what‚Äôs the problem if it‚Äôs a word you use yourself. 

White people lose their lives over ‚Äúa word‚Äù. Seriously? The amount of people who love rap but can‚Äôt enjoy it because of the 100 n words a line is sad. And they support your music! You‚Äôd be surprised how integral they are in ‚Äúsupporting‚Äù your music but that‚Äôs another topic for another day. Iykyk. 

A similar cope is women calling themselves bitches and bad bitches. Yet are livid if a man calls them such. Istg people are so stupid it‚Äôs not even funny. For AA, I get it‚Äôs part of your vocab for generations now and it‚Äôs basically ingrained in you, that you might not think anything of it or it‚Äôs difficult to remove. I promise you it‚Äôs possible. You need to take the responsibility upon yourselves. White people do not refer to themselves and each as C****ER. Asians don‚Äôt refer to themselves as C**NK neither. Why are you ? You‚Äôre the only ones who wear your slurs as some badge of honor, Mexicans use G***GO for example but will to a lesser extent. You have been brainwashed by each other to believe this is empowering. To the majority of the world you look RIDICULOUS & severely lacking of self respect. So why should others respect you. 

I even thought of this, white people starting to use the word normally so BP can realize how uncomfortable it is and hopefully get that to be the reason they stop. It makes me tremendously comfortable to hear one insult themselves like that on such a regular basis. This is how far conditioning gets. If you still haven‚Äôt gotten it, here‚Äôs another cope.  m
Modern women being ‚Äúsexually liberated‚Äù and in the end  for majority of them it‚Äôs a destructive path that hurts them in the end. 

I discourage my friends and family from using that word. I never refer to myself as such. And I don‚Äôt tolerate if someone refers to me as such. The change stats with you."

Anyone who has spent more than 10 seconds on any subreddit that mentions anything about Chinese people will find that almost any negative comment will use ""Commie"".

The Chinese person could be doing whatever, the topic could be completely apolitical, and hateful comments will immediately call them ""Commie"".

It is clear to me that this is a dogwhistle/word substitution for certain ethnic slurs that would get these people in hot water, but ""Commie"" is seen as acceptable because... Well, because the people going about their daily lives = the political ideology of their government, apparently; plus, very few people are going to call out a slur that sounds political for actually being racial.

I have never from memory seen ""Commie"" used on Reddit to actually represent political belief. For that, Reddit prefers the word ""Tankie"". ""Commie"" is reserved for judging Chinese people by where they were born, and/or the colour of their skin."

never mind the obvious lack of self-awareness underscoring their confusion, it isn‚Äôt difficult to understand why conservatism receives such a response in the modern workplace.

our workforce is increasingly diverse, home to minorities of various ethnic backgrounds and women who have made significant strides in the face of entrenched sexism. 

modern conservatism, which is nothing more than a belief in using the power of office to preserve guarantees to a privileged caste, is rightfully viewed as steeped in bigotry by a growing segment of our population. 

if you were to express liberal views at your job, they would generally consist of:

- supporting gay pride and the gay community

- supporting black people who want police to stop murdering them

- supporting women who want equal pay, protections from harassment and the right to make healthcare decisions about their bodies.

- supporting comprehensive immigration reform that doesn‚Äôt paint those who are here illegally as rapists and drug dealers.

- supporting clean energy and environmental awareness.

these are just the boilerplate positions held by your typical progressive.

no one will reasonably take umbrage with the expression of these, and they‚Äôre certainly not views that would make the workplace hostile or unwelcoming.

but a conservative, in 2023, is likely to invite harsh rebuke if they express the following at their place of work:

- supporting free speech for fascists like alex jones, milo, richard spencer, ben shapiro, et. al.

- supporting the criminalization of reproductive healthcare (charging women with murder for getting an abortion, and anyone who aided them as accomplices to murder)

- supporting a supreme court that thinks businesses should have a right to deny gays service

- supporting police who murder innocent black people

- supporting citizens who murder innocent black people (for instance, support of george zimmerman during his trial was seen by the black community as racist, for good reason)

- supporting politicians who demonize people that crossed our southern border illegally

- supporting censorship in our schools and libraries

- supporting trump, desantis and any other politician running on a white nationalist platform. 

now, clearly, expressing these views in your  would make almost all of your black, gay, hispanic and female coworkers uncomfortable. 

it makes perfect sense to me why openly supporting conservatism in your average work place is now frowned upon, and why more and more ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù feel they have to self censor themselves. 

i believe that there should be an official policy that expression of right wing views is not conducive to a pleasant and hospitable work environment."

I grew up in a poor family. I didn't know anyone who had gone to college. In high school, I was of course a typical snotty teenager and my friend group thought we knew everything. Looking back, we were young and stupid and didn't know anything about life. I decided at a young age that I wanted to pursue education so that I could get a good job, send money back home to my family, and not be poor anymore. 

I became the first in my family to graduate high school and then I studied hard and got accepted into a pretty difficult and well-known university in the United States. There, I was surrounded by people who, compared to people from my childhood, were ambitious, worked hard, and seemed smart. Most of my friends from undergrad are now successful in their chosen fields. I would broadly call most of them quite intelligent (whether or not it is due to their education is unclear). 

After college, I worked for a while before I decided to go to law school. I got into a well-known school, which given my poor upbringing, I am really proud of. I was again surrounded by people who I feel like are hard working and smart, at least in terms of legal studies. After school, many of my friends became partners in big law firms, started their own companies, non-profit leaders, etc. making a very good living. I guess in the most general terms, I would call most of them ""intelligent"". It seems like they have direction in life and excel in school and at work. I would caveat that I find some of them lack emotional intelligence and people skills. So they are unintelligent in some ways as well. 

My boyfriend graduated from high school but came from a poor family in the US. He joined the military as soon as he turned 18. After his service, he got an online degree from a for-profit university. I don't know how it works, but this online university transferred most of his military service into college credit, so he only had to take a couple of part time/online classes to get his Bachelor's degree. It sounds like it was a piece of cake and definitely less rigorous than my undergraduate studies (mine was 4 years of full-time and in-person school). This was a little shocking to me because part of what I learned during my undergrad was not from my professors, but from interacting with people from all walks of life. The general social interactions I had during college taught me different world views, something I do not think I could have gotten from a couple of online classes. 

Most of his friends went to high school but not college. A lot of them live on government benefits, or work hourly minimum wage jobs, or are unemployed. It seems like most of them have trouble with basic arithmetic when we are splitting dinner bills. Some of them are tens of thousands of dollars in debt, which I (maybe incorrectly) attribute to poor financial management skills. I can't hold a conversation with any of them beyond the weather, viral tiktok videos, or broadly watched television shows. 

My boyfriend is always saying how he thinks most CEO's, doctors, lawyers, PhD holders, etc. are idiots. He thinks that there is zero connection between level of education and intelligence. Also, being successful or rich does not mean intelligence. 

I agree that successfulness does not automatically equal intelligence. Also, I know tons of academic people who have minimal social skills. However, I do think that if someone is one of the top or world-renowned scholars in their field of study, I would generally think that they are intelligent. 

Back to my personal experience, the people I know from my boyfriend's friend group (or even my own family) generally seem less intelligent than the people I know from higher education. Admittedly, I might just be a really sheltered person. 

I am really not trying to offend anyone. I think that intelligence can be defined differently by different people. I do not think that intelligence is only evidenced by being rich or successful career wise. I also know that there are tons of people who choose not to go to college (or cannot afford to) and end up doing extremely well for themselves. I am only speaking in broad terms. 

***Additional info:

First, I absolutely do not think that education automatically makes someone smarter. I tried to say this in my original post but wanted to reiterate that here. Second, I want to reiterate what I say in my post about there being different types of intelligence. Knowledge in different fields, emotional intelligence, booksmarts, etc. are all different but equally valid and useful in our society! I said this in the comments but to put it up front, I know firsthand that ""educated"" people are not necessarily smart. In school, I met so many future lawyers/doctors/etc. who I could not believe were considered ""smart"" by society. My grandpa is hands down the most intelligent/smart/self-sufficient person I have ever met, but a lot of people thought nothing of him because he was illiterate (not by choice, it is just common in my home country for poor people to be uneducated). I constantly marvel at how much he accomplished while starting out with so little. He is the reason why I work so hard because even though he passed away, I am still trying to make him proud.

I do think that going to university opened up my worldview. I grew up in a tiny little village that did not have running water or electricity. Before coming to America, I had not even met people of other cultures (until missionaries came to ""save"" us). A lot of what I learned from school was experiences.

I made my post after a heated day spent with my boyfriend's friend group where for hours I had 14 adults angrily telling me that I am unintelligent BECAUSE I pursued higher education. They were trying to say I was stupid for ""choosing"" to grow up poor (obviously I did not ask to be born into poverty). They also think only people who THINK of themselves as intelligent (but are actually stupid) go into fields of medicine, law, science, etc. After all of this, they asked me to pay for their kids' upcoming birthday presents and parties because they themselves cannot afford to and if I don't, I am ruining their birthdays. I thought it was pretty rude of them to ask for money after they made fun of my education and career (which has allowed me to have money...) Finally, they think I am unintelligent because I am a woman in her 40s who doesn‚Äôt have children. I think there are of course so many intelligent moms out there, but I don‚Äôt think all intelligent people should be forced to be parents. This one hurt because due to my cancer treatment in my 20s, I actually cannot have children (they don‚Äôt know that and I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing that info with them).

In terms of their definition of intelligence, they defined it as being smart. This confused me because they all consider themselves smart. I do believe that going to school is one way to become smart, yet they think people who pursue school are not smart. The majority of them are unemployed and really struggling to meet basic needs. They tried to say they didn't need university to open up their worldview (like it did for me) as evidenced by the fact that they allowed me, their first non-white friend, into their group. The fact that they feel the need to brag about finally meeting a POC at age 40 concerns me.

In Islam, marriages between first cousins are permitted.

If you do that once or twice its bad, but if you do it for 40 generations and now you are going back in time. 

They've gone backwards in time and I blame obviously the Quran, culture and religion for supporting it, but due to them going backwards in time they are more prone to being violent and being hijacked by the Quran. 

Check this article: [https://pjmedia.com/blog/nicolai-sennels/2010/09/19/the-problem-of-inbreeding-in-islam-n12758](https://pjmedia.com/blog/nicolai-sennels/2010/09/19/the-problem-of-inbreeding-in-islam-n12758)

''Today, 70 percent of all Pakistanis are inbred and in Turkey the amount is between 25-30 percent.''

''A rough estimate reveals that close to half of everybody living in the Arab world is inbred''

''A [BBC investigation](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ban-uk-pakistanis-from-marrying-cousins/articleshow/1298135.cms) in Britain several years ago revealed that at least 55% of the Pakistani community in Britain was married to a first cousin. The Times of India affirmed that ‚Äúthis is thought to be linked to the probability that a British Pakistani family is at least 13 times more likely than the general population to have children with recessive genetic disorders.‚Äù

''And then there are the findings on intelligence. Research shows that if one‚Äôs parents are cousins, intelligence goes down 10-16 IQ points. The risk of having an IQ lower than 70 (criterion for being ‚Äúretarded‚Äù) increases 400 percent among children from cousin marriages.''

I believe not all not all not all, but most of the people that are hijacked by the Quran into doing acts of violence are because of inbreeding and the effects of what inbreeding does to a person. "

1,2023-07-03,CMV: The Fight Against Affirmative Action Has Existed Before Affirmative Action And Has Always Been Racist & Anti-Black,u/Donny-Bandish,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14papz7/cmv_the_fight_against_affirmative_action_has/,changemyview,"it goes back almost a century, before affirmative action was even an idea, much less a policy. 

as you know, the supreme court recently struck down race-based admissions at colleges, the single most decisive blow against affirmative action. 

the plaintiff in this case - like all those who‚Äôve come before them, each with their own sob story about losing a spot to a supposedly less qualified minority student  - argued that qualified applicants to these institutions were being discriminated against, passed over for black students with lower test scores. 

first, there is no evidence that the students who were admitted had lower test scores. that is racist conjecture. second, test scores are not the sole determinant in decisions on admittance. 

but, those pesky facts aside, what i am more focused on is the myth that this was a fight waged in good faith. 

since the 1930s, white americans have tailed against favoritism being bestowed upon black people. they were rallies held by white supremacists in opposition to black people being hired by any number of businesses, where speakers would voice the exact same arguments that are now espoused by these opponents of affirmative action. 

- unqualified workers
- negros talking our jobs
- merit no longer a consideration

these lies were being preached in the streets by white supremacists long before affirmative action even existed. 

in 1943, the us military actually released a film called Don‚Äôt Be a Sucker. it was, shockingly enough, an anti-racist/anti-fascist film. i imagine it was to curry favor with the black population so as to address the cognitive dissonance of combating nazism while ignoring the american brand of racial apartheid. 

anyways, this film highlighted just how old this phony objection to ‚Äúaffirmative action‚Äù is. they were saying this stuff decades before this week‚Äôs ruling. 

affirmative action now exists for white people, and neither plaintiff in this decision nor the conservative financiers of their litigation have expressed opposition to it. 

in an article from almost a decade ago, it was reported that white high school drop outs are as likely at scoring the same job a black college grad applied for. 

no word from the plaintiff on this. 

we can look at the felicity huffman trial and see how white wealth pays the way for white mediocrity to gain entry into these schools. this is but one example of many where wealth and name combine to catapult white children into spots they didn‚Äôt earn off so-called ‚Äúmerit.‚Äù 

over at these esteemed stanford university, a sailing coach was convicted of taking bribes to get unqualified white children into that school by accepting them on his sailing team. i‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs an isolated incident. 

no word from the plaintiff on this. 

i can go on and on with example after example of unqualified white children gaining admittance to these schools. 

but we don‚Äôt even need to focus on these schools. 

look at the homestead act. 

look at the gi bill.

black people were excluded from participating in these giveaways to white america, these affirmative action programs for white people. 

it has always been steeped in anti-blackness. these people will not stop with this ruling. they will focus on any place - academia, non profit, private enterprise - where black people can be found to have been accepted."

And to get some arguments out of the way:

""Affirmative action helps white women more than it helps minorities""

Whataboutism. White women shouldn't be favored either.

""Whatabout legacies?""

Whataboutism. Also shouldn't be favored and also not the topic of this CMV.

""Minorities face too much discrimination and AA balances it out""

Universities like Harvard have been very publicly supportive of AA, as well as pretty much every other major university. In fact, Harvard has indicated in its lawsuit that they'll find other ways of favoring certain races without explicitly using race in its admissions process. When universities will go to that length to ensure that non-asian minorities will still have an advantage, I see no evidence that non-asian minorities will be discriminated against in university applications without AA."

I have been contemplating the significant influence that mattresses have on our sleep quality and overall well-being. It is important to delve into the anatomical perspective and prioritize the biology of our bodies when considering this matter. By sleeping on a firm mattress, we can maintain proper spinal alignment, evenly distribute body weight, and alleviate uncomfortable pressure points. This enables our muscles to relax fully, resulting in a refreshed and revitalized awakening.

However, I acknowledge that initially, soft mattresses may appear to be a comfortable choice. The plush surface may seem inviting, enticing us to sink into its embrace. Yet, I have come to realize that this sinking effect can have long-term consequences on spinal health, potentially leading to an unnatural curvature of the spine and causing back pain.

Now, some may argue that the prevalence of soft mattresses in many cultures and hotels signifies luxury and comfort. Advertisements also play a role in promoting soft mattresses, as they are easier to market compared to their firm counterparts. These factors have ingrained a societal norm that favors softness and coziness over firmness.

Despite these influences, I encourage you to consider this intriguing dichotomy. Let us break free from societal norms and consciously make choices that benefit our bodies. Investing in the right mattress is crucial, as we spend about one-third of our lives sleeping, and it can significantly impact our long-term physical health, safeguarding us against various ailments.

Politicians and celebrities of various levels have made this assertion up to the President.

Politifact rates this claim, that guns are the leading cause of death in children, as ‚Äúmostly true‚Äù

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jun/04/charles-schumer/among-children-firearms-leading-cause-death-2020/

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/mar/29/ashbey-beasley/gun-violence-surpasses-car-accidents-leading-cause/

To my layman‚Äôs view, there are three problems with this analysis.  

First, and I can believe this was innocent: Babies are excluded due to the unique health challenges they have. I‚Äôm willing to believe that that is something ordinarily done, although I believe they should have put that exclusion in the headline given babies are unquestionably children. 

Second, the inclusion of ages 18-19 into the data set. According to the WHO, ‚Äúan adult is a person older than 19 years of age unless national law delimits an earlier age.‚Äù In America, virtually every state sets majority at 18. But, I can believe this is innocent too. 

Third, the ungrammatical distribution of ‚Äúleading cause of death‚Äù to both constituents of the set ‚Äúchildren and teens‚Äù when in fact it applies only to the set in aggregate and to teens, not to children. That it is only true of teens is conceded in the second Politifact article

To believe Politifact and anyone who knows the truth on the data and who continues to assert that guns are the leading cause of death among children, it is equally true that heart disease is the leading cause of death among children, if you define the set as ‚Äúchildren and people over 65‚Äù and again ungrammatically distribute. For that matter, death by heart disease due to older people so dwarfs other causes of death in the United States that we can conclude that heart disease is the leading cause of death for children, teens, young adults, etc. by the same wordplay.

But, whether people who cite their data are dishonest does not mean the study authors themselves were dishonest.

(Edit: it was already shown the following would not work) **To earn the delta, all anyone has to do is cite 2+ medical studies which make the same error, and not on a politically charged topic** (for simplicity, let‚Äôs define that non-exhaustively as not involving violent trauma from any source. This is overbroad, but there are so many mundane health issues I think it would be a bad sign if we had to revisit this limitation) 

For a purely hypothetical example, some study which said that skin cancer was the leading cancer among Non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans, when in fact it was true only for the set in aggregate, but not African Americans specifically would serve as one of the two. It would not do to say that skin cancer was the leading cancer in the United States, but would have to specifically say ‚ÄúX is true of Y and Z‚Äù when it is only true of ‚ÄúY and Z‚Äù and not ‚ÄúZ‚Äù only. ‚ÄúX is true of Y, which is the set of A and B‚Äù would not work."

A man with a small penis should never be in a relationship in order not to lose his self-respect and to be cuckolded.

If you see a couple and the man has a small penis, it's only because the woman is having sex for the man's money. Unfortunately, if you have a small penis and you are not rich, the only sensible way for you is to have sex with sex workers. Sad but true."

1,2023-07-03,CMV: Statistics and survey data are not effective persuasive tools and should not be the sole basis of a convincing argument,u/Boring-Outcome822,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14pox0a/cmv_statistics_and_survey_data_are_not_effective/,changemyview,"It is very common when looking at debates about most topics that the debaters will rely on statistics and survey data to support their point. The rationale is that statistics and survey data are objective and provide empirical evidence to support a claim. If presented only with logical, intuitive or anecdotal arguments, people tend to be dismissive and demand sources and statistics to support the claims. On the other side, arguments that provide only survey data and statistics without providing a logical or intuitive explanation seem to be less controversial.

My view is that statistics and survey data can only be useful if both parties already trust the source of the data. Otherwise, there is too much room for reasonable doubt, such as:

1. Questioning the impartiality of the source
2. Questioning the methods used for data collection
3. Questioning the statistical inferences or statistical significance of the results
4. Questioning the reproducibility of the survey
5. Providing alternative data that suggests the opposite conclusion

Another philosophical reason for this view is Occam's Razor, which is the heuristic that the most convincing explanation for a phenomenon is usually the simplest. Arguments based on logical and intuitive reasoning tend to provide simpler explanations of phenomena and can be used to make further predictions that can later be tested. Statistics and survey data can certainly increase the confidence in one's arguments, but most of the strength is coming from the explanation itself, the data is only there to verify that the theory is not completely out of touch with reality.

It would be somewhat ironic if the responses to this thread look something like ""Well actually, a survey conducted by [SurveyExperts.gov](https://SurveyExperts.gov) shows that 89% of surveys are reliable and lead to convincing arguments."" And I think it would be unlikely to convince me, but I guess I'm open to being proven wrong...

So if one's goal is to convince another person of something, I believe that relying mostly on statistics and survey data is ineffective, and that those should only be used in support of logical and intuitive arguments. If survey data supports a counterintuitive claim, the intuitive claim still has higher credibility unless both parties trust the source (for example if they performed the data collection and analysis themselves with a commonly agreed procedure)."
14,2023-07-03,CMV: There is not much competition and innovation to be made from a duopoly.,u/OverallMatter454,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14pp5kb/cmv_there_is_not_much_competition_and_innovation/,changemyview,"I could discuss the polarized duopoly know as 2023 US politics, but I regress to avoid alienating users who do not wish to talk about politics. Let's talk about something less polarizing like Android vs. iOS. Currently, the global smartphone market is a duopoly where two major players make up over 90% of the marketshare, which would be Apple's iOS and Google's Android. The two fierce competitors do a good job at providing features and economic value, but this lack of choice beyond a fixed binary makes little room for innovation and competition in Android phones and iPhones.

Don't get me wrong, a duopoly is better than a monopoly in that some change from one platform can be ""copied"" to another platform like the camera notch and gesture navigation bar in iOS and Android. Look at Microsoft Windows in the early 2000s, it had little competition from macOS 10 and enjoyed a 90%+ marketshare. This lack of competition made Microsoft lazy when it came to innovating on the desktop until Apple heated up in the 2010s. What I am saying is that a duopoly, while better than a monopoly when it comes to competition and innovation, is still lacking compared to a market with 6, 10, or 12 different competitors. If someone can convince me that a duopoly can be as innovative and competitive as a 10-competitior market, then I would certainly reconsider my view."

Luckily we have been proved wrong in this matter with many women holding offices and not necessarily doing a better job, but not doing a worse one either. 

&#x200B;

Most men have been hardwired, especially in the non-western world to believe that they are expendable and have to sacrifice their time and feelings towards their family. This fact is well exploited by dictators and leaders alike to push young men into sacrificing their time a.k.a life to protect their family a.k.a. country / community / religion. 

&#x200B;

Women on the other hand do not view themselves as expendable unless it really matters, like saving their child etc. A lot of women when surveyed regarding who should survive, if only one partner survived would choose themselves. Men on the other hand would choose to sacrifice themselves and can be convinced that the same can be achieved by sacrificing the other man (a.k.a. enemy).

&#x200B;

Gross generalisations like these seldom tend to hold much weight and history buffs here would quickly shut me down, with glorious examples of maniacal violent women and their bloodlust. But I believe that more women in leadership positions would bring down the incidence of wars drastically."

A lot has been written about them and I haven't read most of it.

When people talk about rights, they're typically talking about one of several different things. I'll focus on legal rights and ""natural rights"". Legal rights arise out of a legal and political process and can be said to meaningfully exist. No problem there.

My contention is that ""natural rights"" are not meaningfully different from a completely subjective and personal opinion about what people should be able to do. When people say that people right to abortion, or guns, or free speech, or healthcare, there is no meaningful difference between that and saying ""I personally believe that people should be able to do/have these things.""

Sometimes people will appeal to a state of nature where people were able to do these things and anything they naturally do is a natural right. This is inconsistent with how actually people talk about rights because no one says people have a right to murder, steal, etc, even though those things are natural to humans. What natural human behaviors qualify as ""rights"" is completely a matter of subjective opinion and is not based on any objective ""natural state."" For a solid example of this, enslavement of others as property has been considered a natural right... until it wasn't. The reason for that change was because people's opinions on the acceptability of that practice changed. Primitive societies did not and do not recognize the same set of rights that we do today.

Sometimes people will appeal to empathy or human well-being or some utilitarian cause. Those are reasons for your subjective opinion, they do not translate to natural rights.

Can provide something that they think is a fundamental natural right, but is *not* something that they personally think people should be allowed to do or have?

When people say things like ""Constitutional rights are based on natural rights"", all that means is ""Constitutional rights are based on what people think should be allowed."" Specifically in this case the people who drafted and ratified those amendments. I don't think there is anything wrong with that at all, but people want to believe that laws are based on something more solid than the opinions of people, and that is simply not the case.

For the religious, I can imagine a case for God-given rights specifically in the case of religious adherence. I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about universal rights."
1,2023-07-03,CMV: I like anal sex but have personal reservations that make me second guess my desires.,u/OverallMatter454,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14pu9c3/cmv_i_like_anal_sex_but_have_personal/,changemyview,"*Notice: This CMV should be tagged as NSFW due to discussion of pornography and anal sex.*

If the title is a poorly written CMV, I am genuinely sorry. I couldn't find another way of saying it. So without further ado, I was exposed to anal sex porn videos when I was about 12 years old (I am currently in my mid-20s). I had a laptop of my own and started to do internet searches out of curiosity for ""sex videos"" or videos of people engaging in sex. This lead me to discover pornography as a minor at the time. Moral and legal issues aside, one genre of porn that got my interest was anal sex. Before I discuss the ""why"", let me explain the how. I clicked on a video depicting this guy inserting his penis inside a woman's anus and at first I was shocked and grossed out.

Then later on, I started to get less disgusted by the act and more aroused. The guy seemed to be enjoying penetrating her ""in there"". I started to watch more anal sex porn videos and by 19, I developed a kink for anal sex. Keep in mind I am virgin and never had sexual relations with another person. Now, I will move on to why I like anal. 

1. It's taboo and there is something fun and kinky about sexually using something unsanitary for sexual pleasure without the fear of unwanted pregnancy.

2. The anus tends to be tighter than the vagina and giving anal sex tends to be more enjoyable for the guy in a straight relationship. He may even climax sooner because of this.

3. Anal creampies. I love seeing guys ejaculate or  dump their creamy load inside a woman's rectum like its a cum dumpster is such a turn on. It's not supposed to be there, but its there. It's such a turn on seeing possibly contaminated baby-creation fluid leak out of hole that meant to expel feces. I sometimes imagine a load of cum just flowing inside a woman's rectum with all of that sperm swimming in there. Sorry if I am being too graphic, but this turns me on.

Now that we got to what turns me on about anal sex, lets explain the conflict I have.

1. The anus and rectum wasn't made to be penetrated by a penis vigorously. The anus and rectum are more prone to tearing and bleeding than the vagina due to its limited use of expelling feces.

2. Anal sex is unsanitary and poses a slew of health risks. From the previous statement, the anus is more likely to tear than the vagina, putting it as a prime place for infection for giving and receiving partners. Fecal bacteria can infect a penetrating partner with cuts or bruises on the penis.

3. Anal sex violates the natural function of sex being a procreative and unifying act. This reservation is more moral than biological but its a reservation that many don't want to admit to out of the fear of being closed-minded or sex-negative. Anal sex is often more about fulfilling carnal lustful desires rather than being intimate and whole with your partner. First, anal sex does not lead to pregnancy unlike vaginal sex. This might give some couples an incentive to treat anal sex as more of a ""recreational"" activity than a ""procreative"" and ""unifying"" act. While this may be appealing to some, others think that this reduces the penetrated partner to a sex object and that the purpose of sex is more about ""my desires"" than ""joining together as one flesh"".

4. You shit cum. I mentioned that this is a turn on to me personally, but others like my mom don't approve of anal creampies as sexual activity. Besides the risk of sexually transmitted infections from exchanging bodily fluids, a woman (or man) is carrying or expelling precious semen out of their anus like its trash. I am personally conflicted with this view because there are some people with fertility issues who wouldn't ""spill their seed"" in a rectum, of all places due to valuing the life-giving nature of vaginal sex.

5. Power dynamics. Anal sex gets criticized for unbalanced power dynamics. Often, the receiving partner is viewed as submissive and ""slutty"" for taking a penis and semen inside her anus and therefore **some view anal sex as taking away the dignity of the penetrated person even when she consents to anal sex**. Some feminists and women of religious faith often say that anal sex is more dehumanizing than empowering to women, even when the woman enthusiastically consents to it.


That is my likes and reservations for anal sex. I am hoping that someone can respond to my CMV from a sex-positive perspective. I also hope this CMV stays despite being potentially NSFW due to content."

However, because it's a Tuesday this year, many companies will not give the preceding Monday off.  This means in order for someone to have a long weekend they need to use PTO.  I think all holidays should be like memorial day, which is celebrated the last Monday of May, guaranteeing a three day weekend instead of having a random day off in the middle of the week.  Having holidays be on set dates of the year (e.g. December 25th for Christmas) doesn't make sense and makes scheduling holiday travel unnecessarily inconvenient."

In my parents day, salaries were private because ""its personal"", well nowadays when workers are treated like shit, it makes sense to have that transparency.

No one loses - employees know how much they should be making, they know what graduate degrees and years of experience will add to their salary, they know what benefits and hourly rates they will be given, and they can shop around for the companies that will pay them the best. It forces companies to work harder to offer their employees better wages. Most importantly, this eliminates gender and racial income inequality, because now you know what you should be making. This is 100% a pro-worker move. 

I am very curious as to how people try to cmv on this, as i see this as only a benefit to workers."

And in researching this I realized that there were a lot of parallels between the arguments for or against hacking tools being readily available and the arguments for or against gun control. I'll just list a few quickly:

>Pro GC: Guns are built with the sole purpose of killing, it makes sense to restrict their availability while it wouldn't make sense to restrict, say, kitchen knives.

Hacking tools are built to attack. They have legitimate security uses, notably in ""red teaming"" or ""penatration testing"" where ethical hackers are hired to attempt to break through an organization's security system. But these tools are, ultimately, offensive software built to attack another person's computer. If you buy the above argument, then it makes sense to restrict hacking tools while it wouldn't make sense to restrict other software.

>Anti GC: Criminals will always be able to get guns, no matter the laws on them. Why restrict them from our citizens?

This has been proven true in the world of hacking tools. [Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/) is one of the most popular malware Command and Control (C2) tools out there, and the company that sells it vets buyers and ensure that they are ethical hacking organizations. It's probably the best example of a hacking tool that tries to restrict itself to ethical uses. However, malicious hackers have found ways to patch out the Digital Rights Management (DRM) portions of the software in much the same way that video game pirates patch the DRM out of video games before redistributing the cracked copies. Cobalt Strike is one of the most popular tools for ethical hacking, and also one of the most popular tools for unethical hacking. Malicious actors are still able to access cracked versions of Cobalt Strike, so why restrict the software for everyone? (Edit: I mean in a legal sense, obviously Cobalt Strike has DRM to sell the software for money. But this example shows that trying to restrict the tool to ethical hackers won't work with our current technology.)

I could go on, but I think these two examples demonstrate the parallels. And I want to see an argument on why my view should be changed here because I realize that my own feelings on these two are inconsistent: I am against legally restricting access to hacking tools, but I'm generally in favor of moderate gun control laws, especially the ones we already have in many places like background checks for people who purchase firearms. So have at it: is there an argument for why the discussion surrounding the second amendment and the discussion surrounding gun control shouldn't also apply to hacking tools?

EDIT: I have awarded two deltas! One because guns are designed specifically to kill, hacking tools aren't. So gun control may not be an apt comparison, though hacking tools can still cause damage and even death. (Pacemakers and insulin pumps often have wireless capabilities now.) The second was the realization that, if you read the 2A as only dealing with weapons intended to cause physical harm, then hacking tools generally don't fall under them. This does create a grey area for software explicitly designed to tamper with personal medical devices like the aforementioned pacemakers, but that's a court case for the record books when it comes up."

I was in one of the most iconic places in Toronto and saw three gigantic flagpoles:   

(1) Canada (2) Ontario .... and (3) LGBTQ2SIA+ ,   

this was July 1, AFTER pride month. Please tell me why instead of the third flag, there isn't:  

\- United Nations flag (blue background, white globe, to symbolize world harmony)  

\- Commonwealth flag (to show solidarity with UK, NZ, AUS)  

\- UK Flag (to show King Charles is our king too)  

\- Toronto Flag (obvious 3rd choice)- NATO Flag (to show solidarity with NATO)  

\- Canadian Military Flag- Elon Musk Flag (to celebrate technological advancements and the race to mars)  

\-  even a trudeau flag (could be used to celebrate pride but he's PM of Canada so he should be up there not just a particular group)  

Why doesn't the alt right get to have a flag there?   

I don't understand. Pride month is over, why is that flag flying so high alongside Canada and Ontario flag? What does it have to do with that? There are so many other bigger groups and minorities that deserve representation why are we picking just one?  

I am an ally and I play gay chicken and would be cool with having gay/lesbo buddies and even participating in orgies with them. I just don't understand why the flag flies so high right beside Canada and Ontario.TL;DR: Do you think it's right to have that as 3rd flag? What should be there instead? Or just 2 flags?  
\-----------------------  
I am writing to express my concerns regarding the display of the LGBTQ2SIA+ flag alongside the Canadian and Ontario flags outside government buildings. While I understand the importance of celebrating diversity and inclusivity, I believe that this particular display sends a message that may be divisive and exclusionary to some members of our community.  
While I appreciate the sentiment behind flying the LGBTQ2SIA+ flag, I believe that it is not appropriate to display it alongside the national and provincial flags. The Canadian and Ontario flags represent all Canadians and Ontarians, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. By displaying the LGBTQ2SIA+ flag alongside these flags, we risk sending a message that some groups are more important than others, which is not in line with the values of inclusivity and equality that we strive to uphold.  
Furthermore, I believe that the display of the LGBTQ2SIA+ flag outside government buildings can be seen as a political statement, which may be inappropriate given the role of government institutions in representing all citizens. Instead, I would suggest that we focus on creating policies and initiatives that promote diversity and inclusivity in all aspects of society, rather than relying on symbolic gestures that may not be universally accepted.  
In terms of alternative flags that could be displayed, I agree that the United Nations flag, the Commonwealth flag, the Toronto flag, and the Canadian Military flag would all be appropriate choices. These flags represent important aspects of our national identity and would provide a more inclusive representation of our community.  
In conclusion, I urge caution in the display of the LGBTQ2SIA+ flag outside government buildings, and I recommend that we focus on policies and initiatives that promote inclusivity and equality for all members of our community. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter."

1. Drunk people are impaired so they need to be protected so they don‚Äôt make choices they regret.

2. Drunk people make the decision to be drunk, so they need to live with whatever they do.

I‚Äôm not commenting on either way of thinking, but currently we as a society have a foot in each camp.

You‚Äôre not responsible for who you sleep with, but you are responsible for what you buy.

Bartenders can get in trouble for over serving you, but you‚Äôre fully responsible when you buy it at a store.

Stuff like this is just wack.  Either the second you have a drink you give up all liability for your actions, or you‚Äôre liable for all of them."

i still believe this, obviously, but this CMV isn‚Äôt here to argue over that. this CMV is in response to multiple people who said that my views were genocidal. 

i‚Äôm here to ask you to CMV that a measure focused on ridding society of this element would not meet the definition of genocide. 

in the dictionary, the term genocide is defined as:

the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group.

now, the term ‚Äúnation‚Äù is murky, because it seems to be separate from ethnicity. but, it would follow that it refers to the citizens of a nation, who can reasonably be considered a separate ethnicity in their own right. 

when we look throughout history, the term has always been applied to those instances where a mass of people were liquidated for their race/ethnicity. 

armenian genocide

the holocaust 

stalin

cambodian genocide

rawanda

these are clear and indisputable examples of mass extermination visited upon ethnic grips because of their ethnicity/race. 

i was thinking of including mao, but i don‚Äôt believe there is any evidence mao targeted groups because of their ethnicity. 

so, my point is that a program that targeted american right wingers would not meet the definition of genocide, because it would not carry a racial/ethnic component."

1. Many LGBT couples have fulfilling, happy sex lives without ever having PiV sex. Oral and non-penetrative sex is also on the table for heterosexual couples.
2. Vibrators and other types of penetrative sex toys can be used by heterosexual women's partners, often do the job better than penises do, and are safer in terms of risk for pregnancy and STDs.
3. Most women also don't often climax from penetrative sex, and non-penetrative stimulation (oral sex) or sex toys are more pleasurable.
4. Often, PIV sex seems very centered around the male orgasm. It's finished when he is, and if she's lucky she maybe got some nice foreplay beforehand.
5. It would be safer and more pleasurable for most heterosexual couples to abstain from PiV sex unless they were trying to start a family. Worries about pregnancy, STDs, and all of that would be off the table and the woman would probably be orgasming more, so intimacy and sense of connectedness would also improve.

1,2023-07-04,"CMV: ""Pleasure and Pain"" defines an Objective Morality",u/Steerianism,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14q7rep/cmv_pleasure_and_pain_defines_an_objective/,changemyview,"Utilitarianism says the maximisation of pleasure and the minimisation of pain are moral goods, and I believe this is an objectively true moral statement. Now I will not go as far to say it is the only moral good (I believe it is - but can't say definitively), but certainly disproves the claim that ""Objective morality doesn't exist"".  
My first argument is that it's quite self-evident. If you look the life of someone deep into a heroin addiction with no stable income, housing, or relationships. Compare this to the life of a successful businessman who has plenty of riches, a family who loves him, and goes on fancy holidays twice a year. In everyday life everyone would prefer the latter to the former, and we use these sort of images to navigate our own choices and decisions. Everyday people can see some lives are better than others, and act in a way to make their own life as good as possible - therefore it would be nonsensical to suggest that all of this morality is ""meaningless"" and ""untrue"".  
Some people may oppose this ""self-evident-ness"" as not being determined by some reason to 'why' this is good. But nothing justifies it apart from itself, I question why we would expect a 'reason'? Any reasons why can bring up to justify happiness as good is merely an attempt to get across an image to someone, but rationality cannot justify what is or isn't the case. Rationality stems from axioms or conclusions, therefore it should be expected that something must ground morality without rational justification - which is happiness.  
This is supported by the fact that we have a reason for 'why' pleasure actually is a good and why pain actually is a bad. Emotions are roughly evolutionary developments to guide our actions to maximise our chance for procreation. Therefore is pleasure and pain aren't inherent goods and bads, how could they conceivably by the foundations for controlling our behaviours? It'd make no sense.  
We can see this pull towards something foundational by reversing the argument of cultural differences: that all cultures and people have different beliefs, hence no objective morality. The fact is that practically all cultures believe in the same basic customs such as ""no killing"" - and in very rare cases where they don't, there is some specific regional justification for why this is. Additionally even people who proclaim to not believe in morality act as if there is, if I key a nihilists car they're going to be mad. If even those who oppose the idea of morality are forced to act as if it exists, there's a good chance it actually does."
1,2023-07-04,CMV: Cancel culture affects us more than rich and famous people,u/Shot_Army8540,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14q8q1q/cmv_cancel_culture_affects_us_more_than_rich_and/,changemyview,"I don't know whether I concider cancel culture toxic or not. But I have noticed that cancel culture affects the ones struggling the most (or at least most of the time)

Just to clarify, when I say cancel culture, I'm not talking about the people that commit full ass disgusting crimes. That's the law and has nothing to do with cancel culture now and everything to do with people's morals depending on whether they still support them.

But then there are still crimes that others wouldn't concider that bad, unless done to a less fourtante person. For example, stealing. If someone steals from a store because of poverty, it is concidered understandable. If a rich person steals from their poor employers, that's is clearly unacceptable.

Something that I noticed is cancel culture affecting people that have nothing to fall back onto more then the people that have a platform for everyone to see. When celebrities or rich people do smth, they get a slap on the wrist, some harsh words, and a little loss of money or followers. Then everything is forgotten and people just move on to someone new. They still have money to fall back on, at times they have family, friends or agencies/brands. Many celebrities that have been canceled have gotten their films watched and liked by just working with another well liked celebrity. Because we all know, other celebrities will still work with the worst of people even if they put up a progressive personality on the big screen.

Cancel culture caused very unrealistic sociatal rules for people that aren't rich and famous. You cannot redeem yourself from one mistake without having countless eyes on your every move to call you out again. And sometimes you don't even get to redeem yourself, your past mistakes are tattooed onto you. Alot of people don't believe in character development and change. As well as with the whole, red flag and assuming things about people these days, which causes everyone to be very self conscious but also deliberately judgemental because they feel like they must hate as they recieve. You see many videos on tiktok about people talking about their stories with others that did them wrong, and then you see many comments otherwise trying to make themselves feel better, genuinely scared they are like the person they are speaking of, or making fun of the person in the story/someone similar in their lives from making a mistake. These days, everyone is always trying to be morally superior. Always trying to get onto the train of whose right and who isn't, who should recieve hate and who shouldn't, will ultimately lead to affecting peoples mental health and feeling unredeemable causing them to not change out of feeling like there's no point, which leads to others still hating them for not changing. It's a vicious cycle. And sometimes cancel culture is even used by people that want to be victims or by fans of celebs to turn the blame on victims or ""cancellers"" (in the context that these celebs or people haven't changed or redeemed themselves) 

Now this is all about things that aren't concidered that bad of things, which all different for everyone. So that brings me to the question:

To what degree (not talking about really bad crimes) does cancel culture get to go? As well as, what type of actions deserve long lasting grudges? 

Apologies if everything sounds stupid."

1,2023-07-04,"CMV: Ignoring the impact of Barbary piracy on the French colonization of Algeria is intellectually dishonest, incomplete, and a gross oversimplification of history",u/Federal_Penalty5832,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14q8t52/cmv_ignoring_the_impact_of_barbary_piracy_on_the/,changemyview,"In an era of sweeping generalizations and sound-bite history, I feel compelled to shatter an egregiously misguided narrative, one that denies any link between the era of the Barbary pirates and the French colonization of Algeria. Such a denial is not just historically ill-informed but perilously neglects the intertwined realities of historical events.

From the late 16th to early 19th centuries, Barbary pirates captured an estimated 800,000 to 1.25 million Europeans, disrupting the socio-economic equilibrium of numerous nations. The tributes to ensure safety of ships formed an obscene chunk of state incomes - as much as 20% of the US government's total revenue. You can‚Äôt dismiss these numbers as inconsequential, not unless you have a blatant disregard for historical data.

I'm not here to push a reductive argument. I'm not saying the colonization of Algeria was purely a mission to end piracy. Such a claim would indeed be ludicrously simplistic. What I am asserting, however, is that piracy, specifically its economic and geostrategic implications, played a role that cannot be discounted in France's decision to invade Algeria in 1830.

Denying this, as some apparently wish to do, is not just intellectually disingenuous but a refusal to grapple with complex historical realities. The ""Fly Whisk Incident"" in 1827, which led to the invasion of Algeria, was closely tied to the mounting pressures of unpaid debts, which included the cost of dealing with piracy.

Rational reasoning requires an acceptance of interconnectedness. Ignoring empirical evidence, and dismissing the piracy issue as a mere footnote, betrays a bias that distorts our understanding of the past. History is rarely the result of a single cause; it's the product of multiple, overlapping factors, piracy included.

When a historian of Fernand Braudel's stature declares the Mediterranean Sea as an ""enormous, almost closed lake,"" acting as a nexus for culture, trade, and piracy, we must understand the implications of such a statement. Algeria's geostrategic position in controlling this vital waterway cannot be understated.

If anyone here insists on maintaining the argument that the French colonization of Algeria has zero correlation with the era of Barbary piracy, I challenge you. Prove me wrong. Arm yourself with facts, empirical data, and credible sources, because I will not be swayed by empty rhetoric or simplistic reasoning. You're going to need more than just denial to convince me.

In the realm of serious discourse, we do not have the luxury of cherry-picking historical facts to suit our narratives. Oversimplification and denial are not valid analytical tools; they are roadblocks to genuine understanding."

And from what I've seen so far, being blatantly racist in these situations is overall beneficial for your safety and well being. This evolved into a catchphrase of ""another win for blatant racism"", which is uttered more often than I would like.

I acknowledge the need for queer representation in popular media to help abolish all the left-over phobia towards the queer community, and normalise queer relationships and individuality in the public eye.

==> But such representations at times can come off as 'out of place' or 'forced'.

B. Often, if in a popular show or film, a queer relationship is shown, without that retionship ( or the queer nature of it ) contributing anything to the main plot, some viewers label it as 'forced' or 'out of place'. But the LGBTQ community simply see it as necessary representation. As in, it's just a relationship ( or a person ), why should it matter whether or not it's straight or gay ( or the person is cis or trans or NB etc ). 

==> I do see that perspective, but it can take away from the artistic value or quality of the content. Even the story telling aspect is somehow hampered. 

C. There are also cases when in any media adaptation of any literary piece, some cisgendered-heterosexual characters are changed into some LGBTQ character, without that characters' new sexuality or gender playing any role in the story. Some heterosexual cisgendered people claim that as deliberate erasure of heterosexuality or cisgendered identity, in the name of representation. LGBTQ people would argue that this claim comes from underlying phobia and heteronormative mindset.

==> I believe this claim does not originate from phobia. Because the same straight/cis people love all loveable original queer characters in pop culture ( a few examples would be characters from, Schitt's Creek, Modern Family, Grace and Frankie, Sex Education, The Last of Us, and counteless others).
The claim only originates when the queer characters come at the expense of already familiar straight/cis characters in adaptations of some literary pieces."

Yes, I acknowledge that he was undeniably cruel to the digital clones of his colleagues within the modded game Infinity, and his sadistic tendencies were disturbing. He was even rude to the pizza delivery guy. However, let's consider his actions outside the game. In the real world, he never physically harmed anyone. Sure, he did steal people's DNA, but that act alone didn't cause any direct harm to them.  
  
  
  
The episode offers us a glimpse into Robert Daly's present circumstances, but what about his past? Who's to say he didn't have a fucked-up childhood, or bitter experiences that made him a docile pushover in real life? Perhaps his bottled-up frustrations and twisted nature found an outlet in the virtual world he created. It's clear that he never received the mental help he deserved. And to make matters worse, he was trapped in the game indefinitely and presumably met his demise off-screen. When we consider other characters in Black Mirror, Robert Daly's situation seems uniquely tragic.  
  
  
  
Let's take a look at Kenny from Shut Up and Dance, the paedophile. Or Ffion from The Entire History of You, who gaslighted Liam for who knows how long before he finally caught on. In ""Men Against Fire,"" those soldiers were hypnotized into committing genetic cleansing. And Mia from Crocodile? She went to crazy extremes to cover up her crimes. Oh, and don't forget the overbearing mom in ArkAngel stifling her daughter's emotional and psychological growth. Compared to all these characters, Robert Daly never physically harmed anyone as far as we know. Whatever frustrations he had, he confined them to the digital realm.  
  
  
  
Furthermore, it's crucial to remember that in the world of Black Mirror, digital copies are portrayed as sentient beings. However, in our real world, technology hasn't advanced to create such sentient digital copies. While we've heard of individuals in episodes like The Entire History of You, ArkAngel, Shut Up and Dance, and Crocodile, who demonstrate the potential harm and ethical dilemmas of technology, the concept of sentient digital copies remains speculative."

He caused a flipping genocide (scratch that, he's also responsible for the construction of the Death Star and thus the destruction of Alderaan, so he caused *two* genocides), he took over both the Republic and Confederacy of Systems and became their dictator, he kept Vader in pain for over twenty years just so he'd be more powerful in the Dark Side, and he groomed Anakin Skywalker to become a Sith Lord by separating him from his friends and wife until he betrayed them all. 

Sure, Dumbledore is the mentor figure and beloved Hogwarts headmaster in the HP books and movies. But looking closer, this guy is a completely irresponsible manipulative bastard. He keeps dangerous relics in the school in places where children can easily either get to them or be killed by the booby traps around said relic, hires dangerous/incompetent/awful people as teachers for bad reasons (he only hired Lockhart because he wanted to prove he was a fraud), left Harry in an abusive home (despite Minerva telling him this was a bad idea) his entire childhood, made himself one of the strongest political players in the Wizarding world just to further his own agenda (which, as is shown several times, causes problems when those duties interfere with the running of Hogwarts), and groomed Harry to be the Chosen One and *let himself be killed by Voldemort*. Also, while he didn't contribute to any genocides (that we know of) he does nothing to end the enslavement of House Elves.

Let's compare, shall we? Both Sidious and Dumbledore:

\- Manipulate people to get their way

\- Employ dangerous/irresponsible people for their own reasons

\- Support (mostly through inaction) xenophobia in their worlds

\- Manipulated a young man to do their dirty work for them

\- Put themselves in high political positions to further their own agendas. 

Yes, you can argue that Voldemort qualifies here, too, but at least Voldemort didn't try to hide how evil he was. To quote Picard: ""Villains who who twirl their mustaches are easy to spot. Those who clothe themselves in good deeds are well-camouflaged."" Dumbledore tried to make himself look like the big hero of the Wizarding world who could do no wrong, and he more or less succeeded...but it doesn't take too long to see that he wasn't as good as he seemed to be."

First of all, who gets to decide what counts as ""hurting somebody""? In some cases, the harm might be obvious - physical violence, for example. But what about more subtle forms of harm, like emotional manipulation or psychological abuse? These can be just as damaging, but they're often harder to recognize and quantify.

This phrase is being thrown around lightly as an excuse to do things that are obviously harmful, just because you 'love' what you're doing doesn't mean it's considered good."

So in the truest, technical sense, Asians are people of color.

What I mean by ""real,"" though, is this: Generally, the term ""person of color"" means not only someone who has non-white skin, but also faces racism or socio-economic disadvantages. This describes native-Americans, Hispanics, African-Americans, etc.

It does not describe Asians in the United States, however. The Asian-American populace in the United States is not only monetarily and academically better off than any other racial-minority group, but in fact they even outpace white Americans in some categories. 

This isn't just my opinion: [The University of Maryland has also decided to separate Asians into a different category than ""people of color.""](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/univ-maryland-slammed-separating-asian-students-students-color-graphic-rcna6151)   UM recognizes that there are attributes about Asians that make it unsuitable to regard them in the same light as Hispanics, African-Americans or whatnot. Other colleges ought to follow suit likewise in classifying Asians as ""non-POC.""

At universities and various levels of education, Asian-Americans have higher educational attainment than nearly every other racial group in America, if not in fact every single other such group in America. 

So when a racial minority earns a lot, has high academic attainment and is in general exempt from all the other disadvantages that other minorities face (such as racism or discrimination,) is it really appropriate to call them a ""minority"" or ""people of color?"" The only thing that makes Asians POC is the most literal definition of the term ""color"" - their brown skin. They do not fit any other qualifier for POC.

The term POC should not be taken to mean only skin color, it should be taken to mean the entire set of circumstances of a non-white person who faces discrimination or racism, struggles financially or academically, etc.  (Before someone says, ""*Well, is LeBron James not a POC since he's rich and successful?*"" - that's not quite what I mean. Sure, LeBron is rich but the overall African-American populace in America struggles, and has struggled for many decades.)

There are only two possible theories that explain the existence of the universe. The first is that the universe came from nothing. There was nothing, and then it just existed out of nowhere. This theory is completely unscientific on account of the fact that something cannot come out of nothing. That is clearly impossible according to the laws of physics and all scientific principles. The only way something could come out of nothing is if Godly powers were utilized. Therefore, the universe becoming something out of nothing means God exists.   
Just think, if someone could make things appear out of nothing, then they must have Godly powers. That would be the only explanation, right? There is no scientifically possible way someone could just make things appear out of nowhere.  
The second possible theory is that the universe existed forever, and you can go back in time forever and it will always have existed. Now, this theory is also unscientific because nothing can exist without coming from somewhere. Everything needs to have come from someplace at sometime. If you go back far enough in the universe, right back to the big bang or the big crunch or big whatever event you believe in, the question remains, where did this come from? Again, if the universe came out of nothing, then that means god exists, because nothing cannot come from something.   
Therefore, either the universe came out of nothing (God created it) or the universe has always existed (again, God created it).

These policies, often referred to as land reform, sought to redistribute land and eliminate the feudal system that had prevailed in China for centuries. While Mao's policies towards landlords were controversial and had their share of shortcomings, they can be seen as a positive step towards achieving social equality, empowering the rural population, and laying the groundwork for China's modernization.

One of the primary goals of Mao's policy towards landlords was to address the vast wealth and power disparity that existed between the rural landowners and the peasants. Under the feudal system, landlords controlled large portions of land while peasants lived in poverty, working as laborers on these estates. The policy aimed to redistribute land, giving the peasants an opportunity to own and cultivate their own plots. By breaking up the large estates and distributing land among the peasants, Mao's policy aimed to alleviate the immense social and economic inequalities that existed in rural China.

Land reform also sought to address the issue of exploitation by landlords. Many landlords would extract exorbitant rents from their tenants, leaving the peasants with barely enough to survive. This system perpetuated a cycle of poverty and economic bondage. Mao's policy aimed to eliminate this exploitation by abolishing the landlord-tenant relationship and providing land directly to the peasants. This not only improved the living conditions of the rural population but also empowered them by giving them control over their means of subsistence."

I noticed that things like diversity, inclusion, and equity are being promoted with the goal of a unified one-world culture and government where people in current African countries, the Middle East, and parts of central and east Asia could enjoy the same constitutional rights and liberties as US citizens.

Proponents of a one-world state argue that among other things, a one-world nation can defend more rights, freedoms, and opportunities for more of the global population than having numerous nations with various wealth and income disparities. Also in speaking of income and wealth disparity, unification of the worlds nations can alleviate economic inequality more effectively and productively through more targeted efforts of income and wealth redistribution. In addition, a one world currency that goes a step further than the regional euro currency would ""level the playing field"" for currency use and international trade.

While a one-world nation sounds nice and all, the idea of a one-world culture and nation sounds like a scary precedent for an abuse of power. I also notice that conservatives tend to be more nationalist and isolationist whereas liberals and progressives tend to be more embracing of globalization and a unified state and culture. With a one-world nation, tyranny becomes more likely through a one-world government having more control over social liberties than a smaller national superpower like the current USA.

I have no issues with supporting women, racial/ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people, and people with disabilities in terms of providing equal access and freedom from marginalization and discrimination. I also have no issue with the transition to a ""cashless society"" as long as individual privacy rights are preserved through government regulation. What I am against is any trend or movement that brings us closer to a one-world unified government and culture. I think there is a need to maintain cultural heterogeneity and diversity as well as having separate nations.

If NGOs like the UN and WHO want to ensure universal human rights are applied to all member states, they can **and did** create a universal declaration of human rights and support initiatives to promote, life, liberty, property rights, and equal opportunity for all human citizens without the need of a one-world unified government and culture. The concern is less of cultural unification and more of potential tyranny that comes from a powerful one-world state."

By peer countries, I mean high income, Democratic countries including Western Europe, the anglosphere, Japan... I'm sure there's more. 

I believe this is causative. In other countries, there is little worry that police at a traffic stop or serving a warrant will be faced with a gun. Many countries don't arm patrol officers, and those countries have fewer police killed on duty. 

As a result of the real threat faced by police, they are increasingly heavily armed. They are quick to use escalating force out of a sense of personal safety. The US courts have protected these police powers.

The idea I've seen is that if police try to infringe on rights, the gun will save you. It will not. The police will kill you, and then use your death as reason to limit rights to be free of search and seizure and free from government violence."

On the recent SCOTUS Affirmative Action ruling, while I typically agree with my left-leaning community I don‚Äôt on Affirmative Action and wanted to understand more about why people believe Affirmative Action in higher education is a good thing. When California got rid of affirmative action and the proportion of the student population that was Asian increased, why does the UC System year after year put out a report there is something at issue with diversity?  
From what I understand, the predominant stated good outcome for Affirmative action is for top universities to represent as close as possible the ethnic distribution of the people. That there is social injustice which does make it harder to succeed as a person of color, and that going to a top university helps elevate and propel people into positions of power.  I don‚Äôt disagree with any of that, but I also don‚Äôt see why it's wrong for there to be a very high proportion of Asian Americans at these top schools.   
Maybe it‚Äôs a stereotype, but anecdotally I have seen this, many Asian people, who immigrated to America, place an incredibly high focus on education for their children. It's part of the culture of many Asian Americans to believe education is so very important. Personally, both my mom and dad came to the USA with nothing, they both never even went to school past middle school as even as kids they had to work labor-intensive and menial work for low pay.  When they got to America, it was the same story but they were often taken advantage of because their English was so poor and they could not advocate for themselves.  Wage theft, work abuse etc etc.  But they sacrificed and sacrificed every luxury (no vacations, no eating out, no new clothes) and worked incredibly long hours to the point where I didn‚Äôt see them much growing up. So that 1) we could live in an area with good schools, and 2) we could pay for private tutoring.  My privilege is that I had parents who did everything in their power to help with our education. I don‚Äôt think my story is unique.  
So I wonder, if culturally Asian American focus so much on education for their children, why is it wrong that there is a very high proportion of Asians in higher education, it‚Äôs like Asians are more likely to eat rice, a lot of Asians obsess over education‚Ä¶. So I am glad that Harvard was found to discriminate against Asians, they did and that was wrong.   
In California which does not have Affirmative Action I don't think we have an admissions issue. I understand there are studies where in job interviews people will rate women or black people lower for the same resume. That is awful and obviously racist and not okay. But CA Universities are already doing so much extra outreach to get underrepresented groups to apply etc. I have seen no evidence that there are any racist policies that hinder underrepresented groups in that admissions ‚Äúinterview‚Äù process.  In fact, at Harvard it as found to be the opposite, that additions were rating Asians lower on ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù metrics.   I love that under the SCOTUS ruling people can still speak to their race, obviously that matters.  BUT once you get the stage of applying to university every person should be judged based on their individual academic merit. I think it will be a good thing when the rest of the country needs to follow California's model.   
What universities can do is provide extra support once students get admitted, so that all groups have similar education outcomes after they get in. This makes sure there is no racism in universities that are creating unequal outcomes. Since by definition if a student got in, and the admissions process was fair, then everyone should have a similar educational outcome.  However all the issues that are BEFORE admissions can be fixed by Universities, admissions can‚Äôt change the wrongs from before.  
If Americans really do want a higher proportion of underrepresented minorities in higher ed, then the real issue is that we have a system where people need to either 1) have money to get ahead in k-12 or 2) sacrifice everything so they can still get a good k-12 education.

Shortly thereafter, every single moderator of the sub was mysteriously banned, and the subreddit was locked. A few weeks/months after that, the subreddit was fully banned, and it was made ineligible for Redditrequest. 

The situation is a bit murky and to this day, most of the facts are still uncertain. One possible reason which may lead the admins to take action was that the gsb mod team allegedly doxxed the admin which had placed multiple pixels on r/place. However, I have yet to see any evidence that anyone has actually been doxxed. If the incident happened, I can understand why the mod team got banned, but the subreddit should remain locked until new mods are selected via Redditrequest. All the high quality memes on the sub that are forever inaccessible now because it got banned. 

I would be willing to change my mind if someone presented proof that all of the moderators were breaking Reddit TOS, and that the users were extremely supportive. Alternatively if someone can present a coherent justification for the admin's decision of banning the sub, I might also be willing to reconsider my viewpoint.

Despite making up less than 1% of the population, I feel they are greatly over represented in conservative media in a way to convince viewers that the trans epidemic is real. The idea is to spread the idea that more and more people are becoming trans as if it‚Äôs some pathological agent that infects people. 

I also think this over representation helps push the narrative that their presence is harming cisgendered people. One of my favorite examples of this is trans people in sports. There is an over representation of trans presence and trans victory in sports. There‚Äôs estimated to be less than 100 trans collegiate atheletes, and most people can only name one, Lia Thomas. Why is this? Because she won. She is the one in many that succeeded. This is where the level of success is overblown. 

Conservative media would lead you to believe that trans atheletes dominate wildest but they don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a few of them and every few years one has a success and the media chooses to hyper focus on them. A more accurate place to look is the Olympics. Since 2015 trans men and women have been allowed to compete given a certain level of progress in their transition. In the last 4 games barely any trans people have qualified and none have dominated. If trans women were ungodly athletic beasts compared to cis women, why haven‚Äôt we had a huge amount of trans women medaling? Easy they‚Äôre not.

To my other point, they are way over representation in the media when it comes to crime. Just like every group of people, there are assholes who happen to be trans. The thing is, when an asshole who happens to be cis does a crime, it is rarely seen as a reflection of the cis gendered community. When it comes to trans people, any one of them committing a crime becomes a reflection of the entire trans community. 

Take that one school shooter who was trans. Despite there being literally no evidence of this being a ‚Äútrans activist‚Äù that‚Äôs the narrative the media ran with in an attempt to make it a trans issue, when in reality it was just one of the many mass shootings in the country done by someone who happens to be trans.

This goes the same with sex crimes. Since it‚Äôs the conservative go-to attack, when a trans person is a pedo, it gives the conservative media machine ammo to label all trans people as pedos, despite the overwhelming amount of child sexual predation being cisgendered heterosexual adult male and an underage girl. 

It‚Äôs an example of trans people doing the same shit that cis people do, except cis people aren‚Äôt widely labeled as groomers for it.

This is just a weapon to convey fear in the hearts of people who already do have a level of bigotry and just need a way to justify it as more than bigotry."

Many people, including me, cannot view monogamy as a spectrum or an umbrella term, because it isn‚Äôt. In any other relationship besides that with a widower, monogamy implies sexual, emotional, relational and romantic fidelity. So just because widowers have different experiences, they are not entitled to change the definition of a word just because they don‚Äôt agree with its core principles, or make it more inclusive. Monogamy is the exact opposite of inclusion of ideas that allow a third presence in exist, even in spirit. 

Another point I would like to bring, is that some widowers keep bringing up an argument of loving multiple children/siblings equally and uniquely, even if they were to face a loss of a child/sibling, in order to justify why there should be space in the current relationship to actively grieve the late partner. It‚Äôs really, simply, comparing apples to oranges. Parenting isn‚Äôt exclusive to one kid, kinship isn‚Äôt exclusive to one sibling, but most romantic relationships are exclusive and monogamous to one partner.

You get only one wife/husband/SO should monogamy exists. Loving two people at once contradicts monogamy.

I think widowers often feel they are being monogamous, but they are just outside of it. And that‚Äôs really not a bad thing if they actually acknowledge that part of themselves and be self aware enough to see how they view attachments now. 

A core part of their identity changed the moment their late spouse passed on, and it shaped their experience and how they see love. 

However I still feel that they shouldn‚Äôt use the word monogamous to define their relationship style based on how this concept is defined right now in this day and age."

Societal collapse can mean many things, it can be large scale or individual, it can mean a dent in the economy or a mass death, but it doesn't mean the extinction of the human race. I believe that humans have the capability of adapting to new environments even with their population or resources reduced. The survivability of humans is out of the question, but I'm here to talk about the suffering.

Nobody likes to hear society will collapse, I didn't like to hear society will collapse, and believe me, I hate the people in r/collapse as much as the next guy. But still, after two years of researching and re reading, whether a collapse happens in our liftime is the question I've been pondering most, because the collapse itself has been pretty much guaranteed. 

The issues that could make the collapse unfold are plenty but I'll summarize them into two categories:

1) Climate change and pollution: we're struggling with this much already. Without the necessary actions of world goverments, climate change has the potential to become truly catastrophic. Perhaps not enough to cause first world-ish societal collapse before 2100, but the warming doesn't stop in 2100. Some issues within this category include climate feedback loops and insect die off. 

2) Overpopulation and resource scarcity: Viewing documentaries like ""There's no tomorrow"" and visiting sites like ""overshoot day"" make one thing very clear: the earth has finite resources and we can't expand infinitely. The more people come, the more resources we use, the less resources there are, the less we can support our current society. Some issues within this category include peak oil and water scarcity. 

2b) UNDERpopulation: the population decreasing will only mean that in the future there will be more older people and infrastructure meant to support a way bigger group of humans will be rendered useless, there will not be enough people to keep it functioning.

I would absolutely love to have my view changed on this. To me collapse is inevitable but the question of when exactly we could see it really bugs me and eats away my mental health through anxiety and sometimes I wonder if willful ignorance would be a better way to live. If someone agrees with me on this I also propose changing my view on the theory that a collapse will happen within my (17) lifespan."
0,2023-07-04,CMV: Most people who are against children transitioning just don't want people to be trans at all,u/justacommentwriter,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14qtcny/cmv_most_people_who_are_against_children/,changemyview,"There I said it. Yes obviously I don't think a 12-year-old should have gender reassignment surgery but I also think it's borderline transphobic to say you have to wait until you're 18 to be able to medically transition. Even more transphobic if you believe a child cannot even just socially transition before 18.

It sort of reminds me of how in the UK, the age of consent for homosexual relations used to be 21 when it was 16 for heterosexual relations. People view LGBT+ issues and people as sexually deviant and extreme when in reality, homosexually is not more deviant than heterosexually. Thankfully, the age of consent for gay sex and relations eventually went down to 18 in the 90s and down again to 16 in the early 2000s but now young transgender people are facing a similar problem. 

To many, trans people and issues are seen as a monolith and a shared ideology instead of as individuals. To a lot of people on the outside, they may believe any child who says they are trans are only doing it because it is ""cool to be trans"" and it is just a faze. Only adults can be transgender. Children cannot be trans because how could they? We mUsT prOTeCt tHe ChiLDren! Give me a break. You don't want to protect all children. You just don't want people to be trans.

Look I'm not saying a child should go on HRT a week after coming out as transgender but saying all adolescents with gender dysphoria are not allowed to transition is at best ignorant and at worse, cruel."

I'm not saying it's all out of hate/ envy, but because Americans and their government are by default expected to be role-models for the World. Americans come from all corners of the globe, so they've been able to shape a society that tries it's best to accommodate all types of people. 

There are some places that seem better on paper in terms of social security and quality of life, but when you factor in population, the age in which the country was founded, and the amount of choice you have to live the life you see fit, America is #1 and always will be. 

America has influenced many countries in the past, and those countries owe their success to initial investments paid for by Americans. It's also easy to tout quality of life standards when the diversity in the country is minimal, and you can easily govern small populations who generally value and think the same things. 

Everyone talks about America being a war mongering, resource-hungry and cocky country. I spent 8 years in the Marine Corps, I've participated in Operation Tomodachi, when thousands of Marines and Navy sailors assisted in disaster relief delivering hundreds of thousands of lbs of food, water and medical supplies to Japanese civilians, as well as hundreds of aircraft and vehicles for the SAR effort. 

In Iraq and Afghanistan, I've seen certain places be terraformed from miserable shitholes to places with schools, basic infrastructure and security. I've been given flowers and fruit, food and drinks by some of the civilians, people learning English to just talk to us and say ""thank you"" for being there. 

America has led the way in nearly every single sector, but for some reason we get shit on, and it's even mix between some of our own citizens, and people in other countries who just have an innate hatred for us. 

That being said, this is speaking about America as a whole and the way we operate. Just because you're from a different country, doesn't mean you're ""lesser than"". America was founded from pulling people from all corners of the globe, which is what makes it such an innovative and successful country.

But I have a lot of issues with the way cities do them, and also how easily accessible fireworks are for civilians.

Here are all the problems I can think of with fireworks:

1) They are dangerous, and if you aren't trained, you can get injured.

2) They can cause fires

3) They can be traumatic for pets

4) They can cause a lot of problems for people who have conditions such as PTSD, autism, recent concussions, etc.

5) They can cause sleep disturbances when not done at regulated times.

To fix these problems, fireworks should be made extremely difficult for citizens to get, and only with a permit. They also should be required to notify neighbors before using them. Any cities that are by water should be required to shoot their fireworks off from the water or the coast, and not near buildings or forest if possible. People should be steeply fined for using fireworks without permission and if they are in an area that is at risk of force forest fire, they should even face potential prison time."

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre bringing drugs. *They‚Äôre bringing crime*. They‚Äôre rapists.‚Äù was, I believe, the defining sentence of the 2016 Trump campaign. Trump wanted to erect a structure to keep out illegals immigrants from fears rooted in them bringing in crime.

**Illegals immigrants commit crime at lower rates at natural born citizens.**

Therefore, the crime Trump warned about was a simple increase in the number of crimes occurring.

Human beings by our nature commit crime. There will be a certain number of criminals, x, out of group y. From group y, take away x, we will have z, bystanders. From z, there exist a segment √† for police. Therefore, from y immigrants coming in, there will be indeed x more criminals committing crimes, but there will also be z victims. There is a higher proportion of z from y than there are in natural born communities due to the lower crime rate.

So people living here already would have a lower chance of being victim to a crime, the same way living a city with a lower hominid rate than rural areas, there are more murders happening around you but you are less likely to be directly involved.

This means that Trump was speaking of more crimes happening. It follows he simply does not want them here due to their humanity. He wants less humans of their form here. 

This similar issue is not brought up concerning immigration stemming from the north, where there is actually a higher terrorist threat.

Therefore there must be an ulterior motivation to his resistance to more people who commit less crime. Racism. The worry that demographic change will take place.

To avoid this, all terms in governmental office, including the lowest staffer must be subject to strict term limits of 1 non renewable term not lasting more than 5 days with the period between elections remaining the same (4 years) to prevent entrenchment of power.

Additionally, the age limit for such offices would be changed from the minimum age of 25 for congressmen and 35 for president to 0 for minimum age to 21 for the maximum age needed to stand for election to those offices to remove connections that would tempt people to abuse the system.

We, children of change and chaos, became slaves to order and monotony.   
  
Now that I got my artistic needs satisfied, allow me to explain: we, humans, monkeys, have things that we love and value, and we can examine those things by looking at people of eld, to be specific, stone age men. Even then, without any monetary goal in mind, we still played and made art and communicated because that is what we love, this is what we are good at.   
  
Capitalism, however, ruined it - we started to think about the world in a sense of transactions, of loss and gain. Not only is it utterly pointless, it poisons our nature, and makes us less human. Efficiency became the end of all arguments, but how many times things that were ""efficient"" were not good for humanity? Fascism, by all definitions, IS more efficient than democracy, but we all (I'm a leftist, and I will never compromise on human freedom) can agree that this does not make fascism any better or beneficial to humanity. We treat AI like a toy, without single care and limit, going full force to the detriment of humanity as a whole. Oil, that the 1% keeps forcing down our throats even as the world burns.   
  
What is efficient, and what is better for humankind, are two different things. We are animals that evolved to build cages around us: and the worst part, I don't think humanity will stop.   
  
A traumatic event will happen which will simply force humanity to change when it gets too much. There is still time to make things better, but between the death of philosophy as a school of thought, capitalism replacing masculinity for all insecure men, violence becoming shunned as a form of achieving freedom, and all fun xenophobia happening in the world, humanity will sleep as it rots away.  
Much like a middle-aged man with diabetes and alcoholism who won't change until he almost dies, I think humanity won't wake up before it is smacked in the face.   
  
Humanity, in its unwillingness to move away from capitalism as a transitional step from feudalism to socialism, created its own memetic plague that will be the end of this thing we call civilization. Only radical decisions can solve this radical problem, but we de-clawed and de-toothed ourselves for nothing of value."

\- murdered my family in front of me

Don't get me wrong, my heart and money goes out to victims of bad things, such as sexual abuse charities, but the reason I am saying this is because I do think its **factually true**. A good comparison I could draw is the fact that people were arrogant in the past for not believing the fact that the earth was not flat, and shaming for questioning it immensely. It may have hurt their ego, or was painful that their religion was incorrect (here, I am not implying rape is as painful as this, its x50000 less painful, but it definitely disappointed people), but factuality does not care about your irrational emotions.  
  
To make sure I will forever forgive anyone, because I truly, wholeheartedly believe in it being factual, regardless what happens ever, I read everyday as one of my affirmation x5 ""**I am glad** I can forgive anyone **regardless what happens ever** (**e.g.: someone torturing me alive**)""  
  
Some people may say: ""mUh, you are just coping that there are evil people"", to which I would say its actually the other way around. **Don't worry, if someone explains me how I am fundamentally wrong, I won't care and won't forgive and accept my unfortunate arrogance**, but what I do think like that these kind of people a**re the ones who cope in reality, as they cannot accept the lack of agency over their actions:  Which one do you think is worse???**

They would rather despise me, telling me that I am just trying to ""look morally superior"" and whatever, which is not true, and to demonstrate that, I know myself better than you people, I am very introspective!**  
  
**Whereas the belief of free will does give people comfort and feeling of control!**  
  
Finally, some people may say ""**but what about people who actually went through tremendous pain, you never did, you ""morally posturing"" c\*nt**, its easy for you to talk!"", which is **100% factually true, I won't disagree**. What I would do there is not tell them that they should forgive when they are at their most vulnerable, **that is disgusting, and that would be the genuine ""looking/acting morally superior"", factually reprehensible**. **I would wait for them to heal from the immense wound, emotional or physical, and then tell them when they are ready to hear it!** "

I recognise that women face issues in these places, and that women outside of these places usually have it worse than men. 

Why do I think men have it worse than women in the West? Well, men and boys lag behind in universities and colleges (I think men make up less than 40% of people with higher degrees), make up most of the homeless population (around 3 in 4), are much more likely to die by suicide, are less likely to get custody of the child after the divorce, get 60% longer prison sentences than women for the same crime, are more likely to die at work, are more likely to be alone, are more likely to not seek or get mental health treatment, are much less likely to get help as a victim of domestic violence, are much more likely to go to war and die (many if not most countries have a compulsory draft for men, but not for women). 

In media and politics, we hear about women's issues, films and TV shows show strong independent women standing up for themselves. Meanwhile, men are painted as perpetrators, as weak and incompetent, and told we're responsible for a patriarchy that oppresses women. Boys as young as 12 have been told in classrooms to apologise to the female pupils for being male (this happened in Australia). What does this do to boys and young men? Will they learn to cower, to a√∏ologise for their existence, or perhaps they'll grow up to resent the society that taught them to feel guilt for something they had no control over? 

In dating, men often hear that we have to make the first move, but we can't be creepy. A compliment can turn into harassment. We're told that consent is key, but only as defined by women. When a drunk guy and a drunk girl *both* decide to sleep with each other, the guy risks being labeled a rapist for taking advantage of a poor drunk girl, but the girl never gets such accusations hurled at her for taking advantage of a poor drunk guy. Why is that? Amy Schumer joked about ""having sex"" with a guy who was so drunk he barely knew where he was, let alone was able to get hard. Nobody cancelled her for that. Then there are stories of women ""taking away"" consent that had been given, *after* doing the deed, ruining a man's reputation in the process. I believe Aziz Ansari is such a man. 

I've seen studies that claim most men 30 or younger are single (around 63%), and nearly one in three men are sexless (28%). Who's there for these men? Who do they talk to? Many men don't have friends to talk to. Many men are invisible in society and are made to feel that their feelings and problems are a burden on others, so they don't open up. Not only that, but when they do open up, sometimes their vulnerablities get used against them in the next argument or they suffer a break-up or divorce over it.

1,2023-07-05,CMV: We do not have scientific evidence for most (90+%) of our beliefs.,u/Annual_Ad_1536,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14rbfrg/cmv_we_do_not_have_scientific_evidence_for_most/,changemyview,"A lot of atheists are ""evidentialists"", they wrongly think that beliefs need to be justified by other beliefs that are already justified by appropriate evidence (e.g. known scientific beliefs). 

This is incorrect. To prove this, try asking yourself what the evidence is for the existence of evidence. That is, what is it about the earth's rock strata in the Grand Canyon, that make that strata evidence for an older earth, as opposed to my Diet Coke, which is not relevant to a conversation about an older earth in the same way? 

Or, what is it about the DNA samples in a criminal trial that makes it admissible in that trial, as opposed to the coffee that the judge is drinking before that trial?

What causes this to happen is the psychological properties of the beliefs that the DNA samples cause. Because the belief in the DNA samples coheres highly with your existing beliefs about the facts relevant to the trial, it is both relevant, and evidence, for either the claim that the party didn't do anything or did do something considered criminal.   

The same applies to the DNA in the lab that was used to demonstrate that CRISPR can edit genomes. The coffee in the lab does not form a belief that is evidence that CRISPR work, because the coffee simply isn't relevant to your beliefs about CRISPR. Yet you believe the coffee exists, and very many other things about the coffee.  

For any Belief you have B which is evidence for a claim, you can find various Irrelevant beliefs I1, I2, I3... which together form a much larger set of beliefs than the set of beliefs which are actually evidence.  

Thus most of the things you believe are not evidence at all, let along scientific evidence, for the truth of any claim.

* If your constituents are doing well and have terrific public benefits, same for you. If not... work harder! Collaborate with other members of government to make life for you as cushy as possible. Build something better. 
* Elections are less about one-issue bullshit. It's about trying ideas and executing. If your ideas fail, someone else will likely challenge you for the seat and propose something new. If your ideas work, great! Keep going! 
* That minimum wage, she going up
* The focus for most politicians will be on getting more people jobs. 
* Healthcare would get a meaningful facelift.
* Tax dollars would be used more meaningfully (hopefully efficiently)

SOME CHALLENGES I ALREADY EXPECT:

* **How do you possibly monitor something like this?**
   * In my opinion, we're more than capable of monitoring an individual's total earnings (salary, investments, benefits). We already do it on a scale of 150M+ taxpayers, I'm certain we can keep track of 100,000 or so. I also don't think it would take much more than what we're already doing to get a good estimate of the median income / public health benefits from the territory that an individual governs. 
* **It's not just about earnings and salary, it's about the power of the connections and the influence they have while holding office.**
   * That's true! One of the components of a bill like this can and should include a buffer window after they hold offices to maintain the total earnings cap (open to how long is reasonable or fair). It should also include harsh penalties for accepting any gifts or anything of that nature. Open to suggestions for making this piece as ironclad as possible, but just making it *HARDER* is a huge and important step imo. 
* **Nobody will want these jobs.**
   * I'm not sure this is even a real challenge, but I would disagree with it. Plenty of people earn at this level or less and would jump at the opportunity to genuinely help their communities. How many people out there are doing work for non-profits, helping the needy, or just... like... teaching? Good lord, they need a pay raise.
* **This would never get approved, they're too self-interested**
   * If that's the only, legit challenge to this idea, I see that as a reason to get really loud about it and apply pressure at every level of government to get something like this passed.

OK hit me with it. Tell me why this is dumb and i should feel bad üòÇ"
1,2023-07-05,"cmv: Once an online platform becomes ""big enough"", its users should gain rights",u/mesonofgib,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14rcyyt/cmv_once_an_online_platform_becomes_big_enough/,changemyview,"I feel that, in Western societies, a lot of damage is being done by the fact that a large portion of our public discourse is taking place on platforms run by private companies. The problem is that companies can--and are even expected to--moderate the words of others.

In UK, they have the concept of the 'right to roam', where in some cases the public has the right to access land _even though it is privately owned_ (although some activities are excluded from this right). Land that has been judged to be of public importance becomes ""access land"" and no one, not even the owner, can stop you from accessing it.

I feel that we need something like this for online spaces; when something like Twitter becomes big enough and socially significant enough someone can bring a case to court to establish that it is now ""public access"", and _the law_ describes what is and isn't allowed on it (on online platforms in general). As long as you're not breaking the law, you can't be kicked off.

Many people refer to Twitter as the ""online public square"", but it's not. It's a private company, and their rules are all that matters. I do feel, however, that there _should be_ an online public square (or maybe many of them) where citizens are protected by law, not by the vagaries of a company's sporadically-applied content policies.

For what it's worth, I think that a method of moderation on ""public access"" platforms that is consistent with the above worldview is that there shouldn't be a Great Filter on Twitter that defines _everywhere_ what speech is allowed and what is not, but instead each user should get their own filter controlling what they see. If you don't want to see a particular type of content because you find it offensive then you can go into your settings and tell it to filter that out. You should also have control over what people say against something that you own, such as in reply to your Tweet or as a comment on your page; but no one (except the law) should be able to control what is said elsewhere on the platform."

705,2023-07-05,CMV: Students are Not Qualified to Take out Student Loans,u/BJPark,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14remru/cmv_students_are_not_qualified_to_take_out/,changemyview,"I think that expecting students to take on life-changing, non-bankruptable debt, after careful consideration of the pros and cons is stupid.

And let me be clear - it's not just students. *Most* adults - **including those well into their 60s** \- are terrible when thinking about money. I personally know older adults who have no concept of the time value of money, inflation, or discounted cash flows - all of which are critical when evaluating whether or not taking on debt is a good idea. Asking an 18-year old to rationally put a value on their college education is hilariously ignorant of human nature.

It's all very well to say ""We have to treat 18-year olds as adults"", but this ignores the fact that it's not just about 18-year olds. *The vast majority of the population* is not qualified to make this decision.

No regular 18-year old is able to resist the pressure of a lifetime of their parents, teachers, friends and instructors telling them that they need to go to college at any cost. It's *impossible* to expect students to resist peer pressure when all their friends are going to college. *It is not reasonable* to expect the average college-aged person to have the emotional maturity to reject a lifetime of conditioning and make the decision to not take a student loan.

*That's not how human beings work*.

*We should not make being irresponsible easy. ESPECIALLY with government help.* If people want to be irresponsible, it should still be possible, but they should need to go out of their way for it. It should NOT be a default option.

And to make matters worse, **these loans are not easily dischargeable in bankruptcy like other loans**. If a lender is stupid enough to lend hundreds of thousands of dollars to someone with no collateral and no history or payment, *that is the lender's fault*. If making student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy means that lending standards will be stricter, and that interest rates will be higher, than so be it. This will reduce the demand for loans, reduce the demand from college, and reduce the price of college.

To hammer home the point, **this isn't just about students**. Millions of adults are culturally browbeaten into being financially irresponsible, and taking out mortgages when sometimes, *renting is the cheaper option (especially when 30-year government bonds are yielding good rates)*. But asking these people to resist generations of indoctrination is unrealistic.

We human beings almost always will take the path laid out for us by society and the government. Asking the average person to do their due diligence in the face of opposition from their friends and family is dumb. *They will not do it*.

Fine, we can't do anything about society or friends. But we *can* do something about the government. The government should NOT be in the business of loaning money. And while we're at it, the government should NOT be in the business of guaranteeing mortgages either, or giving mortgage payments tax deductions, or even exemptions from capital gains for primary residences. Because when the government does something, it becomes normal, *and people lose their ability to do their own due diligence*.

I don't blame people. Human nature is what it is, and there's no point sermonizing or moralizing.

I was lucky enough to come from a family that hated debt, so I have never even had a credit card or a mortgage. But **I can't take credit (pardon the pun) for that**. In my own way, I too was just following the path laid down for me. It just so happens that I was insulated from these influences."

Growing up, I was taught to NEVER look at any information relating to spirituality/religion aside from what was church approved. However, as someone with a passion for learning, I started to notice some issues with this. I've had questions about the church's history that I've ""put on a shelf"" over time because I was told I would understand it later, and if not, it would all make sense in the next life. 

It wasn't until I started teaching an English rhetoric class (essentially learning how to identify and distinguish effective arguments from fallacious thinking) that I realized that a lot of why I live the way I do is not logical at all, but rather due to faulty logic. This logic made sense to me as an impressionably child, but with my critical thinking cap on, I don't agree with this logic. Since then, I've been exploring outside sources and am SHOCKED by so much of the information (from reliable academic sources) I've encountered.

I've been learning about the BITE model (""The BITE Model of Authoritarian Control"" -  associated with cults). [https://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/](https://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/) It talks about: behavior control, information control, thought control, and emotional control. There are many things under each category that I've experienced (but fortunately not all of them, and you do not need to have all of them in order to label something as a cult). 

While I am pretty sure that I grew up in a cult/cult-like environment to some degree, I can't help but wonder if it's even possible to have organized religion without it being a cult at the same time, and maybe it's not a good or a bad thing, it just is.

1,2023-07-05,CMV: it sucks being an Indian/South Asian girl,u/Icy-Pop-8163,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14rme5w/cmv_it_sucks_being_an_indiansouth_asian_girl/,changemyview,"I‚Äôm sharing my opinion as one. I‚Äôm technically not Indian but for all practical purposes I tell everyone I am. 

Being an Indian girl sucks ass in so many ways. Now this is no hate to the other Indian or brown girls as I believe many carry themselves well and are smart, independent, and pretty. However, this is just me speaking in general and from my personal experiences. 

First of all appearance wise, no race likes us. I feel as if we are on the bottom of the barrel for male dating preferences. Men of every race always prefer white girls and it‚Äôs a fact. Asian (I mean east) girls are also high on the list because of their feminine features. Latina girls are also preferred by men because of their looks and physique. Although many people say black girls are least preferred (which I think shouldn‚Äôt be true because there are many decent/pretty looking ones) I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true and many men also view them as as attractive for their structure and personality. Being a brown girl means you always get hair on your face, arms and legs. Your skin is dark and your hair isn‚Äôt straight or thin and it‚Äôs hard to maintain. Your features are disproportional and your metabolism is shitty. Guys never approach you and I‚Äôve noticed whenever a good looking guy for a different race approaches a brown girl people always comment negatively. Also, being an Indian girl means you have to date within your race and most likely you would have strict parents. This means you are limited to brown guys unless if you want your parents to disown you. As far as brown guys go, most prefer white girls and only date Indians for their parents approval. Brown guys/South Asian guys don‚Äôt find me attractive and have called me fat, ugly, and dumb many times in the past. 

As far as social life goes brown parents are so strict you aren‚Äôt allowed to do anything. That means no hanging out with anyone, partying, having a bf (unless you want 20 questions), smoking, drinking, tattoos, wearing what you want, etc. Other races are more chill but brown parents just want their kids to live a conservative and restrictive life. This makes it even harder to do things and put yourself out there. It‚Äôs just always studying and nothing else. 

Education and work wise colleges and companies are resistant to hire or admit us. Affirmative action doesn‚Äôt work on brown people boy or girl. To get into a decent school you need at least top 10% or 1400+ SAT to have a chance while the other races don‚Äôt have it as difficult. Work wise, it helps being a woman but it doesn‚Äôt help being a BROWN woman. You don‚Äôt get any preference while white, black, or Hispanic women are easily hired for tougher positions. It‚Äôs like they almost consider us as guys. 

Racism wise no race likes us. White people view us as foreigners and black people
discredit us. We are ignored by the other races. Even East Asians get more respect from white people because they mix with them and respect their food and culture. The lighter the skin is the less racism a brown person faces. Also the culture is way different from all the other religions in the world so no one can relate even by beliefs. It‚Äôs almost like other races can‚Äôt find a common ground because there‚Äôs no relation with Abrahamic religions. It‚Äôs almost like we are foreigners or aliens. There‚Äôs no racial category for us. We‚Äôre just meshed into the ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù category which is generic and indicates we are the same race as Chinese or Japanese people which isn‚Äôt true. 

I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt true for everyone. I‚Äôm just speaking from my personal experiences and what I have noticed. This is just my view and what I think."

My main argument would be that there are certain hard lines that we are taught from a very young age to not cross under any circumstances, and 99% of the time it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to realize why doing these things would be stupid in the first place.

In every decent community we are taught from a super young age that if an adult tries to put our hands on us in any way that that is a hard line to never cross under any circumstances. Not only that, but once children hit the teenage years, not only does every authoritative figure in their life tell them to not fuck around with adults but there‚Äôs HUGE societal pressure from peers at that age regarding age gaps as well, hell I remember 8th graders getting shamed for dating 7th graders. 

Scamming can be a bit more elaborate but there are hard lines like ‚Äúnever give out your social security number‚Äù and ‚Äúnever give out your bank info‚Äù that would only be crossed if you either grew up in a culture/household with poor education that didn‚Äôt teach you those things, or you‚Äôre an idiot.

Obviously this is seen as an insensitive and offensive opinion to have so here I am willing to change it, but currently whenever I here a story about how somebody got fucked over in ways xyz they usually crossed some sort of hard line that I would never dare cross in my life, like someone getting robbed because they went into a sketchy looking car at 2 am, that‚Äôs another example of a hard line I would never cross and I just don‚Äôt understand how people would end up in those types of situations, basically there are just certain things that absolutely no amount of convincing or persuading will convince me to do because they‚Äôre hard lines we are taught usually from a really young age, so when someone crosses them I either think they were raised in a way that never taught them those hard lines or they‚Äôre just flat out stupid.

7,2023-07-05,CMV: The only people who deserve tips are people who actually give you a service worth a tip.,u/Howre-Ya-Now,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14rthtg/cmv_the_only_people_who_deserve_tips_are_people/,changemyview,"In my opinion, people don't deserve tips for doing the absolute bare minimum. As an example, bud tenders at dispensaries. If all they have to do is walk 3 feet to the left and grab a joint, there's zero reason for me to tip them. They didn't give me a service, they grabbed an item and handed it to me. That's it. If I come in with a bunch of questions and have to rely on their knowledge and experience, I'll tip them for their time. But if I walk in and know exactly what I want and they just grab it and ring it up, they deserve nothing but their wages.

  
Imagine this:

  
You have 1 bud tender and 2 customers.

  
1 customer buys a $10 bong, the bud tender walks 3 steps to get it, then takes 30 seconds ringing it up

  
Another customer buys a $1,000 bong, the bud tender walks the same 3 steps to get it, then takes 30 seconds ringing it in.

  
Why does one of those deserve $200 and another deserve $2? It makes absolutely zero sense.

  
The idea that customers have been tricked into thinking it's on them to subsidize wages is insane. It's literally the exact same thing as billionaires putting the blame of climate change on the average person despite emitting a thousand times more.

  
Nothing will ever change in tipping culture if people continue to tip. And guess what? It's working! I've started seeing shops all over social media beginning to put signs out telling people they no longer accept tips because they've raised wages for their workers.

&#x200B;

But somehow it's my burden to make sure these people have livable wages despite the absolute bare minimum of service and if I don't tip I'm an asshole.

  
Companies literally put in the job description that you can make tips, like it's some kind of special bonus. The company doesn't want to pay it's employees more, so it rephrases it in a way that sounds like tips are a bonus, just because the company doesn't want to pay the wages themselves and knows they can rely on customers to make up the difference. If you can't afford to pay your employees a livable wage, you don't deserve to have that business.

  
It's an antiquated, insane way of approaching things.

  
If you go above and beyond to make sure I had a memorable experience, I'll tip the shit out of you.  
If all you do is walk 3 feet and ring in a joint, why the fuck would you deserve to be rewarded for that?

  
TL;DR I don't think people should be given tips unless they earn it and force employers to stop relying on customers to subsidize wages."
2,2023-07-05,cmv: tinder is exploitive of both sexes but men have convinced themselves it‚Äôs not just a pay for play sex service and women haven‚Äôt caught on that it‚Äôs men looking for sex in exchange for nothing,u/interitus_nox,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14rtr8h/cmv_tinder_is_exploitive_of_both_sexes_but_men/,changemyview,"why are men still surprised that tinder has completely turned into a prostitution ring? i‚Äôm not knocking sex workers because who cares but how is tinder/online dating apps still a thing in 2023? it‚Äôs never been comfortable to go on blind dates but tinder has convinced entire generations that this is the only way to meet new/potential partners.

not to be captain obvious here, but, since there‚Äôs just endless stream online of posts in virtually every sub dealing with ANY human relationships or interactions (not just sex or romance but literally anything that has to do with interacting with other people) still getting filled with one tinder post after another about: OF women, cammer girls, live streamers, IG wannabe models, scammers tryna get paid just to meetup or literally blatant (pay x for y sex service) sex workers that do men not get it? Tinder has been and always was a pay for play platform. It‚Äôs the girls night of online dating. Women were initially lured in to the app at the chance of free drinks and maybe a chance at a relationship with what should be normal guys. This allowed whoever owns tinder to exploit these women as free bait to get the real chumps they‚Äôre after, men. Men who were the real mark of this scheme were there to pay extra for the premium accounts to have limitless swipes. The stage was set and even though Tinder almost immediately became unusable for people uninterested in selling or buying sex it‚Äôs still the dominant resource for young people looking to date. The whole thing is a scam against men to pay for access to women who they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt be able to meet. It‚Äôs a scam against women to be used as window items to lure in outrageously gullible men. The platform is 80/20 male to female ratio. Tinder itself imo has been the lynchpin of all this incel violence against women. These types of men can‚Äôt see what the app is designed for and therefore have concluded that women are whores but like just not for them because you know the whole ugly broke insufferable personality thing. 

anyway Skip forward years later and nobody but creeps or sex workers are using tinder with apparently a parade of utterly gullible men who think this is a way to get sex in exchange for a drink at a bar or nothing at all then rage at the world that women are the problem. Women aren‚Äôt the problem. Dumb mother fuckers who don‚Äôt understand they‚Äôre being used by a corporation think Tinder is the end all be all of their interactions with women.

I extended my trip and fell in love with the country.  I don‚Äôt mean the government at all, I just mean the people there and the beautiful geography.  We had 8 IDF soldiers traveling with us, and it put a lot of things into perspective hearing what they go through in a daily basis and how they grew up.  Only 3 were combat soldiers, others were computer scientists, graphic designers, or engineers.  

We had a very hipster guide who wanted to give us the Palestinian perspective too (he was American, moved to Israel).  He had friends of his talk to us about what it was like, being kicked off their land, seeing people die everywhere.

The Israeli soldiers also told us that they had strict training to not kill people, even if others are shooting at them, unless it is absolutely necessary.  They contrasted it with the US army and how when they come to the Middle East and just shoot everyone who‚Äôs not white out of fear and do disgusting war crimes.  

We learned that Israel was a gift after the holocaust, which resonates with me and makes me support it in theory.  The USA massacred native Americans and populated it entirely of white people.  That isn‚Äôt justifying anything at all, but the state is so new.  They explained that what happens there is really messed up, but the media only shows the owls time side to enforce anti-semitism.  The so much of the Middle East has absolutely disgusting war crimes and terrorism daily but it isn‚Äôt shown on the media unless Jews are involved. They said that the government tried social programs but that wasn‚Äôt recorded.  They also said that attacks are just retaliation.  They have bombings every week, all the time.  It seems as if people are targeting them for being being Jewish, they retaliate harder, and that is what‚Äôs recorded.  Anyways I do notice anti semitism becoming more normal, both in severity and tolerance of it.  Ideally the state should give up the West Bank, but the American government can ideally do a lot of stuff too that we aren‚Äôt focused on.

Anyways.  I am open minded.  I am not by any means a conservative.
I know there is more to it and my education on the matter is funded by the Israeli government."

Work is never going to be fun, it's work, that's why you get paid to do it. 

I worked my ass off to get an engineering degree, land a cushy office job with nice pay, which is basically better than 95% of humans have had in world history.

Having to be around the same people every day in the same office, having to be fake and act professional, it's miserable.

Trying to get fulfillment and meaning to your life through your career is completely futile, especially if your life goal is just to climb the corporate ladder and become an executive or something. The rat race is such BS. It's kind of sad that Western culture really seems to encourage a lot of people into climbing some corporate ladder just so you can buy nice things and impress your peers.

If your kid is like 14 or 15, at that age where they are beginning to form their views and opinions, and it happens that they see the world different than you and have political views that are 180 degrees different and would vote in a different way than you, how would this make you feel as a parent, and would you feel like you had a responsibility to change their minds?

In my view, if they are 14-18, this is when they are developing critical thinking, and they should be starting to understand the world and socioeconomic ideas at least on a basic level

IF by using critical thinking and their own way of logic and reasoning and they end up with a different view, I think that is ok. 

I think its quite damaging to tell ur kid, especially when they are 14-18 which is a volatile time ""your subjective view is wrong because it doesnt match mine"", you are eliminating their ability to think for themselves and making them dependent on you. instead of making their own decisions later in life, their default will be ""what would mom and dad do""?

There is absolutely no way to morally defend meat consumption in my view. I watched and read endless discussions and it usually comes down to ‚Äûit‚Äôs ok because it‚Äôs always been like that, it‚Äôs part of us etc.‚Äú

Most people (and I include myself) are totally disconnected from what it actually means to eat a piece of meat or even animal products in general, at least in western culture. How much suffering is caused by it. Meat is tasty so people ignore that and come up with all kinds of excuses.

* The Supreme Court (SC)
* The Presidential Office
* Congress/Senate

And all of them are flawed in different ways.

For example, with the SC, justices are appointed for life and who is appointed at any given time is dependent on who is the current president. This would be fine if this wasn't political, but it's pretty clear that the justices simply decide cases on political beliefs as opposed to actual facts. Only one justice currently seems to give any thought beyond political beliefs. 

Furthermore, a justice has recently been found of taking bribes essentially, which should've truly triggered some sort of action, but didn't because of the complex impeachment process. It requires a simple majority in Congress and then a 2/3 majority in the Senate.

Now to go to further problems with this. The Senate is practically a useless house, but above that it's completely unfair because its principle isn't ""1 person, 1 vote."" The states aren't different anymore, they're a country and don't all deserve an equal say because they're a ""state."" They deserve the power their population actually has.  However, this flawed system means that either political side can essentially block impeachment due to how the Senate works. 

Next we can go to Congress. Gerrymandered districts create serious unfairness in Congress, due to purposeful but also natural gerrymandering. (natural referring to how democrats are concentrated in certain locations making bipartisan maps gerrymandered, too) Both political parties do it, although it does benefit Republicans that bit more.

Finally the Presidential Office. Well despite Democrats winning the popular vote every time this century (Excluding a candidate who lost his original popular vote), they have only spent half of this century in that office. 

So, in other words, every branch of the U.S. political system is seemingly flawed.

I feel that those two can be combined together in sentencing to help improve justice systems.

To give an example of how this can work, during sentencing, the judge or the jury will review a criminal's background and motive for a crime before deciding to either impose a sentence that is either retributive (chopping off an arm, fine or jailing for theft) or restorative (counselling/rehab for theft).

While I'm against this legislation for many reasons (such as the fact that it is being used explicitly to prevent abortion legislation), the idea that an amendment requiring 60% of the vote could pass with 50.1% of the vote seems extra absurd.

But why do we particularly condemn landlords increasing prices on their assets and not other businesses increasing prices to be in line with the market? The problem is the system of capitalism that incentivises profit, not the individual landlords themselves who are just acting logically. They have a business that they are trying to make money from just like any other. If prices across the board are going up, then of course landlords would be stupid not to increase their prices to be in line with that. Why do we expect them to be altruistic and not supermarkets or other businesses?

If we wanted to change this practice it would have to be at a governmental/policy/law level. We would have to choose as a country to disincentivise being a landlord. Otherwise of course standard supply and demand price increases will occur. If they increased it too high then they wouldn't get tenants.

I think they have a major ego for this and can‚Äôt accept that it‚Äôs called oral sex, you‚Äôre still being intimate with a person, you‚Äôre still laying with someone, you‚Äôre still cheating if you‚Äôre in a relationship, you‚Äôre still having sex. There are many forms of intimacy, sex is just one of them, and depending on the person they will see it as cheating if you flirt with others, intellectualize with others, be emotional with others. And I agree with that sentiment, because if you have a partner and you talk to everyone else but them, then you really are cheating because it affects your relationship, and you don‚Äôt have the need to talk anymore because you‚Äôve been doing it all day.

I don't know how long Reddit has been doing this (I myself have been here for 9 years), but I have noticed a trend of people self-censoring their own words out of the (misguided) idea that prevents the possible triggering of individuals who may have experienced trauma.

I am a licensed psychotherapist. Best practice obligates us to not shy away from discussing suicide, sex, or other topics that may be triggering. If we suspect a client is considering suicide, we ask directly: ""Have you thought about killing yourself?"" If we see a client become visibly uncomfortable when the subject of sex comes up, good therapists bring it into the room: ""You appear to me to be visibly uncomfortable when sex comes up. Does discussing it make you uncomfortable?""

By censoring words like ""suicide,"" ""rape,"" and ""sex,"" we are treating them like curse words and perpetuating the negavity attached to them. Using them freely and uncensored can go a long way in destigmatizing these subjects and helping traumatized individuals process their thoughts and feelings around them.

One could argue that Reddit is not a therapy office and the processing of trauma should be done there, not here. Even so, I still believe that destigmatizing these subjects can only help. Regardless, I am open to changing my view on all this if a reasonable counterargument is supplied. Thank you."

For example the Romans enslaved everyone regardless of race and ethnicity. In Ancient Greece you had greek slaves, in Rome you had Germanic slaves, Briton slaves, Greek slaves, middle eastern slaves. under Alexander the Great there was greek slaves, germanic, middle easter, and African slaves.

I personally want to side with ""Side A"" because the act of affirming the LGBTQ+ community is the right thing to do. However, I cannot find anything in the Bible to defend consenting same-sex relationships. All I can find are the collber passages that suggest that ""Homosexuality is incompatible with scripture"". That any attempts to reconcile the two are foolish.

I want to believe that being gay is not a sin and that I can use Scripture to defend my view. But I do not know how, so I come here to figure out how to do so with critique."

Also, I don't get their obsession with guns, I've never understood how they can have so many shootings, and I get that it's a massive country, but compared to the entirety of Europe it's still insane. The thing is, there are countries in Europe and elsewhere that have way more things that I dislike about them, hell, even my own country sucks, everyone here is depressed, hates themselves and hates eachother and we still suffer from Russian influence, but for some reason America just makes me want to make fun of it and hate it way more."

Most people wouldn't consider dating with someone who is completely not in their ""type"" physically wise even if they have a perfect matching character. 

People claim they deeply love their partners (bae and stuff) but the reality is they wouldn't be interested in building a deeper connection with them if the latters didn't have those ""assets"" (or rather a key asset) that sometimes (if not most of the times) are the matter of the genetics lottery. If Y loves X to the death but wouldn't if X was e.g. totally physically unattractive to Y in the first place (so they wouldn't start dating) then I consider it fake. I get it's all biology and stuff but I can't resist the feeling it's all fake and we're just bunch of hypocrites. 

Imo no love is totally unconditional but relationship love very differs from the love you hold e.g. for your cat or dog when you don't really care if it's this or that, you love it just because it's there and can be a comrade to you. I'm not talking about a situation when the dog attacks you/bites you and you hold a grudge etc. but rather the premise of love in the first place. Same goes for parental love.

Imo this post is chaotic but I hope you get what I mean. Would love to hear your opinion in the topic."

courting adult women seems so freaking difficult. Teen girls seem to not care about things like money and a guys career since they‚Äôre still so young.

It is bad because animals can not give informed consent, specifically to another species as they cannot effectively communicate such complicated ideas and concepts. 

If animals could give informed consent, interspecies coitus would not be immoral as long as it wouldn‚Äôt harm either party mentally or physically.

There are many diseases that can be passed between species through sex, and certain species can not mate with others without injury, but if both of these methods of harm brought about by interspecies sex were not possible, and species could give confirmed consent to others, and it could be understood, I don‚Äôt see why interspecies sex would be harmful to either party.

I understand this view is controversial and I will no doubt be receiving accusations of being an animal abuser and zoophile. So, for the record, I have never had any sexual relations of any kind with any animal other than a human, and I have no desire to. 

I just want to open a discourse on this topic because I see a lot of discussion on furries and how it is reprehensible to be sexually attracted to animals and animal sexual organs, even if those animals are anthropomorphized physically or mentally."

With social media era, I'm seeing more and more videos of men proposing to women. And although of course it is a happy moment and also something that I still want someday (marriage), I'm starting to find the act of proposing and the women's reaction quite cringey.  
  
I feel like we live in such a patriarchal society that the act of a man ""choosing"" to spend the rest of their lives with you is something you'd be super ""suprised"" over and crying and getting all emotinal makes me wonder how much us women spend our lives waiting for this day to come whereas men hold that, so to speak, power. I mean, if you're in a relationship with someone, let's say 3, 5, 7 years and it's a healthy one, why is it such an emotional thing to get married? I can't seem to understand this concept anymore.  
  
Also the fact that women proposing to men is usually frowned upon and lots of people will comment on how a woman is forcing a man to settle whereas the other way around it's considered beautiful?

This word needs no introduction, but it is basically telling men to grow some balls and quit obsessing over women. The origin of this word is deeply intertwined with the incel community. Wikipedia says ""A definition of simp appeared on Urban Dictionary in 2005,\[3\] and the word continued to be used by rappers into the 2010s, when it was adopted by members of manosphere,\[1\] incel,\[5\] and MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) forums\[12\] alongside similar derogatory terms such as cuck, beta, and white knight.\[5\]\[12\]"" 

Then other memes, like the ""Virgin vs Chad"" meme are also very popular, and terms such as ""chad"" and ""alpha male"" that originated in incel communities are also used more and more especially among young people. I know that it's a joke, but I still feel like it is normalizing the content produced by the incel community and the views of other manosphere idiots. 

Paradoxically, many people in my high school also seem to view being a virgin as a bad thing and it seems like everyone is talking about sex and being in relationships. And I feel like something needs to be done about this relentless mocking of virgins. Let's face the facts, some men are just less attractive and can't get a date. I learned this the hard way by trying to date and being ugly. The men who get left behind are told that it is their problem for being ""virgins"". Also, some men might not even want sex as much as others. There are more and more single men in younger generations, and we have to stop embracing incel culture. In other words, society is telling single men that it is bad to be single, and that you can't have a life as a single person, and parading around hateful ideology that causes people to become incels. 

I must be missing something. But it really seems like incel culture is increasing and precious little is being done about it. I myself am a virgin and I'm trying to accept reality and have a good life without those same intimate connections, and I have fallen victim to incel ideology in the past, taking out my problems on feminism and women. If we as a society keep treating unattractive men like inadequate beta males and using memes from incel culture, we could be creating a monster."

https://www.npr.org/2023/06/30/1182121291/colorado-supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-decision

>Writing for the conservative majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch drew a distinction between discrimination based on a person's status--her gender, race, and other classifications--and discrimination based on her message.

>""If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation,"" he said, ""it is that the government may not interfere with an 'uninhibited marketplace of ideas.'"" When a state law collides with the Constitution, he added, the Constitution must prevail.

>The decision was limited because much of what might have been contested about the facts of the case was stipulated--namely that Smith intends to work with couples to produce a customized story for their websites, using her words and original artwork. Given those facts, Gorsuch said, Smith qualifies for constitutional protection.

>He acknowledged that Friday's decision may result in ""misguided, even hurtful"" messages. But, he said, ""the Nation's answer is tolerance, not coercion. The First Amendment envisions the United States as a rich and complex place where all persons are free to think and speak as they wish, not as the government demands.""

As Justice Brown indicated in a hypothetical during oral arguments that if this case is decided for Smith there's nothing substantial stopping a business who meets a ""customized expression"" criterion from discriminating against any protected class. From the dissenting justices:

>""Time and again businesses and other commercial entities have claimed a constitutional right to discriminate and time and again this court has courageously stood up to those claims. Until today. Today, this court shrinks.

>""The lesson of the history of public accommodations laws is ... that in a free and democratic society, there can be no social castes. ... For the 'promise of freedom' is an empty one if the Government is 'powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of [one person] will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a[nother].'""

I of course believe that the dissenting justices are right. Utilizing the same logic as Smith a person who meets the ""custom product"" and ""expression"" criteria (which are woefully easy to satisfy, Smith designs *web pages* for example) could discriminate against any protected class - race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, or gender identity), national origin, age (40 or older), disability and genetic information (including family medical history). 

I believe the 14th Amendment (and indeed most anti-discrimination law) has been gutted by this decision. Give me some hope that bigots don't now have carte blanche to discriminate in America provided they jump through a couple hoops in order to do so."

I feel like my view of feminism has been warped to be more of a character of feminism. I would leave it at that if I didn‚Äôt find people taking these positions Irl. Now I want to be clear I am a feminist a Marxist feminist so I understand my positions are a-bit progressive for the average person and that maybe my disagreements are more indicative that I‚Äôm more progressive then most then an issue with feminist discourse. I‚Äôve outlined positions I hold that I feel like show where the disconnect is but I think explanations of what you think online feminism is working for would also be insightful because again I‚Äôve been talking to conservatives so my view is skewed. 


I don‚Äôt really care about the wage gap, like I care in the sense it exists and it‚Äôs a problem but it‚Äôs not really a primary concern for me. I‚Äôm more interested as solving the issues that lie at the heart of the problem. So I‚Äôm more interested in getting mother (or whoever is taking care of kids) paid for their work. I‚Äôm more interested in why 90% of rape is done by men and how to reduce that percentage. I care little about the women who are wealthy but are paid less then their male counterparts.

I think feminism is equality of the genders and not just female empowerment. So when I look at an issue like why aren‚Äôt women able to get to the same heights as their male counterparts I ask what social norm is creating that and how we dismantle it. So in that example I think men get to go to greater highs because they are expected to be self sufficient they are expected to win all or lose it all (hence why they also have a higher homeless rate). So deconstructing the expectations of men seems like the way forward to help women reach similar heights or at least make a system where no one is left on the streets 

I pity the anti social boys I see. I‚Äôve seen to many boys who are unwilling to open up to express themselves and how they feel or unwilling to participate in activities because of its feminine qualities. Is it because of Toxic masculinity definitely but is it also because feminists have failed to reach these kids and give them the keys to unshackle themselves from their own isolation.

I have no interest in discussions about ‚Äúlook how this is gendered isn‚Äôt that bad‚Äù because if we don‚Äôt address the capitalist incentives for manufacturing gendered products we will always have that same discussion.

I disagree with statements that are ‚ÄúFuck men‚Äù or ‚Äúkill all men‚Äù, even though I used to say them, they make feminism seem hostile to men which it absolutely should not be. 

Finally I‚Äôve been annoyed by so called feminists who frankly know nothing for what the movement stands for. Saying dumb ass things like ‚Äúif men are feminists they can‚Äôt talk, Men only become feminists for sex, or simply can‚Äôt have a conversation that isn‚Äôt whatever some idiot online told them was feminism. I‚Äôm concerned that this isn‚Äôt as fringe as I would hope, and I‚Äôm worried that people with shallow understanding of feminism are hindering discourse.

In conclusion my focus and interest is in the poor and queer women who‚Äôs oppression is magnified by there intersectionality, and interested how feminists thought can help boys feel more confident and be better people.

Are these in line with feminist positions? If not why?"

*‚ÄúWould you ask a man that?‚Äù* Implying that they want to be treated like men.   
Many insist on wearing pants, refusing to wear skirts, as if to imply that wearing clothing associated with femininity is inferior, but wearing clothes associated with masculinity is the ideal. There is nothing wrong with women wearing pants. I‚Äôm specifically referring to those that do it as a social protest.    
Rather than make girl scouts what they want it to be, they would rather infiltrate the other side and try to become ‚ÄúBoyscouts‚Äù. So now BOYscouts had to start admitting girls who wanted to be boyscouts.    
There was a YMCA and a YWCA. Not good enough.  Certain females insisted on going to the YMCA. So they had to open it up to both genders even though there was already a YWCA they could go to.  
When feminism was first coming out, one of the things earlier feminists made a big priority was smoking cigars, drinking hard liquor, swearing, and doing a number of other things that were not good, positive, necessary, or beneficial.  They were just things men were known to do, so that meant they needed to do these things.  Because ‚Äúmen did it.‚Äù   
The ideal for the feminist seems to be being treated like a man, doing things that men do, inhabiting spaces that men inhabit, and basically becoming para-men. 

Other thoughts:  
Just because someone treats a woman differently than a man here or there doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong.  Men and women are different so some things will be different.  What's important is that both sexes are known to be equal in value.  But equal is not identical.  Some differences must necessarily exist.  But modern feminism seems bent on making women identical.  And in my view, we don't need women intentionally dressing like men, trying to talk like men, trying to exist as men in men's spaces, and modifying their natural impulses to model themselves after men.

So far as I can tell, plant-based just means vegan. Why do we need a (particularly dumb) new term for a concept that has been well-established for decades?

""Vegan carries a negative connotation,"" you might claim. I acknowledge that point of view, even if I'm personally ambivalent (for the record I eat a low-meat diet but plenty of dairy and eggs). If you think this justifies re-branding then let's pick a term that isn't so misleading.

When I hear/see ""plant-based,"" I assume that the product either a) contains more than 50% plants by weight or b) doesn't contain any inorganic materials (like salt). See, animals eat plants, so ultimately one could argue that meat is plant-based. And where does dairy fall in all of this? I'd argue that it's clearly plant-based...

That said, I don't have a good alternative, should we insist on sup'plant'ing ""vegan."" How about a term like ""animal-independent?"" Well, bees pollinated your fruit. ""Humane"" sounds pretty good to me but that would probably be interpreted as even more inflammatory than ""vegan"" has become in some contexts.

Disclaimer/bonus rant: I avoid establishments that advertise themselves as being either ""vegan"" or ""plant-based"" but would always be happy with a good old-fashioned ""vegetarian"" spot. Unfortunately, those seem to be nearly non-existent these days. I've been told by friends in the service industry that many vegan restaurants would like to go vegetarian (so they could use honey, eggs, etc.) but expect a backlash (such as review-bombing) from the vegan community. Can't we just respect folks for eating less meat, even if they don't teetotal?"

We should have universal health care. You might be wondering ""Well, why not let the government take control over the entire economy. Surely if they can make a better medical care system they can do the same for food, housing, technology, clothing, etc"" well, again if you think this way, you're a racist. You might think because you use your common sense that you're right, but you're wrong. Because you're not listening to your hearts. You only listen to your brain. Using your brain is rooted in bigotry because back when slaves were around the slave owners actually used math to count their slaves. So they used their brains to control their slaves. So if you want to use your head all the time That actually makes you a racist. 

Politicians are corrupt. But they're still trustworthy and I believe in them.

I hate it when people try to bring facts and logic into a debate. It has NOTHING to do with that. It's about what we think might work and how we feel. Nobody has time for your racist facts. Turn your brain off for once and listen with your heart. The moment you turn your brain off, you'll become a Democrat. If you have it half way turned on, you'll be a Republican and you don't want to be that because they're racist because they disagree with me. If you want to just think with logic, use facts, and make a lot of sense than go join the Libertarian party where your little ""facts"" actually matter. But we don't need that in this country."

Social media should be required to have free speech and prevented from removing hate speech. Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy and social media sites are the modern equivalent of the town square. It‚Äôs where people go to debate the issues of the day. A truly tolerant society has to allow the expression of ideas with which they disagree. Mill argued that the best test of truth was to allow people with different ideas to compete with one another. Truth may not immediately win out in the marketplace, but repeated encounters with a variety of viewpoints encourages people to think critically rather than accepting whatever idea is handed to them. Even flawed or incomplete opinions were valuable, Mill argued, because they could be used to gain a ‚Äúclearer perception and livelier impression of truth.‚Äù"

The problem with this push is that it pretty often, if not always, ignores the 2 different realities of men and women. There's usually very little effort to find middle ground or understand where the other side is coming from for most people.

Simply put, men and women are just build different physically, emotionally, and logically. This isn't to say one is inferior than the other, just that our perception, and by extension our realities, are different.  But the problem is that often we try to convince the other gender to believe our reality without considering theirs.

This ranges from things like dating, personal safety, child rearing, etc. I can't think of a single gender based issue where common ground can't be found just by understanding the other side. You can CMV by giving me at least one."

0,2023-07-06,Cmv: all men are gay,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ssqql/cmv_all_men_are_gay/,changemyview,"(MY MAIN POINT IS THAT MEN ARE EITHER GAY OR BISEXUAL)

I've suspected this for a long time now. Compared to women, which gender is more comfortable with their sexuality? Women. It's guy are ""no that's gay we can't do that"" the rantings of a homophobe is usually signs of being deep in the closet.  I originally posted the following in another subreddit but it closed before it could get any traction, then someone reposted it online where it got a little more attention. Another user suggested I post it here instead which I thought was a good idea.

So here is my reason:

A little bit about myself:

‚Ä¢ I am a 23 year old female. Short/Petite frame. Fairly attractive. Femininity is average I guess.

‚Ä¢ I'm attracted to masculine men.. (ex. Idris Elba, Michael Fassbender, Mark Wahlberg etc) just for reference..

‚Ä¢ I live in the midwest ~

My story:

I have dated 3 men in my life and believe it or not, they each turned out to be gay.

This is getting not only tiresome for me, but it's also beginning to make me extremely angry, to the point where I am beginning to deeply resent gay men. And also fear all men in general for the simple fact that I think they are all secretly gay.

I search in google ""I am a girl. Why do I attract closeted gay men"" and 99% of the results are along the lines of: ""I am attracted to men. Should I leave my wife?"" Or ""sex with married men as a gay man"" or ""I've built a life with a woman but I'm gay""... What the fuck.

I am so angry because honestly, I see the chemistry between men. They understand each other in a way that women cannot (and the same goes for women yet for whatever reason, most women still hate each other...)

I used to watch a ton of gay porn (strictly research purposes) and saw all over amateur gay sex videos most of them were titled ""pegging or getting pegged by my not so straight friend"" or ""his girlfriend caught us"" and a lot of ""he fucks me while his gf is away"" .  And they were all homemade...

Men just respect each other on a whole other level. In all the gay movies and gay couples I meet in real life, the bonds they create are so strong and promising. And when a guy is gay, it's like there is absolutely no chance at him ever being attracted to a woman. Yet the same.. ""Stigma"" does not apply so much to a lesbian woman, who is much more likely to end up leaving the girl for a man.. It's like men really do have each other's backs. Their bonds are seemingly unbreakable and at this point I just think to myself..yeah, why would a man ever want a woman when a man could give him everything he needs sexually AND emotionally? Yikes...

And another thing: my ""gaydar"" is A-1 at this point. It's kinda always been. It's like every where I go I see gay men. I catch onto their body language and see how they change when they speak to other men. There's this strong connection between them like no other. It is TERRIBLY obvious to me when a man is gay. Whether he be top, bottom, switch, bear, IRON CLOSET etc...

At first I thought I was just insane/paranoid, but after busting the last guy I was with, my closest (first) cousin, a couple of my uncles, and even a guy one of my girlfriends was with, I realized no.. I'm not so insane after all. And to top it off, I reached out to one of my high school crushes last week after coming across his number in my phone. He had a big crush on me too back then but he was so shy for a variety of reasons. Well, come to find out that he is gay, and I had already braced myself for this because of my aforementioned experiences.

Needless to say that a vast majority of my other high school crushes are now gay. It's as if EVERY single guy I talk to ends up being gay. When I was searching for a community to post this in, nearly every other post I saw in each community was a gay confession, many which involved losing interest in a girlfriend. (ps if you don't believe me, I screenshotted a few)

All of the girls I know always come to me when they suspect a guy is gay because they say it's what I'm best at.. Wow. How's that for talent.

This is the shit that makes me think..were men EVER attracted to women at any given point in time? And how the hell could you date/marry someone you KNOW you don't like, then turn around and still do gay shit behind her back, hurting her in the process. I swear a lot of them just do it for the thrill of having a ""secret life""...  But some say it's because he is afraid of how society will react to him.. but at that point, he is no longer the victim because he deliberately dragged somebody else into his life and deceived them. And also, that doesn't apply anymore for the simple fact that the whole world is becoming significantly more liberal each day. You say anything against gays today and you get bashed by every soul in the vicinity...

I have no idea the meaning of why this is happening to me. I am so fucking confused and nonetheless scared. And pissed. I've never felt so undesirable in my life. I just feel like whatever man I choose will eventually come out as gay. It feels like a curse. And I am so terrified to date now because of this"
0,2023-07-06,CMV: Guys who have a double standard about body count per Andrew T*ate cannot be good husbands,u/Big-Text-4930,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ssto9/cmv_guys_who_have_a_double_standard_about_body/,changemyview,"I think this because I believe the mindset that leads men to view women with body counts the same as their own or even lower than their own negatively, bc they feel hookup culture ""emotionally damages women""-contradict themselves and also fundamentally view at least *some* women as objects for their sexual pleasure and nothing else, just as sexual receptacles basically. If they think it emotionally damages women, then by partaking they are consciously emotionally damaging women and not caring? And it's considered okay just bc men can have sex with a woman and not care about her at all?If this is true (and I'm not disagreeing that sex is probably less emotional for men)-then they are basically saying men should be allowed to use women for sexual gratification/just for their bodies because men fundamentally don't care about certain women and that's just a fact that we need to accept-so let's enable their disrespect of women and the creation of girls with emotional pain?!

My view would be changed if men with these opinions respected women openly and had happy, educated wives who they don't place restrictions on. And also, more to the point-that they don't continue to use their opinion that some women are just sex objects as a justification to cheat bc the woman they cheat with is just a body to them. How are women supposed to trust that they won't use this take to partake in cheating? Just bc they love the woman they are with and that they don't view as objects enough? Is that reliable?

I've never, ever seen this though. "

```
(response to previous discussion on virginity loss being difficult)

Hate to break it to you but it take effort. Unless your a girl no one is going to be banging on your door trying to take you vCard.

What I would tell myself when I was 16. Hit the gym and work on style (classic 5x5 and dappered.com) and sign up for boxing or bjj. Goal here is to build a strong body, solid style and self confidence. No mater what you look like being in good shape, wearing clothing that shows that off and knowing how to protect yourself never hurts.

Then read a couple good books. No more mr nice guy, when I say no I feel guilt, and practical female psychology for the Practical man, and models.

Then it‚Äôs just about finding girls your interested in and having the balls to ask them out. If you like a girls she should have no doubt in her mind you want to go out with her the first time you hang out. You will get rejected, yes it will happen more than your successful. Guys I know who are best with girls only have about a 1% to 5% success rate. Trick is they don‚Äôt care if they get rejected. Because they know regret is alway worse then rejection. When it happens be a gentleman smile and walk it off. Had a girl flat out reject me only to see me later and be interested simply because I didn‚Äôt get mad she shot me down.

Sun it up is the path is to become attractive.

```

I do not consider this to be exactly a toxic attitude or even wrong. But I think it sets people up for failure to think like this because it's a strategy more or less optimized to a school environment. In such an environment men will meet a large number of women of which they have a reasonable amount in common with anyways (both at the same school etc). 

I think the worst element of it (excluding adjacent ideas) is that it portrays itself as a long term strategy of deferred gratification, but while it does require some degree of deferred gratification, it's medium term at best. It only feels long term to someone who gets the messaging at the right age (14-16) and both has a lack of perspective of something truly long term, and also has enough time to be able to successfully put their resources into it for several years.

Without the ability to meet tons of women en masse from school, and them having a certain baseline trust of you due to you being a fellow student, the whole strategy of be attractive and ask lots of women out without concern for rejection is not gonna work. Having meeting women as an afterthought makes the attitude not helpful in later periods.

""Build it and they will come"" does not work in business and in relationships it only works in school."

252,2023-07-06,CMV: The U.S. house of representatives should be radically larger,u/afriendlytank,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14suz9w/cmv_the_us_house_of_representatives_should_be/,changemyview,"I'm not talking like it should be 600 representatives instead of 450 something I'm talking it should be like 15,000 + representatives. Here are some reasons why i think districts should be radically smaller.

* it's way cheaper to campaign to 22,000 people than 700,000 people, which would make it feasible for talented, but less well connected individuals to run. Also, less incentive to listen to special interest groups because running a grassroots/ independent campaign would be doable. Easier campaigns also means easier to run against incumbents/ party power, more turnover, more fresh voices, better leadership pool, etc.
   * counterpoint: this would also make it easier for crazys to get elected, but it's not like the.current size of our districts make it any harder for the crazies to get in lol . also nothing wrong with a couple weirdos if it means the people from their district feel like their voices are heard.
* my gut says it'd be much harder to gerrymander a district of 22000 ppl. like there would prob be a couple border districts where gerrymandering is possible, but there would be plenty that are probably untouchable because they're surrounded by too much of the same party
* on that note- i doubt we would continue to have a two party system. no chance that any two parties could organize that many people into just two groups.  Factions are guaranteed to break out and the sheer number of representatives will likely make those groups powerful enough to quickly create new parties. multi-party systems better represent the people
* it will be much more expensive for special interest groups to influence politicians and their staff simply because there are so many more of them. the return for influencing one politician will go down a lot
   * counterpoint: they might just focus on the most powerful individuals, but even the most influential politician will see their power diluted by sheer numbers.
* they will know what their constituents needs are!! To be fair  22,000 people is still a lot, but it's heck of a lot easier to get in the right ball park of their needs than  3/4 a million. I feel like collectively we have just given up on feeling represented and known by our representatives because we assume it will be too difficult to manage otherwise, but why assume the difficulties are not worth having someone to actually represent you accurately!! 
* reduce partisianship.  I imagine the needs of someone living in public housing in NYC are a lot more similar to someone below the poverty line in Appalachia than they are to the finance guy on wall street. and both groups would be better represented and more likely to vote similarly.  There also would be more viable options for reps to actually push forward legislation they care about rather being forced to vote on party lines
* people won't lose representation. the fixed number of house seats means that as districts expand and they need a rep, other smaller districts lose their representative even though the population of their district has not changed.  Like Montana only has 1 representative, even though their state has a population of 1 million. That is ABSURD.
* they would get paid less. if they can't afford to take care of their families/ selves on a lower salary, maybe they should enact some policies that make a lower wage more livable LOL. Frankly, I think reps should be paid whatever the average salary of their constituents is, but that's another post. Lower salary would make the job less appealing to those that are money motivated instead of make-the-word-a-better-place motivated.
   * counterpoint: might make it less appealing to talented/ smart people, but I honestly don't buy this. The non-profit industry is case and point. Those workers get paid jack, but plenty of brilliant ppl work there.
* administrative work would be easier because there would be more people to delegate the work to.
* i don't think it would actually increase the amount of ppl working in washington that much. I think it would just change the ratio to be more reps instead of aids.
* i would also like to say I think a large increase is necessary because a lot of these benefits, like diluted influence of special interest groups, viability of independent campaigns, decreased risk of gerrymandering, personal connection to constituents, guaranteed dissolution of the two party system- would not exist unless the district sizes are significantly small enough. These incredible benefits do not happen when a district size is 100,000 people.

i think the main counters are going to be about logistics and consensus building. However, I am not convinced size is the main factor in determining whether legislation gets pushed forward. I think it has more to do with the partisanship and lack of talented leadership, which I think will decrease significantly in a large house due to everything stated above.  As for logistics I am frankly too lazy rn to think of solutions, but I bet you guys could imagine ways to make it work if you were feeling creative. And arguably tricky logistics are well worth the myriad of benefits."
1,2023-07-06,"CMV: ""Offensive"" jokes are funny and a necessary part of comedy",u/RaindropDripDropTop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14svipr/cmv_offensive_jokes_are_funny_and_a_necessary/,changemyview,"First of all, I'm not saying people don't have the right to get offended by things they don't like. If someone watches a comedy show and the jokes offend them, that is their right, they are allowed to be offended. However, even though that is their right to get offended and speak out about it, I can't take these people seriously. They seriously need to lighten up and develop a sense of humor. 

A recent famous example of this was the Dave Chappelle Netflix special. The vast majority of the audience thought it was hilarious, but a vocal minority of people took to social media or even protested and complained about Dave Chappelle making jokes about trans people. He never even said anything against them being trans, he more so made fun of how you are not allowed to upset them and how they overreact to things....and honestly they kind of proved him right. Ultimately, comedy is about being funny and making people laugh, and Dave Chappelle's jokes were successful at doing so. They were funny. 

In a more general sense, many of the greatest comedians of all time have said a lot of ""offensive"" jokes. Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neal, Louis CK (terrible person but great comedian), Norm Macdonald, Chris Rock, etc. The list goes on and on. Even if you don't personally find these people funny, it is undeniable that these are some of the most influential and biggest comedians of all time who are not only popular but also widely respected by their peers as being great comedians. ""Offensive"" jokes are a huge part of so many comedic acts, and often times the ""offensive"" jokes are the funniest. Bottom line is that agreeable and safe are rarely ever as funny as more off color type stuff. The great comedians are often really good at toeing the line of being ""offensive.""

Then there are even some comedians in the past who made jokes that don't even toe the line, they cross the line and simply would never be made today. Take Andrew Dice Clay for example. I understand all of the criticism against him, his jokes are stupid as hell, and he said a lot of blatantly misogynistic, homophobic, and racist jokes. I can see why a lot of people consider him low brow trash comedy....but at the same time, he was undeniably a great performer, dude was selling out massive arenas in the 80s and 90s, and honestly as stupid and low brow as his jokes were, they were funny as hell and made a ton of people laugh. He was also playing an over the top character. 

I totally understand the criticism some people have that comedians should punch up instead of ""punching down."" If someone feels that way, that is a fair positions. But ultimately the purpose of comedy is to be funny. Sometimes jokes that punch down are funny. Sometimes jokes that are mean are funny. Not everything has to be nice and clean and safe, sometimes it's the mean and controversial jokes that are the funniest. ""Offensive"" jokes simply are often very funny, and they are essential to comedy, because without them the comedy can be lame and boring. I'm not saying people shouldn't do safe and clean comedy if they can male that work, but you also need the other end of the spectrum."

If that were true, we simply would never make it past a bunch of monkes - our ability to cooperate, to emphasize, to reason, when combined with our innate desire for art (as an ultimate form of communication) and knowledge (for the sake of it; as far as we can tell, we humans simply love learning things. We do science for the sake of it) allowed us to survive where many would not.   


Building up on that, I also believe that we, humans, crave freedom - to do things that I mentioned above, to enjoy life and be happy, we must be free. Freedom does not come from happiness (and such thinking can lead to rational that someone can be happy, and thus free, in oppression) but rather, happiness comes from freedom - the freedom to be what you wish to be, to actualize yourself, to create and ponder, those are the things that bring us joy. Living and interacting with living world brings us joy - and freedom is crucial to that.   


To that extent, we create laws and the such which regulate society, as a mechanism, to ensure safety, and therefore, maximize freedom. For example, while there is no innate value to life, good and bad are subjective, and every person holding the right to kill (just as any animal has the right to kill in the wild) we, still, regulate around that. Why? To ensure the most freedom; we agree that certain ""rights"" go against the good of the collective and, therefore, limit them to increase the overall freedom of species. That concept is extremely simple and we followed it for about as long as civilizations existed; which is why I am so confused for why we cannot do the same with economics.   


We create laws around civility and education and everyday life and all those things; we create abstract boxes and lines, but for some reason, we are so willing to let economics flow, as if the world as a whole will come down if we will not. The dream of humanity being free of shackles that are economics is a normal dream to have, and that is the dream upon which communism, as a far-left idealogy, is based. To that end, I fail to see but a single otherwise: communism failed before? So did capitalism, but that does not stop us from doing it again; why should failures of old stop us from striving for better future, even if said future is hopeless? Is there no virtue in fighting a losing battle, if said battle is worth fighting?   


In reality, the only issue that a person can have with communism can either stem from poor education (and, therefore, poor understanding of politics and economics) or from lies (and propaganda) Logically, there is no good argument to limiting individual power at the expanse of corporate power, nor is there any good argument to conservatism as a whole. Humanity, as a species, is a progressive animal: conservatism is bad for us. "

4,2023-07-07,CMV: Unconditional love in romantic relationships does not exist,u/Federal_Penalty5832,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14sykyk/cmv_unconditional_love_in_romantic_relationships/,changemyview,"From a psychological standpoint, understanding human emotions, motivations, attachment styles, and the complexities of fidelity and infidelity suggest that romantic love is rarely, if ever, unconditional. The very nature of human emotion tends to be circumstantial and fluctuating, responding to external events and internal states. Moreover, attachment styles - secure, avoidant, anxious - can dictate the terms of a romantic relationship. With these facts, it's hard to argue that love in romantic relationships is completely free of conditions.

Philosophically speaking, the nature of love, the conditions we place upon it, and the ethical implications of such conditions underscore my stance. Different philosophical theories present various perspectives on love. For example, utilitarianism could imply that love persists only as long as the happiness it brings outweighs the suffering. Furthermore, ethical considerations also stipulate that romantic love often comes with a prerequisite of reciprocity, consent, and mutual respect, thus reinforcing the notion of conditionality.

Looking through the lens of sociology, societal norms and expectations greatly influence our perception of love and relationships. Monogamy, fidelity, and the ""rules"" of romantic relationships as stipulated by society inevitably set conditions for love. These social constructs are not universal, vary over time, and differ among cultures, yet they frame our understanding and experience of love, adding conditions to it.

Lastly, anthropology introduces cultural perspectives into this discussion. Cultural norms and practices around the world show that the concept of love, relationships, and fidelity are not universally understood or practiced. In some cultures, romantic love is not even a prerequisite for marriage, highlighting the conditional aspects of these relationships.

(Note: I'm not suggesting that there isn't profound, enduring love that can exist in romantic relationships. Rather, I question the premise of it being unconditional in the true sense of the term.)"

1,2023-07-07,CMV: Most white people only believe in prejudice when they‚Äôre the victim.,u/822211,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14szui8/cmv_most_white_people_only_believe_in_prejudice/,changemyview,"It is evident to me that whenever anyone brings up the concept of reverse racism here, there is unanimous agreement among everyone participating in the discussion. White individuals seem to be unwilling to recognize and acknowledge the existence of racism and their own contribution to it. However, they readily portray themselves as victims of racism if they are even slightly excluded from social events like a cookout. Then in the same breath, they will come up with justifications for the tragic lynching of a 12-year-old in Alabama. Watch how the comments and karma of this post play out.


This is the original post that was unfortunately deleted, but I think Is a good read. 

CMV: Most white people in America are in denial that they are racist

I see white people as equivalent to the Germans during the Holocaust who stood by and did nothing as the Jews got gassed to death in Auschwitz. You may think this comparison absurd, but slavery in America has existed for 243 years and continues to exist. It's just called the prison-industrial complex now, in which America incarcerates more people than any nation on earth and disproportionately black people who perform prison labor. Turns out the 13th Amendment doesn't apply to ""criminals.""

White people claim they aren't racist with their every breath; that they don't support white supremacy. Yet words are just hot air. What do their actions do?

The elite on the left twist their hands and bemoan the actions of insurrectionists on the right, while doing absolutely nothing to help.  At least the neo-Nazis openly admit who they are. Martin Luther King Jr. didn't fail in the South, the supposed hotbed of racism. He failed in the North; in Chicago, when he came up against Daley's Democratic machine and the intransigence of Northern racism thinly disguised as segregation by choice.

Perhaps you are familiar with ""Letter From a Birmingham Jail""  where MLK writes of the problematic white moderate. That is what I see as well. We may celebrate MLK today by naming streets and a national holiday after him but we celebrate the sanitized version of MLK digestible to white people. Towards the end of his life (he was assassinated on April 4, 1968), as his activism turned against the Vietnam War and uncontrolled capitalism, his popularity declined. Today American schoolchildren learn of his ""I have a dream speech"" and while that is good it is not enough.

In the name of fear, the GOP has weaponized racism ever since LBJ dared to sign into law the Civil Rights Act of 1965, saying as he did so that the South would be lost for a 100 years. The voting rights enshrined in that act, King's legacy, have been gutted by SCOTUS.

In the name of law and order, white people stood by as one by one black leaders got assassinated, sometimes violently by the government, such as Fred Hampton, a leader of the Black Panther Party.

White people reviled Malcolm X because of his nationalistic and militant rhetoric when it came to anti-racism, while ignoring the uplifting of the black spirit that he performed.

White middle class people watched in horror on January 6th. Yet they continue to do nothing. Where are the protests in the streets? The exercise of our First Amendment rights, the ones the Founding Fathers chose to place first of all other amendments in the Constitution? Where is the outrage against black prison labor? Where is the outrage against the new Jim Crow laws? Where is the outrage against housing discrimination that continues today? Where is the justice not just for the victims of police brutality, but the victims of all of the lynching that started as soon as the Civil War ended and black people were no longer considered the valuable property of white people? White mobs are responsible for the murder of a child like Emmett Till. How many of those who supported lynching have ever been brought to justice?

Unless you perform antiracist acts, you are in denial about your complicity with a system that has long centuries of being racist against black people.

When you complain about affirmative action, you are ignoring the centuries of affirmative action white people have enjoyed. Thanks to a SCOTUS decision regarding the University of California system, affirmative action can no longer legally be enforced. Guess which political party has used its control of the Presidency to appoint SCOTUS judges while denying Democratic presidents like Obama their SCOTUS nominations?

Racism is not going to die easily. To paraphrase a famous quote, it only takes good people to do nothing for evil to prevail.  


Addendum: I'd like to quote a white woman here, Karen Fleshman, because I am hearing many of the same excuses she observes in the arguments:   


""And for generations, white Americans have made excuses and turned away.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not me.‚Äù

1,2023-07-07,CMV: Spanking is sexual assult and parents who spank there children should be considered pedophiles.,u/The_Lord_Of_Death_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14t1lsa/cmv_spanking_is_sexual_assult_and_parents_who/,changemyview,"Firstly yet me explain how I'll define ""spanking"" 

For this posts purposes, I consider spanking to be: Forcing a person over your knee, or any other common posision, pulling there pants and underwear down, and repeatedly hitting them on the anus. I know spanking isn't allways done in this way but I think it gives a good basis to go off of.

1. The first thing I would like to point out is that the act of spanking, is a form of sexual assult. We can prove this in many ways but for starters, if somone went outside and forced a random women (or man) over there lap, pulled down there pants exposing there private parts and then repeatedly hit them in thoese areas they would be charged with: assult, sexual assault, sexual harassment, battery, public exposure, (and if they have a history with this person then,) physical abuse and sexual abuse. Now presuming they weren't immediately killed by a group of people who witnessed this they would be looking at a 10-20 year sentence, especially if they caused high amounts of damage to the area. This shows spanking is clearly considered wrong and a crime.

Also lets look at the definision of sexual abuse: ""Sexual abuse includes any sexual behavior that is done to someone without that person's consent."" Spanking fits this definition 

2. If you can understand how spanking is a form of sexual assult then surely spankimg a child should be considered sexual assult towards a minor. Whitch is a pedophilic (I know that's not a word but you know what I mean) action.

3. Now obviously theres going to be   lot of disagreement with point 2 so here's a few responses I predict coming.

 Note: I'm going to focus more on WHY spanking is wrong and less why its sexual assault, beacuse if you think spanking is a wrong and creepy thing to do to a child, then you can allreddy see my point I'm trying to make, even if you don't aggre with it. 

4. ""I was spanked as I child and I turned out fine"" A study published in 2015 discovered evidence concerning children with anger issues and corporal punishment. Researchers found that children who were spanked showed much more aggressive behaviors, thus leading to a greater likeliness of being spanked even more‚Äìthis creates a vicious cycle that breeds children with anger issues.

Http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4904830/ (link  to study)

What this shows is that people who where spanked often DONT ""turn out fine"" not only due to the increased anger issues and higher chances to resolve conflict with physical violence but also beacuse people who say ""I turned out fine"" are the people who then continue to sexualy abuse minors. So no, you clearly didn't turn out fine.

5. ""Spanking a child is an easy and quick way to teach them a lession especially when compared to grounding/time out"" Just beacuse it's easier for you to quickly hulmiliate and beat a child dosn't mean it's better. Obviously the aforementioned point shows how there is a long term negitive effect on that child's life but it also breaks trust. Trust is the most important thing you need to have with your child and Forcing them into a posision where there genitalia is rubbing on your body and your hitting then on a sexual part of there body shows that child that you are NOT somone they can trust, it shows you resort to violence and you don't care about or respect boundaries. Again studies show that people who where sexualy abused as a child where more likely to be arrested for sexaul abuse crimes. Whitch makes sence these people probably thing its normal to use physical violence to get what you want. After all that's what they where taught.

I was unable to find the links to these studies but if I do I'll update them here.

6. ""I only hit my child over clothes and not bare"" Now i'll say that this is way, WAY better then hitting a child bare. I would say that this DOSN'T count as pedophilia since there's a clear mean to disapline the child and not anything else (at least some what) but its still definitely considered abuse. And arguably still sexual abuse. It's better but better dosnt mean it's good. Your still hurting your child and humiliating them. I want to make this clear before I get comments pointing it out.

7. What I'm about to say is the main reason I'm so against spanking and the thing that makes it so disgusting... 
Most children who are spanked develop spanking fetishs. There is many articles that show this and I recoment you research it your self. I would rather not put links to information about fethishes on here. There's a good article on city-data.com by Chris Dugan that covers this topic well, again I recomend you do your own research for this. The fact that young kids are developing fetishs for spanking, often while there parents are still admitting spanked makes it So, So awful. I don't think I even have to explain why. 

8. ""I'm not spanking my child for sexual gratification so therefore it's not pedophilic"" this is the main point I presume will be brought up in the comments and to any one who says it.
Really? Like does that change anything? Just beacuse your doing sexual things to minors to physical and emotional hurt them and not for sexual gratification, that makes it ok? Do you think your child experiences your abuse differently based on what you want to achieve. Answer: NO! they will be negitivly affected the same way no matter what your intent for spanking them is. 

Sexual assult to a minor makes you a pedophile, no matter if your doing it for non-sexual reasons. 

9. So what am I trying to achieve by this post. Well, No matter what you can't convince me that spanking is right or even that it's not abusive. But I want to know if I'm missing something does somone have a reason, not why spanking is right, but why its not sexual assult or why the people who do it aren't pedophiles. I realy struggle to see how anyone can justify these acts but nearly 70-80% of the world can. Also since it will pebbly be brought up in the comments, I've never been spanked but have heard countless stories from freinds who have. And no, not a single one of them think it helped them. 

Finally I want to thank you for reading this, I know its extremely long but I realy want to explain my points so I can have an indepth conversation with some people on this issue. Thank your for your time."

Empathy makes you choose a side. You will either be empathetic to one group while actively hating another group, or you will try to understand everyone's side but with your own bias. Psychopathy does not have that. They are nothing more than statistics. You can index the damage caused by someone without ever feeling anything about this. You are truly neutral.
2. Empathy makes you vulnerable to being exploited by people. You will feel bad for these people while they will continue to take advantage of your empathy. Psychopathy makes being exploited nearly impossible. Since you cannot afford to care about anyone, they will be unable to take advantage of you.
3. Empathy is unnecessary. You don't need to feel bad for someone to realize why committing said crime is a bad idea. Try to commit a crime, and you will face the consequences. Psychopaths deal with this by comparing the rewards of the crime with the consequences. You will already see why committing brutal and victim-based crimes is a bad idea by comparing the values, so that makes empathy unneeded to prevent yourself from committing crimes.

In conclusion, psychopathy has far more benefits than empathy. Change my view as to why empathy can have more benefits than psychopathy."

As outraged as people are over things that cause untimely death, not just those caused by massacres, but unsafe working conditions, unsafe driving, as outraged as they are, they should be more outraged when they see what the death actually looks like to the people who witnessed it first hand and the uniformed responders who have to clean it all up. People say they are outraged enough just thinking about it, but they're not, they're self-censoring in order to make the world a better place in their mind. The late night news doesn't omit graphic death because it's in poor taste, they do it because it would hurt their rating, it's a part of reality that people want to avoid.

People say we become desensitized to violence, they're usually talking about movies where the violence is fake and you are really just becoming tired of a Hollywood gimmick. You don't become desensitized to real violence, you become distressed and broken down by it, but that distress is what motivates real social change in order to prevent more death. They show police officers video of police being killed, and trainee pilots videos, or recreations of plane crashes for the same reason, seeing is believing, and it makes them better at what they do.

Since we are all tasked with mutually making society a better place, we should all see the unfiltered truth, the good and the bad.

One exception I'll make is in the case of people being killed in an act of terror or ransom, for the fact that urging people to watch those videos increases their motivation to commit such acts and video them, but in most other cases of death being caught on camera by happenstance, people should be familiar with what exactly went down when a fellow human being died somehow."

Many, if not most people, make up their own religion.

I was raised a ¬´christian¬ª. My whole family on my mothers side is christian. Or at least they think so. The only person that actually follows the bible and everything that comes with the religion is my grandmother. Everyone else is making up their own religion, but believing in the christian god and Jesus. And almost every single person I have met has their own sort of christian or Islamic religion:

Many are drinking their asses off. Many are LGBTQ. Many are swearing like it‚Äôs the only words in their vocabulary. Many are breaking their marriage. Many are working on sundays. Many are not praying, unless they need something.

I could go on and on. When I confront people that stand close to me about this, they say that they know god and know that they wouldn‚Äôt be sent to hell for doing this. Oh, so you know god better than the Bible or Quran? You know the rules better than the 10 commandments? I know god is forgiving sins, but this is a whole different thing. This is just wanting to believe in something without even knowing what they actually believe in.

Like myself for many, many years. I loved Jesus, and god, but I didn‚Äôt believe in the garden of Eden. I thought Jesus was real, and I prayed often, but didn‚Äôt believe 90% of the Bible. I believed in the Big Bang, and at the same time god. That isn‚Äôt Christianity. That‚Äôs Tuttirunkenianity. Now I am unfortunately an atheist (I really miss believing) after seeing what the fuck I was doing. And that was, like many others, making up my own religion.

Edit: I have learned that the name for this is lukewarm christians. I don't know if that affects other religions."

I don't know why artists are so respected and why it's shameful not to know certain 'art pieces' while everyone can ignore basic knowledge regarding science and brush it off because it doesn't affect their lives. I am a scientist, why should I care about music genres or historical art periods? My job is to improve the world, not to know the names of paintings or their authors. Most scientists are considered to be boring, and their work is undervalued. I've put an immense amount of work to be where I am and studied my ass off, yet I also need to learn something about art so I won't look illiterate. It sounds weird, but I was looked at differently from my friends once because I wasn't aware of a certain musical composer's artwork. The opposite doesn't happen - artists don't need to learn some basic stuff about bio or chem; they won't be called dumb.

All movies in the movie theatre should have subtitles so that we can fully understand what's going on.

A con someone might say is it might be too distracting. Except it's really not in my opinion. Every other country where English is not a first language that shows an English movie has subtitles. These people don't seem to get distracted. I also put on subtitles whenever I watch something at home, and it doesn't hinder my experience at all. Anyone saying it diminishes the movie experience by not making the movie ""pure"" is just being a snob."

It seems that alot of younger people (myself included) aren't all that interested in having children and in general non-religious people are less interested in having children, or at least a large amount of children. On the opposite side of the coin are people that believe you should have as many children as ""God wants you to have"" and not use birth control. This is not really meant to be a birth control/abortion debate. My point is that if you have an antinatal attitude or believe that its selfish/bad to have children, then the only people that are going to be populating the planet are the so-called ""fundies"" or devoutly religious, or people who live in cultures or poor countries without birth control. So you can't have your cake and eat it to. Secular people who don't want children are going to have something of an ideological/cultural decline, ergo their ""fundie"" opponents are going to be more likely to replenish their numbers."

For context, I‚Äôm a lesbian, and I do believe kink can fit in to Pride festivities, just not the parade. I‚Äôm also not slut shamey, or anti- sex work. This is just my opinion and I‚Äôm open to changing it if someone changes my view.

I personally don‚Äôt think that kink, overly sexual things, or nudity belong at Pride Parades.

As a lesbian who is also a sexual assault survivor, I think firstly it contributes to the oversexualization of queer people. The amount of straight men who use this rhetoric to objectify and degrade WLW people is gross. Queer relationships aren‚Äôt for personal pleasure. This puts especially female presenting people more at risk. 

Secondly, I think Pride should be kid friendly because there ARE gay kids. There are gay families who want to bring their kids. Not everyone wants their kids to see bondage.

Thirdly, I‚Äôm tired of trying to explain to straight people that yes Pride is still a protest and a community building event, and not just an opportunity for queer people to wear ass-less chaps.

Also, asexual people are part of LGBTQIAP too.

Just like we still need to drink in beer tents and not on the street (at least where I am) public decency rules shouldn‚Äôt just go out the window because it‚Äôs Pride. Have events at the club? Sure. Just leave the Pride parade for the whole community to enjoy."

My thinking is that people should be able to do whatever they want in their personal relationships, or with their own body, and it should all be de stigmatized. It‚Äôs almost as we looked at the binary structure of gender and sexuality, decided it was too rigid, then created a different rigid octonary structure.

The boss wants some statistics. You search the files on your PC write the report and send it. He wants to send the most relevant data to 15 other people. So you make a summary and send an email with an attachment to 15 other people. 

This took some 40-50 minutes. And you have over 7 hours left where you have to work. You have to do roughly another 50 Emails, compile another 3-4 such lists. Write around 50 Emails. And only then your day is over...

People in the office nowadays do roughly 10x more work than people 40 years ago. Technology has enabled this, but not lead to a reduction in working hours. Therefore if people work the same hours - but do 10x more work in thouse hours - they are doing 10x the workload and are 10x more stressed.

Ugliness impacts almost every single aspect of life. From childhood, the way you are treated by teachers and peers into adulthood the way you are treated by employers.

If I‚Äôm being honest, I don‚Äôt know how else it can be treated. I feel that with talk therapy and maybe medication in cases of chemical imbalances, a dysphoric person can cope or resolve with the issue without transitioning.

I view transitioning, hormonally and surgically, to be rather traumatic on the body and accomplishing more harm than good. It can and will easily leave you without functioning reproductive systems and permanent hormone replacement therapy. It‚Äôs not a way I see is comfortable to live.

To be honest, regardless if dysphoria can be treated any other way, I see being permanently dysphoric with your gender as a much better alternative to a partially dysfunctional body that requires permanent treatment.

However, the fact that the US, UK and NATO at large keep giving it weapons and ammunition while not stepping their own feet into the conflict might signify that they're not *really* interested the resolution of the conflict.

What they're interested in, one might argue, is continuing to sell the weapons and ammunition as long as feasibly possible.

Numerous bluffs Putin and his admin have made about nuking Ukraine or Eastern Europe have come and passed, with no result. The Zaporizhizhia nuclear plant remains a threat of a nuclear sabotage, but other than that, nothing much happened. That would make one to conclude the Russians are as much concerned about the nuclear fallout. That, in turn, means, that nuclear weapons Russia has been brandishing may not be much of a threat really. So, NATO could have actually put their troops on the ground to help Ukraine end this conflict, thereby saving lives and property.

It's not happening, despite the above, so that leads to a thought that NATO really does not want it to end.

The military complex is churning out rockets, shells, rifles, tanks and drones, and will happily do so in eternity if allowed. Their vested interest is in that this conflict *never* ends.

They export obsolete, outdated equipment to Ukraine, no help with troops, and in return they have their profits go through the roof. This war is a boon for them.

Sex is binary precisely because there are only two possible sexes, there is no third option. There are only 1s and 0s, there are no 2s. 0, Male and 1, female, categorised by sperm and ova. On a species level, males produce sperm, and females produce ova. However, on an individual level, males are defined by the organisms whose reproductive anatomies are structured around sperm, and females are defined by organisms whose reproductive anatomies are structured around ova. One ***does not need to be able*** to produce sperm or ova in the present.

There are two usual objections to the sex binary that are parroted. The intersex objection, and the claim that sex is bimodal, such as seen in this [graph](https://imgur.com/a/OdOhvaT), because characteristics which are tied to sex, such as hormone levels, voice pitch, hip width, facial hair thickness, musculature exist on a spectrum, and thus, sex is also on a spectrum.

**The Intersex Objection**

This objection mainly takes the form of, there are individuals who are not unambiguously categorised as male or female, thus, there is a ""third option"", so to speak.

It's important to note that the true prevalence of intersex people is astonishingly rare, comprising approximately [0.018% of the population](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12476264/).

Responding to the objection, the sex binary **does not mean** that every single human being will always be unambiguously male or female. What it does mean is that there are only two sexes.

Let's look at 2 intersex people, one has both sets of reproductive anatomies, a true hermaphrodite, producing both sperm and ova, and one has neither. The reason why these people do not threaten the sex binary is that their body structures do not comprise a third sex. They use the 1s and 0s, or neither.

The first person, with both anatomies, would be classified as male **and** female. However this is obviously not a third sex, they are combination of both sexes, both values in the binary system. The second person, with neither anatomy, would be classed as ***sexless,*** this person would not have a sex. This also does not fall outside the binary of 1s and 0s, because this person utilise neither value.

The important point here is that what is going on in an organism with regards to sex is not sex itself. Four options can be laid out;

1. Male
2. Female
3. Male and female
4. Neither

These outputs are **not themselves** sexes, ***but combinations of sex.*** This is clear in the latter two options, the third are both sexes combined, not a third sex and the fourth, represent a lack of a sex, a lack of function, also obviously not a third sex, how can a lack of a sex be a sex? In other words, human beings as individuals are not binary, but sex itself is.

I think this analogy really strikes the point home;

>It‚Äôs a bit like shoes. Just as there are, in reality, only two sexes, there are, in reality only two types of shoes out there for people: left-footed shoes and right-footed shoes. And yet there are four ways that a person can be ‚Äúshoed,‚Äù so to speak. A person can wear a right shoe only, or a left shoe only, or both right and left shoes, or no shoes at all. And so, just as we can think of ‚Äúthe sex a person is,‚Äù or, in other words, what‚Äôs going on in a person with regard to sex, we can also think about ‚Äúthe shoes a person wears,‚Äù or what‚Äôs going on with a person when it comes to shoes. And, in both cases, there are four possibilities, four combinations. But, as before, it would be a mistake to think of these combinations of shoes as themselves shoes. Clearly, wearing no shoes at all is not a type of shoe. In the shoe system, there are only two kinds of shoes. The system is binary, in that way. Similarly, in the sex system, there are only two kinds of sexes. The sex system, like the shoe system, is binary.

**The Argument from Sex-Related Characteristics**

I mentioned this [graph](https://imgur.com/a/OdOhvaT). It seemingly proves the existence of the bimodal nature of sex, two peaks representing typical males and females, and a middle value, an intersex person. What variable would be on the x-axis exactly?

This graph misrepresents biological sex, it conflates characteristics that are ***consequences*** of one's sex with sex itself. These characteristics do not define one's sex. Reproductive anatomies do.

Is a male with a high-pitched voice, no facial hair, little musculature ""less male"" than a 6 foot 5 bulk dude with a thick beard who won the bodybuilding championship? Sex is not a continuous variable, it is a categorical description. The implication of this mindset would lead to such platitudes like ""I have 3 units of more maleness than that guy"" this is completely absurd. 

This type of rhetoric reinforces regressive and offensive attitudes towards people who don't fit neatly into typical male and female appearances. It reinforces playground bully logic, a girl with more masculine features is just as much a girl as her friend with a more stereotypically feminine physique. 

We recognise that females usually have XX chromosomes and males XY because these chromosomal combinations correspond almost invariably with female and male sexes, respectively. We associate high testosterone levels with males and high estrogen levels with females because we comprehend that these hormone levels correlate with an individual‚Äôs sex. It would have been **literally impossible** to associate any of these traits with males and females without first understanding what males and females are, **apart from these traits**. And what all these traits are caused by or correlate with is the type of gamete that an individual‚Äôs anatomy is structured around.

Sex is a fundamental, immutable biological component of almost all organisms, even ones such as Placozoa. These organisms reproduce sexually, and they are very simple organisms, consisting of a few thousand cells, yet still can be classified into males and females. It follows that males and females are very simple terms, defined by a single parameter, reproductive anatomy, centred around either sperm or ova, only two options, and thus, a binary system.

not to mention you guys only ever claim the not white side (seriously, show me one biracial who identifies as white) to me it just comes of as wanting to be opressed, like, if white people are supposidley the privileged group, wouldnt you want to identify with privilege?

Regardless of the private beliefs of legislators in one state or another, the actual merit of such a policy still stands. Requiring identification to make sure you are following existing laws (no voting twice, citizens only, no felons, etc) doesn't seem to me to be an infringement on liberty. I've heard the argument that some people don't have IDs for one reason or another, yet still should have their right to vote recognized. If you don't have an ID, you can't get a job, rent a place to live, open any bank or credit account, drive a car or even buy beer. So I figure if there are people who don't have an ID (probably very few) they have more important things to worry about than casting a vote in a sea of 150 million votes. I'd love to hear a solid argument against this."

Here's a timeline of events which we know so far.

Nov. 2  
The White House discovered classified documents from Biden's time as vice president at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C. The documents were found while Biden's personal attorneys were packing files that were stored in a locked closet at the think-tank, the White House said.

Dec. 20  
Biden's personal lawyer informed Lausch that additional documents with classified markings were identified at two locations, including his garage, inside the president's personal residence in Wilmington, Del.

Jan. 14  
The White House announced that Biden's personal attorneys discovered an additional five pages of classified material at his home in Delaware while the DOJ was on site to take possession of the original classified document.

Jan. 21  
Richard Sauber, a member of the White House Counsel's Office, said additional classified documents were discovered during a Jan. 20 search at Biden's Wilmington, Delaware, home.  
Bob Bauer, Biden's personal attorney, said in a separate statement that the search by the Department of Justice took almost 13 hours to complete, but neither Biden or first lady Jill Biden were present.  
Six items containing classified document markings were discovered during the search, Bauer's statement said. Some of the documents were from Biden's time in the Senate, as well as his vice presidency. Handwritten notes from Biden's vice presidential years were also taken for further review.

[https://www.axios.com/2023/01/12/biden-classified-documents-timeline](https://www.axios.com/2023/01/12/biden-classified-documents-timeline)

Now, Biden should be impeached for this. Removing one classified page might have been unintentional. However, removing numerous classified documents shows a pattern of behavior, a pattern of behavior indicating willfulness. It is simply not plausible that anyone unintentionally removed 20 or more classified documents. Classified documents are marked classified at the top and bottom of every page. Every paragraph is marked classified. The classified documents are kept within folders with classified cover sheets, which are themselves kept within safes or special rooms designated for the storage of classified information. Accidentally removing a classified document is something which should almost never happen.

Fear is a primal instinct deeply ingrained in our biology. It serves as a survival mechanism, alerting us to potential dangers and threats. However, fear often extends beyond physical peril and seeps into our emotional and psychological realms. It manifests as anxiety, anger, jealousy, and sadness, among other negative emotions.

Jealousy, for instance, arises from a fear of losing someone or something we value. Anger  often emerges when our expectations are not met, triggering a fear of being disrespected or marginalized. Anxiety is often driven by a fear of the unknown or a fear of failure.

On the flip side, positive emotions can be traced back to love. Think about a moment of pure joy you've experienced. These positive emotions can be viewed as love, whether it's love for ourselves, love for others, or love for the beauty and wonders of existence.

I believe every day we have a decision to choose whether we live our lives motivated by fear, or love. Love is always the right choice. It's not always the easiest or most comfortable by any means, but is the best choice for your own and other's well-being. It's well worth the time, to stop and consider what's motivating you in a difficult situation."

They are willing to contribute and it should be their right to do so. 

Here's the solution. Whoever wants to contribute to paying off this debt, should be able too. They get taxed at a heavier rate. People who don't support it, don't get taxed. That way everyone wins. You aren't forcing someone to pay the debt but at the same time you're letting those who want to help the issue pay for the debt themselves. It's a win-win. Everyone gets what they want. You shouldn't force those to pay for the debt but you should allow those who want to contribute to contribute."

I think 16-year-olds are capable enough to make these decisions, and if she and her family are happy and the boy is financially secure, I don't see any problem with it. Especially when, in the past generation, people used to marry young and didn't see a problem with it. So why now? And the biological proof is that if girls can menstruate, they are able to create babies; therefore, they are able to create a family. If we are respecting the consent of teenagers who engage in sexual activity, then why not focus on the consent of those young teens who want to marry? Why shun them? Isn't it a bit of hypocrisy?

Example: The prices of eggs increased during COVID. The egg companies state that the reason for this was due to a disease which was killing off chickens.

Saying ""we are paying for something whether or not we need it right now"" is fucking stupid. If a family did that, they would be on the street starving.

Im not saying that there arent good programs that are in the mandatory block, I do support alot of them (even if id do them differently), but the fact that 75% of our budget is completely inelastic every year I think is self destructive. We need to have wiggle room, covid is a fantastic example. If we could have eased off the mandatroy block and the discretionary block, we could have curbed the inflation that happened afterward, rather than creating a problem that wont be addressed in 20 years. Some years we may need to appropriate money differently depending on emergencies or things that are out of our control, and its good to have that flexibility if it prevents a bigger problem.

Let's call out what Jonah's ex is really doing here: airing her dirty laundry in public for attention and justifying that by claiming to spread awareness of ""abuse"".

Hurt feelings happen in just about every relationship. To suggest you are somehow the victim of abuse because your partner was prince charming and hurt your feelings is pathetic and an insult to victims of real abuse.

It's almost a weird form of narcissism, this desire to be a victim of abuse. These people get off on the attention it gets them. It's like they want to be a victim of abuse so badly that they will stretch the definition of abuse to apply to just about any unpleasant experience they had with their partner.

The standard for what constitutes abuse should be much higher than that, so that we take it seriously when someone says they are a victim of abuse. But these people are watering-down the concept of abuse to the point where if someone says they are a victim of abuse, I don't know if it's because their partner physically beat them, or because their partner ""sent them a mean text message >:(""."

These fucks are no better than the GQP who attacked the capitol, and they need to be removed from society. If not, they set the precedant you can destroy society if you call it a protest, which obviously can't be allowed to happen. My view will be changed if you can convince me that they aren't terrorists, or that their actions are in any way justifible."

3,2023-07-09,CMV: The Bible is not anti-LGBTQ,u/FerdinandTheGiant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14up1sq/cmv_the_bible_is_not_antilgbtq/,changemyview,"I should clarify my stance: The Bible does not contain a blanket condemnation of homosexuality or any message that when looked at within its historical context reads that way. 

I should also clarify I don‚Äôt know Greek or Hebrew but will be attempting to rely on literal translations from those instead of poor English translations just to make the  true ambiguous nature of the verses in question shine through. 

So to get it out of the way, I‚Äôll address the clobber passages, these being Leviticus 20:13 and 18:22. 

Leviticus 18:22 literally says: ‚ÄúAnd with a male do not lie down the lyings of a woman abomination it is.‚Äù The phrase ‚Äúlyings of‚Ä¶‚Äù used here is the the plural construct form of ‚Äòmishkav‚Äô, (mishkevei) used only one other time in Genesis 49:4 and that is typically translated as bed. The passage reading in the KJV reads *‚ÄúUnstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.‚Äù* This is in reference to, Reuben, who slept with Jacob‚Äôs concubine, Bilhah. If one were to apply the same usage of mishkevei as was used in Leviticus, you find that the meaning is essentially ‚ÄúReuben had sex with Bilhah as with his father‚Äù. Obviously Reuben doesn‚Äôt have sex with his dad so it appears that he was violating his dad by having sex ‚Äúas if he was his father‚Äù in so far that he is taking his sexual role by engaging with his concubine. This kind of hierarchy of sex appears quite common in the Ancient Near East. It used to be taboo for your wife to be on top because it robbed the man of his vitality. I‚Äôll get into this more when talking about Paul. Anyways, with that in mind, it appears that this usage, when applied to Leviticus, greatly changes the meaning. It is not about homosexuality or homosexual sex, it would be about violating the sexual hierarchy by having sex with a man as if he was a woman. I‚Äôve already seen it argued that it‚Äôs clarifying that sleeping with a man while cheating on your wife is the meaning. This is seen in the Nedarim 51a as well, with the rabbi being told Leviticus referred to engaging with a man outside of engagement with his wife. Obviously the interpretation changed over time, every text needs to be negotiated, but I believe the intent was not a simple ban on homosexuality or a blanket condemnation of homosexual male sex either.

I can address the other passages and assumedly will have to in the comments, but as of now I need to finish up."

19,2023-07-09,CMV: Efforts against Nerf toys are counterproductive because it generates easy excuses for pro 2nd people (USA) to oppose gun control.,u/Disposeasof2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14useq6/cmv_efforts_against_nerf_toys_are/,changemyview,"To start with, I do not personally hold practically partisan views on guns (USA resident), I see merits and flaws to both sides' arguments.

As far as I am concerned, the Nerf community is very well aware of the worst case scenarios and bad consequences of improper behavior and practices in the hobby. That is why we call them blasters not guns, and why we say tagged, not killed. We are aware that realistic blasters and mere talk of the subject has gotten law enforcement involved in very bad ways, that eye injuries occur due to participants not wearing eye protection such as safety glasses.

That said, there is inevitable blending of certain firearms nuance and nerf, such as the logic as to how spare magazines and holsters are carried, safety rules such as treating everything as if they are loaded and having proper muzzle and trigger discipline, and even some terminology such as holster, magazine, buttstock, muzzle, e.t.c. still apply accurately.

What I am noticing is that in many posts on various subreddits, there seems to be at minimum, a deliberate refusal to defend Nerf toys as a harmless object, and at worst, outright conflation with actual firearms as ""gateway guns"" or ""firearm analogs"" and/or pushes to ban them altogether. This is the same type of commentary that I notice zealous pro gun people reacting poorly to, and often exploiting to fear monger. They will say that a kid being suspended for merely briefly dragging a nerf toy across his virtual class camera and not having his suspension rescinded for several months ""shows that the gun control crowd wants to outlaw nerf toys"" or some rhetoric like that.

Lawyers on r/legaladvice and Avvo seem to hold a collective view that when a probation officer deliberately misconstrues Nerf toys as ""weapons"" for the purpose of probation conditions, Nerf toys are simultaneously insignificant as to not be worth defending for monetary, practical, or free speech purposes (""how is this affecting your life"" one comment says, ""cardboard cutouts of guns aren't protected by the 1st amendment"" e.t.c.) but significant to the point that they are ""potential dangers to law enforcement if painted black"" and that allowing Nerf toys for firearms charge defendants would set the precedent to allow them to possess realistic firearms replicas if not real firearms outright.

It can be safely assumed that there is a significantly noticeable voice out there that can be reasonably perceived as condemning Nerf toys, and it is backfiring greatly from what I can observe. Steven Crowder got so much fuel for his media outlets by hosting the kid denied a Nerf gun by a mall santa, many facebook comments under any firearms group (r/firearms, Firearms Policy Coalition, e.t.c.) talk about how the banning of gel blasters in Australia and the fact that Bradley Philips had to register a Nerf toy as a gel blaster category firearm simply for putting a gel ball inside the barrel and firing is a ""precursor to tyranny"", e.t.c.

This compounds with the inconsistent logic applied to Nerf and firearms vs other topics that many pro gun people of all backgrounds will exploit to label the gun control crowd as inconsistent; one could easily point out the hypocrisy in claiming that teaching gun safety in schools will encourage more gun handling and deaths but also saying sex education in schools won't increase teenage pregnancy, rape, and STI rates.

Lastly, the children punished for even having a foam pirate sword or for even having finger gun often seem to be more inclined to be interested in real and fake ordnance because their parent's efforts ironically became the catalyst for their rebellion. Children are literally the future, and when they grow up, they will definitely be acting in politics and society in a manner greatly influenced by their upbringing."

5,2023-07-09,CMV: Biological sex is not a spectrum,u/leposteur,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14utzlz/cmv_biological_sex_is_not_a_spectrum/,changemyview,"
The claim that ""sex is a spectrum"" deviating from the millions of years old fundamental sex binary is seen across many papers, even ones published in highly respected scientific journals such as [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/518288a).

This claim stems from the fundamental misunderstanding of what sex actually is. In sexually reproducing organisms, sexes are one of two distinct reproductive strategies an organism may utilise to engage in reproduction. These strategies revolve around two, specific gamete types, sperm and ova.

**Binary system: a system consisting of two parts.**

Sex is binary precisely because there are only two possible sexes, there is no third option. There are only 1s and 0s, there are no 2s. 0, Male and 1, female, categorised by sperm and ova. On a species level, males produce sperm, and females produce ova. However, on an individual level, males are defined by the organisms whose reproductive anatomies are structured around sperm, and females are defined by organisms whose reproductive anatomies are structured around ova. One ***does not need to be able*** to produce sperm or ova in the present.

There are two usual objections to the sex binary that are parroted. The intersex objection, and the claim that sex is bimodal, such as seen in this [graph](https://imgur.com/a/OdOhvaT), because characteristics which are tied to sex, such as hormone levels, voice pitch, hip width, facial hair thickness, musculature exist on a spectrum, and thus, sex is also on a spectrum.

**The Intersex Objection**

This objection mainly takes the form of, there are individuals who are not unambiguously categorised as male or female, thus, there is a ""third option"", so to speak.

It's important to note that the true prevalence of intersex people is astonishingly rare, comprising approximately [0.018% of the population](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12476264/).

Responding to the objection, the sex binary **does not mean** that every single human being will always be unambiguously male or female. What it does mean is that there are only two sexes.

Let's look at 2 intersex people, one has both sets of reproductive anatomies, a true hermaphrodite, producing both sperm and ova, and one has neither. The reason why these people do not threaten the sex binary is that their body structures do not comprise a third sex. They use the 1s and 0s, or neither.

The first person, with both anatomies, would be classified as male **and** female. However this is obviously not a third sex, they are combination of both sexes, both values in the binary system. The second person, with neither anatomy, would be classed as ***sexless,*** this person would not have a sex. This also does not fall outside the binary of 1s and 0s, because this person utilise neither value.

The important point here is that what is going on in an organism with regards to sex is not sex itself. Four options can be laid out;

1. Male
2. Female
3. Male and female
4. Neither

These outputs are **not themselves** sexes, ***but combinations of sex.*** This is clear in the latter two options, the third are both sexes combined, not a third sex and the fourth, represent a lack of a sex, a lack of function, also obviously not a third sex, how can a lack of a sex be a sex? In other words, human beings as individuals are not binary, but sex itself is.

I think this analogy really strikes the point home;

>It‚Äôs a bit like shoes. Just as there are, in reality, only two sexes, there are, in reality only two types of shoes out there for people: left-footed shoes and right-footed shoes. And yet there are four ways that a person can be ‚Äúshoed,‚Äù so to speak. A person can wear a right shoe only, or a left shoe only, or both right and left shoes, or no shoes at all. And so, just as we can think of ‚Äúthe sex a person is,‚Äù or, in other words, what‚Äôs going on in a person with regard to sex, we can also think about ‚Äúthe shoes a person wears,‚Äù or what‚Äôs going on with a person when it comes to shoes. And, in both cases, there are four possibilities, four combinations. But, as before, it would be a mistake to think of these combinations of shoes as themselves shoes. Clearly, wearing no shoes at all is not a type of shoe. In the shoe system, there are only two kinds of shoes. The system is binary, in that way. Similarly, in the sex system, there are only two kinds of sexes. The sex system, like the shoe system, is binary.

**The Argument from Sex-Related Characteristics**

I mentioned this [graph](https://imgur.com/a/OdOhvaT). It seemingly proves the existence of the bimodal nature of sex, two peaks representing typical males and females, and a middle value, an intersex person. What variable would be on the x-axis exactly?

This graph misrepresents biological sex, it conflates characteristics that are ***consequences*** of one's sex with sex itself. These characteristics do not define one's sex. Reproductive anatomies do.

Is a male with a high-pitched voice, no facial hair, little musculature ""less male"" than a 6 foot 5 bulk dude with a thick beard who won the bodybuilding championship? Sex is not a continuous variable, it is a categorical description. The implication of this mindset would lead to such platitudes like ""I have 3 units of more maleness than that guy"" this is completely absurd.

This type of rhetoric reinforces regressive and offensive attitudes towards people who don't fit neatly into typical male and female appearances. It reinforces playground bully logic, a girl with more masculine features is just as much a girl as her friend with a more stereotypically feminine physique.

We recognise that females usually have XX chromosomes and males XY because these chromosomal combinations correspond almost invariably with female and male sexes, respectively. We associate high testosterone levels with males and high estrogen levels with females because we comprehend that these hormone levels correlate with an individual‚Äôs sex. It would have been **literally impossible** to associate any of these traits with males and females without first understanding what males and females are, **apart from these traits**. And what all these traits are caused by or correlate with is the type of gamete that an individual‚Äôs anatomy is structured around.

Sex is a fundamental, immutable biological component of almost all organisms, even ones such as Placozoa. These organisms reproduce sexually, and they are very simple organisms, consisting of a few thousand cells, yet still can be classified into males and females. It follows that males and females are very simple terms, defined by a single parameter, reproductive anatomy, centred around either sperm or ova, only two options, and thus, a binary system."

I don‚Äôt care what the UK or other EU countries did about guns, it isn‚Äôt applicable here. 

I‚Äôm a socialist and liberals are ceding power to the right by being idiots on gun policy. I like my guns and my stance is that more non far right people should be arming themselves, particularly minorities. Right wing people say guns don‚Äôt kill people, people do, yet they don‚Äôt fund mental health whatsoever. The proper stance is allowing guns and also having funding for mental health, as well as waiting times and intensive mental health checks. There‚Äôs obviously more policy that would be good but that‚Äôs not the point of this post 

For a TLDR, banning guns in America is the equivalent of saying you‚Äôre going to put a spaceship on the sun tomorrow, it isn‚Äôt happening.  

The main point, you‚Äôre never going to ban guns in America. Just stop, it‚Äôs a shit fight you‚Äôll never win or feasibly be able to accomplish. Quit it and you‚Äôll get more votes from single issue voters. 

To begin, assault rifle bans are a complete waste of energy and time. The vast majority of gun deaths are done with handguns because you can conceal them. Good luck fitting a AR-15 in your jacket pocket. If liberals were choosing policy based on fact they would be pushing for handgun bans instead of ruining themselves over assault rifle bans. 

America also has more guns than people. In what world do you expect America to ban guns in general? You can go to any local elementary school playground and find a pistol, they‚Äôre everywhere. A buyback program isn‚Äôt going to do a thing and taking away guns is the precursor to more right wing terrorism than we already have. 

Why would you want right wingers to have all the guns? They‚Äôre the political affiliation with the most terrorism activity and threat in the US. Why are liberals kneecapping themselves when the right is two presidents away from holocausting LGBT people? Do you really want the only people in the country with guns to be the most hateful and unintelligent reactionaries? Yes, guns make things more dangerous, but we aren‚Äôt other countries. Everyone and their grandma has five pistols in their kitchen drawer. A good guy with a gun is only the case in 5% of shootings, a gun simply helps even the odds of civil loans slightly. If some right wing loon is trying to kill people at drag show I‚Äôd hope someone there has a gun too to at least have a chance of killing them before more harm is done.  

Mass shootings are the exception, not the norm. The majority of people who die from guns are either suicides or interpersonal/gang violence. Europeans who think going to school in America is like Call of duty isn‚Äôt the case whatsoever. Yes, we have more gun deaths on average, we also have shitty red flag laws and mental support. This is a mental health issue. We had guns centuries ago, mass shootings are only more commonplace as of the last two decades. 

We are not going to amend the second amendment. Just don‚Äôt even consider that as a possibility. 

I cannot fathom the political self harm of attempting to push for gun bans in America. It simply isn‚Äôt possible. Many who voted Republican are single issue voters who are politically illiterate, and agree with 90% of liberal policies. Hell, they‚Äôd probably be wearing red capes if we had an actually left wing party that supported gun ownership."

>By tapping into their ‚Äúdark streak‚Äù,  Isaacson said that leaders were less weighed down with empathy and were able to focus on bigger-picture issues.

I'd like to preface this by mentioning that [I'm not religious](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14oerk4/cmv_some_people_are_spiritually_dead/). A common atheist rebuttal to ""*where would you get morals from without religion*"" is ""*we follow the Golden Rule*"". But if you let your kids watch the news and study history, they'll realise the Golden Rule has never really been true.

Society rewards powerful people who are ruthless and treacherous. Meanwhile, non-powerful people are expected to behave themselves, and punishments apply to us if we try anything criminal. For example, powerful people can get away with lacking empathy, in fact, they prosper when they aren't weighed down with empathy - whereas a non-powerful person will suffer consequences if they lack empathy.

The Golden Rule only works when you're not too powerful to face consequences for wrongdoings. To climb the social ladder from insignificance to significance, one needs more than just hard work, they also need to get away with being ruthless and treacherous.

Now if I had kids and they said ""*that sounds horrible*"", I would tell them that ""*you either have to live by this world's rules, or you can try to fix it*"". But at least being honest about the rot in this world will show them why they need to behave - because I am not a powerful elite person - or it will instill in them a desire to fix the world.

The obvious alternative is to instill kids with morals through religion, but I'd probably botch that because I am not a sincere adherent to Catholicism (or any other religion for that matter)."

The opponents are 4 geniuses with above average intelligence who start the game with between 500 to 5000 Money. Who will win the game 99 out of 100 times? The below average guy with a lot of money.

This is because money gives security and enables people to throw cash at a problem until it disappears. It gives more opportunity and enables people to realize their full potential. It enables people to take risks, to experiement and to outperform players that are better but dont have the resources to compete.Money compensates for lack of talent and lack of skill. Money compensates for stupid decisions that would ruin other people.

Its the same in real life. People born into the top 1% or even 0.1% like Franklin Roosevelt or Donald Trump have it much much easier to become President compared to people that are born into poor or Middle Class Families. 

People like Jeff Bezos whos grandfather owned 25 000 Acres of land and who got 600 000 Dollars (inflation adjusted) from his parents - had the security and help to start something. He had a chance 99% of people never had.

Bill Gates through his rich parents had the time and money to start something. The nepotism of his parents created a connection with IBM that ultimately started his success.

Sure there are some Outliers that really make it from poor/Middle Class to rich/influental/President. But these people are a minority and it doesnt change that fact that starting life with more resources makes it far easier and far more likely to succeed compared to people with fewer resources.

My main reason is that current practices create an unfair double standard between married and unmarried parents.  
Current practices require non-custodial parents to often pay more in child support than their children actually need, to the point where parents might be paying for luxuries depending on the non-custodial parent's income. I understand that the reasoning here is that the children should have access to a similar lifestyle to what they would have if their parents were married. The flaw that I find in this reasoning, however, is the apparent assumption that married parents will always provide their children with the highest quality of life that they can afford to give them, e.g. children of wealthy parents will have a luxurious lifestyle because their parents can afford to give that to them. This isn't always necessarily the case, though. A wealthy married couple, for example, has every right to just give their children a basic middle class lifestyle and keep the rest of the money for themselves. They don't have any obligation to give the children more than they need, even if they can afford to do so. It's unfair then that non-custodial parents should be required to give more than what their children need in child support because married parents are not held to that same legal standard.  
I think the solution is to cap child support at the equivalent of a middle class lifestyle (I would say that this would entail something along the lines of a basic apartment, sufficient food, sufficient clothing, etc. to be able to live comfortably). If the custodial parent is able to provide this lifestyle, then no child support should be required from the non-custodial parent. If the custodial parent is not able to provide this kind of lifestyle, then the non-custodial parent should be required to pay the difference between what the custodial parent has and what the basic lifestyle requires.  
To address a common counter-argument that I've seen: I realize that with this solution, children might experience a downgrade in terms of their lifestyle following a divorce. For example, they might have wealthy parents who provide them with luxuries, and then the parents get divorced, the lower income parent gets full custody, and the non-custodial parent chooses to not provide luxuries anymore. I do not see any problem with this situation. Nobody should be entitled to any particular lifestyle, and as long as the children have their needs met, it's okay for them to go from a luxurious lifestyle to a basic lifestyle. And again, the parents should not have any obligation to provide their children with more than they need since married couples are not held to that same standard.  
Also, I realize that in the case of split custody, there might be a mismatch where one parent is able to provide a luxurious lifestyle when the children stay with them, while the other is not. I do not see this as being a problem either. If the children end up preferring to spend time with one parent rather than the other, that is okay, They are not required to enjoy the company of both parents equally. The non-custodial parent should have every right to provide however much they want for their children at a given time and circumstance as long as basic needs are met since married couples have that right."

A quick prompt on chat gpt 4 with the below question brought back the answers following it:

What are some examples of individuals, rulers of groups of people through history that demanded to be referred to using specific titles or pronouns?

Throughout history, there have been numerous individuals, rulers, and leaders who demanded to be referred to using specific titles or pronouns. Here are a few examples:

Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt: The pharaohs of Ancient Egypt were considered divine rulers and demanded to be addressed with titles such as ""His Majesty"" or ""Lord of the Two Lands."" They were seen as living gods, and their titles and pronouns reflected their elevated status.

Roman Emperors: Roman emperors often adopted honorific titles and demanded that their subjects address them accordingly. For example, Augustus, the first Roman emperor, preferred to be called ""Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus"" (Emperor Caesar, Son of the Divine, Augustus). This emphasized their authority and divine connection.

Chinese Emperors: Chinese emperors held immense power and were known by a variety of titles throughout history. The most common was ""Huangdi"" or ""Di"" (meaning Emperor), and they expected their subjects to use honorifics when referring to them, such as ""Your Majesty"" or ""Son of Heaven.""

European Monarchs: European monarchs often had specific titles and pronouns associated with their status. For instance, King Louis XIV of France insisted on being referred to as ""Louis le Grand"" (Louis the Great) and used the pronoun ""we"" instead of ""I"" to emphasize his authority.

Japanese Emperors: Japanese emperors, known as ""tenn≈ç,"" had specific titles and pronouns. For example, Emperor Hirohito, who reigned during World War II, was referred to as ""Tenn≈ç Heika"" (His Imperial Majesty) and used the pronoun ""watakushi"" to signify his status as the highest authority in Japan.

The Pope: The Pope, as the head of the Roman Catholic Church, holds the title of ""Holy Father"" or ""His Holiness"" and is addressed accordingly. The Pope's pronouns are typically the masculine forms associated with his office, such as ""he"" and ""him.""

These are just a few examples, and there are many more instances throughout history where leaders demanded specific titles and pronouns to assert their authority and reflect their elevated status."

If you are advocating to separate previously synonymous words(sex and gender) to make people feel more comfortable in their own skin with arbitrary labels than you should say that. If you‚Äôre arguing that transpeople should be treated fairly and equally under the law than you should say that. I don‚Äôt like the shifting goal post arguments where definitions constantly change and what people say isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwhat they actually mean‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt think transpeople can ever be the  opposite sex but rather fall into their own category of well, transpeople. But please cmv."
1,2023-07-09,CMV: Leviticus is not anti-LGBTQ,u/FerdinandTheGiant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14v0tes/cmv_leviticus_is_not_antilgbtq/,changemyview,"I should clarify my stance: The Leviticus passages do not contain a blanket condemnation of homosexuality or any message that when looked at within its historical context reads that way unambiguously. Originally I was going to do the entire Bible, but I thought this would get too long so I just wanted to do Leviticus. 

I should also clarify I don‚Äôt know Greek or Hebrew but will be attempting to rely on literal translations from those instead of poor English translations just to make the  true ambiguous nature of the verses in question shine through. 

I‚Äôll address the clobber passages, these being Leviticus 20:13 and 18:22, 

Leviticus 18:22 literally says: *‚ÄúAnd with a male do not lie down the lyings of a woman abomination it is.‚Äù* The phrase ‚Äúlyings of‚Ä¶‚Äù used here is the the plural construct form of ‚Äòmishkav‚Äô, (mishkevei) used only one other time in Genesis 49:4 and that is typically translated as bed. The passage reading in the KJV reads *‚ÄúUnstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's **bed**; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.‚Äù* This is in reference to, Reuben, who slept with Jacob‚Äôs concubine, Bilhah. If one were to apply the same usage of mishkevei as was used in Leviticus, you find that the meaning is essentially ‚ÄúReuben had sex with Bilhah as with his father‚Äù. Obviously Reuben doesn‚Äôt have sex with his dad so it appears that he was violating his dad by having sex ‚Äúas if he *was* his father‚Äù in so far that he is taking his sexual role by engaging with his concubine. This kind of hierarchy of sex appears quite common in the Ancient Near East. It used to be taboo for your wife to be on top because it robbed the man of his vitality. I‚Äôll get into this more when talking about Paul which I may do in another post to address Corinthians.

 Anyways, with that in mind, it appears that this usage, when applied to Leviticus, greatly changes the meaning. It is not about homosexuality or homosexual sex, it would be about violating the sexual hierarchy by having sex with a man as if he was a woman. I‚Äôve already seen it argued that it‚Äôs clarifying that sleeping with a man while cheating on your wife is the meaning. This is consistent with the usages of singular usages of mishkav which are used for adultery. This reading is seen in the Nedarim 51a as well, with the rabbi being told the Leviticus passages referred to engaging with a man outside of engagement with his wife. 

Obviously the interpretation changed over time, every text needs to be negotiated with , but I believe the intent was not a simple ban on homosexuality or a blanket condemnation of homosexual male sex either. The Ancient Near East didn‚Äôt have any concept of homosexual or heterosexual and based the motivations for sexual acts into completely different categories than we do today. These passages also completely leave out lesbian relationships, likely because women weren‚Äôt of concern when it came to the sexual hierarchy."

In these places men deserve the same choices. If he does not want to be a father, does not want that particular child or does not want a child with that woman, he too deserves those choices. 
Unlike motherhood which has 100% certainty of which woman is the mother. Fatherhood is not always accurately determined, this can be for any/all of several different reasons. So the alleged father should have no more time to make his decision than the mother. Ex: if abortion is only allowed up to 3 month, he also deserves the same 3 months to weigh his opinions. The obvious question would be at what time should his time clock start? I propose that his time should start at the date he is legally served either a ‚Äúformal accusation of fatherhood‚Äù (a sworn & signed statement by the mother, accusing him of impregnating her legally served on him) or the date the state legally determines paternity. Which ever happens first. If men are obligated to accept that abortion & motherhood is entirely a woman‚Äôs choice, then women should be equally obligated to accept that fatherhood, raising a child &/or paying child support be entirely a man‚Äôs choice, with the same time limitations to make the choice of course. Would this not be truly equal & fair to both potential parents?"

Christians argue that liberalism, progressivisim, and leftism often rejects the existence of God in favor of a system favoring man. Secularists and agnostics argue that the traditional family values and faith of conservatism tends to be tied to Abrahamic religions like Christianity.

To me, I noticed this weird correlation between being a leftist and being an atheist, agnostic, or SBNR (spiritual but not religious). What I am trying to say is that it seems impossible to reconcile Christianity with progressive politics. I heard Christians argue that Jesus would favor capitalism, oppose socialism, and would believe that affirmative action is racist."
0,2023-07-09,"CMV: Men and women can be friends, but not close friends.",u/BiryaniEater10,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14v3uhs/cmv_men_and_women_can_be_friends_but_not_close/,changemyview,"There's the age old discussion of if straight men and women can be friends or not and people talk about it in a binary of ""absolutely yes"" or ""absolutely no."" I think the correct answer is mostly no, since they can be cordial with one another but not close friends.   
A lot of people ask ""what about bisexuals"" and ""you need to trust them"" but that really misses the point.  
The issue is that societally, men and women's non-work related interactions always carry some sort of air that things could potentially sexual, even if the man and woman are not into each other.  For example, let's say I'm at a food plaza in a mall, and I see a guy eating who is wearing the jersey of the same obscure soccer team I support. And I, and most people, do not wear their orientation on their sleeve. Regardless of whether I'm gay, straight, or bisexual, this would be seen as a very forward (given it's a convo with a stranger), but relatively normal convo, whereas if I try to talk like this to a woman, the first thing she's gonna wonder is why I'm trying to hit on her.  
Another example is, outside of people absolutely entrenched in toxic masculinity, I could also give a comment to a male friend, or even a stranger, complimenting their choice of clothes. I could say nice shirt/shorts, pants, or shoes, and it's taken as a normal compliment. However, in the case of a woman, if I were to say nice shirt/shorts, or nice dress/shoes, the comment will be taken as an advance on her/flirting, which in fairness, is true of most men giving those types of compliments.   
Now, what does this have to do with why men and women, particularly those in relationships, can't have close friends of the opposite sex. It's because in a man-woman close friendship, there are certain assumptions that we as a society make that would make it incompatible with being in a relationship. When opposite sex friendships between men and women generally give an appearance of and are associated with flirtation, it's very difficult to ask the SO to ""just accept"" that their SO can have friends of any gender. At the end of the day, there's \*plenty\* of options for close friends with people of the same sex, so maybe it's better to stick to them and avoid the hassle."

Retirement money is good, and there are people who are too stupid to save for retirement who may need it.

But let me ask you, if you walked up to 100 people who are CURRENTLY WORKING, and asked them if they could use the money that is taken from them right now in a more efficient way (paying off a house, roth IRA, stocks, gold, etc), how many of them do you think would say yes?

My point is that some people who are better at saving or want to invest in more lucrative retirement options should have the ability to opt out of social security when they work. If they feel that something else would serve them better, and is acknowledging that they are taking the risk and accepting it, why should we not let them use their money the way they see fit?

Its like how a public option polls at like 75%, while medicare 4 all is like 23%, people like the CHOICE to do what they want, whether that be a public option, or a private solution they can tailor to their particular needs.

To be clear, This doesnt change SS at all, the people who cant save anything can still take part in it, the only change is that those who dont want it arent forced into it. I feel the same way about medicare, if you feel like a private solution is better, then I think you are entitled to do what you want with your own money.

I was convinced this has no downsides, some people can accept the risk and do what they want, others can continue with the normal system. Im curious to hear other perspectives"
1,2023-07-09,CMV: Stop making excuses for them,u/Excellent_Lime6556,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14v70sj/cmv_stop_making_excuses_for_them/,changemyview,"Let me provide some background information about myself. I am 23 years old, born in California, and was raised in South Korea for around 7 years before returning to the United States at the age of 8.

I can't help but wonder why black folks are so prone to committing crimes. Sure, not all African Americans commit crimes, but after correcting for population and errors, it appears that they do commit more than other groups on average.  And, no, they are not being targeted by cops; we are discussing homicides. This data carefully follows what other European countries, such as the United Kingdom and France, record, not only the United States.

I've never understood why individuals make justifications for such actions. Racism, enslavement, and poverty do not justify criminal behavior. Since the end of Jim Crow, single parenthood rates in black neighborhoods have skyrocketed; is this a cultural issue or a result of systemic racism? If this is the case, why are they dropping out of high school at considerably higher rates than the rest of the population? Why is it that research reveals that affluent blacks are more likely than impoverished whites to commit a crime? There are numerous sources, and it has been thoroughly examined. I'm not sure why it's so difficult to discuss matters like these. Stereotypes may be inaccurate and may not apply to ALL people but hold a certain truth.

The concept of reality as a social construct was discussed by Peter Berger in his book ‚ÄòThe Social Construction of Reality‚Äô. Human relationships shape our society. Essentially, we build our own reality, which includes both what we want to believe and what we don't want to believe. You will always find a way to persuade yourself that something is true when it isn't. This is known as secondary belief of elaborations. Of course, growing up in California, my thoughts were not always accepted, but as a student here at Berkeley, I strive to be as objective as possible while evaluating cases. Please persuade me that I am incorrect, based on my own personal experience. From road rage incidents to getting my car broken into, it always seems to be a particular category, age 18-22 black males. I am curious, please do not hold back, I am not a snowflake when it comes to disagreements. If it isn‚Äôt genetic then what is it?

Lastly, higher education is fucked, there needs to be some reform, we not teaching anymore we are brainwashing these students and pushing useless agendas on them.

Now onto my post, rape is often framed as a woman's issue but I don't think it's effective to think about it that way. Now while I don't dispute that rape probably does happen to women more, I'd argue that it's not as uncommon as we think for it to happen to men. It happens in jails and people are kinda just ok with that and actually find it humorous. What a lot or people don't know is that there are times when men will rape other men, not for sexual gratification, but rather to humiliate the man. Popular streamer Bart Kwan actually told a story about how he forced a broomstick up a guys butt, and laughed about it and last I checked he hasn't been banned from YouTube and I think the video is still up. 

Anyway there are multiple instances I remember that years down the line made me thing ""wow that person's a predator"". I knew many women who would intentionally feed guys who otherwise weren't attracted to them drinks, then seduce them into sleeping with them. I also knew some gay men who literally had a game where they would see how many straight guys they could 'turn' (meaning get them drunk and have sex with). I knew one girl who revealed that she intentionally sabotaged a guys condom, in order to get pregnant which she did, but ended up getting an abortion after realizing he wasn't going to stay. At the time I found it pretty weird but it didn't register until much later that these people are disgusting and should probably be in jail.

I mainly blame this on the way that rape and sexually assault is taught. It's always taught that it's something that men do to women so when it happens the other way around I think it goes unnoticed or is ignored. I think the legal system has consistently fumbled the bag when it comes to these sorts of cases for everyone. 

In my opinion it would be much more effective to have the discussion of rape and sexual assualt be about victims vs perpatrators, not men vs women. To CMV, prove to me that it's more effective to center it around women, preferably with solid info"

This post will rattle whoever reads it. I do not care. Brace yourself. It will be a hell of a ride. And it is not even an opinion. It is based on hundreds of sexual encounters I have had with cis men. It is based on my observations.  
  
You cannot take what men say at face value. It is always the ugliest and most repulsive men who will loudly proclaim that they will never touch a trans woman with a ten-foot pole. However, they are lying. Men are very visual. If a trans woman looks very good, men will definitely have sex with her.  
  
You do not see thousands and thousands of videos of cis men loudly proclaiming that they would never date a paraplegic person or a person with Down syndrome. Why do they have this need to say they would never touch a trans woman?  
  
I am living proof of that. I am a post-op trans woman and wherever I go, men hit on me. Straight men. Regular men. Men accompanied by their manky wives ogle me and wink at me. Why? Because they think I was born a woman and I look good. I have had SAFE sex with literally hundreds of men. I have lived in 4 different countries and traveled the world. Something doesn't fucking add up here. You see all these fugly mofos claiming that they would never touch a trans woman with a ten-foot pole, and yet they all want to have sex with me,  
  
Your chromosomes are absolutely irrelevant when it comes to straight men. You need to be incredibly and naturally feminine, you need to look exceptionally good and have a realistic looking vulva. When these studs insert their penises in my designer vagina, they are not thinking about my chromosomes. They love all of the female signifiers I have.  
  
""Biology, biology, biology"" fuck that shit. It is not that simple. Sexual attraction is not solely biological. Nature and nurture are not mutually exclusive. How do you explain that men love lingerie and high heels and women dressed up to the nine? There is no biological reason for that. There is no evolutionary reason as to why men get a boner when they see a woman with lingery It's because throgh social conditioning men have been wired to be attracted to signifiers that are typically associated with women. Whoever has studied semiotics knows that these signifiers are arbitrary. There is no biological reason as to why blue is associated with boys and pink is associated with girl, for example. Significance attribution is arbitrary.  
  
Trans women are the whipping post of our society. Everyone feels entitled to shit on trans women. Behind closed doors, it‚Äôs a completely different story. Did you know that trans P\*RN is one of the most watched types? Something doesn‚Äôt add up, because all of these ugly men are loudly proclaiming that they would never touch a trans woman with a ten-foot pole, and yet that is not how it pans out in real life.  
  
Personally, since I am post-op, I no longer disclose my trans status. I am very picky. I only like men under 30, above 6‚Ä≤1‚Ä≤‚Äô, with a full head of hair, and well-endowed. I will never settle for anything else. I do not like bald men, shortlets, old farts, men with small penises.  
  
As for children: I hate children, I despise them. I do not want children, I do not want to be around children, I do not want to see your children‚Äôs photos, and I will not adopt children. I want childfree restaurants and airlines. Give me any animal any day, including snakes. I would prefer a roach pet over having children. Most of these men who want children have defective genes. They should not be breeding because they will only create more miserable lives. Plus, have you seen what childbirth does to a woman‚Äôs body? A woman‚Äôs value exponentially decreases after she pops up fetuses. So, no, thank you. I tell these men I date right off the bat that I passionately despise children, and they do not say anything.  
  
And do not believe the lies these men are telling you. They would have no problem with an infertile cis woman. Most of them do not even want children but are trying to use that excuse as an easy way out.

Margaret Sanger was a social reformer and the founder of the birth control movement in the United States. She also supported eugenics, which is the idea of improving the human race by selective breeding. She should be known for being a racist who wanted to exterminate the African American population, but instead, she is known for being a ""champion of womens rights."" Which is just a nice way of saying that she founded one of the biggest Genocide inducing companies to ever exist, along with destableizing the nuclear family and making mass genocide of children an accetable thing.

Instead of always giving your own take, it's usually better to ask about someone else's take and understand where they are coming from. If someone says something stupid, you don't need to correct them (you can riff and banter with them about it, but don't be the ""um ahkshually"" guy). If you're at a dinner party, don't be the pedantic intellectual person, be the person who is fun to be around. 

Here's the thing, a lot of people are extremely intelligent, but they are capable of playing ""the dumb guy."" There is such a thing as being dumb in a smart way, if that makes sense. A lot of comedians are a really good example of this. These types of people are way more fun to be around than someone who is always trying to be the smartest person in the room. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you should just go around making fart jokes and never saying anything of substance, I'm just saying you have to be tactful about it. You have to read the room. People can still recognize you're smart without you having to try to show it off. I'm sure we all knew those kids in high school who were smart but had no friends and didn't get invited to parties because they were always trying to be the intellectual. 

I'll make an analogy with music. Let's say you're at a party, and you play a lyrical, deep, and poetic rap song with a simple boom bap beat that has immaculate pen game, or you play a piece of classical music with a complex composition. Then you play a catchy trap banger with dumb lyrics about doing percocets and lean. The latter is going to be a lot more hype and fun than the former. This isn't a perfect analogy but you get what I mean."

1,2023-07-09,CMV: The contraceptive pill should be banned.,u/Vast_Painting1487,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14vg56e/cmv_the_contraceptive_pill_should_be_banned/,changemyview,"The birth control pill liberated women gave them control over their reproduction, freedom to live lifestyles equal to men by overcoming their biological limits. These are really good things.

 The lens I use to measure progress however is different than this more conventional metric. I don't think freedom, while a necessary condition to live a meaningful and happy life, is always and everywhere good. A pattern that I repeatedly see in the story of human progress can be described by the term ""the coincidence of opposites"" which poses that As you get farther and farther away in one direction, you don't get farther and farther away from that thing you hope to flee, you start to find that you're approaching it again. Like if somebody were to walk in a straight line across the globe they'll end up in the same spot they started.

For example, once we graduated from hunter-gatherer societies, and began to develop agriculture and animal husbandry, we've succeeded to stop parasitically feeding off the earth and replace our food supply but then we developed hierarchies based on land ownership and inequalities between those who owned and didn't own land and wars over land because after the agricultural revolution land had value and could produce excess food that could be stored and sold, freeing people to do other things. 

But was hunter-gathering really so bad? We were accustomed to it, and people still lived happy lives before the agricultural revolution. The ability to create 20x more food didn't make people 20x happier. In fact, populations exploded so much that the increase in population eventually ate any gains from agriculture's economic efficiency and the gains also became consolidated and monopolized by whoever could monopolize violence. We, essentially, ended up back where we started. Not any happier. 

Then the industrial revolution came and liberated us from our subsistence farms because 1% of the population can now feed the other 99% freeing us to create many new jobs to buy the excess food and to urbanize. But these new jobs were often really dehumanizing, they objectified us by reducing us to a single function in a factory that were often repetitive, long and dangerous. Not much more fulfilling than working on a farm and it removed your labor contribution further and further from the final product. Essentially alienating you from your labor and your work. Creating 1000x more food didn't make us 1000x  more happy. 

Skipping to today, social media and smartphones is a prime example of this coincidence of opposities. We sought to connect everyone digitally and instantaneously but never before have we been more isolated. 60% of Americans report feeling lonely on a regular basis according to a survey of 10,000 Americans by Cigna.  

I think one reason the story of human progress keeps running into this happiness paradox described by the ""coincidence of opposites"" is because we don't know what we truly want and that's because we don't know who we truly are. Our evolutionary environment built men to be hunters, women to be gatherers, to wake up and go to sleep with the sun, to be outside with nature, to reproduce, raise kids and then die. Everything else we've added to the mix is making our biological  and social systems uncalibrated by becoming biased to different environmental extremes other than what we were evolved for. 

Now finally, how does this relate to the birth control pill? While reproductive control brought all sorts of freedoms, I think we're ignoring the fact that women's biology is the reason sexual exclusivity was a norm, getting and staying married was considered a virtue and two parent households were common and motherhood and fatherhood were clearly distinct and specialized roles. Since women can mimic male biology through biohacking, they can also subvert social roles that used to belong to men like parenting, causing a much higher incidence of divorce and single motherhood. A survey from the University of Pennsylvania showed that both women's and men's self reported happiness started falling between 1970 and 2005 right around when the contraceptive pill became widely adopted by 1 in 4 married women in 1965.

This experiment in female biohacking is causing ripple effects onto our life scripts and social roles, becoming more and more unaligned with the environment and incentives we evolved around. While there are many converging societal trends causing male and female unhappiness, and birth control pill might not be the main one, I do suspect the downstream effects of the pill is showing up in these well-being states by eroding socially assigned roles and life scripts for the genders that incentivized long term bonds."

I haven't tried therapy, but I'm aware of what it entails, and I'm know for a fact that therapists don't offer any groundbreaking solutions that can instantly transform your life. So what's the point in going to therapy?

A common response to my previous point is that therapy is not a quick fix but rather a means of guidance to help resolve personal issues. However, I find it difficult to see a distinction between the support provided by therapists and that offered by friends or family. Therapists do not offer unique insights that are beyond the capabilities of those close to us. Consequently, therapy appears to be redundant since both therapists and personal connections (friends/family) serve as guides, acknowledging that neither can fully resolve our problems. In light of this, I question the rationale behind seeking therapy when it's no more effective than just talking to your friends/family.

I personally perceive the act of paying someone to discuss my problems as disingenuous and artificial. It feels more like a business transaction rather than a genuine attempt to provide support. I believe that therapists are primarily driven by financial motives rather than a sincere intention to help people. Therapists have their own personal lives and challenges. They too have financial obligations such as bills to pay, expenses, and families to support. Some of them may even have the same issues as their clients. In reality, their primary focus is more about using their profession as a means to sustain their desired lifestyle and achieve financial comfort, and less about the psychological well being of their clients. 

I find it pointless to engage in therapy when I believe that my therapist is not fully invested in listening to what I have to say. They have their own problems to deal with, and they have a tight schedule as well. Therefore, they not only lack unique insights, but they also seem to lack genuine investment in understanding and addressing my problems, unlike my friends who may be more personally invested in supporting me.

Making it bankruptcy dischargeable means banks have to analyze who they are lending to and if they have the means to repay it. That means they will check assets or your parents means to repay it, and/or check if you are majoring in something that is traditionally associated with a good income - doctor, nurses, lawyers, engineers etc... AND how likely you are to even finish it.

This will effectively close off education to the poor, children of immigrants and immigrants themselves, and people studying non-STEM/law degrees.

Education in the right field DOES lead to climbing social ladders. Most nurses come from poor /working class backgrounds, and earn a good living for example. I used to pick between eating a meal and affording a bus fair, I made 6 figures as a nurse before starting nurse anesthesia school.

Even for those not in traditionally high earning degrees, there is plenty of people who comment ""well actually my 'useless' degree is making me 6 figures, it's all about how you use it...""

>A judge has warned of the dangers of driving at ""excessive and unreasonable"" speed after a doctor, driving below 30mph (48km/h), hit a 12-year-old girl.

>Dr Shanthi Chandran was driving at 28mph (45km/h) through Oxfordshire, in January 2018, when the girl stepped onto a pedestrian crossing.

>She was driving at an ""excessive, unsafe and unreasonable"" speed

Now, it is completely and entirely possible that this person might have been driving without propper awareness to the wider road. Any sensible road user should know that speed is just one factor when driving, and you should be considering the whole road, paying attention for possible dangers, and contemplating anything that could be even potentially hazardous. I'm perfectly ready to accept that this doctor was not driving with the apt level of care and consideration, and that the injuries they caused to this child was at least partly their fault.

However, what I cannot get on board with is this judge's assertation that the speed Dr Chandran was driving at was anything less than reasonable. They were literally driving below the speed limit. The limit that the law has put in place as a compromise between safety and efficiency for road users.

You can say ""they should have slowed down when they saw the hazard"" or ""they should have swerved to avoid the person"" etc, but you cannot say ""they should have been driving slower"" because the law says they shouldn't. The law literally says ""in this area, driving at 30mph is entirely fine"".

So I really cannot understand why the judge is saying 28mph is ""excessive, unsafe and unreasonable"". The argument just doesn't make sense. How can it be excessive, unsafe or unreasonable when the law has literally said ""you can go this fast here""?"

I'm not saying wear a suit and tie everyday. Clean and stylish clothes (whatever your style is), a well trimmed beard and haircut, a subtle perfume or cologne.

As much as Reddit may disagree society as a whole puts a great value in this. Taking proper care of yourself shows that you can care for others and are willing to make an effort. I think its nuts how many people are willing to die on this hill of ""I don't care what society thinks of me."" I garuntee you will miss many opportunities and have a way less fulfilled life with this attitude.

It's just crazy to me how many people are just content to look like absolute slobs then wonder why they can't get a date, missed a promotion, or have a hard time making friends. I used to be that guy. I started caring about my appearance and it made a world of difference.

First, almost everything Americans use or eat comes from the work of migrant workers or sweatshop workers from poorer countries.

Second, I don't see how it's much different from the minimum wage system where people work several hours a day to barely make enough to afford rent or even eat well. I see so much gofundmes everyday, people with college degrees having to work as janitors or almost being forced into homelessness because they couldn't pay their rent for that month.

The third world may have beggars on the streets but atleast they don't get thrown into jail and can survive on charity.

Both systems are bad, I think it's just hypocritical for Americans to judge people who have servants when I don't see how it's much different from someone working in a diner who has to be yelled at by their boss every minute. Servants aren't slaves, and most often are treated as family. It's still bad though don't get it wrong."
28,2023-07-10,CMV: Modern music is great.,u/Fando1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14vsynm/cmv_modern_music_is_great/,changemyview,"I am speaking more broadly about music as an art form, as opposed to the music industry or the pop charts. 

Music as an art has been democratised by modern technology, in a way that has allowed almost anyone to create a great sounding record in their bedroom. Further to this, social media has allowed these same creators to distribute their music to a wider audience.

When I grew up, record labels and radio producers were effectively the gate keepers, deciding who would 'make it' and who wouldn't. They were a small, impenetrable network who would arbitrate on what music would be recorded, what would be played on radio, and hence what consumers would be able to listen to. 

It was a system rife with nepotism, where old men who'd never played an instrument in their lives would decide who had 'the look' based on their own subjective opinions (or, as was often the case, just signing their neices, nephews and sons/daughters of their mates).

The end result was a narrow set of musical styles, created by a narrow demographic of musicians. 

The quality of musicianship was also very low, with the main focus being asthetics Vs craft. 

Contrast this to now. Young musicians push themselves technically and artistically unincumbered by large labels or corporation's. Able to find a niche and develop a strong online following. Producing a vast range of different styles and often pushing the envelope on what is sonically possible. 

If you are a music fan, you may dislike one particular genre or fad (perhaps you don't like grime, or djent, or neo jazz), but there are still a million more to choose from that simply didn't exist 20 years ago. And a host of great artists writing within those."
1,2023-07-10,CMV: Casually dating multiple people should be the norm prior to settling down in a monogamous relationship,u/vi891,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14vtsag/cmv_casually_dating_multiple_people_should_be_the/,changemyview,"It is such a huge commitment to only be with one person indefinitely. And most people agree to such a commitment within only a few months of getting to know each other, and for some people as little as a week. I don't understand why people view getting into a monogamous relationship as something that isn't that serious. It's not much different than an agreement of marriage aside from the legal difficulties that would be involved in the event of a break up/divorce. 

I think that casually dating people for at least a few years as a teen and young adult before choosing to settle down with a single person would be beneficial for a number of reasons. First, it would allow people to have comparisons and see what they truly want and what makes them happy/unhappy in a romantic/sexual relationship. I think this could also lower the amount of people who ignore the red flags in a relationship that becomes abusive because they've been able to see what it's like to be treated right by others or had the time and experiences necessary to realize the traits of an abusive person.

Additionally, it could help prevent the grass is greener effect that people tend to experience in long-term relationships when they haven't had much experience seeing people other than their partner. Having dated multiple other people, they are able to make a much more well-informed choice on who they want to spend their lives with and be more certain that they made the right decision without having to ignore as many doubts.

A person would also be able to develop way better communication skills as they'd have to interact with people who may have very different needs/styles of communication. And they may be more exposed to their own faults as well and be able to work through them prior to settling into a serious relationship.

And lastly, it allows people to develop more as a person. Having at least a few years without dependence on a single guy/girl allows the person to develop their own independence, helping prevent possible codepence in their future relationship because they know how to be on their own and rely on themselves. And the experiences they get with many other people allows them to be exposed to so many different hobbies/areas of life that they may have missed out on had they chosen to lock themselves down in a relationship with one person. This would allow a person to have a better understanding of themselves, have more dynamic interests, likes, and dislikes, and a fuller life experience in general.

EDIT: my view has been changed. I now think that rather than this being the norm, it should be normalized. I still think it's beneficial for the reasons I listed, however I think alternative dating styles like the one I mentioned, in addition to monogamy, should be more accepted in today's society, rather than one being the typical or being pushed onto young people before they've had the chance to figure out what works best for them"

Ironically, these are the same protest tactics employed during the Civil Rights Movement. However, some redditors who openly mock and insult modern-day activists, whether they advocate for environmental causes, animal rights, or other social issues, tend to view the Civil Rights activists who utilized similar tactics as heroes. They commend their approach, praising it as the ""right way"" to protest.

This stark contrast in attitudes raises questions about the consistency and understanding of protest tactics throughout history.

1,2023-07-10,CMV: Quantum entanglement provides strong evidence for the existence of parallel universes,u/Federal_Penalty5832,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14w0wqy/cmv_quantum_entanglement_provides_strong_evidence/,changemyview,"Allow me to clarify my viewpoint from the onset: I'm of the firm conviction that the phenomenon of quantum entanglement provides substantial evidence supporting the existence of parallel universes. It's not just a wild theory; it's an inference rooted in the very principles that underlie the fabric of our reality.

Firstly, let's delve into the concept of quantum entanglement. This phenomenon, as validated by a multitude of experiments, entails that two or more particles become inextricably linked, regardless of the spatial distance separating them. If one changes its state, the other instantaneously mirrors the change. Einstein himself called this ""spooky action at a distance"". It defies our conventional understanding of the universe and the speed of light as the cosmic speed limit.

If we were to interpret these observations through the lens of the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics, a fascinating possibility emerges. It suggests that for every quantum event, the universe 'splits', creating a multitude of parallel universes. Each universe represents a different outcome of the quantum event. The interconnectedness observed in quantum entanglement could then be interpreted as interactions across these myriad universes.

This interpretation, though admittedly speculative, isn't baseless. The mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics does not rule out the existence of these parallel realities. In fact, MWI maintains the pure wave function of quantum mechanics without collapsing it, something that many other interpretations struggle to achieve.

I concede that concrete empirical evidence for parallel universes remains elusive, but this isn't an adequate refutation. Consider dark matter and dark energy. Our inability to directly observe or measure them doesn't negate their existence; instead, we infer their reality from their undeniable effects on our observable universe.

This discussion is complex, intertwining the principles of quantum physics, theoretical physics, and philosophy. However, my argument isn't predicated on complexity but on the inherent nature of quantum reality itself. If you're skeptical, I'd urge you to question not just the interpretation, but the very quantum phenomena validated by rigorous empirical data.

That's where my viewpoint stands. So, here's the gauntlet I throw down: Can you present a compelling counterargument that effectively separates the phenomenon of quantum entanglement from the possibility of parallel universes? Or is the skepticism towards parallel universes born from a reluctance to step outside the comfort zone of our observable universe?"

The credit scoring system in America is not made for consumers, it is made for lenders. The system is broken and favors white, upper-middle class people who are not chronically ill. People from marginalized groups such as black people tend to have lower scores which means higher interest rates on loans, higher chance of denial of credit, denial of approval for an apartment, and even difficulty gaining employment.

The system needs to be reformed in a way that promotes equity to economically disadvantaged people. First, paid-in-full collections accounts should be able to ""fall off"" of a persons credit report before the 7.5 year anniversary from the date of first delinquency if it is paid in full and NOT settled.

Second, missed payments that are more than 2 years old should be discarded from a credit report.

Like if I don't feel comfortable with something my ex-gf's would do or with the way my wife is acting around other men, I used to just automatically write off my feelings as irrational insecurities and suppress them.

But recently I have been realizing that some of my feelings are pretty rational, and certain things that I felt uncomfortable with were actually not okay, and I should set boundaries for myself in these areas. 

There's a few different explanations for these feelings. 

1. Being cheated on is actually a very traumatic experience, which produces automatic triggers, similar to somebody becoming jumpy in a car after a serious accident. So sometimes things are under control and the response is irrational, but the heightened sense of awareness makes it literally impossible to tell the difference as it happens. And one of the worst things you can do is blame someone for how they feel, saying ""you're just insecure"", which makes it sounds like you're weak and a coward. But being afraid after a traumatic event DOES NOT make someone a coward at all. It takes bravery to face those fears.
2. The situation can actually be rationally threatening. Like in the same way you should be afraid of stepping on a rattlesnake, there are certain behaviors between men and women who are in committed relationships that are not acceptable; things that are actually unfaithful and do hurt the other person. You wouldn't feel safe with seeing a kid walking into a busy street, but when you don't feel safe with your partner flirting with other people and not having boundaries with them, it's irrational to feel unsafe? It's just your insecurity. 

Also there seems to be a disparity between what men and women feel in these areas. It seems the majority of people will say women's feelings are valid and then completely disregard men's feelings and call him irrational, insecure, or controlling. This has led me to automatically respond to women's feelings and do what makes them feel comfortable while suppressing my own because I write them off as irrational.

I do not believe there are 9 planets, but rather 12, as that includes the other Pluto-like bodies that have been discovered since the definition of a planet changed: Ceres, Makemake and Eris.

The reason I disagree with the new definition of a planet is I just see no utility to it other than to disregard an important region in a solar system in the face of scientific curiosity. The public is less willing to support funding a mission or study of a celestial body if they didn't grow up thinking of it as having importance. The ""ice dwarf"" planets could potentially hold key insight into the history of our solar system and life itself, and deserve a spotlight.

A much better definition of a planet would be ""object orbiting a star that is massive enough to crush itself into a roughly spherical shape."" Such a body should not have to ""push all other objects out of its orbital path"" in order to be considered significant in the face of astronomy.

I see a lot of what I would even dare to call ""disinformation"" emerging from sources even such as PBS, where it is claimed that it would be impractical to consider Pluto a planet because there are several hundred similar objects. Like I said, there are only three other Pluto-like objects known to science. You can consider Pluto a planet without considering a car-sized meteor in its orbit a planet as well."

Pandas are the most docile of all bears. There has never been an instance of a panda killing someone. It is also entirely possible for pandas to bond with humans.

I don‚Äôt know if you see the life pandas are living in zoos but it is not great. There are civilians out there that can give pandas a much better life than the zoos can, which are only operated by greed.

1,2023-07-10,"CMV: There are some fairly solid arguments in favour of letting trans women use women's spaces, but most also imply that there should be no gender or sex -split spaces at all/that men should be allowed into such spaces too",u/forbiddenmemeories,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14w573k/cmv_there_are_some_fairly_solid_arguments_in/,changemyview,"First off, this is gonna be a long one, so apologies in advance.  
  
So I have seen a number of arguments frequently put forward when the debate of trans women being present in women‚Äôs-only spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms, refuge centres or prisons, arguing that they should indeed be welcome in these spaces. Some are more based on practicality, others more on certain moral claims, but I think the main arguments I have seen do have some merits and are often pretty consistent with other attitudes we have towards inclusion versus exclusion.  
  
However, what I do find a little strange is that many of the same arguments could also be used similarly effectively to argue that the existence of single-sex or single-gender spaces at all is wrong, and that everyone ‚Äì male or female, cis or trans, etc. ‚Äì should be equally free to use whichever spaces they like. Segregation by gender or sex is a rare case of segregation that has remained largely uncontroversial until the recent past, but with the debate having now been re-opened, I think it‚Äôs hard to consistently argue in favour of maintaining any such form of segregation whilst arguing that excluding trans women from women‚Äôs spaces specifically is wrong. I will go through the most common arguments that I‚Äôve seen in favour of letting trans women use women‚Äôs-only spaces, and explain why I feel each one could also plausibly be used to argue against the existence of women‚Äôs-only spaces at all, or spaces from which anyone of any sex or gender identity can be excluded.  
  
(It should of course be noted that vice versa also applies; I also feel that these arguments make the case that cis men or men in general should not be able to maintain spaces just for them that exclude trans men or any women. I have merely chosen to focus on the cases of trans women in women‚Äôs spaces and the existence of women‚Äôs spaces in general, as I‚Äôm by and large responding to a debate that‚Äôs already happening, and the opposite tends to generate much less controversy and heated argument.)  
  
**Impracticality and invasiveness of excluding people**  
  
One common argument that I‚Äôve seen is that attempting to prevent trans women from using women‚Äôs-only spaces would either be highly impractical and/or necessitate an extreme and embarrassing invasion of people‚Äôs privacy. In some cases, it does indeed seem implausible to think that, for example, every women‚Äôs bathroom or changing room could feature some kind of ID check to prove that all entrants were born female to prevent trans women from entering, plus we may simply see many people using some kind of fake ID, or many people may be so uninterested in enforcing the checks as to make them entirely unsuccessful. On the other hand, attempting to directly ‚Äòverify‚Äô someone‚Äôs sex such as by inspecting their genitalia would be an extremely invasive and humiliating ordeal to put someone through, one we could hardly countenance, particularly as given the very cis women the measure was allegedly to protect would have to face the same checks too.  
  
This to me seems like a pretty strong line of argument. I can imagine at least some settings in which someone‚Äôs sex could be verified both practically and without the need for anything all that invasive ‚Äì if they were signing up for a sports league, for example, it probably wouldn‚Äôt be that hard to ask for a birth certificate or a letter from a GP confirming what sex the person was assigned at birth ‚Äì but for very mundane stuff like bathrooms, it does indeed seem pretty hard to enforce. However, I think most of the above points would also hold true for a man who wanted to similarly access a space reserved only for cis or trans women. Checking the ID of every somewhat masculine-looking person at the door of every bathroom or changing room would be similarly impractical and inspecting their bodies similarly invasive, and would also run the same risk of harming some of the very people the measure was apparently to protect. At this stage, unerringly enforcing any kind of gender or sex segregation of these spaces seems impossible, and thus, maintaining women‚Äôs-only spaces at all does present a bit of a practical headache and the sacrificing of some people‚Äôs dignity to ensure that the current users of those spaces feel safe. If that trade-off is unjust when it comes to trans women, it‚Äôs surely unjust when it comes to men too.  
  
**Wrongness of collective punishment**  
  
Another common argument I‚Äôve seen is that the exclusion of trans women from women‚Äôs-only spaces on the grounds of fears for cis women‚Äôs safety amounts to a kind of collective punishment. There have indeed been a few cases of trans women (or at least, people claiming to be trans women) assaulting women in these spaces, but the vast majority of trans women have not done so and it would seem fair to assume will not do so at any point in the future. It is thus unreasonable and prejudicial to set out a blanket ban on a whole group of people availing of certain spaces simply because some people from that group have used it as a route to committing crimes; it would be as wrong as something like forbidding all Muslims from using public transport because a handful of Islamic extremists have committed terror attacks.  
  
This again is I think a promising enough line of argument and pretty consistent with our wider values. We do tend to treat people as individuals and to regard the stereotyping of whole groups or the indelible association of certain bad character traits or crimes with whole groups as irrational and harmful. And we hold to principles of ‚Äòinnocent until proven guilty‚Äô, so it seems unreasonable to restrict someone‚Äôs activities over a potential crime they may commit when to date they have done nothing wrong. Again, though, I think we would be obliged to extend the same benefit of the doubt to men as well. Many women have been victim of crimes by men, but this does not by the above principles seem good enough reason to debar every individual man from entering into certain spaces, or to argue that assault is something indelibly masculine, or to categorise every man as a potential assaulter any more so than anybody else. This is I think a controversial subject because at this point in time having these feelings about men does seem to be more socially acceptable: arguing that not all men are abusers is often interpreted as an insensitive dismissal of the fears of those who may be abused by men, and women being wary of men in general is not seen as a prejudicial thing. To an extent, I think the same is also true in today‚Äôs climate of attitudes to trans women: I‚Äôve seen many news outlets covering accounts from cis women of feeling ‚Äòunsafe‚Äô around trans women in a fairly sympathetic light, whilst I‚Äôm sure the same outlets would not dream of giving the time of day to something like a white person saying they felt unsafe around black people, or a Christian saying they felt unsafe around Muslims; they and most other people would firmly regard that as an irrational prejudice on that person‚Äôs part and certainly not a reason for us to treat those other people any differently to accommodate for that person‚Äôs anxieties.  
  
In sum, then, I think there is good reason to argue for giving trans women as a group the benefit of the doubt and presuming that any trans woman wishing to use a women‚Äôs-only space is not there with any nefarious intent, and in not making concessions to those who object simply because they feel unsafe; it‚Äôs consistent with our attitudes to other groups, be they racial, religious, etc. But likewise by that reasoning it would be wrong to assume that any man intermingling with women is doing so as an opportunistic predator, or that that man should be expected to leave if some object to him being there.  
  
**Physical danger, or lack thereof**  
  
Thirdly, a common argument I‚Äôve seen as a rebuttal to those concerned about trans women in women‚Äôs spaces ‚Äì as well as in settings like women‚Äôs sports ‚Äì is that any concerns some may have about trans women possessing greater physical strength also amount to a crude generalisation. Males and females come in all shapes and sizes, and so even if the average person assigned male at birth is indeed taller and more likely to develop greater muscle mass than the average person assigned female at birth, that certainly does not mean that all trans women are going to be able to easily overpower all cis women, and so does not justify general concerns of cis women being physically disadvantaged against trans women, and any accompanying concerns that may go with that territory.  
  
This is another tricky one, because the general differential in height and strength between men and women is often cited as justification for why women being wary of men has a more rational and less prejudicial basis than, say, a person of one race being wary of people of other races. It‚Äôs not just that a woman is more likely to be assaulted by a man than by another woman, but that a male attacker would typically present a greater threat and thus that being wary of men in general to an extent makes sense. If this is a rational basis for ensuring that women in general have certain spaces from which men can be excluded, isn‚Äôt it also rational for cis women to have spaces that exclude trans women too?  
  
The counterpoint, as I‚Äôve said, is the fact that this is a generalisation. There are plenty of trans women out there of small and light physiques who would not present all that different a physical threat from a cis woman, and so excluding the whole group or feeling wariness towards the whole group may be unjust and another case of ‚Äòcollective punishment‚Äô. But the same again holds true of men. Some men are also physically unimposing, and wariness of these men and subsequent debarring of them from certain spaces simply because of threats posed by other, different men would seem equally wrong.  
  
The final point I have to mention here and admit my ignorance on is that I don‚Äôt know to just what extent transitioning diminishes these physical differences. I imagine it cannot eliminate them entirely, but it may be that trans women are on average stronger than cis women but not as strong on average as cis men. In which case, one may seek to argue that there is a cut-off point of just how much stronger on average a group must be before another group can reasonably exclude them on safety grounds, and that cis men are above this cut-off point but trans women are not. This would seem defensible enough, much in the same way that if you ran a kennels business it might be reasonable to put the Labradors in with the terriers, but not the Rottweilers in with the terriers. This isn‚Äôt a line of argument I‚Äôve seen too many people embark upon, but if it was demonstrably true it might be a pretty robust defence.  
  
**Segregation as a fundamental wrong**  
  
Argument number four that I‚Äôve seen, related again to that collective punishment notion, is that segregation of different groups of people into separate spaces is just fundamentally wrong as a concept. Some might argue that it is wrong because it is done on arbitrary grounds, whilst others may argue that it is wrong because it is likely to precipitate other harms like a two-tier society, or because it leads to the ‚Äòothering‚Äô of certain groups and the deeper entrenchment of social divides.  
  
It‚Äôs not shocking that many people apparently feel this way and often make appeals to such ideas, because many forms of segregation in practice have indeed proven to be all of those things just described. Also because often promises that segregation can be done justly or that it does not imply inequality, such as the infamous ‚Äòseparate but equal‚Äô defence of racial segregation in some American states, have proven to be mere bluster to conceal the mistreatment of certain groups.  
  
In practice, though, whilst the segregation of some spaces and activities by gender or sex down the years has also been abolished (particularly former male-only zones that have since become unisex), segregation of certain spaces and activities by gender or sex such as bathrooms or changing rooms is one that for a long time held up with little controversy, and which I think fundamentally still holds up with little controversy today. There is an ongoing argument of whether it should be sex or gender that separates these places, but very few people are arguing that they shouldn‚Äôt be separated at all. It cannot of course be ignored that unlike some previous segregations such as the Jim Crow laws, segregation of bathrooms and such is at least even-handed: men and women each have their own exclusive spaces and the spaces are generally of comparable quality, as opposed to those states where the best of all public services were reserved for white people and black people were forced to make do with the poor quality public services that were left. But an underlying part of it is I think simply that a lot of people simply still regard segregation by gender or sex as a general feature of life as reasonable, in a way that they don‚Äôt with other characteristics. People are, rightly or wrongly, comfortable with men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs bathrooms in a way that they would not be comfortable with black and white bathrooms, regardless of how equal the two were in exclusivity and quality.  
  
This, I think, is one of the major sources of strife when it comes to debates like the trans bathroom debate and one of the major reasons why the two sides struggle to see eye-to-eye. There are, of course, some who simply do not view trans women as women. But I think there are others who do indeed view trans women as women, but nevertheless view segregating bathrooms or locker rooms or other spaces by cis versus trans as reasonable, and find ‚Äúbut we are all women‚Äù as non-compelling an argument against this as they would find ‚Äúbut we are all human‚Äù to be a lacklustre argument against segregating bathrooms by men versus women. The other side of the aisle comes with the view that segregating bathrooms, locker rooms etc. by cis versus trans is as inherently wrong as segregating them by race; that it‚Äôs othering, that it‚Äôs treating people differently for arbitrary reasons. But I cannot see how this could not also be followed by the conclusion that segregated bathrooms full stop are inherently wrong; that it encourages men and women to ‚Äòother‚Äô one another and puts an arbitrary line between them. Having gendered spaces at all, then, I think undermines any argument in favour of trans women‚Äôs access to women‚Äôs spaces that rests solely on the idea that segregation is a fundamental wrong that cannot be permitted under any circumstances.  
  
**'If it bothers you so much, go somewhere else'**  
  
The final argument I‚Äôve seen in favour of trans women in women‚Äôs-only spaces is simply that any cis woman who does not feel comfortable with the arrangement should simply go elsewhere. It‚Äôs a familiar argument across many situations where some people take umbrage with others: that the obligation is on the people who take umbrage to make way, not the other way around.  
  
This is in my view the weakest of all the arguments addressed here, and I find it equally weak in other circumstances too. That is not me saying that I think every person‚Äôs every preference should be accommodated, or that we are obliged to meet their every demand in order for them to not feel offended. Rather, I‚Äôm saying that the burden of responsibility does not *always* fall on the offended party to either grin and bear it or leave. Some things, people can be reasonably expected to put up with or to take themselves away if it bothers them; other times, that is not a reasonable expectation.  
  
This also applies to the single-gender or single-sex spaces row. The crux of supporting letting trans women use women‚Äôs-only spaces is that cis women do not have good reason to be bothered by this occurrence; that this is a case where we rightly can expect them to either put up with it or go somewhere else, because it is little or no imposition on them to share the space with a trans woman. (Indeed, I‚Äôve seen posts of the sticker stuck on bathroom walls with a catchphrase along the lines of ‚Äúa trans woman peed here, and nothing happened to you‚Äù essentially making this argument: that trans women using women‚Äôs-only spaces has no inherent effect of any note on cis women.)  
  
But the same argument can surely also be made that men and women sharing those spaces together also has no tangible impact on anybody‚Äôs life, and thus that nobody has any good reason to be bothered by that occurrence either. (Certainly, a woman entering into a bathroom to discover a sticker noting that a man was there several hours earlier would have no discernible impact.) If the argument is simply that one person‚Äôs desire to use the space trumps other people‚Äôs misgivings about it, then the burden to not use the space would be on the woman who felt uncomfortable rather than on the man who had previously not been allowed to go there. If ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like it, go somewhere else‚Äù holds as a general rule for cis women who don‚Äôt want to share a space with trans women, it presumably would hold for any women who didn‚Äôt want to share a space with any men, too.  
  
\*\*  
  
Whew, that was a long one. Anyway, to summarise/back to the title: there are numerous arguments in favour of trans women accessing women‚Äôs-only spaces ‚Äì in terms of practicality, in terms of our other moral values, in terms of not punishing whole groups or suspecting bad intent from people who as of yet have done nothing wrong ‚Äì but that they also imply that the existence of women‚Äôs-only spaces at all is not really defensible either, and that this may be a pill we have to swallow now that we are looking at the separation of our public spaces with renewed scrutiny.

So I had a fun conversation with my friends at dinner last night that has left me thinking on what my stance in this situation would be.

There's a very popular show from a couple years ago called ""Parks & Recreation"" and one of the major plot point is that Pawnee (the town) is populated with idiots. So despite the cast's good intention in governing the city, things usually don't work out in comical way.

Our conversation last night centered around what we would do in that position.

Suppose this situation :

You're elected the sole leader of a town of 100 people through a fair and democratic election, where you won by a landslide on a platform of implementing the people's will for the good of the community.

Day 1 you're given two proposal : 

A. Spend the town's budget on fixing the main road, which direly needs repair.

B. Spend the town's budget on a giant party with Blackjack, Drugs and Hookers.

You host a referendum, and because the townspeople are silly people, all 100 people show up and vote for Black Jack and Hookers.

&#x200B;

What is the ethical thing to do here? 

Implement Proposal A - which is an actual proposal that improves the good of the community? 

Or implement Proposal B - which is what people actually wants?

My initial gut take was to take the third path and resign - but that feels like a cop out to the ethical debate. So if resignation isn't an option, *I'm currently leaning A.*

Leadership should involve the burden of making the hard choice for the good of the community, so Option A would be the ethical thing to do. However, it's also a clear violation of the mandate of the position which is to represent the people and implement their will- which inherently makes this also an unethical choice.

&#x200B;

What do y'all think? Help me pick a side!

1,2023-07-10,"CMV: If we must have democracy, all referendums and national elections should have basic tests.",u/owenredditaccount,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14w5oah/cmv_if_we_must_have_democracy_all_referendums_and/,changemyview,"People have brought this up before in this subreddit and the answers are often little more than ""it's undemocratic"", but nobody really explains why this is actually a bad thing in a way that is satisfactory enough for me.  
I'm not against democracy in practice per se but I think it's seen as this perfect system when the reality is very different. My main gripe with democracy is the average Joe who just votes how Rupert Murdoch's papers tell them to has the same weighting as anyone who keeps informed in other ways. And you can say ""that's just democracy"" but I don't have to accept that.  
The most common refutations for aptitude tests:  
\- It is undemocratic: I get it, but many things are also to an extent ""undemocratic"". I do have a line where I'd draw, but I actually think aptitude tests are more democratic than, for example, FPTP or voter ID laws (both can be gerrymandered easily, especially the former, and the latter deals with a problem that doesn't exist). Hell, election deposits exist, why not those? It makes no sense to argue that the buck should stop here. Plus, I think a system where people with only a baseline knowledge are able to vote is simply better. If a majority of people support a decision but a majority of informed do not (or vice versa), the opinion of the informed is surely better.  
\- It is a slippery slope: governments can do anything at any time anyway. A government could \*try\* and ban any opposition at any time without having to slowly change it through legislation, for example, using military or direct suppression or whatever. If you think something has already too far then argue that instead. I personally don't think this is a slippery slope, but if that is an issue then I do have proposals further down the page.  
\- It will always be biased: then set up an independent regulatory body to do it. If they aren't truly independent then that's its own problem, not an innate one. In the UK the electoral commission exists already to do things similar such as writing referendum questions.  
\- It would suppress X voter type: firstly, how do you know? If you think this would suppress a specific minority, isn't that just an assertion that they are less intelligent? Certainly not an assertion that I'm making. But, for example, if over 80s or under 20s are disproportionately suppressed due to lack of a very minimal amount of interest in what you are voting for (something I could imagine happening), literally why should I care? This is meant to weed out people who are voting without basic knowledge of what they are voting on. Is there a correlation between this and intelligence? Probably, especially at the very lower end of the scale. But I don't see that as an issue. Westerners by and large think that everyone should get a vote, and that it is still important having this principle even if it leads to worse decisions/outcomes for countries. I just do not agree with this at all.  
\- It's unimplementable:  
For referendums: I would have a regulatory body such as the Electoral Commission. In order to vote in a referendum, such as Brexit, you must answer a certain proportion of extremely simple questions correctly. For example, if we went back in time to 2016, ""is the UK a member of the European Union"", ""does the UK have, or not have, any elected representatives to the European Parliament"" or ""are all EU members also members of the single market?"". But I just came up with those, an actual commission would have more time.

I obviously have my own biases about Brexit, but let's say I think there are a lot of people who voted one way or another without having a clue, and that in the years after have shown that they tend to be from one side. I'm not going to pretend that if you applied this to referendums retrospectively they would always have the same vote outcome; however, I don't say this as a way to try and reverse the result of any particular referendum.  
For national elections: a copy of all the party manifestos in a booklet for each voter at the polling station (in the UK you should be able to get this now anyway). The voter can then read the manifestos and has to answer another series of very basic questions about what each party is pledging.

  
You could even release the entire question bank ahead of time like for driving tests, and out of maybe 80 questions total, every member who goes to the polling station would get a sheet with a randomised selection of 10. You would have to try and ensure no cheating using phones with polling station staff, but I understand that you may still have some who will be able to cheat anyway. Can't solve every problem myself but you would have 100s of experienced people (hopefully!) you can call on to come up to solutions to something like this. You would submit your referendum vote along with your test, and the polling station staff would staple them. When the votes are counted, you would also count the aptitude test scores and throw out any with a score of lower than say 40%. The pass mark can be really low as long as one could prove they had the most bare level of knowledge.   
I guess you could argue that some dodgy business could be going on by the vote counters to suppress people voting a certain way by e.g. erroneously discarding some votes. I guess that can happen under our current system anyway but I suppose to mitigate it you could instead do something like electronically tagging the voting sheet and test sheet together or something. Or have multiple people do it. Or have recounts for anyone who is +/- 10% of the pass mark.  
For local elections: no aptitude tests. It probably wouldn't be cost effective but I feel like on a local level it wouldn't be a good idea anyway. If the people in your area repeatedly vote for shitty people locally, it's a lot easier to move to the next city over than the next country.

Honestly these would barely be aptitude tests. I think voter apathy is a problem, but I think the opposite is worse. That is to say, when people vote for things they don't know enough about, or when they don't have real reasons behind their decisions. This is a way of trying to deal with this problem without literally making people explain their rationale, which is way too far for me. And in a way, this issue is itself caused by voter apathy to actual education. Time and time again I have seen this in my country.  
I'm talking about the UK specifically for my examples but I don't see why a lot of other countries couldn't do something similar."

I think any violent crime should automatically get them charged as adults, and moreover, any such minors should also be sent to adult prisons. They did an adult crime, they get adult consequences. Children should know violence is bad, and being under a certain age should never let them get away with assaulting people. I saw a reddit post about an 11 and 13 year old who beat up a women, and there was support for charging both as adults, so this isn't unpopular."

Why is it for girls it has to be, oh he needs to have a nice house, nice car, and or a nice job and I'll let him hit it. Isn't sex supposed to be physical and marriage/dating is about money/stability? Like why does how much money a man make determine whether a girl will sleep with you or not? It should be as simple as, he's good looking and we get along but no. 

So by this logic, we need to start normalizing it's okay for guys to lie to get some action. WHEN IT COMES TO DATING THAT IS DIFFERENT because we are talking about starting a life with someone. But for this article I am purely talking about sex which should be physical and about looks/personality not how much you own. Like in nature you don't see a female bear go, ""oh that's a nice cave, that bear has. It's bigger than the other bears cave so I'm going to let him hit"" Like no. In nature the woman will mate with the biggest male and that's normal, that's called physical attraction. Only in human females will a woman sleep with a dude depending on what's in his wallet.

Like I never caught it until i turned 21 and talked to other girls and guys and realized how stupid girl expectations are when it comes to getting laid. Therefore the scumbag liars who I originally deemed un worthy of getting into a womans pants, I AM SORRY. I see why you guys lie to get laid, they literally won't sleep with you based on looks, it's about income and what you got and it's sad. We got to lie more fellows in strictly situations for sex not for marriage CMV."

One time I yelled at someone and she started saying stuff like ‚Äúyou hate me cause I am woman‚Äù, ‚Äúyou are a sexist pig, who looks down on woman‚Äù.

I have noticed similar incidents online and around when two parties are arguing about something and one of them plays a Victim Card calling other one homophobic or racist.

I feel miss use of such cards undermine their entire cause.

Here's a keen observational breakdown and list of how women operate towards certain men, by treating ugly men and attractive men differently in social settings and work settings. Here is the list of whats been documented:

1. Being rude or not being nice to unattractive men unless hes attractive (its called the HALO EFFECT)
2. Being very uncomfortable or being crowded around unattractive men
3. Keeping the boundaries and being scared at all times around ugly men except attractive men (Ugly men cannot approach or ask for help without any ridicule, unless its an attractive man who does the same thing) 
4. Being attractive makes them excel or be successful without them working hard (getting super easy tasks, just having a pretty face to get by in life)
5. Dont mind being sex zoned as long as hes attractive with a social status (CEO, rapper, actor, etc)
6. Hate that ugly men want to have sex with them because hes morally beneath them (in terns of value, looks, etc) 
7. Love to objectify a lot of men but hate to be objectified by the ugly men (they hate when ugly men got standards)
8. Dont see ugly men as worthy enough to have sex unless he is attractive
9. Want to be respected, admired, and saw as a human being by men they look down on (being accepted for who they are but they cannot do the same when it comes to a ugly guy)
10. Respect men on their looks and their status, careless about their evil personalities UNLESS HE IS UGLY (the go-to word if its an attractive man: *""SuBmIsSiVe""*) -- And if its you: *""MAYBE ITS YOUR PERSONALITY, THAT'S WHY WOMEN WONT DATE YOU""*
11. Having sex with attractive men less than a few minutes of *JUST* meeting them
12. Not facing any actual challenges that men face that are way harsher (yet women try to compare their fake hardships to actual things men go through)
13. Shows a bubbly side of her personality to attractive men she wants (shows a mean & manlier side to ugly men who she thinks might ""assault"" her for being ""kind"" so its better safe than sorry. Their justification: Being ""kind"" *means* ""flirting"") 
14. Attracted to bullies & psychopaths; rewards their behaviors with sex (scientifically proven)
15. Using their looks to their advantage to get the special treatment: Better deals, tips, etc (scientifically proven)
16. Develop bully/evil traits and characteristics similar to those she have dated back in high school (that transitions over into her adulthood)
17. Will skip over and overlook ugly men when it comes to helping her out (they prefer to trust attractive men instead, its called Halo Effect) 
18. Will constantly objectify ugly men at a workplace and antagonize them (caused ugly coworkers to leave and quit, kept the attractives. scientifically proven)
19. Will spit in your food and drink; laughs at the fact, you didnt know she did (only does this to ugly men, its been proven) 
20. Will laugh and celebrate at weaker men getting beat up and/or murdered; praises the bully or murderer (just because hes attractive, she will do mental gymnastics to defend their actions) -- *VICTIM SHAMING 101*
21. Women prefer the full package: Good looks, house, big money, & a nice car (scientifically proven)
22. Always insinuating they prefer personality; the men they're attracted to dont have any (personality: *arrogant*, *big money*, *cocky*, etc)
23. Claim ugly men dont have personality; neither does she nor does she actually cares about one, unless hes attractive (who actually dont have one either)
24. Tend to say one thing, yet do another thing totally opposite from what they say (key word: hypocrite)
25. Claim they dont believe in socio sexual hierarchy; yet contributes to it and always stays in search of an *""ALpha MaLe""* (go back to the key word above)
26. Dated and slept with high school bullies; they show no remorse to the victims that he tormented daily (makes excuses to justify and victim shame who he bullied) 
27. When they are called out for each of THEE above: They be in denial and virtue signal (also they do mental gymnastics to justify their horrible takes/standpoints)
28. Tells men to date other men/women because she feels like they need to date someone in their ""looks"" range (because they think their looks are morally beneath them to accept them for who they are)
29. All of these aboves prove that women are in denial, cheaters, liars, users, hypocrites, bullies, abusers, materialistic, narcissists, etc.
30. Claiming that you hate women because they feel attacked for being held accountable, yet Chads and Triads are the real ones that *ACTUALLY* hate women (a female scientist claims they are *true misogynists* more than incels) because if they loved them right BEFORE SEX, THEY WOULD'VE STAY WITH THESE WOMEN AND NOT LEAVE AFTER SEX  -- But women claim to ugly men: ""*YOU HATE WOMEN AND ONLY WANT US FOR SEX*"" (key word that's being spelt out: P-R-O-J-E-C-T-I-O-N)

I believe that abortion is wrong

Hear me out

I believe this not because of my religion, nor because of some experience, but simply because it‚Äôs killing something.

And this isn‚Äôt like killing an animal(to eat it)
Or like killing a baby
It‚Äôs inbetween, and that‚Äôs one of the reasons why people are split about it.

HOWEVER

A woman should have the right to choose. 
I am a man, so I can‚Äôt speak to the pain of childbirth, I can speak to the agony of just hearing people talk about it.
And some don‚Äôt have the financial stability for a baby,
But I still think that abortions are wrong.
I mean, I grew up with very conservative parents, and I do share some of the same opinions.
But if you don‚Äôt have a condom, don‚Äôt have sex, or if you‚Äôre not hooking up with a pullout master, don‚Äôt have sex. 
If you do think you may be pregnant and don‚Äôt want to have a baby, contraception is a perfect option because at that point, it‚Äôs a clump of cells. 

I understand this may be flawed but it‚Äôs what I believe.(Kinda the point of this sub huh)"

But, I feel like it‚Äôs one that takes a certain level of empathy to fully understand, and not everyone, in my experience, has that.

Take this classic scenario. Persons A and B are friends. One day A starts to see B in a romantic way, and tells B. B doesn‚Äôt reciprocate, and clearly rejects A‚Äôs romantic offer. Typical stuff, right?

But then, B tells A that they really want to remain close friends, as if that‚Äôs supposed to be some kind of ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù that benefits both parties.

It isn‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt.

In fact I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs quite selfish. The way I see it, B is basically asking A to prioritize B‚Äôs desire for attention/companionship over A‚Äôs own mental health. What a great base to build a ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù off of!

For A, remaining close friends with someone who not only doesn‚Äôt share their attraction, but also asks A to suppress it, is voluntary self-torture. It isn‚Äôt even a ‚Äúreal‚Äù friendship anymore at that point because of all the eggshells & taboo topics both people will be avoiding to placate each other, even if those settling those topics genuinely matters to A.

For B, they get to benefit from a companionship that‚Äôs completely one-sided in their favor, garnering free attention without having to do any of the heavy lifting of a real friendship (I.e sharing both a friend‚Äôs triumphs and burdens, no matter how uncomfortable).  

The presumption is that B wants to ‚Äògo back to how things were‚Äô before A expressed romantic interest‚Ä¶but the reality is that this is impossible! 

The pre-confession friendship did not ask/expect either party to suppress any potential romantic feelings that may/may not develop‚Ä¶because like it or not, friendship CAN be a gateway to romance. But the post-confession ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù does have this restriction, making it a fundamentally different kind of companionship.

I could go on, but hopefully by now my point is clear: saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just be friends‚Äù immediately isn‚Äôt a request to continue the previous relationship as-is: it‚Äôs a request to start a new one that mostly benefits you.

The best thing B can do, if they do truly value A‚Äôs friendship, is give them time to heal so that eventually, maybe a somewhat mutually beneficial friendship can form. It still won‚Äôt be pre-confession level, but at least A likely won‚Äôt be torturing themselves anymore.

1,2023-07-10,CMV: The Democrat Party is NOT left wing,u/namemightbetaken,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14wbmpt/cmv_the_democrat_party_is_not_left_wing/,changemyview,"Reason 1 why they're not: Equality ‚â† Leftism

Believing in equality is possibly one of the most Centrist things you can do. The extremes of the social far right believes in the supremacy of only one group and the preservation of them, whereas the social far left would believe all difference in people,, like culture, must be overcome to form a united group of people. Equality (as we know it) is perfectly in between those two fringes. Equality is Centrist, not Leftist.

Reason 2 why they're not: Civil liberties ‚â† Leftism

Neither wanting people to be able to get gender reassignment surgery or get abortions are innately Leftist views, despite what many American Rightists may have led you to believe. That kinda stuff falls onto a completely different political spectrum, and thus can't be considered Leftist in nature. Furthermore, the Right's unwillingness to accept transgender identities as legitimate and not wanting people to be able to receive gender reassignment surgery doesn't mean the opposite view must be Leftist. Believing that transgender identities are legitimate is politically neutral, not Leftist. There's even very prominent transgender Rightists, such as Blaire White, which crumbles the idea of all things transgender being related to Leftism.

Reason 3 why they're not: The party is literally Centrist.

The party has several factions, with some of its biggest factions believing in Neoliberalism, Social Liberalism, and Social Democracy (Often mistakingly called Nordic Socialism or Democratic Socialism. No, Bernie Sanders is not a Socialist ‚Äî another reason why the party isn't Leftist ig). All three ideologies are Centrist. Social Democracy and Social Liberalism are Centre-left, but Neoliberalism is often regarded as being pure Centre or Centre-right. The only major way the part is Leftist is that it has major factions that support Centre-left economics, somewhat balanced by Neoliberalism's Centre-right economics. The Democrat Party is Centrist, not Leftist. CMV!"

1,2023-07-10,Cmv: being gay cannot be an immoral sin because I dont feel tempted by it,u/Vialix,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14wcjf4/cmv_being_gay_cannot_be_an_immoral_sin_because_i/,changemyview,"If I were gay I would meet other gay people or at least secretely watch gay porn or something. But I do not. I tried, didnt give me pleasure. Based on this, I think gay is not a choice. Also, some research suggests it is not a choice but I agree gays have agenda (like everyone else) and could fabricate or skew the data. So, I mostly base my belief on my experience of not being able to choose to be gay.

Now, why I am saying this‚Ä¶ bare with me:

Christians and far right people tell me that being gay is not moral or something. But‚Ä¶ if I am not able to choose to be gay, how can it be immoral? I mean: I fall prey to a lot of temptations personally. So if becoming gay was one of these temptations, I would probably become gay. But I am not able to!

There is no choice for me, and therefore how can it be a question of morality? I hope you can help me understand it dear lainons.

Because so far, this paradox is leading me to believe that the christians and far right people actually strongly believe the gay is a choice because they actually may feel gay desires as a temptation themselves. Because, look: thanks to the theory of mind, we kinda assume other people have similar mental experience to ours. So if they, in their own head feel gay desires, they automatically assume others have it the same way. They consider gay a choice because they themselves feel it as a choice. And if they repress it in themselves and feel guilty; there will be the pressure in them to project this outside and want to punish others for it.

I know my theory is very armchair-psychologist like‚Ä¶ but it simply stems from the fact I am unable to comprehend why would they consider gay as immoral IF it is impossible for many people such as myself to choose to be gay."

To begin with, I will say that I believe that humans inherently crave freedom, that is our nature, and to that extent, we participate in science (as a way to understand the world for the sake of knowledge) and art (as an ultimate form of communication)  
  
To that end, I believe that most, not all, but most left values are good for humanity, as they are aimed at increasing liberty of humanity as a whole, which goes along with our desire for freedom, so things check out. Conservative values, on the other hand, are the other way around: not only do they aim to keep us ""where we are"" because ""things are good now"" - which is bad both because things always change and permanence is impossible, and because things will never be ""good enough"" (especially since objectivism does not exist) I tried examining conservative values but found nothing that would have any worth.   
  
Religion as a whole is a scam, and while it can provide positive influence on certain people, I think humanity is better off without it - especially since monotheistic religions are extremely authoritative and enforce a very rigid structure that goes against human nature as a bunch of rebels.   
  
Conservatism in question of gender and sex is useless too - sex is not that important, gender is subjective, and trans people are no issue to anyone. We should be moving to a post-gender world but instead conservatives will have us debate about trans bathrooms (I think that all bathrooms should be unisex, but at least single-use ones for sure) Humanity is of one race, human, so I see no value here either.   
  
In terms of economics, late-stage capitalism is a snake that eats its tail, and the only future that capitalism has is in its transition to socialism, to make use of all those money to create a safe base for people living in society.   
  
Feel free to attack any of my points, or bring up yours, because I fundamentally think that conservatism is just bad and wrong for humans, and I want to know if that position has any openings or not. To that end, I believe that the only reason a person can have conservative values is either if they are misguided/uneducated (and don't know what they are talking about, were lied to by propaganda, or simply lack real-life experience) or just evil (aka, fascists) "

I think the biggest objection to this view would be that I could potentially not get into heaven. However, there isn't good evidence that a god exists. Especially considering how many religions there are, how would I even know which religion to believe? And there are too many contradictions within many religious texts (such as saying that God is benevolent but then providing many examples of extreme cruelty). 

Another possible objection could be the community or sense of peace people get from a god. But you can find those through other measures, and religion just as commonly can harm people as help them.

Benefits of not having a god includes being able to live your life how you want, unladen by religious guilt. Another benefit is not being able to have your faith manipulated to do something bad such as a war or persecution.


**I should mention that I'm specifically talking about religions that believe in a god. So for instance, certain sects of Buddhism as well as atheist Judaism wouldn't apply."

Plus the dearth of manpower that would result could be solved by lowering the minimum age to stand for office even more to 10 or even 5 years old.  I rather take the 11 year old with no impulse control in charge of a government constituency rather than a Mitch McConnell like old figure since he or she would come up with new ideas consistently rather than pondering over tried and true solutions and even if they don't work, they would at least provide jobs to people in the meantime and keep unemployment down.

So here is an idea. You can only be elected to office once, but terms should be set somewhere between 6 to 10 years.

They can also (in some cases) not have to keep corrupt promises to those who paid for them to get in. What are they going to do, not help them get elected again?

As we know, LBGTIQ+ issues are controversial ranging from far Right Conservatives (often Fundamental Christians) with a strict Binary approach to Sex and Gender through to the progressive ""woke"" view of Gender Identification. The theological research I have done seems to identify a few contradictions in this area that I would like clarification.  
Firstly, the Christian literature all refers to two sexes and consequently we live in a binary world of male/female and man/woman. The texts overtly aligns sex, sexual preference with gender as one rather than separating the three distinct concepts. From a sex and gender perspective, Christians quote Genesis (Adam and Eve) as the prime example of sex and gender being binary. Part of my confusion is hermaphroditism which is a form of intersex anomaly where both male and female gonads are present. Christians have told me that God doesn't make mistakes. So, based on hermaphrodites, is sex/gender not binary or has God made mistakes by allowing hermaphrodites to be born?  
The second question is around sexual preference, specifically same sex. I am unsure anywhere in my theological research where female same sex relations are forbidden but it appears to be in fundamental Christian circles, not sure why. Also, the English Standard Version (ESV) of the Bible states in 1 Cor. 6:9-10 a bunch of people will ""not inherit the kingdom of God"" including ""men who practice homosexuality"". What worries me from an academic validity of the source document (the version of the Bible). Since the concept of homosexuality as a sexual orientation and sexual identity is a relatively recent development, with the word itself being coined in the 19th century. The Bible is a bit older, so how many variations of translation are there to get the translation ""homosexuality"". Just based on these specific anomalies, are we dealing with confirmation bias or have I missed aspects in my research?"

I feel this view should apply in any country that has the ability for this to function in terms of productivity and development, most of Europe, the USA ect. The birth rate is declining and already below replacement in the UK and many of these countries, potentially causing demographic issues in the future, or worsening existing ones. It also means more young people largely do not have the option of having families. 

I believe if you work full time you are contributing enough to society that you should be able to have a child. Considering you have little option but to partake in the society you're born into, earning income from a job is really the only practical option you have to start a family (UK and most EU countries). 

A couple working full time on minimum wage cannot afford to raise a child in the majority of the UK, especially in a remotely healthy environment.

The minimum wage for full time workers over 23 in the UK is 19,000. This results in an after tax take home of 1350 pounds per month. Nursery and childcare costs are higher than this so one person is going to have to stop work resulting in 1350 in income to support 2 people and a child.

This is completely rules out much of the South and South east of the UK immediately (studios 750-1500 without bills). Not to mention full time workers should not be forced to raise a family in a studio flat, they're contributing enough. 

The suggestion many people come up with now is ""move to ""insert cheap place here"".  First this ignores the fact that this means they dont have the support of friends and family in raising a family, of which most prior generations did and is immensely helpful, but sure, not impossible.

Lets look at rent in Grimsby, a stereotypically 'bad', 'cheap' town in the north of England. The average studio is 600 pounds without bills. With bills you're looking at around 900.

I find that a bit hard to believe it.

If men experience sexism, they would have talked about it more often.

But they don't talk about it, they mostly talk about they are not getting laid. 

So either the ""sexism"" they face is either rare or very minor issue or it dosen't exist in the first place. 

But perhaps the biggest piece of evidence of how no trans person has ever talked about the sexism men face.

Every transgender person I met have only talked about the sexism women experienced. How women were treated differently and the subtle, blatantly and behind door sexism they face.

Not one trans person, not even a trans man has come forward talking about men experiencing sexism. 

Also most of the sexism come from other men.

Women are not sexist towards men.

This is my view on the whole ""patriarchy harms men"" 

So by this account, sexism against men dosen't exist."

As not only does this lead to falsehoods, but it is illogical that truth can be expected to be established in a sole coherent narrative.

&#x200B;

A key issue is that rationality discriminates against uneducated people who cannot yet articulate their ideas in a air-tight logically valid description. Yet often there is some genuine truth they can see and are attempting to explain. The way ideas and beliefs form is beginning from some base truth or observation, and then slowly developing the idea out rationally, therefore if you beat down ideas for not meeting these standards of rationality yet, then you crush truth before it can become coherent. Where disproportionately this will undermine the ability of uneducated people to have the truths they see to be taken seriously.

The trans debate I believe is a fantastic example of this. The current stage where 'gender' is at is relatively incohesive, as of the present if you were to scrutinise the rationality of trans concepts of gender then they would be undermined. And yet clearly transgender people have found some aspect of truth which wasn't catered for by the biological-dichotomy account of gender, to disregard transgender ideas on the account of their illogicalness would be an error. And an even greater issue is that since irrationality is seen as proof that a concept is false, now trans people strategically cannot accept the need to solve these flaws because that will be used against them - slowing down progress.

&#x200B;

The other aspect is that rationality merely makes connections between and from a set of propositions. If you have incorrect premises, then you can get incorrect conclusions which are still completely rational.

First of all this necessarily requires a form of truth that supercedes rationality, since if you require axioms for rationality to develop from, then these axioms/propositions have to have truth outside of being justified rationally. Rationality itself to be meaningful necessitates that it isn't the ultimate form of truth.

More importantly however is that we don't have all the information of the world, therefore logically you wouldn't expect to find a single unified strand of rationality which incorporates the entire truth. You would expect that you find something like models in social sciences: theories which interpret events through one theory, and that all the theories are built from different parts of the entire truth. Therefore to hold the entire truth we must simultaneously hold different conflicting accounts simultaneously - hence irrationally."

Some were opportunistic, or wanted to oppress and hurt others.

&#x200B;

Whenever I'm talking with friends about media with authoritarian regimes such as the Capitol in the Hunger Games or the Galactic Empire in Star Wars, my friends say that they would probably join the resistance because the regimes are evil. I mostly agree, but I ask them to look at the perspective of from a nuanced perspective. I get funny looks when I say that I would want to be a Peacekeeper or a Stormtrooper, even though my intention would not be to hurt others, but to protect and support my family.

&#x200B;

When talking about World War II, everyone says ""I would have joined the resistance"", or ""complacent people are so dumb, why can't they resist and fight for their freedom?"". In hindsight, this is rather easy to say, as World War II ended about 78 years ago. However, this would not have been easy. I would think that those people would either have been dead or are actively trying to hide from the Einstatzgruppen (the Nazi murder squads). The Nazis would have burned the entire village down and killed everybody (including the women and children) if they caught a resistance fighter in that village, so by in large, it would have been better for you and your neighbors to just keep one's head down, unless you were part of a group they were actually trying to exterminate.

Ok, so in no way am I saying that the resistance groups, such as the French Resistance or the Polish Underground State were not heroic. Of course they were heroic. They helped liberate their countries. However, I don't really think that the life of resistance, even passive, would have been for everyone living under occupation or an authoritarian country because of just how violent the occupiers were.

Collaboration is a contentious topic in many cultures. Many countries have had historical collaborators that are forever hated, such as Marshal Petain in France, and Wang Jingwei in China (who is actually known to Chinese as a very negative term called ""hanjian""). However, while there certainly were the opportunists and those who just weren't right in their heads and wanted to oppress others (shame on them, by the way), have you ever thought that there were people in the Vichy or the Wang Jingwei regime who genuinely wanted to protect their countrymen, or at least their families from destruction? I can't really blame those who want to save their families in such circumstances, especially in the circumstances involving destruction of one's homeland and people. Many collaborators just did what they and their families needed to survive, especially if that meant taking part in the machine of annihilation. Even if this was misguided, people who collaborate to protect their families have sound logic and reasonable motives. And what happens after the war? They get a bullet in front of a firing squad under false charges of ""treason"" against **a country that no longer existed (officially) by that point**. I understand punishing and/or executing higher ups who were genuinely the bad guys, but not the common guy serving in the collaborationist regime's military forces or as a paper pusher who wanted to protect their families and countrymen.

I'm not condoning the crimes of the collaborationist regimes, though. They are certainly tragic, but I implore people to look at the views of complacent people and collaborators with a nuanced perspective. Thanks.

0,2023-07-11,CMV: We need mandatory after-school Western culture&ideology study classes akin to Bible study classes,u/Crofucije,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14wuby3/cmv_we_need_mandatory_afterschool_western/,changemyview,"From what I perceive, despite European and American states being established on the foundations of western cultural heritage, including the principles of liberalism and the enlightenment, we as citizens today do not feel personal connections to that heritage, as well as (generally speaking) are being quite ignorant as to what this heritage entails.

I would argue that this affects society negatively, as it leads to people taking their rights and resulting social amenities they enjoy for granted, while also leaving an unoccupied space in the minds of the people - which harmful actors can exploit and fill with various ideological, religious or political nonsense. 

Due to lack of proper knowledge obtained through directed learning, people instead have to scramble for answers themselves, which I would argue is a bad thing due to the average person's inability to discern what is a quality source of information and what isn't.

One example that bothers me personally, being white and male, because no authority on culture&ideology tells you what our culture is about and what we should value - Jordan Peterson, Tucker Carlson and even Andrew Tate will, and you'll go to them frequently and be reminded by them about this. What they say will become truth in your eyes, because no one else taught you better.

There is an element of reinforcing mainstream cultural values to this, which not only benefits the majority population, but also helps with assimilation of minorities and immigrants - something that is important for the stability of a society.

The most recent related topic to this is the latest riots in France, because of which many bluntly asked - why do minorities cause problems again? What can we do to help them alleviate their grievances? And as every European knows, it all comes back to poverty due to not assimilating, and not assimilating due to poverty - that vicious circle.

Our modern liberal framework leaves no space for religious or ethnic discrimination, and this is a good thing, so formulating a solution based on singling out one group and applying special rules for them does not fly. However, mandatory after-school Western culture&ideology study classes would in my opinion be a huge step forward in the right direction, because it would expose a significant amount of people to thinking and values they were never taught. Especially if they come from very conservative and religious backgrounds.

I would also argue such classes would help prevent the creation of people like Anders Breivik, who was also motivated by what he wrongly perceived was defending western values.

I hope you can understand that I don't have a ready made blueprint of how exactly such classes should be implemented or what exactly taught or by who, but as an idea I think it has merit. I compared this with Bible study classes, because those classes are designed to remind of and reinforce values and beliefs those people hold as true and good, and helps with not losing perspective on what they are all about.

We as people are nurtured into becoming what we eventually are, first guided by our parents, then teachers, but then are left to our own devices. I am thinking we can help better society by implementing a new guiding tool towards shaping better people and society.

What I noticed was this: Christians would preach about how Christianity was the most radical, life-transforming, joyous message in all of human history - but then live as if it weren't at all.

Christians would say that the Gospel would bring true joy like nothing you'd ever experienced - but nearly all of them were just as gloomy and downcast as non-Christians.

Christians would say that people who died as unbelievers would roast in horrific torment in Hell forever and ever - for trillions and trillions of years - but then these Christians would spend only maybe *half an hour per year* trying to save souls, when you'd logically think they'd spend every single waking moment trying to save souls.

Christians would say that their loved ones who died had gone to Heaven and were in a place thousands of times better than this rotten miserable place called Earth - yet Christians were just as sad and despondent at their funerals as non-Christians, and did not behave at all like someone whose loved ones were in a far better place. (Similar, Christians were just as afraid of, and as averse to, death, as anyone else, even though death was supposed to be the ticket to a much better place.)

The Bible mentioned many times how important it was to tell the truth and be truthful, yet I found Christians to spew out hoaxes, false conspiracies, false prophecies or falsehoods even *more* than non-Christians, and to have a *greater* tolerance for falsehood than others.

I could go on and on, but I think the point is made. 

The only conclusion I can come to is that Christians don't in fact actually believe what they preach. Maybe a tiny minority do, but the vast majority do not."

I was raised never to insult someone's mother or father, regardless of how much animosity or contempt I have for my intended victim. My parents made it clear: you never know what goes on in another person's home or their relationship with their family. Insulting someone's parents could lead to an unintended and unexpected response. So for my entire life, I made sure to only target my intended target of ridicule or aggression. 

My mother passed from an unbelievably painful and degenerative condition 2 years ago. When I close my eyes I can still see and feel the sponge swab we used to moisten her mouth, scrubbing off pieces of her gum and tongue. I never imagined the various ways I would come to grieve. 

Recently, the ""yo mama"" jokes and insults have managed to hit a nerve I never knew I had. If it weren't for intervention I may have killed someone and the only thing I regret today is that I didn't. I have no emotion or feeling about my conduct other than regret for the rage I wasn't able to exert on my target. 

Charges may or may not be filed against me, but as I type this I have no concern at all beyond determining the address of my target. This will become much easier if this ever reaches a docket. This is my mindset and train of thought.

I'm rational enough to understand when I'm being irrational, but that understanding doesn't trump my anger and need to soothe it. I now understand clearly the proverbial wire my parents told me never to trip. That ""mama""  joke or insult has the ability of harnessing grief nobody can control and could result in a hospitalization or untimely departure. 

If you have beef with someone for any reason, leave their parents or loved ones out of it or brace yourself for their justified reaction. It could be dismissive or it could be violent but it's definitely justified."

Both have the ability to completely destroy your quality of life, and I do not see why suggesting people with depression be given the ability to pass away peacefully is so taboo and frowned upon in our society. I'd like a good reason -- besides the potential of the pain it might cause other people, because in my opinion it's the patient's own quality of life which should come first -- that it isn't legal to help a severely depressed individual to end their suffering. After all, if somebody really wants to die they can just kill themselves on their own (though this is oftentimes very painful for the person who dies and unexpected for their families/loved one's, if it even works): PAD is a safer, less painful, and less sudden alternative. As someone with treatment resistant depression that has suffered with it since childhood, constantly been in therapy and on medication with no results, and finds it difficult and pointless to continue living: I need hope that things will get better and a good reason not to just end it and save myself the pain of suffering until I die naturally."

I think we could have an entirely separate discussion on the extent to which jobs will be reduced by forcing employers to pay minimum wages, as well as our tolerance for job reduction in a stronger economy and the tangible and intangible benefits of ensuring that anyone who works full-time is able to survive. But for now, I'll just take it as a given that if we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobs will go down, and that could be considered ""bad"".

The exact same thing should, in theory, happen if every undocumented immigrant was kicked out of one's country and were replaced by native-born workers. And by restricting future immigration, that should be reducing the number of workers who would accept low wage jobs. If employers only had a pool of native-born citizens from which to hire, those citizens will almost certainly demand a far better wage than an immigrant would have. This is well-understood to be the mechanism by which we slow or stop wage depression. If we keep immigrants out, wages should go up.

But isn't this the exact same result? If these employers can no longer hire immigrants and can only hire people who demand to be paid more, isn't that going to lead to the same end result of fewer jobs for everyone? If an employer could afford to hire 10 workers at $10 an hour, but now he has to pay them $15 an hour, he may instead decide to let 3 or 4 people go and thus only have to pay $90 - $105 an hour to balance the accounts. So it's still the same job-reducing mechanism in the end.

So isn't this hypocritical? If someone opposes minimum wage on the grounds that they will reduce jobs, but they are totally fine with stopping immigration, maybe even kicking out undocumented workers, shouldn't that also raise the concern of job reduction? Why is it only a problem in the former and not in the latter? This seems inconsistent to me.

In the early days, such as Eisenhower administration, they were fairly housebroken and the eastern establishment reigned supreme and upheld the New Deal consensus.  It was a similar dynamic to how Bernie is a beat dog they yank out to endorse Biden and how ‚Äúthe squad‚Äù would never dare with the insubordination that the freedom caucus is happy to pull. Senator Taft was merely the eternally put upon critic who seldom got his way. 

The form of conservatism that we recognize today with the coalition and ideas championed by Reagan was stewing in the late 60s through the 70s. Goldwater was the canary in the coal mine that signaled what would come to power in the 1980s and shifted the center of gravity well to the right of the dead New Deal consensus/coalition  (at least on economic issues). 

Even then, they had an intellectual infrastructure that gatekept the fetid underbelly of the right. Buckley kept (at least explicit) anti semitism, know-nothing esque isolationism, and the paranoid, petit bourgeoisie conspiracists out of the tent. The last group was championed by John Birch Society. 

When it comes to the face and official leadership of the party, the 2016 election was the victory of the Bircher‚Äôs over the National Review old guard. The patricians of the conservative media class has to reckon with how little power they have. A general feeling of the neoconservative project being discredited was widely felt in 2008 and that still lingers. In life, Robert Welch Jr (the JBS founder) and his society were ghettoized by the neoconservative mainstream embodied by Bill Buckley. In death, he triumphed. Goldwater‚Äôs promise came to fruition 20 years after his failed rightward insurgence. So the same goes for the Birchers eventual victory over the conservative mainline. The freedom caucus, the Jan 6th protestors, moms for liberty, etc are all his children.

We can see this phenomena on a smaller scale of time. Birtherism was a conspiracy among the base that the GOP establishment was too dignified to nod at. Then they were usurped by that movement‚Äôs premier celebrity representative. QAnon was another pen of shit the hoglike base rolled around in. It became less amusing when candidates, police chiefs, and others in power sincerely believed it. 

Normie libs have been feeling themselves lately. They think the Republican Party is stuck in a ditch, perhaps even in a death spiral. They simultaneously believe the GOP stands little chance in 2024 and that a manifestly senile 80 year old is our best bulwark against them. There is a general fantasy that they get the birchy-ness of their system and we will return to the mythical ‚Äúmoderate republican‚Äù.

I doubt it. I think that the worsening of economic and environmental conditions will continue to radicalize them further. One of the J6 protestors will probably be in congress sometime soon. Perhaps the Oval Office within the next 10-20 years. To continue with basic pattern recognition, I imagine the leaders of the Democratic Party will fondly recall the ‚Äúreasonable, moderate republican‚Äù of yore- like Trump and Boebert. They did the same with Reagan, Goldwater, and even Bush. Any movement or party that‚Äôs even remotely serious about improving things for the common people and world as a whole would make sure they are demonized and their entire legacy is undone. Overtime they were hated and correctly recognized as harbingers of a deranged, evil agenda. Then they got outdone by what came next and now are used as positive examples to contrast with the current iteration of reactionary politics. Why would Trump and his most loyal acolytes getting this treatment be out of bounds? I think it‚Äôs more likely than not.

Those in support of ""anti-woke"" legislation are either bigots or being misled.",u/alarmed_fire,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14x2xcc/cmv_there_is_no_woke_mind_virus_and_conservatives/,changemyview,"The American right has recently begun obsessing over drag queens, LGBTQ+ people, and the discussion of sexuality and feminine health in schools. They've co-opted the term ""woke"" as a catch-all for any discussion, institution, or group that supports these people, and have begun a massive ""anti-woke"" campaign in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election.

At first, this ""anti-woke"" movement was a strange, fringe belief that seemed easily dismissible as another attempt to vilify minorities by the Republican Party, but recently, states like Florida have begun to actually enact sweeping, enforced legislation gutting free speech in schools and attacking LGBTQ+ people, drag queens, and women directly.

The Republican Party has always considered itself the champion of personal liberty and small government in the United States, but now they're backing politicians like Florida governor Ron DeSantis in blatantly fascist and anti-freedom legislation. DeSantis has, in the name of ""anti-woke"" policy, swiftly enacted a collection of anti-freedom and anti-education legislation in the state of Florida, including, but not limited to:

* **""Don't Say Gay""**  
DeSantis championed the Parental Rights in Education bill, which completely bans the discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in Florida schools up to grade 12. Obviously, since heterosexuality and cisgenderism are unavoidable components of human society and history, this bill only applies to discussion of non-hetero or non-cis identities.  
For example, as critics have pointed out, the language of the bill should prevent the discussion of, say, Mary and Joseph's marriage, just as it prevents the discussion of homosexual relationships, but it is exclusively enforced in opposition to the discussion of minority gender identities and sexual orientations. DeSantis is quoted as saying that teaching kids ""they can be whatever they want to be"" is ""inappropriate"".
* **""Don't Say Period""**  
This one is particularly ridiculous. As an expansion of the ""Don't Say Gay"" law, DeSantis has also implemented a ban on discussing human sexuality, STDs, and periods until sixth grade.  
The average girl will start her period between the ages of 11 and 12. Many girls, especially in conservative states like Florida, are never educated about this phenomenon, and thus it is left to schools. *Government officials in one of the US's largest states have banned teachers from teaching young girls about an often scary and difficult-to-handle part of their natural experience as women*. It is jaw-dropping that this was even considered, let alone enacted. I have yet to see a single conservative even attempt to justify this abhorrent law.
* **6-week Abortion Ban**  
I don't want this post to go down the often cyclical spiral of the abortion debate, so I won't say too much here. What's relevant is that any ban on abortions is a direct attack on women's autonomy, and Florida's 6-week ban is seen as far too harsh by even conservative pro-life politicians in other states.
* **Gender-Affirming Care Ban**  
In direct opposition to the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, Human Rights Campaign and countless other societies of doctors, scientists, and activists, Florida has banned life-saving gender-affirming care for Floridians of all ages who rely on Medicaid. 40% of transgender people in the United States have considered suicide, and access to gender-affirming care has been able to reduce the risk of suicide in trans youth by 73%. Gender-affirming care is only ever pursued with the full consent and support of the patient, their medical professionals, and (if the patient is under 18) their parents.  
This bill directly targets life-saving medical care for gender-minority youth in Florida, and strips Floridian parents from their right to authority over their child's care.  
***Crucially, this bill also allows the state to take custody of any children whose parents attempt to provide them with gender-affirming care.*** Conservatives are literally in support of the state taking children away from their parents if they try to provide them with medical care.
* **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Ban**  
Florida has also banned Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs at public colleges and universities. DEI programs exist for the sole purpose of diversifying staff and promoting inclusion and equity in academic spaces. What possible reason, aside from explicit racism, do conservatives have for attacking these long-standing institutions that have done incredible work in enabling greater equity in our society?
* **Critical Race Theory Ban**  
Florida's educational institutions of all levels have been banned from even mentioning Critical Race Theory, a 40-year-old academic concept that aims to shed light on how racism is embedded in our legal systems and policies. Again, American conservatives will do anything in their power to attack programs that aim to benefit minorities in this country.
* **Pronouns in School Ban**  
Florida has completely banned the ability for teachers or staff in educational institutions to ask preferred pronouns, or even to use any pronouns that don't correspond to someone's sex as defined at birth.
* **Stop WOKE Act**  
Florida has banned schools *and workplaces* from any discussion about ""discrimination based on race, color, sex, or national origin"".
* **Drag Show Ban**  
The government of Florida has banned cross-dressing in front of minors in public. This is completely draconian and makes no sense.
* **Firing and Replacing Entire University Boards of Trustees**  
DeSantis has fired the president of the Board of Trustees for the New College of Florida, stacking the rest of the board with his own appointed supporters in an effort to take over the academic institution.
* **Widespread book bans**  
The state of Florida has also banned almost 400 books from Florida schools, including *The Handmaid's Tale*, *The Color Purple*, and *Unspeakable: The Tulsa Race Massacre*. A teacher is currently under investigation for allowing her class to watch the Disney cartoon *Strange World*, simply because it features a gay couple.

Every single one of these actions or pieces of legislation are objectively in opposition to individual freedom, parental freedom over their children's education, women and minorities' freedom over their own bodies, and the free exchange of speech and information in general.

How can the same party that claims to support freedom of speech and information support the legal banning of books and speech in support of minorities, or the state taking children away from their parents for seeking medical help?"
1,2023-07-11,CMV: Being the elder sibling sucks only in the case of same-gender siblings,u/MeasurementSimple467,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14x30ar/cmv_being_the_elder_sibling_sucks_only_in_the/,changemyview,"In my country most parents have 2 kids and i think thats like the majority case. I am talking only about heterosexuality in my post. My personal opinion  
  
Obviously we can't choose the gender or order of birth. It is destiny just like some things in life like family wealth, height etc.  
  
This is my opinion after observing many siblings around me  
  
In the case of same gender siblings,  
  
The first kid is the kid on whom the parents do all experiments, by the time second kid grows up, they get to know all the wrong steps they took with the first kid. The first kid is told so much from childhood that he has to care for his younger brother , this is done till a extent where it just fits in the elder sibling's subconscious mind and helping younger silbling becomes kind of an obligation.  
  
On the surface people may sugar coat things but ultimately subconscious mind prefers the more successful person. This is amplified because both siblings are same gender, so same kind of things are expected from them.  
  
I have observed that in 90 percent of cases, the younger silbling is more taller, stress free, attractive ,has good speaking skills, gets easier oppurtunities due to mistakes made by older silbling irrespective of the his caliber, gets help from parents and brother ( better parenting).  
  
In most cases It just seems like the elder brother/sister is a test baby inorder to make the younger sibling better.  
  
According to me , a boy and a girl is the best possible combination ever in the case of 2 siblings. The parents get to experience both the worlds, most of the competition between the kids is completely ruled out just because of the gender (different things are expected) , parents also tend to respect and love each kid equally because they only have one boy and one girl ( there is no alternative)  
  
My conclusion : The extremely lucky ones are younger silbings in case of same gender sliblings and lucky ones are the families with a boy and a girl.  
  
Do you guys agree?"

There are a couple of possibilities: First, the sinister one: no we can't. This is as good as it gets and starvation and homelessness are just part of the equation. 

I don't believe this is the case, but if that is the case it seems extremely far fetched that humans could ever create a classless society. A dictatorship where everybody's actions are policed (which is the only way I can think of to make a classless society work against people's will) is going to have classes of sorts, just like all other dictatorships. Only instead of the 99% and the 1% where some of the 99% are quite successful it's the .01% and the 99.99% where 99.99% of people are policed every second and .01% of people are too powerful. 

If it's not a heavily policed dictatorship, people have to be on board. 

The other possibility, the one I choose to believe, is that meaningful change is possible. But then it seems to me that if meaningful change is possible it would be ridiculous to destroy the system in place when meaningful change occurred in pursuit of something that may still not even be possible. 

Either way, I do not see the logic in pursuing a classless society.

""The doctors told my parents that I can have a live daughter, or dead son.""

Using suicide threats to make someone else do what you want them to is abusive 100% of the time. Even if that threat is valid.

Imagine an ex boyfriend calling up his girlfriend... ""Give me another chance please... If you don't I'll kill myself!"" That's abuse! 100%!

Imagine a teenage daughter going up to her dad ""Buy me the new Iphone or I am going to kill myself!"" That's abuse 100%!

Imagine a mother fed up with her kids making messes go to them and saying, ""If you don't start cleaning up after yourself I am just going to kill myself!"" That's abuse 100%!

You can not find any context where it is ""Do X / Give me X or I kill myself!"" where it is NOT abuse... It is ALWAYS abuse...

Even if the person is genuinely suicidal then that is what you should focus on. Not giving in to their demands. Give them the suicide hotline number. Get them into some sort of therapy or counseling. Caving in to such demands only leads to bad things.

Getting a bunch of tattoos, ear gauges, coloring your hair, etc doesn't make people look cool, it makes them look like try hards. The only people who can pull these off are attractive people, and attractive people don't even need these things to look cool anyway. Being attractive in and of itself is cool, adding all this extra stuff adds no value. Meanwhile unattractive people who get all these things just look silly. You can try to polish a turd, but it's a still a turd.

The only exception to this are people who are famous rappers or rock stars or something like that. For them, this kind of stuff can be part of their persona as an artist, but for a regular person all of these things just indicate that they are trying too hard to create an image. It's vain and superficial, and not even remotely necessary.

Some might argue that it's a way of expressing yourself, but if someone requires superficial things like tattoos, gauges, and colored hair to express themselves, then that's a problem. They should try expressing themselves by having a personality instead, or maybe some sort of talent or skill. Actually doing something or creating something interesting is a good form of expression. Simply adding crap to your body to try to look ""cool"" is corny. 

Others will argue that they just do it to make themselves happy, but again, if you require adding all this pointless crap to your body to make yourself happy, that's also a problem. Someone's happiness shouldn't be linked to whether they have rainbow colored hair, holes in their ear, or ink on their skin. If someone really wants to waste money and time on adding pointless stuff like that to their body, all the power to them, but it's corny. If someone finds their happiness in dressing like a clown, they are free to do as they please, but it's still dumb."

It's blight must be addressed because it can cock up society to the point of logjam as different groups infight in government and politicians advance their careers at the expense of others.

I propose these solutions.

Sortition to ensure that the lobby group has a equal chance of not getting someone that would obey their demands

Ban lobbying if a group exceeds a certain number (50+) of members under pain of death. This rips out the source of the problem and ensure that politicians can focus on their jobs. Alternatively, ban lobbying entirely

Confine people elected to political and government office under cells with little to no human or societal contact to prevent them from getting ideas from each other and lobby groups. Additionally, it would condition people to think government/political office is a crap job and cause many people to not think of it as a career but rather as a chore, decreasing careerism.

Strict term and age limits in all government and political offices to ensure turnover so that lobby groups don't get guys who they know that would be there for a long time.

There is a survival instinct, and people have fear of death and the unknown, and they associate death with loss and sadness on an emotional level, but there isn't a good rational reason to consider death a tragedy in itself.

Various theories on a more humane prison system have been put forth. To summarize a few:


‚ÄúReintroduction into society is ideal and we should treat prisoners in such a way that will maximize their potential to be productive members of society upon their release.‚Äù


‚ÄúBy treating criminals poorly, we become just as barbaric as they are.‚Äù



‚ÄúAll criminals, even the most serious and heinous of criminals, ultimately did what they did because of factors outside of their control.‚Äù



I see the merit in all of these arguments. However, I don‚Äôt believe they hold up for various reasons. 


The first argument is the most pragmatic. It emphasizes the fact that as a society we need to maximize every members productivity and good moral standing. With that being said, this may not apply to a good portion of criminals. 

I think that many violent criminals simply cannot ever be productive members of society. My argument is essentially that the vast majority of those who commit deviant acts will never be safe enough to reenter society. They cannot be changed. I feel fairly strongly that to commit crime of certain magnitude whether it is murder, rape, unprovoked assault, or even stealing from or general abuse of the vulnerable, requires a basal lack of empathy that simply cannot be reversed. It is an immutable mental characteristic that will not bend or give quarter. I think the vast majority of those who commit these crimes are psychopaths through and through. I leave room for some exceptions of course, but I would bet that such exceptions are few and far between. 





The second argument is faulty because it presumes that just because suffering is involved, it is inherently barbaric. We aren‚Äôt the Amorites, we don‚Äôt subscribe to an eye for an eye type of system. For example, this type of vengeance would be raping a rapist and sending them on their way, or beating up someone who beat someone up. Our chosen method of punishment is serving time in prison, a universal punishment for all criminals, with the severity of the crime allowing for adjustment of amount of time served. This serves the double purpose of punishment, and potentially protecting society from a dangerous person. 




The third argument appeals to extreme compassion, and I actually don‚Äôt disagree with the basic premise. All crimes, at the end of the day, are circumstantial. Whatever went wrong in someone‚Äôs life, or a psychological deformity they were born with, caused them to commit a crime. With that being said, we venture too far into the realm of getting to comfortable with people who have done severe wrong. While true that it was ultimately not their choice to do what they have done, these are still dangerous and manipulative people who have a grave inclination to hurt others. I think extreme examples can give us a better idea of this principle. People like Peter Scully or Albert Fish are always ones that come to mind. Sometimes, someone really is close to evil even if it ultimately never their choice, and that deserves at least some kind of punishment. 




While the goals put forth by proponents of a more humane system are admirable, they are too lost in in either robotic pragmatism, moral superiority, or mindless overextended compassion. 



I‚Äôm not suggesting that our prison system does not need reform. Prisons in America are simply not conducive to an image of a civilized society. Stories about people getting stabbed or raped in prison should give us absolutely no pleasure. But even still,for the victims of crimes and society itself, at the end of the day, justice must prevail."

People can be ruthless, instead of explaining I was told how wrong I was and so on. Where I'm from, there's no she/her or he/him, that didn't matter though. Yes, I grew up knowing there's only male and female, thats still my view althought that doesn't mean I'm going to bash anyones who is in the Lgbtq, I'm going to be happy for the people who know themselves, gay or not. I have friends and a bestfriend who is in the lgbtq community but also share the same view as I do, I don't care if people around me are gay, trans etc. We're all people, sure some people don't feel included thats why more pronouns are created but damn, I couldn't keep up."

Many people who play blackjack (for example) are amazingly successful in life and have good paying jobs and more money than they know what to do with. That said, they are delusional when it comes to their odds of winning and what they have to do to justify things. From tapping the cards 3 times to limiting players on the table, what they are doing will earn the favor of the gods. My thoughts are that people do this knowingly or unknowingly to make things bearable. The same I think applies to life.

The first people that seem obvious to point out are those who are religious and believe in a god. All signs point to the idea that your religion probably isn‚Äôt the right one. But people will ignore that because without religion their life would not be as good as without the belief.

The same could be said I think about even something like science and reason. We know that people have been wrong throughout history about countless scientific discoveries. Yet we believe we are right because that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at in time. While I fall in this boat I still feel like everything that people do is to justify living and to make their life better.

Maybe I just think that people have no purpose and anything they come up with is really just lying to themselves. Part of why I want this view changed is that I used to be a firm believer that love was one of the major purposes that we have in life but I‚Äôve been feeling less connected to that way of thinking and would like to go back.

For example, 

[the earth was created in 6 days](https://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/what-are-7-days-of-creation)

[the entire earth was flooded and only two members of each species were preserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark)

The entire existence of Jesus as a historical figure is supported by only [30 sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus#:~:text=The%20historicity%20of%20Jesus%20is,regarded%20as%20a%20fringe%20theory)

The compilations of the gospels are very questionable. The oldest surviving fragments of the gospels date 300 years after Jesus' death, and are written in Greek, Coptic, Latin, Armenian (Jesus and his disciples would not have any literacy in these) and the authors are completely unknown. To recognize the writings in these books as historically accurate, while simultaneously claiming that Hindu, Greek, or Roman myths are nonsense in comparison, is entirely hypocritical.

That summarizes the bulk of my point, but if you want more evidence of the prominence of outlandish and farfetched stories in Abrahamic religions, here's a bit more.

[Muhammad riding a flying donkey to from Mecca to Jerusalem, and ascended to heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isra%27_and_Mi%27raj)

So naturally, when challenged, most people go into an intense defensive state, denying everything their opponent says.

1,2023-07-12,CMV: electoral fusion should be legal throughout the US.,u/PublicFurryAccount,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14xqt1u/cmv_electoral_fusion_should_be_legal_throughout/,changemyview,"Electoral fusion is when two or more parties agree to nominate the same candidate. This practice is only fully legal in New York and Connecticut, the former of which has been covered nationally somewhat because of the relationship between Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and the Working Families Party.

I think electoral fusion solves a major dilemma in the American political system: minor political parties need to run candidates in prominent elections to gain attention but, for that same reason, the voters will be wasting their vote. With electoral fusion, a minor party can nominate a major-party candidate while still running their own in down ballot races they‚Äôre more likely to win. This allows the minor party to be a player without being a spoiler, garner attention, and provide a political home for its members (who no longer need to strategically split their ticket).

Further, I think this might help ease political cynicism. Many people treat party membership as an identity and some dissatisfaction with politics is no doubt linked to identity mismatch. People who are Democrats because they oppose Republicans, for example, might be happier in the Green or Purple Parties *if they can be assured that voting third party won‚Äôt throw the election.*

This isn‚Äôt a view I hold terribly strongly but I do hold it."

3. The COVID vaccines are 95% effective against infection

Now, onto climate change science. This is funded by basically the exact same people who fund COVID science, like Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum. This science, like COVID science, blames humans for all the world's ills. And climate science always involves some NWO solutions like blocking the sun. Heck, I've sometimes heard climate lockdowns suggested too.

Aren't we really just returning to normal after the Little Ice Age? The Little Ice Age only ended about 150-170 years ago, and I'm pretty sure it was the coldest period since the Big Ice Age.

Even if humans are causing the world to get warmer, why is this a bad thing? Why does the climate change cult want it to be so cold?"
1,2023-07-12,cmv: I'm a thirder in the Sleeping Beauty problem (Probabilities),u/Bengamey_974,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14xsmxk/cmv_im_a_thirder_in_the_sleeping_beauty_problem/,changemyview,"**Here is the problem :**

[Sleeping Beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty) volunteers to undergo the following experiment and is told all of the following details: On Sunday she will be put to sleep. Once or twice, during the experiment, Sleeping Beauty will be awakened, interviewed, and put back to sleep with an amnesia-inducing drug that makes her forget that awakening. A [fair coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_coin) will be [tossed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_flipping) to determine which experimental procedure to undertake:

* If the coin comes up heads, Sleeping Beauty will be awakened and interviewed on Monday only.
* If the coin comes up tails, she will be awakened and interviewed on Monday and Tuesday.

In either case, she will be awakened on Wednesday without interview and the experiment ends.

Any time Sleeping Beauty is awakened and interviewed she will not be able to tell which day it is or whether she has been awakened before. During the interview Sleeping Beauty is asked: ""What is your [credence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credence_(statistics)) now for the proposition that the coin landed heads?"".

**Context :**

The problem  continues to produce ongoing debate  with halfers telling the answer is 1/2 and thirders telling the answer is 1/3.

&#x200B;

**My understanding of it :**

My initial intuition is to say 1/3. She could either be on monday heads, monday tails or tuesday tails both having the same probability. Only one of the 3 possible cases include the coin coming up on heads, so from her point of view the probability that the coin landed on heads is 1/3.

If she would have to bet on what the coin landed on and be rewarded 10$ each time she is correct, she should answer tails and she would earn twice as much money.

&#x200B;

I imagined 2 other different problems :

**Problem 1 :**

Same initial procedure but :

* If the coin comes up heads, Sleeping Beauty will be awakened and interviewed on Monday .
* If the coin comes up tails, Sleeping Beauty will not be awakened on Monday nor Tuesday.

In either case, she will still be awakened on Wednesday without interview and the experiment ends.

Any time Sleeping Beauty is awakened and interviewed. During the interview Sleeping Beauty is asked: ""What is your [credence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credence_(statistics)) now for the proposition that the coin landed heads?"".

Since she know she is awake and interviewed, she know for sure the coin landed on heads and she should answer that the probability that the coin landed on heads is 1 and that the probability that the coin landed on tails is 0.

**Problem 2 :**

Same initial procedure but :

* If the coin comes up heads, she will be awakened and interviewed on Monday and Tuesday. On both monday and tuesday her hand would be painted red.
* If If the coin comes up tails, she will be awakened and interviewed on Monday and Tuesday. On monday her hand would be painted red and on tuesday her hands would be painted blue.

In either case, she will still be awakened on Wednesday without interview and the experiment ends.

Any time Sleeping Beauty is awakened and interviewed. During the interview Sleeping Beauty is asked: ""What is your [credence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credence_(statistics)) now for the proposition that the coin landed heads?"".

If her hand is blue she know for sure she is on Tuesday and that the coin landed on tails, so she should answer that the probability that the coin landed on heads is 0.

If her hand is red we are in the same situation than the intial problem and I think she should answer 1/3.

**Opinion on the formulation of the problem :**

I found the formulation of the problem to not be very good.

It hides that there are 2 unknowns :

\- Did the coin came up on heads or tails ?

\- Are we monday or tuesday?

It also hide that the princess as a piece of information (She know she is awake at the very moment she is interviewed) and that this information is a result of the combined effects of the 2 unknowns.

The question asked to the princess should be ""Knowing that right now you are awake and interviewed, what is your [credence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credence_(statistics)) now for the proposition that the coin landed heads?"" The probability asked is in fact a conditionnal probability.

Am I missing something ?

EDIT: Side question : In the intial problem what should the sleeping beauty answer to the question "" What is your credence that today is monday?"" ?"
1,2023-07-12,CMV: Let's talk about it. Feminism has turned into a disease which mostly indicates that you hate men. It's used as justification for improper treatment of the male gender.,u/Mikethereal23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14xtydc/cmv_lets_talk_about_it_feminism_has_turned_into_a/,changemyview,"First and foremost, I don't hate women. I have a loving girlfriend, sister and mother. Now let me explain, I hate how feminism has gone from having pride in your gender to basically ""men shouldn't have any rights and need to shut up on any topic that possibly involves a female"". I just hate the hypocrisies that you ladies surround yourself with.

9 out of 10 double standards benefit woman so why do we pretend like we still need the constant push of feminism still?

You want to be treated equal and yet majority (70-85%) of you will not approach a man and wait to be pursued, how is this equal? By now shouldn't we have just as many girls chasing guys as guys chasing girls? No because you ladies want that double standard to stay the same. Make it make sense

Guys are still the ones buying gifts for Valentines Day, we are expected to hold the door, while if we expect a woman that can cook and clean and it's, "" HOW DARE you want me to cook and clean because I am a woman."" LIKE WHAT.

""Happy wife, happy life"" expression? Really? Just say a man can't be happy in a relationship

One of my favorites is how a woman can be crying and sad on facebook and she will get support and attention from everyone around. A guy doing the same gets told to man up, we as men aren't allowed to have feelings apparently.

You complain about being single while turning down guy after guy whether from ignoring DM's, simply being picky asf, ignoring the guys trying on dating apps all to go for the guy above your ""station"" when as for most men we start with, is she pretty (most of yall from 19-40 are) and boom we can start somewhere. Make it make sense

You complain about being treated like objects but want to be help and treated like a trophy or prize to be won. WHAT, make it make sense.

Let's talk about how the guy is paying for dates and gifts all for the womans time and she still might say no. Yet women complain about the dating world suiting men more? What

A woman can hit a man but when a man lays a hand on a woman in retaliation, he gets jumped like ""don't touch her, how dare you hit a woman."" WHAT, it makes you want to almost laugh laugh laugh.

Only Fans is the ultimate form of backwards feminism because yall females justify stripping online because ""it's for a paycheck"" basically admitting that as long as you do something for money that doesn't harm anyone it's okay no matter how morally wrong it is, just like stripping/selling your body for money used to be frowned upon and it's damn near encouraged now adays (stripping much more than selling your body as selling your body is still pretty frowned upon). But in 2023 it's now justified as a woman that you can do anything for a check and be supported. Disgusting. We value women degrading themselves by selling there titties and ass but the construction worker can't even make half that much. Like I heard an only fans girl ""low level"" makes an extra 5,000 a month from only fans. FIVE THOUSAND A MONTH, making more women lazy and ""oh I can just stay home and show off my body for money"" sad society we live in and don't give me the bullshit reason ""her body her choice, it doesn't hurt you so why do you care"".

Oh not to mention yalll love sleeping around now like men do. If you are ""better"" than men then why are you copying us? IT IS MUCH EASIER for a girl to get laid than a guy, WE ARE DIFFERENT. Which is why it's considered slutty to sleep with a bunch of men because girls can dick easier than guys can get pussy which is why it used to be frowned upon but now no, SLUT SHAMING is illegal and god forbid.

Last but not least, when a woman is fat like Lizzo, she is empowered to keep eating like a slob, let yourself go and enjoy those curves. For guys we are just told we are fat and need to lose weight. Like no, EVERYONE should exercise and stay in shape, some people have issues where they can't but most don't, hence a society where fat shaming women gets you crucified.

So a woman can say, I don't date short guys but a man can't say, I don't date fat women. WHAT. One you can control and the other you can't. Make it make sense.

Let's talk about

&#x200B;

I don't know when woman equality started turning into men being treated as lesser citizens and slaves but I don't stand for it and fight it at every turn.

Once again I don't hate women, I hate feminism and what is has turned into which is almost like a cult that hates men and wants the world to bow down to them while we are suppose to just sit back and watch as feminism slowly tries to take away the rights of men.

This makes no sense to me, if someone is genuinely messed up in the head then they clearly have no ability to understand the gravity of their actions or feel remorse, making them 10x worse than your average guy who just had a bad day.

Gay, straight, bi, trans, or whatever. It doesn‚Äôt bother me since I keep to myself and you can live your life however you feel. However, the rampant trans activism is creeping into everyday life and now is causing the opposite effect these activists think it‚Äôs having. 

Now this is probably just because the internet is home to the most aggressive and annoying ‚Äúactivists‚Äù, but people screaming and treating misgendering someone akin to calling them the N-word is where you lose my support. 

The entire trans community is being handled with kid gloves. Making a joke about trans people? Almost illegal and certainly grounds for someone being fired now. Disagreeing with a trans topic? Banned on most subreddits. Hell, there‚Äôs a proposed bill in Canada to make it punishable by up to $25,000 for misgendering someone, or participate in an anti-LGBTQ topics. Canada is literally making safety zones where mean words are punishable by $25,000. If someone threatens a trans person in a ‚ÄúSafety Zone‚Äù then sure fine their ass. But mean words aren‚Äôt violence. I‚Äôm sorry to break it to you, but name calling isn‚Äôt akin to threatening your life. And don‚Äôt try and tell me some stupid comparison about how yelling ‚ÄúBomb‚Äù is illegal and punishable by law. They‚Äôre not even remotely the same. 

Lastly, the uptick in over the top trans support. I‚Äôm not one of the ‚Äúoh trans person on a bud light can, never drink Bud light again‚Äù people. That‚Äôs dumb. It‚Äôs also dumb when people get mad over corporations advertising the trans flag during pride month. They‚Äôre in it for the money. Neither side should care what corporations do as long as it‚Äôs not glaring displays of hatred towards your group. No, the thing I‚Äôm tired of is people forcing trans into every facet of life. I‚Äôm not denying trans people exist, but there sure as hell isn‚Äôt enough trans people to make it center stage in everything. I don‚Äôt need my kid learning about trans stuff in school. That‚Äôs not because I hate trans people, it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt want anything sexually based taught to my kid, or referenced. It‚Äôs a child. Anything sexual based is a no go. Gay, straight, trans. No. 

And for the love of god. Have trans pride parades all you want. But god damn‚Ä¶let‚Äôs not have nudists walking around in public or having floats that are wildly and blatantly sexual.

Of course my clueless parents started to judge me because they had ‚Äúno idea how this happened!‚Äù This messed with my view of food as I got older. I went through a lot of dark times in my life. I am okay now, but the point being is that when I see very fat children I feel for them. I get pissed at parents that don‚Äôt care about their child‚Äôs health. That shit is child abuse. Instead of acknowledging their emotions, you just give them food to shut them up and give them large portions because you think they can or should eat as much as an adult, if not more.

I don‚Äôt hate anybody who‚Äôs fat, I never will, however I hate that people enable this behavior with kids. You don‚Äôt need to weigh a certain amount but it‚Äôs ridiculous to allow this to happen to your child which will get them bullied, ruin their health, stump their growth and take away the ability to move their bodies which is essential in building their health. Letting your child get obese should be in the same category of abuse as not feeding your child or hitting them. These are all such destructive methods of child abuse yet I feel like not enough people speak out about this. Am I wrong?"

This can be in the home, or in the office.  The problem I see, is that they are often totally fine with that in specific situations.  Here are a few. 

Taking out garbage.  In just about every heterosexual relationship I know where they are living together, the man is expected to take out the garbage the majority of the time.  Many times women will even take it out of the can, but leave it for the man to take out.  So there is no ""physical"" limitation.  Its just they don't want to. 

Babysitting.  Most people are fine with the idea that when hiring a babysitter, it will, by default be a girl/woman.  It may be that if a guy is an outlier, they'd consider him.  But in reality, they will almost always look for a girl. 

Mowing lawn/shoveling snow.  Similar to garbage.  In a heterosexual relationship, those things are assumed going to be done by the men the majority of time.  If its a big snow, sure, the woman may help if there are multiple shovels.  But that isn't the expectation. 

Even in terms of raising kids now.  There seems to be a big push to make sure boys know how to cook and clean, so they don't expect women to do that when they are grown, but I don't typically see the same push to make sure women are mowing lawns and shoveling snow.  

Why is it a problem for it to be assumed a woman will cook for her man, but totally ok to assume the man will take out the garbage?  It just seems to be a situation where people are hypocrites. Just say there are some things you think men or women are better at.  "
1,2023-07-12,CMV: I think being LGBTQIA+ is a congenital defect,u/Apprehensive-Bad-700,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14y09mh/cmv_i_think_being_lgbtqia_is_a_congenital_defect/,changemyview,"As someone who's been for LGBTQIA+ rights my entire life, in recent years i feel like the movement has become a bit over simplified/normalized which leads to harm/ignorance and hate in my opinion

  
As the title says i personally believe that being part of the LGBTQIA+ community should technically be considered a congenital variation/defect, (birth defect) this word does carry alot of negative connotations which i understand, even though i disagree with that connotation.

  
Lets go deeper into what that technically means

  
Congenital disorders are also known as congenital abnormalities, congenital malformations or birth defects. They can be defined as structural or functional anomalies (for example, metabolic disorders) that occur during intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally, at birth, or sometimes may only be detected later in infancy, such as hearing defects. Broadly, congenital refers to the existence at or before birth.

  
We can catergorize this is two different categories.

  
Genetic cause: in this catergory we have Downs syndrome and a few single gene defects, including certain intersex conditions

  
Enviromental: This is actually where most of the conditions come from since if we think of how complex and fragile gestation is, and we need to understand that due to the fact evolution is a step by step basis (meaning each mutation needs to be advantageous), since we didnt adapt a more isolated enviroment for gestation and the body doesnt have a way to check if the pregnancy developed according to the genome if the pregnancy gets affected by certain external forces changes happen, this is why enviromental changes are the more common ones

  
We have not yet found a conclusive reason why people are born gay/trans/ace/lesbian.  
The most current agreed upon theory within the biological field is the, hormone exposure theory, in simple terms, during gestation signaling hormones act as guides to tell cells how to assemble, this can affect both how you feel about yourself and sexuality.

My issue is that people no longer consider these conditions, people seem to think now that we evolved to be that way, when things like Autism, Schizophrenia, ADHD, OCD which even have genetic causes which means that atleast they are in the natural selection phase of evolution.

Censoring the discussion and what I would argue is the genuine nuance of any ‚Äúp3do debate‚Äù is the standard online and to me what I see it as is a form of cancel culture that‚Äôs 100% completely socially acceptable and approved by virtually everybody. It‚Äôs completely fine to accuse someone of being a p3do and will be cheered on by 100% of people if someone dare says something like ‚Äúwell you can‚Äôt really tell the difference between 17 and 18‚Äù, and the logic behind this is that it‚Äôs ‚Äúsus‚Äù, and ‚Äúwhy would they want to talk about that topic if they aren‚Äôt a p3d‚Äù? What it really shows to me is how many people (conservatives) who say they‚Äôre ‚Äúanti cancel culture‚Äù and ‚Äúanti censorship‚Äù actually are when someone says the ‚Äúwrong thing‚Äù.

All of that is nonsense, to every idiot who will accuse me because of this post, why do people like any controversial topic? Because it‚Äôs controversial. And you can‚Äôt get any more controversial than this topic so that‚Äôs why I would believe psychologically that people would want to debate any nuance of this, it has nothing to do with them wanting to commit horrible immoral shit. And I do empathize with this to some extent, on the extremes if you have someone saying a fucking 6 year old can consent then yeah I‚Äôd agree there might be something bigger going on there. But most things people bring up are not that extreme and are actually more nuanced than I think anyone gives credit for, and that‚Äôs what frustrates me about this is that it seems like nobody agrees there‚Äôs nuance to some of this stuff.

Here are some examples of nuanced debate topics that get censored and shut down and you‚Äôll be called a p3d for talking about, but I find these all to be not only nuanced but very fascinating and worthwhile topics to discuss:

The nuance of consent, at what brain state is consent considered invalid

Is being attracted to underage girls who have hit puberty something that‚Äôs biologically normal

At what point is an age gap immoral, if two minors can consent with each other but can‚Äôt consent with an adult where‚Äôs the middle ground, is 16-19 okay, is 17-21 okay, etc

Isn‚Äôt it true that some underage relationships might turn out fine (I can see why this one would be bad optics wise to say)

Is calling hebephilia ‚Äúpedophilia‚Äù disingenuous

Should a non offending clinical pedophile be accepted in society

Is there EVER remorse for someone who harms a child even after 30-40 years

Do boys have less mental ramifications from sex than girls do

Is female to male rape as bad as male to female rape

If being attracted to a 17 year old is degenerate, shouldn‚Äôt being attracted to an 18 year old be degenerate as well

I feel like it can‚Äôt be reasonably argued that these types of discussion aren‚Äôt nuanced, again if someone comes in and says ‚Äúhey guys  can a 5 year old consent?‚Äù, then I can understand being a little bit more suspicious because that‚Äôs not a nuanced debate (although I NEVER believe in censoring discussion). But when someone starts getting accusatory for trying to debate a ‚Äúp3do‚Äù argument that actually has nuance and substance, and decides to shut down that conversation, I see it as nonsense. Absolute monkey brained cancel culture nonsense.

To change my view I would like a logical reason  that either we should censor these debates because it‚Äôs harmful, that these debates aren‚Äôt nuanced, or that there‚Äôs some good reason I‚Äôm not seeing to get accusatory of anyone arguing about these debates, basically that the pedophile witch hunt online is justified in some way.

 In my view, this is not suitable. What's the purpose of a job? It's our contribution to society in exchange for payment that we use to do our basic needs. You can still make 10k per month as a white collar worker and still have not a lot of money left due to other factors such as family and property maintenance and a blue collar worker could not make a lot of money in terms of monthly pay but would have plenty left to spend due to prudent savings and money management.

As for males working in traditionally pink collar jobs such as nursing and teaching, it's a job. As long you have money for your needs and wants, it's okay to work in the job itself.

&#x200B;

TL:DR. Jobs should not be viewed through collar colour by people. As long as they have money from their jobs for their needs and wants, they should not view jobs by collar color but just as jobs...

I think he was a bad president, and I do not agree with his positions whatsoever. I think he is a narcissistic megalomaniac, a populist con artist, a demagogue, a clown, a reactionary, you name it. However, just purely in terms of the political theater, the performance ""art"", and maneuvering an election campaign, him winning the 2016 election was a great accomplishment. 

First of all, he was being attacked at all angles and really had no business winning that election. The media was running attacks on him 24/7, the Republican party establishment didn't accept him, liberals, progressives, and leftists all despised him. Even though he was extremely wealthy and had a celebrity status, he was still running as an outsider and an underdog. It was a time where ""political correctness"" was the norm, and he was extremely brazen and politically incorrect. Everybody was predicting him to lose the election, people were shocked when he ended up winning. Obviously he lost the popular vote, but against all odds he managed to win the key swing states and become the president. 

Second of all, say what you will about Trump as a person or about his views, but he is undeniably great at playing ""the game."" He was able to turn his biggest weaknesses into his biggest strengths. The fact that he was so shameless and controversial caused him to become the absolute center of attention and hijack the spotlight. The fact that he refused to be politically correct and went the complete opposite direction, along with being an ""outsider"", allowed him to stand out from the herd in the republican primary. His ability to be entertaining and put on a show, almost like a WWE villain, gained him a cult of personality following that resonated with certain key demographics to winning the election. ""Make America Great Again"" proved itself to be an incredibly effective campaign slogan. He also used social media to his advantage very effectively.

Third, some of his scorched earth tactics were absolutely insane. He completely dismantled Jeb Bush just by using two words: ""low energy."" Some of his comebacks during debates were straight gas. ""You've attacked women, belittled their appearance, called them pigs.....only Rosy O'Donnell"". H: ""If you were the president --"" ; D: ""you'd be in jail"". His campaign was completely dirty and low brow. It had no real substance, it was just pure portraying himself as a cult of personality leader who relentlessly attacked anyone who went against him. Say what you will about this strategy, but you can't deny that he executed it well. 

Conclusion, Trump was a terrible president and is a terrible human being, but he is incredibly talented when it comes to marketing, entertainment, and political theater. Winning the 2016 election against all odds using his unorthodox tactics was a great accomplishment."

* Ukraine not being a part of NATO has meant that the rest of NATO (most specifically the US) is not obligated to send troops to fight Russian invaders. Yes the West can still send aid to them, but that's different than direct action of having US troops fighting Russian troops.
* Ukraine not being NATO has meant that the US cannot put nuclear missiles in Ukraine.

So this means that Ukraine becoming part of NATO will mean the following:

* US troops WILL be obligated to fight directly against Russian troops. Meaning that the US and Russia will be in open conflict rather than the proxy wars which have defined the post WWII years till today.
* Ukraine will no longer be a 'buffer zone' between these two massive nuclear superpowers.
* The US will be able to put nukes in Ukraine.

I think this is going to trigger WWIII, because:

1: It guarantees that US and Russian troops will be in conflict. And as Noam Chomsky once said:  'If the US and Russia ever went to war than that's it. Organized human life as we know it will be over.' (Paraphrase) Obviously he's talking about the deployment of nuclear weapons. (He also said that world peace requires Ukrainian neutrality) 

2: Russia \*cannot\* allow for, or tolerate, nukes being directly on their boarder. Just like America could NOT tolerate the USSR having nukes in Cuba. This lead to the Cuban missile crisis, which \*almost\* resulted in WWIII and an unfathomable amount of death. 

So if Ukraine joins NATO we are guaranteed to have a Ukrainian missile crisis in the near future. And this time who knows? It might not go the other way and means we'd be leaving the fate of the human race up to a dice roll."
1,2023-07-12,"CMV: The ""hard problem of consciousness"" is based on a premise that isn't actually accurate, and also has no empirical evidence. In other words, a misunderstanding, and as such, can never be solved, and even the premise perhaps be wrong.",u/rubenespanyol,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14y9uyv/cmv_the_hard_problem_of_consciousness_is_based_on/,changemyview,"To give context, the hard problem is this: 

* How does the brain, a complex arrangement of matter, give rise to subjective conscious experience or qualia?
* We have no idea how exactly matter, an object/thing, causes conscious experience, e.g. experience of the sweetness of sugar, redness of a color, hardness of texture
* Why can't I just eat a candy, have my brain detect its chemical composition, react to it, and send signals to the body about what to do? How is it that there is a movie-experience about it consisting mainly of the experience of sweetness and texture/feeling of the candy in my mouth? 

What it isn't

* It's not about what consciousness is
* It's not about how we sense and behave as human organisms, in regards to neuroscience and how the brain is related to mental and bodily functions (this is the easy problem)

**The premise** of the hard problem (which I think is wrong): 

* *The brain produces/causes conscious experience*. This premise comes from the assumption that matter existed first, then after some evolutionary complexity, it produced conscious experience. Though there is a correlation between brain states and conscious experience, it has never been proven that the brain produces consciousness. There isn't even a solid hypothesis about it, let alone a standing theory which this premise is based on. In short, the premise is a complete assumption, but the only one we have.

We may need to define:

* Consciousness - subjective experience; the lights are on; there is a movie wherein ""I"" am the center of experience; there is an experience of sweetness even though it could just be enough to have a sensor and a complex if-else instinct (like a robot) to be able to function and survive

The ""emergent property"" theory still doesn't help. It just says that ""the biology just does that"", yet the brain (matter, object) is an entirely different category of ""stuff"" to consciousness. I'm not sure if it is graspable how different they are and why this is being referred to as the hard problem. The emergence theory still doesn't bridge the gap, nor even gives any idea/hypothesis on how to bridge it. 

There are other theories that address this, but all of which that still use the same premise leave me still unconvinced.

My point is that the hard problem has only been persistent because we refuse to change our premise. The alternative I am convinced by, unfortunately, isn't empirical (ironically this means NOT SUBJECTIVE, about a topic that concerns subjectivity itself) enough to be presented for public discussion. 

So I will leave it at just that. I'd like to hear your opinions about this hard problem and how I might be wrong, particularly on either: 

* How it can be solved
* How it isn't a hard problem"

Now, everyone says that those are bad, but a few days ago, I finally understand the root of it: American workers are so lonely and so isolated that they substitute their identity with politics. It is a natural evolution of the alienation that capitalism brings (and especially late-stage capitalism)   


If we are to follow this logic, it even could be argue that establishment of coops and the such could eventually lead decrease in radical views among the conservatives (racists, bigots, etc)   


We should stop promoting competition and start promoting what we are really good at: cooperation.  "
1,2023-07-13,"CMV: Cooking yourself from scratch can, should, and likely will be made redundant and obsolete",u/ChipProfessional5875,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14yc5t8/cmv_cooking_yourself_from_scratch_can_should_and/,changemyview,"When I lived with my parents, I treated cooking as something that either my mum will do, or a duty to take part in. Now that I live alone, I treat ""getting food"" as a pressing quality-of-life issue. In the meantime, I began really looking into weight loss (I used to be obese), and so addressing all these issues made be believe that: cooking yourself from scratch can, should, and likely will be made redundant and obsolete. Below are the separate (but connected) explanations to this view.

TL;DR- Most points are around economies of scale and sustainable life

1. Economies of scale - especially with cooking, and especially with certain kinds of food (rice-based dishes, soups, etc - admittedly not so much with burgers and pizzas) - cooking more of the same thing will not require too much extra labor, thus lowering costs. For example, double of the soup - will not require double the labor. So the costs will be down, and may eventually phase out cooking. Just like with cloud computing or Amazon delivery.

2. Eating premade foods/eating out is more dieting-friendly. Hear me out! If you cook something from scratch, then

* It is difficult to estimate how much of the ingredients do you use. One day, you may use some exact number of tomatos, sugar, salt and another day - you may use your leftovers.
* It is difficult to estimate nutricional stats as the ingredients' state is changed. If you cook, you always want to scramble, boil, roast, fry or grill - because then you get much more nutricional value from your ingredients. However, what does that value become? I.e. Did you just make your food fatty by adding that nice sauce to your fried chicken, and how much fattier did it become?

In comparison, when you use pre-cooked food or when you eat out - you tend to be able to find out about calories, fats, sugars, fiber etc - because these industries are highly legistlated. And, as a sidenote, you can often take quick and easy steps (as compared to convincing youserved not to add that tasty but unhealthy ingredient to the food when you are cooking yourself)

3. Expiry dates! Don't get me started. When some types of food expire, the smell is horrible! Pre-cooked food usually takes months if not years. And when you are eating out, you usually eat the food straight away. And again, for the big 'food places' (restaurants, cafes, food stands and vans) -  because of economies of scale, the expiration management is more streamlined

4. Just the sheer amount of time and space consumed. For cooking at home, you need stoves, grills, microwaves, coffee machines, knives, forks, dishes. After the food is eaten, the dishes need to be washed - which can be remediated by a hopefully-not-breaking dishwasher, which itself needs to take up space. Life is already too short, and wasting it on washing dishes is painful for me to think about. When you use pre-cooked food, you can often get away with an oven or a microwave, and you often can re-use the food packaging (I.e. pizza box or rice container) as a dish. With eating out, these time and space costs are streamlined and optimized

5. Eco reasons. As much as I hate ecoactivists sometimes, I think even them will eventually realize that streamlined food chains are easier to eco-optimize than regulating for how long a stove can be turned on. The recent push for artificial lab-grown meat also puts pre-cooked food and eating out in a move favorable light with eco-people

&#x200B;

Looking into a more distant future, if my predictions are right, then cooking yourself will have no solid ground. Hear me out! For example, for streamlining dieting as described in pt.2, the governments of developed countries, that are concerned about obesity nationwide - will likely introduce sophisticated apps and gadgets to help track food consumption - much more user-friendly and sophisticated than there are now. They will probably also discourage cooking yourself through taxation. Ecoactivism will only make matters worse for cooking yourself, and economies of scale overall will make pre-cooked food more accessible - for example through more streamlined deliveries, whereas the supermarkets will probably focus less on raw ingredients. So, who will be left to cook food yourself? I can only see niche groups of people: financially upper class who really love cooking themselves and not use a restaurant? Distant farmers? People with extremely specific dietary wants or needs? But probably not an average city-commuter having a 9-5 job and other things going on in life.

&#x200B;

P.S. I'm biased in my thoughts, for many reasons. I lost 30+kg by dieting (65+ pounds). I recently noticed that supermarkets try to appear eco-friendly, so it probably means that they are not. I also love my time and don't really enjoy cooking"

First of all I believe that both men and women shouldrecieve equal opporunities and protection but I don't believe men and women are equal.
There are many pshysical and psychological differences between a man and a women and we should strive to complete each other not be the same.
Nowdays it seems that every masculine trait is considered to be toxic and men are encouraged to become more feminine.
Being a provider for your family, a protector, more dominant and less emotional are no longer portraied as desirable qualities for a men instead women are pushed to take this role and men are becoming more feminine and emotionally unstable.
There is also a strong wave of misandry pushed by the feminist wave and usually there are little to no consequences for being a misandrist but you're judged harshly and punished for being a misogynist.
The biggest issues is that there are a lot of companies that hire on political agendas and they try to keep the workplace 50/50 which is very harmful for the economy because it doesn't promote meritocracy.
Overall in my opinion society is trying to destroy male identity, emasculate men and portray men as abusers and women as victims."

I believe eating the marshmallow straight away is the rational choice.

Firstly, consumption of a good has diminishing marginal utility. In this case, the second marshmallow is never as good as the first one. This isn‚Äôt the basis of my argument, but does go on to strengthen the weighing of utility I do later. 

Simply, I believe the act of waiting for the marshmallow - the tense ‚Äòwhen will he be back‚Äô, ‚Äòmy that marshmallow looks tasty if only I could have a bite‚Äô represents negative utility to whoever‚Äôs waiting. (especially if you consider the further utility gained if the child just goes back to playing with its toys.)

Watching the videos of the children stressing over the wait, tentatively (and adorably) glancing furtively  at the marshmallow was the initial line of reasoning here. I believe this is called hedonic pathways, and is what advertisers do - all those colours on foods to make them enticing- inducing hunger and discomfort to prompt you to buy those foods. 

Similar to how I wouldn‚Äôt wait an hour in a queue to a great restaurant when I could have a nearly-great restaurant and it‚Äôs food straight away, I believe the negative utility gained in waiting exceeds the diminished utility in waiting for the food. 

Thus, the child should eat the marshmallow and just go back to playing with its toys (assuming that it couldn‚Äôt do that originally and is left to their own thoughts.)"

I absolutely believe that if the Left *properly* employed right wing media and PR tactics they would stand a real chance on the global political stage.

The Left never riots, the Left never frames its opinions as controversial, the Left never gets a chance to laugh at the Right because all eyes are on the Right laughing at the Left!

It‚Äôs awful, that the political ideology that I and others like me believes in - one that promotes equality and peace, will never get a real chance to compete on the same stage as the closeted racist, capitalist warmongers who are seemingly on a mission to destroy our planet and everything on it.

I am convinced that catastrophic climate change is locked in, unavoidable, and the worldwide political climate, especially in the Western world, lacks the will to engage in any meaningful mitigation behavior or preparation. We are past the point of return and are now at the hockey stick portion of the graph where natural feedback loops continue to feed into each other and the crisis will become exponential.
  

  
* Multi-breadbasket crop failure combined with monocultures from GMO crops will result in massive worldwide famine in the next 5-10 years. ([Large scale crop failures are currently happening due to unpredictable weather patterns resulting from climate change](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-23/climate-change-threatens-china-s-crop-yield-food-security#xj4y7vzkg)). The nature of the Western supply chain is that Capitalism has optimized out all redundancy and safeties. We no longer maintain warehouses of perishable foods in any significant amounts; due to globalization to drive down production costs most food is in transit on a truck, or a cargo ship. The lack of resiliency to our system was revealed during the Covid Pandemic when supplies for many things ran short. Covid was nowhere near the scale of the climate crisis. Governments are not remotely prepared for mass migrations and famine; civil unrest and social breakdown will result.
  

  
* Western society will never willingly give up it's standard of living to save the human race on a meaningful time scale. Western society is unforgivably wasteful and it would require 6 planet earths worth of natural resources to maintain a Western standard of living for every human on Earth. The Western standard of living depends on the rest of the world not having it. Governments are aware of the issue, but the only solution is to immediately abandon Capitalism immediately in favor of survival and rationing, which a Western government will never willingly do and the public would never willingly accept as Western society has not been asked to make personal sacrifices on this scale since World War 2.
  

  
* [Wet bulb events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature) are beginning in the Western world. Wet bulb temperature readings are a temperature reading relative to humidity. At wet bulb 90 degrees, humans can no longer safely work outside. At 95 degrees, sweat will no longer evaporate from the body, which is how our bodies vent waste heat. At this point, if you don't have access to a form of artificial air conditioning, once the ambient temperate wherever you are reaches 95 degrees, your body will cook itself to death and you will be dead in 6 hours. [61000 people died](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/12/1187068731/heat-waves-europe-deaths-study) in the European heat wave last year. This June, wet bulb temperatures reached the[SE United States](https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/4074341-extreme-threat-large-swathe-of-southern-us-at-dangerous-wet-bulb-temperature/). As Web Bulb Events occur more often, they will result in mass casualties as high AC use will strain substandard infrastructure (see Texas power grid). Wet bulb events are already a major issue in SE Asia and the Middle East, which will be uninhabitable within the next decade or so.
  

  
* Extreme weather events will continue to strain government budgets until they break. Florida and California are becoming uninsurable and many major policy writers refuse to write new policies in these states. An uninsurable society is a nonfunctional one as it means financial ruin lurks around the corner for every citizen as these events continue to increase in frequency.
  

  
* Economic collapse will happen quickly once mass migrations begin, as local infrastructure fails to manage the massive number of refugees. If there are no jobs to be had and no one has any money to spend on nonessential items, then consumer culture will collapse. Crime will skyrocket as desperate refugees fight for food during shortages.
  

  
* Acidification in the ocean has killed [\~50% of all ocean life since 1970](https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/17/world/oceans-report/index.html). The impending [Blue Ocean Event](https://glennfay.medium.com/the-blue-ocean-event-will-be-a-tipping-point-for-our-climate-42c05898862c) combined with this, increased pollution making marine life unsafe to eat, and increasing temperatures will turn the oceans into a dead zone, devoid of anything capable of supporting human life.
  

  
* There is no existing technology that will be able to prevent this. Geoengineering is impractical. Proposed carbon capture technology is only theoretical until it's actively saving humanity, and to believe that it will avert catastrophe is a false hope at best.
  

  
There's a number of other points I could add, but I feel like that's more than enough to get a CMV thread going.

There is also the case that abortion is used as a means of eugenics. It is known that the disability community is divided over the issue of abortion. For example, in certain cases of pregnancy, there is prenatal screening for Down Syndrome and some forms of autism. This raises the ethics of the matter since some women who get a positive test result for Down Syndrome or ASD may consider terminating their pregnancy.

Why would Charles Darwin promote the idea that certain groups are inferior to one other due to certain characteristics when racist people like white supremacists can turn around and use the theory of evolution to defend racism?

I don't like racism because it reduces me to my skin color. But I want to accept the theory of evolution since much of the scientific community has built ideas and other works from evolution.

Now, when it comes to disability, some ableist people use evolution and Darwinism to defend this idea that because ""people with disabilities aren't fit to survive outside modern society, they do not deserve the right to life or procreation due to their disability"". How do people with disabilities fit into evolutionary theory and Social Darwinism? Do people with disabilities have inherent worth and dignity despite their disability?

**Better be careful how I word this since Mods treat any post with trans in it with kid gloves. So, mods cut me some slack and actually try to understand what I am saying before you pull out your red transphobe card and throw me out of the sub**



I am, what many on Reddit and the media call, a transphobe apparently. Which is ridiculous to me because I have no ill will towards to the trans community as whole. I do have issues with trans ‚Äúactivists‚Äù who are on a war path to label everyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with them as bigots/racists/transphobes. That needs to chill. 

But, my stance on trans people is complicated for some to understand. Mostly cause people are chomping at the bit to hit their transphobe comment quota everyday. However, I am someone who thinks if you have a penis you‚Äôre a man. I can‚Äôt force my brain to change that just because there‚Äôs this new wave of men transitioning to being women. I‚Äôve lived on this planet for 30 years and, before 3 years ago when the trans movement stormed out the gates, everyone agreed penis = man and vagina = woman. Which means pronouns are associated to your genitalia. Blows my mind that people find this statement offensive now, but I digress. 

So, even though I think having a penis means you‚Äôre a man, it doesn‚Äôt also mean I‚Äôm going to attack your way of living. I try to compare it to abortion rights. You know pro choice vs pro abortion. I am pro choice. Meaning I support your choice to live your life how you want. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean I fully agree with you. Pro choice, like with abortions, does not mean pro-abortion. It means I support your ability to choose how you live your life. I don‚Äôt have to agree on everything in your life in order to support you. Demanding support, or else be dragged on the internet, is a sure fire way to further the divide. You won‚Äôt win ANYONE over to your side with ultimatums. 

Lastly, all you people on Reddit who love using the word transphobe for the smallest things, shut up. Just stop it. Learn how to have a discussion. It honestly feels like the people who support trans rights the hardest are the LEAST empathetic people in the world. They like to view themselves as perfect humans who care so much, but are the quickest to name calling. The fact that disagreeing with biological men playing in women‚Äôs sports is a death sentence on this website is appalling. It‚Äôs not transphobic to disagree on a debate about how biological men and women are different and how it affects sports. 

Transphobia, or any phobia, has gone from its literal definition of fear, hatred or anger for a specific group to ‚Äúunless you agree with me 100% on every idea then you hate trans people.‚Äù I‚Äôm here to remind you that people will disagree with you in life and you have to deal with it in other ways than banning them. Yeah I‚Äôm talking to you Reddit. All you mods that are afraid of allowing people to discuss sensitive topics.

36,2023-07-13,CMV: being genuinely ugly makes your life significantly worse,u/KillaHotel,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14yol9h/cmv_being_genuinely_ugly_makes_your_life/,changemyview,"When I say this, I mean ugly from childhood and I mean UGLY. Not average. Ugly. As in a 3 out of 10 on a good day. I feel that there is a point where averageness becomes a level of objective ugliness. That‚Äôs what I am talking about and I want to make it clear before some guy says ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm ugly and I‚Äôve had no shortage of girls find me attractive‚Äù because they‚Äôre not ugly.

So being ugly from childhood does certain things to you as people treat you badly simply because you are an ugly childhood. This extends from adults and peers. I can remember being as young as 5 having entire classes mock me for the way I look. My parents were just as bad as even though they wouldn‚Äôt call me ugly, I would ask them if I was ugly and they would tell me that it doesn‚Äôt matter since they would love me no matter what I looked like which even as a kid the subtext was clear.

Even older into early ages of school, ugly children experience social isolation because no one wants to be friends with the ugly kid. As a result you miss out on formative social interactions and it sets you behind your peers.

This makes you different on three levels. You‚Äôre ugly, you‚Äôre a social outcast, and now you have maldeveloped social skills as a result of this. There‚Äôs a reason why social anxiety is so prevalent in ugly people. This usually leads to bullying. Mocking because of the way you look. I experienced this throughout high school and even early college. I had multiple bullies, there were girls who would simply just exclaim when they saw me then laugh to their friends about how I looked. 

I remember one occasion so vividly where I was walking by a a table in my universities dining hall and a girl looked up at me, made eye contact, let out a loud ‚Äúoop‚Äù. Then as I walked passed loudly whispered, ‚Äúgirl did you see him‚Äù and started laughing with her friends. Things like that are common for truly ugly people and it takes a toll on your self esteem. You go through life walking on eggshells knowing that when people see you the first thing they‚Äôll think of is how ugly you are.

Ugly people typically don‚Äôt have romantic experiences in their youth which makes romantic navigation much harder. You don‚Äôt know how to talk to people, or flirt because you‚Äôre so socially awkward and everyone finds you too ugly to flirt with anyways. This means you don‚Äôt make the same mistakes others do young and you become much less knowledgeable than the average person on those norms. Also if you‚Äôre male you have to deal with the stigma of being an older virgin. 

I‚Äôm a virgin at 22 and my female friends on multiple occasions said they think it‚Äôs weird for a guy to be a virgin at that age. So in my case that stigma is already starting and there‚Äôs not much I can do to change that. 

To top it off, most people also do their best to invalidate what you‚Äôre feeling. Especially if you ask for advice online. I‚Äôve tried and the advice is usually ‚Äúno one‚Äôs really fly, you‚Äôre likely average and compare yourself to hot people‚Äù when I know objectively speaking it‚Äôs not the case as average people don‚Äôt have the experiences I have. The same comes with family who will lie to you, therapists will placate you and not offer any solutions.

My therapist even told me that getting in better shape to get a girlfriend was a bad idea as it could lead me to hurt myself. Everyone would rather lie to ugly people in a adulthood even though we‚Äôve experienced the worst people have to offer early on.

That shapes your life and it will always be with you no matter what."
1,2023-07-13,CMV: Feminism is Good. Feminism is Unstoppable,u/Schmurby,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14yonmv/cmv_feminism_is_good_feminism_is_unstoppable/,changemyview,"I've seen a lot of posts on this sub and on Reddit overall that suggest that feminism is in some way to blame for a lot of society's ills.  I think that this is nonsense.  I think that if you respect women as full human beings, you have to see feminism as one of the greatest forces for good in the modern era.  

However, I also think that the reasons for the rise of feminism have nothing to do with morality and everything to do with technological progress and urbanization and, barring some kind of massive global catastrophe and collapse of civilization, feminism is here to stay whether you like it or not.  Please allow me to explain. 

**Feminism is good -** 

For the vast majority of recorded history, which is to say, since the advent of agriculture, women have had far lower social status than men.  The extent of oppression varies across space and time but I know of no exceptions to this in world history.  Women have been married off to husbands against their will, subject to appalling abuse with little to no legal recourse against their spouses and parents, barred from owning property, shamed for any expression of their sexuality and ostracized when they dared to deviate from social norms.  

There were women in the preindustrial era who rose to great power due to the accident of inheritance (Elizabeth I, Catherine the Great) but they are very much the exception.  And pretty much all authors, scientists, painters, philosophers, theologians, doctors, lawyers sculptors, composers, and anyone whose central life achievement took place outside the home, was a man until about roughly 1800.  

Feminism has a number of varieties but I think we can say over all, the central message is that the situation I described above should cease to exist and women should enjoy equal legal rights and social  respect  as their male counterparts. I think that if you don't agree with this statement who either hate women or you do not see them as fully human.  

Yes, individual feminists can be obnoxious and sanctimonious and yes, it's probably slightly more difficult for a heterosexual male to find a sexual partner since the advent of feminism but, so what?  These problems are meaningless in comparison to what women have endured for centuries. 

&#x200B;

**Feminism is unstoppable -** 

So, I'm not going to pull out a bunch of sources and stuff, I'm just writing off the cuff, but I'm going to say that the first inklings of the modern feminist movement started in about 1800 which coincides with the Industrial Revolution.  And herein lies the why of feminism.   Women began to effectively challenge their status as second class beings at exactly the point that people began to migrate from the countryside to cities, from an agricultural life of living off the land to an industrial life of working at a job for money.  

This makes perfect sense when you stop to think about it.  Women make babies.   Today, in our modern world, babies are a luxury. but in a premodern rural society children are a necessity for the survival of the family and of the community.  More children equals more work in the fields, more people to look after the old folks (remember there was no social safety net in the preindustrial era). People needed to have kids. 

And having kids was no simple matter in those days.  It was the leading cause of death for women and roughly half of babies born did not see adulthood.  Therefore, women had to spend most of their youth pregnant (which was dangerous) or raising children (very time consuming), both of which take a tremendous toll of a person's physical and mental well-being.  This was not fair and not just but it was endured because it was really the only way for communities and society at large to perpetuate itself and stave off starvation.  

All of this has now changed since the rise of industry, working for money and an urban based lifestyle.  Children are no longer needed, they are, in fact, a burden on one's household and one's budget.  People still do want kids because they are a great joy and a biological imperative but today people ""decide when they are ready"" to have kids and some people choose never to have them at all.  

This is a tremendous shift in the fabric of society and it has made it possible for women to realize their full potential as pregnancy can now be put off indefinitely.  Women can focus on developing themselves emotionally, intellectually and professionally.  Moreover, as there are less and less jobs which require brute physical strength, women are effectively able to compete with men in the job market and to excel in the arts, sciences, medicine, business, government, law, etc.  

This development is the inevitable outgrowth of our modern technological society and barring a complete breakdown in our modern system where we have to return to agrarianism (which is not unthinkable), feminism is here to stay.

1,2023-07-13,CMV: Sex is not an expression of love,u/maimonidies,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14yp3pi/cmv_sex_is_not_an_expression_of_love/,changemyview,"There's this popular notion that sex is the ultimate expression of love. The idea goes even further that the sex is an indication of how strong your love to your spouse is. And if you dont have much sex (say you don't find your spouse attractive anymore) then that somehow shows that you don't love your spouse unconditionally, or that your love to them is somewhat diminished. But this idea of equating love and sex is so foreign to me.

Sexual attraction and love are very much unrelated. I love my kids, my parents, or my platonic friends, yet I have zero sexual attraction to them. I can lust after a sexy man/girl yet have no love for them whatsoever. Rape actually illustrates that very well, you are sexually attracted to the victim (I guess you love the way the victim arouses you), but no one would call this love in any shape or form, that would a gross misinterpretation of love. Now of course you can love your wife **and** be sexually attracted to her, but thats not always the case, and if I somehow lost sexual attraction to her, that doesn't say anything about my platonic love towards her, I can still love everything else about her, and my love would arguably even more genuine than the love someone has towards their spouse that is based on their mutual sexual attraction.

Let's face it: Sex is a selfish and exploitative act. It can be reciprocal for sure, and we usualluy strive for that in a loving and healthy relationship. But sex by definition is a form of gratifying your sexual urges by exploiting someone else's body for your needs, albiet with consent. So sex is really at odds with love (this may be the idea behind the incest taboo, but I digress). Sex by consent can definitely coexist with love in a loving relationship, but if it doesn't, that shouldn't be an indication that they somehow fell out of love (although I do understand why someone would want out of such a relationship, since sex is an integral part of a traditional marital agreement and they are not being provided).

But for some reason, this myth has been so ingrained in our culture, that it's hard to even think that sex is not an expression of love at all. It's almost taboo to argue otherwise. Why do you think I'm wrong? And where do you disagree with me?

Also if you're talking about can ""you"" be racist to white people how can talking about the individual bring about discussion about systemic racism and how white people aren't discriminated against systemically. If we're talking about the individual and the word ""you"" it falls more under discrimination and prejudice against a group. Because how can one person be systemic?

I'm in high school in Canada and in many arguments and debates have been named a colonizer. I've been told that my personal problems dont matter since im a white male and that my ancestors discriminated against people of colour. If that isnt prejudice, discrimination and racism i dont know what is. Being able to say something to a white person that you cant say to anyone else is so obviously racism. Excluding white people from certain things just because of their skin is insane. Different groups and friend groups ive been excluded from.

My ancestors were all polish, the first country invaded and controlled by the nazis. Me and my siblings are only alive because my great grandfather escaped a camp in russia by tying himself on the bottom of a russian train. My mother was a refugee who was homeless in england. She had to steal bread and hunt then skin live fucking rabbits to live at 8 years old. My grandparents had to hide as their cities and homes got bombed to the fucking ground. Poland at this time became literal rubble, nothing else (you can lookup pictures) my ancestors were killed by military police and starved in camps. I am not a slave owner or a colonizer or someone who stole children away from their mothers in the 1800s in canada. And the fact that i can be called that, and named a racist based off the colour of my skin is plain racism towards a white person plain and simple.

My Mom who was homeless with an abusive father and came to canada at 9 from the cold war and civil war on poland which was fighting against russia's control, she came not knowing english and she worked her ass off, she had to get every academic scholarship so she could even afford school throughout her life. the fact that she a doctor tells anyone who says white people's accomplishments are less valuable and impressive is mental.

My mother is the most hard working woman, put in the worse point than 99% of black people and people of colour escaping from a cold war, civil war in poland she never got less than a 95% on a test. People complaining about how hard life is because of their skin and always giving excuses and complaining should know that whatever shit youre going through doesnt stop you from studying and performing in school. Stop complaining get off ur ass and do something with your life, stop using your position as a way to complain and blame people for why you didnt work hard enough. Its possible, go do it, stop being racist.

Also with talk about diversifying and equalizing populations of races in jobs i wonder how is that fair at all? Imagine if that law was in place and my mother got turned down from being a doctor because she's white? That alone would be racist asf. Wtf are these ideas people have nowadays. The idea of perfectly balancing races in jobs would turn out to be a disaster and would be completely Marxist because it forgets the individual and personal preference."

There has, to my knowledge, not been a single verified case of the TSA stopping an attack, nor are they reliable at stopping threats at all, with a horrible track record of stopping contraband. They are not a critical part of airport safety, as that has generally been done with increased security measures, greater passenger awareness, more air marshals, and greater monitoring of potential threats.

So that leaves us with the TSA essentially only existing to create jobs and provide some semblance of calm through security theater, but I don't believe that outweighs the burden they place on travelers in the slightest."

Even perspectives that challenge one another.  The ability to consider multiple perspectives is the act of expanding your consciousness.  

  
If we operate in life with a narrow or limited perspective, we will create false limits.  Those false limits will decrease the quality of our experiences.  There is a rigidity to life that isn't meant to be there.  We're fluid beings.  We're meant to grow forward and outwards.

  
Your environment is not your reality.  Your perspective of your environment IS your reality.    


This idea is as simple as looking at a box.  There are 6 sides on the outside and 6 sides on the inside of the box.  That is 12 total sides to the box.  If you don't thoroughly examine all sides of the box, your perspective of the box will be limited.  

  
Whereas, if you pick it up.  Look underneath it.  On the backside.  Open it up and view the inside.  You change your perspective of the box and view all 12 sides.   This doesn't mean you change your belief that it is a box.  It means that you understand the different sides or perspectives of the box.

  
Life is just like that figurative box.  Only, it's far more complex.  Thusly, ever event has more than 12 perspectives to consider.  "

Note that I do not agree with this in practice, my argument is that transmedicalism is a useful tool for injecting nuance into a narrative which is often treated as all or nothing on both sides. 

I was discussing this in another CMV, which got removed, but whenever I encounter someone saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not transphobic, but‚Ä¶‚Äù, I like to employ the following litmus test: should a trans woman, diagnosed with gender dysphoria, who has been on HRT and has undergone bottom surgery, be allowed to use women‚Äôs facilities? Prisons? Should she be recognized as legally female?

There are lots of people who believe that being assigned male means you can never be a woman without exception, but I think they‚Äôre in the minority. I don‚Äôt think that most people are nearly as absolutist. If we can get them to admit that there is a point when someone can be ‚Äútransitioned enough‚Äù to be recognized as their identified sex, then it‚Äôs no longer eradicationist. It becomes about where and how we draw the lines and how much gate keeping is necessary. It becomes something that we can actually engage without it becoming entirely existential. 

An example of a transmedicalist argument that I‚Äôd levy without actually supporting in practice could be ‚Äúupdating gender markers on state documents should require a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and medical attestation that the person is on HRT.‚Äù I don‚Äôt like the gate keeping, but it‚Äôs the kind of policy argument which I think would resonate with normies and could help to deradicalize them with an injection of nuance. 

I do understand that there are many problems with transmedicalism and I don‚Äôt think that we should be ceding ground to those trying to eradicate us, but those same people people are radicalizing normies with disinformation and scare tactics, so perhaps we need to be willing to (carefully) compromise some of our ideals in order to protect our lives?

Edit: I‚Äôll add to this that any proposition of transmedicalist policy must bring with it guaranteed access to gender affirming care for anyone meeting the criteria for gender dysphoria."

We live in a world with countries that legalize child molestation. People are murdered every single day, many of them for absolutely no reason. People that exploit the poor and essentially destroy their livelihoods for either greed or shits and giggles. Literally watched a video of these teenagers walking up to an old man and beating the hell out of him for no reason. Just picked a fight with a random old guy and jumped him. Vladimir Putin just started a war last year and is actively killing women and children over territory that isn't his, and there's a strong possibility that if anyone interferes to a high enough degree he'll kickstart an event that could kill the entire human race.








And you expect me to believe any of these people have good inside of them? 







Now granted, I'll be the first to say its never a good thing to expect the worst out of people you don't know anything about. Hell, sometimes the people you DO know about. But there's a difference between optimism and intentional blissful ignorance. Bad people do exist. God awful people with no amount of charity, happiness, or sympathy? They exist and there's a lot more of them than you think.






EDIT: To be absolutely clear, I'm SPECIFICALLY talking about people to who legitimately atrocious acts like murder or rape for no reason at all.

Ideally what I think should happen is we should have a separate prison system that is more just for getting these people off of drugs and getting them back into society but that is very wishful thinking, this hasn‚Äôt happened and probably isn‚Äôt going to so we have to legalize all of the drugs.

I think that is absolutely absurd - social security taxes are regressive, since all income above a certain figure is entirely exempt from paying into the program, so this is wrong on principle.

1,2023-07-13,CMV: Dishwashers are useless appliances and they save no time or effort whatsoever compared to washing by hand,u/RegularNormalAdult,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ywwsy/cmv_dishwashers_are_useless_appliances_and_they/,changemyview,"Alright, here we go. I've personally held this view for over a decade, from living on my own in college, through multiple apartments, and upon purchasing my first home in 2016. My wife and I have two small children that make epic messes. We cook breakfast every single morning. I prep dinners every weekend, and we eat out maybe once a week max. Needless to say we have a metric butt ton of dishes that need washing every day, so I believe I'm coming from a good position to dispute the idea that the dishwasher is in any way a useful household appliance. 

I'd like to run through the majority of pro-dishwasher talking points that I've read on the internet one-by-one and provide counterpoints for each:

**1. Dishwashers save time**

This is ostensibly the selling point of dishwashers; they save you time that you would otherwise have to spend scrubbing away on your dirty dishes. The trouble begins when you start to actually examine this claim empirically and it falls apart. The workflow for using a dishwasher goes like this:

- Pre-rinse dishes that your dishwasher doesn't clean properly
- Load dishes
- Wash pots, pans, and other dishes you *can't* load into the dishwasher
- Wait for the washing cycle to finish
- Open the dishwasher to let dishes dry OR pull them out and dry by hand with towel
- Unload dishwasher and put dishes away

Compare this to the workflow for handwashing:

- Turn on hot water and soap your sponge
- Wash dishes 
- Put dishes in drying rack
- Wait for dishes to air dry
- Put dishes away

I am not exaggerating when I say our families' usage of dishes is insane. It's not uncommon for us to go through almost every plate, bowl, and piece of silverware we have in the house every day, plus all the other cooking implements such as pots/pans and cups, mugs, and glasses. We turn over our stockpile of dishes daily, and despite this it takes me on average 20-30 minutes to hand wash it all every evening. Which brings us to the next point:

**2. Dishwashers save effort**

This is related to the first point, but the idea is that handwashing dishes is hard, and dishwashing makes it effortless. This claim is also false.

To illustrate my point, let's compare the dishwasher to another household appliance that was invented around the same time: the washing machine. Drying clothes as we all know takes little to no effort, machine drying or by hand. Before automatic dryers, people simply hung the clothes out to dry and let the sun take care of the rest; in many parts of the world this is still how clothes are dried today. Manual washing on the other hand, was a painstakingly long and hard job. Throughout history, from antiquity to the 19th century, hand washing clothing was an all-day affair. This is part of the reason it wasn't done very much in many cultures, because it simply took so long and was such hard work. For more detail on this I highly recommend this TED talk about how revolutionary the washing machine is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZoKfap4g4w

The point is, the advent of the washing machine not only freed up hundreds of hours of manual labor per year, it also freed up the hand and wrist destroying work of manually scrubbing clothes. Compared to washing dishes by hand, the work involved in using a dishwasher is about the same. You *already* have to pre-wash dishes with caked on grime the dishwasher can't get. You *already* have to hand wash pots, pans, and other cooking tools that don't fit or the dishwasher will ruin. You're *already* there at the sink, washing dishes. Simply add a little soap to your sponge and wash the rest of them too, and then you're done.

**3. Dishwashers save water/electricity and are better for the environment**

This point is mostly true - studies have consistently shown that handwashing uses more hot water than dishwashers. However, I'd like to counter that because dishwashers are so shitty at their jobs of actually washing dishes, and due to the limited amount of items you are actually allowed to use the dishwasher for, if you're already at the sink running the hot water for the pots and pans plus any prewashing that needs to be done, any marginal water or energy savings is a complete wash (pun intended) when you look at your bill.

Furthermore, most people here are living in or just outside a city with a municipal water supply. I can't speak to well water or other sourced water, but at least for maintained water supplies any residential water you use is going directly back to the water supply and being recycled and treated. For residential usage it really, really doesn't matter how much water you use from an environmental perspective as long as it ends up back down the drain and not on the pavement outside to evaporate away. Residential electricity usage is so small compared to commercial usage that I think the benefit of dishwashers is negligible there as well. The only improvement you'll see is on your water/energy bill, and it's not going to be dramatic enough to matter compared to other low-hanging fruit like simply running your A/C less.

**Counter-Counter Points**

But wait! I hear you say - my dishwasher isn't shitty, it does a great job! And I can put all my pots and pans in it without a problem!

Whenever you hear this on the internet, it's either one of two things: either the person does not do much or any cooking at all and is washing a few lightly soiled dishes in every load, or they happen to be lucky enough to not live in an area with hard water. 

85% of the United States has hard water. Whether that's the usual limestone calcium/magnesium hard water or even harder stuff like iron, dishwashers absolutely, positively suck at effectively cleaning dishes with hard water. You either have to have a hard water system already installed in your house or spend thousands of dollars to get your house plumbed for one, and they require regular maintenance to stay in good shape. 

I live in an area that has some of the hardest water in the United States. When we bought our house in 2016 it came with a brand new dishwasher, and we tried to make it work. We tried every single dishwasher product for hard water, and nothing worked to either get dishes clean enough to use again or remove the extreme calcium/hard water residue left on them. Simply washing dishes by hand solves both of those problems with minimal time and effort. 

Lastly, I know that there are dishwashers that don't suck. I used to wash dishes in restaurants with big industrial dishwashers that absolutely blasted the shit out of dishes with high pressure scalding hot water. BUT EVEN THEN I had to prewash for the really caked on stuff to ensure there was no residue left over. 

**In Conclusion**

Dishwashers suck, you can't put half your dishes in them, and washing dishes by hand is not hard or time consuming. You're already at the sink. Just use some soap and finish the job."

1,2023-07-13,CMV: Financial child support should be retracted,u/Soft-Butterscotch128,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14yzs36/cmv_financial_child_support_should_be_retracted/,changemyview,"I don't think there's any good reason child support (at least financially) should be a thing. It doesn't really make sense to me.

&#x200B;

1. Really the biggest reason, parenthood is an option. I don't think there's any other situation in which the government can force a kid on you. All 50 states have safe have laws, adoption and foster care. It doesn't make much sense to me that it's ok to dump a baby in a chute, or give them to someone else and you're free and clear...yet leaving them with a parent requires you to financially support them. Doesn't seem fair
2. The idea that it's to 'support the child' doesn't really make sense either. If one parent wants to keep the child then the other parent has to pay that parent child support because the child is hypothetically gettign 1/2 the support. But if both parent choose to give up the child they are not financially obligated to the child despite the child have neither of their support.
3. The punishments don't really make sense. A child can be fine, healthy and taken care of, but if a parent owes too much they can be thrown in jail. But being thrown in jail doesn't assist the kid in  anyway and actually has more potential to hurt them. It's basically indentured servitude
4. In other situations the government doesn't intervene. For example, if a man and a woman make less than the average COLA, the government doesn't throw them in jail for inadequate support. Or in a relationship where one parent provides more financially, than the other, they can't sue to be compensated.

While my dad wasn't there, I don't blame him or hold any ill will towards him, because how can I? He's just some guy who wasn't ready for the responsibility of kids which being around the age he is now, I completely understand. It's likely not the choice I would make if I ended up in the situation but I also wouldn't want it to be forced on anyone. Imo child support is the government overstepping it's bounds and inserting themselves into families. The government's role should be to provide support through welfare not forced financial obligations"

There are 12 million moms in the United States that have been in an abusive relationship and then have their ex/father of her kids come in and out when it‚Äôs convenient for them. These men are narcissists who will do anything to hurt their woman.

And unfortunately, this is traced back to the deadbeat being enabled by his narcissistic mother who makes the mother of his children feel like it‚Äôs her fault that her deadbeat bd couldn‚Äôt be a man.

So, I have a solution. If a young boy disrespects a female teacher of his in school, that boy will be publicly executed on his 16th birthday in front of his hometown‚Äôs city hall. That will be the ultimate death to all deadbeats and grown men disrespecting women.

And for the record, I at least would be a man and not abuse the mother of my kids."

TLDR: I think AI Art = theft.

I think artists should be compensated fairly for their work, and believe the basis of AI Art‚Äôs primary present day technology is built off of stealing from artists to train the models of said Systems. As a result it follows that in order to best be in solidarity with Artists and to support the work you love, the best option is to not pay for AI Art, whether through boycotting, banning, or pirating is irrelevant, and not the point.

These companies have made it pretty clear so far that they don‚Äôt care about their artists by not budging on the issues of AI Art, and a fair workplace, job, and pay. 

In order for them to prove me wrong the companies who are using AI Art should respect, and meet if not exceed the demands of the Artists effected, and any artists impacted by future uses of AI Art.

Otherwise by paying these companies for their content created using AI Art you are encouraging this behavior, however if the companies make something without AI Art they should be rewarded with compensation to support their artists and subsequently their shareholders.

If the companies believe artists can be left out in the cold by waiting for said artists protesting‚Äôs rent to expire, and bank account to go dry, and debts legal or otherwise to pile up and come due, and not be held accountable that should be met with people who love Art, media, etc to protest with their wallets.

Again, to change my view said companies need to meet if not exceed the wishes of Artists that make their media.

Why are we locking up people who commit no crimes but drug possession (without intent to distribute).  If you think this is fine should we lock up alcoholics and smokers?  Gambling addicts?  People with mental health disorders?

An example from illinois you commit an armed robbery you get 6 to 30 years.  And if great bodily harm was caused during said robbery it adds 25 to life to the original term for the offensive.  So bringing a total to 31 to life.  But a first degree murder is 20 to life. Even if you downsides the murder case does 100% of the time here and armed robbery does 85% its still a longer minimum.

Or another example a second degree murder can be eligible for probation but residential burglary isn't.

Police officers can get away with alot. Especially within their own department.  We need some kind of agency providing oversight and the second theres proof of excessive force or arresting too high a percent of their felony arrests.

The public defenders shouldn't be allowed to be friends with the states attorney or prosecutor.

Anyone who commits more than 1 murder or commits child trafficking should be the death penalty.  Add a panel to go over the case and vote anonymously to make sure innocent people aren't killed.  Anyone that commits a sexual act before someone's 13 or repeated offenses over that age.  Kidnapping where someone is either never found or found months/years later as well (almost any custody battle also where they attempt to flee the county this the I see both sides

Cash bail bonds need to be removed entirely.  Either they're safe enough to be re-released, safe enough for electronic monitoring, or should have no bond.  Money shouldn't decide ur freedom."

1,2023-07-14,CMV: White Nationalism Is Not The Same As White Supremacy,u/Donny-Bandish,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14z7jg1/cmv_white_nationalism_is_not_the_same_as_white/,changemyview,"obviously, this is prompted by the recent brouhaha over senator tommy tubercille‚Äôs comments about spared white nationalists in the military. 

 now, allow me to preface this by saying a few things. first, i‚Äôm black, lean far to the left when it comes to politics, and absolutely abhor racism in all of its various forms.

i would also like to stress that this is not a defense of white nationalism or, really, nationalism in general. 

to me, a nation is a group that is cohered by a cultural bond. you have nation states, countries that fall under one flag; and you have nations that refer groups of people with a shared identity, oftentimes racial. 

nationalism is pride in that bond taken to its extreme. beyond just acknowledging and appreciating the cultural ties that bond you with others within your group, you aggressively trumpet that identity, drowning out a recognition of other groups and their distinct cultural markings.

nationalists treat their cultural identity like they would a football team, as if they are in competition with other nations. 

but, while i obviously think nationalism can often turn into a misguided form of patriotism that becomes defensively hostile to other groups, i don‚Äôt think it is the same as white supremacy. 

white supremacy is a very specific form of racism that is steeped in discredited theories of pseudoscientific race realism. 

white supremacists believe whites are genetically superior to jews, blacks, asians and mestizos. because of this belief, most white supremacists aspire to a world that is exclusively white. to that end, white supremacists are advocates of violence towards other races, acts committed in what they perceive to be an ongoing race war. 

i don‚Äôt believe most white nationalists subscribe to the pseudoscience of your garden variety white supremacists, nor do i believe they condone acts of violence towards racial minorities. 

i believe most white nationalists have no problem living in a society that is multicultural, so long as their group stands out from the rest. i believe your average white nationalist can be friends with other races. 

white nationalists are white people who are proud of what white people have accomplished (usually in the 400 years since the founding of America). 

do i think that pride is unfounded and sitting atop undercurrents that are arguably racist?

yes, absolutely. 

do i think white nationalists could become white supremacists?

without question. 

but, is a white nationalist automatically a white supremacist? 

no, i don‚Äôt think so. 

look forward to someone changing my view of they can."

1,2023-07-14,CMV: Climate change is real but blocking roads and spraying paintings does not help in any way.,u/Ahahahahahahahalooo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14z908l/cmv_climate_change_is_real_but_blocking_roads_and/,changemyview,"I think a lot of people have seen climate change protestors sit in the middle of the road, blocking it and disrupting people who are driving. There's also the video where they threw some ted liquid on a painting in a museum.

How does this help fight climate change?

When the average Joe who works to feed his family can't go to work because of someone blocking the road, it's not going to make him think ""oh wow, climate change is really affecting us huh?"", it's just going to make him vote for politicians how are against climate change activism. Disrupting normal people only hurts the climate change movement.

I believe it would be a far better protest to go and protest in front of a government office, block the entrance there, spray paint it, whatever they want to do. It's the government's choice to ignore climate change, not the average Joe's. Go throw tomato juice on the municipality center, go block the mayor's road.

I think it's cowardly to attack random people who are just minding their own business. If you truly believe in your cause then attack the people responsible for climate change."

The way they overreact when something goes wrong in a game or someone prevents them from playing is just hilarious, as if there's hardly anything more important than games.

1,2023-07-14,CMV: Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a dangerous idea that undermines personal responsibility,u/Zxhamuaha,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14za2zn/cmv_universal_basic_income_ubi_is_a_dangerous/,changemyview,"I believe that Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a dangerous concept that ultimately undermines personal responsibility and fosters a culture of dependency. While the idea of providing a guaranteed income to all citizens sounds appealing, it overlooks the potential negative consequences.

Firstly, UBI disincentivizes work and productivity. Why would individuals strive to work hard and pursue career advancement if they can rely on a basic income without any effort? This undermines the fundamental principle of meritocracy and discourages personal growth and achievement.

Moreover, UBI fails to address the root causes of poverty and inequality. Instead of empowering individuals to improve their circumstances through education, training, and employment, it perpetuates a cycle of dependence on government assistance. This approach does not promote long-term solutions and stifles innovation and entrepreneurship.

Furthermore, implementing UBI on a large scale would require substantial funding, which inevitably translates to higher taxes for everyone. This places an unfair burden on those who are already contributing to society and rewards those who are not actively participating in its progress.

In conclusion, while the idea of Universal Basic Income may sound appealing on the surface, it ultimately undermines personal responsibility, disincentivizes work, and fails to address the root causes of poverty and inequality. Rather than relying on a government handout, we should focus on fostering an environment that promotes self-sufficiency, personal growth, and equal opportunities for all."

1,2023-07-14,CMV: Changing your environment is far more effective than changing your mentality and should be your first priority.,u/VanillaIsActuallyYum,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14zewcl/cmv_changing_your_environment_is_far_more/,changemyview,"A lot of conventional wisdom seems to suggest that a person's first priority should be to change their *thinking* about their problems and that changing their circumstances is more of just a ""band-aid"" than anything else. It is not viewed as a lasting solution that will bring lasting relief from one's problems.

I disagree. In my 38 years of experience on planet earth, I have only ever found relief from my problems by actually changing my circumstances.

I grew to hate my career in engineering. I tried all sorts of mental exercises to remind myself that it's conventionally understood as a ""good job"", that it pays me well, that employment is stable and finding new jobs is easy, but none of that ever changed the fact that working for corporate America felt so soul-sucking to me that I knew I'd never find peace in that career. It wasn't until I went back to graduate school and shifted my career entirely to Biostatistics, allowing me to now work for a University doing public health research, that I was finally able to put that problem to rest.

As for relationship issues, hopefully everyone out there who is single can relate to the fact that there are lots, and I mean LOTS, of us who are single and are all done with the whole ""figuring out who you are"" thing or whatever the fuck. I can't tell you how exhausted I am of hearing ""yeah well, this time between relationships for you is a great time for you to discover yourself, pursue your interests, and work on who you are as a person!"" I'm good, you guys, really. I know who I am, what I like, what I'm into. By age 38 I'm very, very thoroughly acquainted with who I am and what I like, so no, whatever sort of thinking I'm supposed to do about my situation at this point isn't going to change a goddamn thing, and it really hasn't for probably the better part of 10 years by this point. But long story short, the bothersome thoughts I've had in regards to my relationship status only ever stopped when I actually entered a romantic relationship. I could try to not let my relationship status as a single person not bother me by thinking this thought or that, working on meditation, doing the whole ""don't give in to those intrusive thoughts"" thing for longer than I even want to do it every day on a regular basis, and yet still none of that was nearly as effective as simply putting an end to being single and getting into a relationship. So in my view, if someone is struggling with being single, the top priority should be to get them a partner, NOT to give them some advice on how to cope with being single, because that's just not going to work. (as an aside, this all makes it clear why relationship advice from happily married people, especially those who DO promote the whole ""oh yeah, just use this time to grow as a person"" angle, is correctly viewed as condescending, belittling, arrogant, and above all else, extremely ignorant)

The same thing applied to my status as a virgin. Lots and lots of talk there about how it's okay to be a virgin at age X, that it will happen for you by this point or that and you should just coax yourself into believing it's okay. In my case, I didn't lose the V-card until I was 28 years old, and my thoughts regarding my self-worth were absolutely CATASTROPHIC in regards to being a virgin. You know what finally put those catastrophic thoughts to rest, permanently, after they tortured me for years and after I tried every trick in the book to get myself to stop letting those thoughts bother me? Actually having sex. That happened, and voila, a massive weight was lifted, the monkey was off my back, and I just felt so much better after that.

This was on my mind even after some more basic things I experienced this week. I started a new job in an incredibly quiet office, and the quietness caused me anxiety (which actually causes noise to spool up in my head, very similar to, if not actual, tinnitus, which only exacerbates my anxiety), and the conventional wisdom, yet again, for a condition like that is to just get used to it, accept it, come to some mental place that makes it okay to hear what you are hearing. I tried that for a few weeks and I would just end each day being exhausted by the mental taxation involved with trying to adjust. Instead I bought a white noise machine, and guess what? No anxiety, no bother, nothing! I changed my circumstances, and again, I feel way better, after trying to do the whole ""just change your thinking"" thing for weeks and getting literally fucking nowhere with it.

The same goes with my eye floaters, a problem that nobody seems to take seriously at all and for which I cannot find any help whatsoever. I tried for years to accept that I could see these dark blotches on a blaring white computer screen, and I only achieved peace by utilizing dark mode. As I write this, I'm writing it in a window with a black background and white text to block out the floaters. If I didn't, I'd see the brown shit in my vision and it would just upset me. Again, a simple adjustment to my circumstances sets me at ease, and fighting to get myself to accept things otherwise is something I've tried quite literally for YEARS and have simply never been able to achieve. So I just don't think that changing one's thoughts can work. If it has already been years trying to accept things like this, and I'm 38, won't I be damn near dead by the time I purportedly achieve inner peace over these things? It seems like my only option here is to change my circumstances.

I just don't see why changing your thinking would ever be preferred over changing your circumstances, nor do I understand why anyone would even suggest that changing your thinking about your problems is even possible.

1,2023-07-14,"CMV: If you go through a fast food drive-thru and realize once you get home there are missing/incorrect items in the bag, it's your own fault.",u/Easy_Rip1212,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14zhz61/cmv_if_you_go_through_a_fast_food_drivethru_and/,changemyview,"Obviously the employee(s) taking your order and putting the items in the bags *should* get it right. But each of us learn through experience that they get it wrong *a lot*. I would estimate around 5%-20% of the time there is an error.

This is why the responsibility is ultimately on you to open the bag and check to ensure the order is correct before you leave. By not looking in the bag you are making a choice to trust the fast food employees to get it right. So if you get home to find out there is a mistake, that's your fault for not checking it before you left. 

I know a lot of people would say, ""It's not my job to check their work. They're getting paid to put the correct order in the bag!"" 

That is true. Let's assume that if you go back to the store they'll correct the order and refund/compensate you for the mistake. But your ideal outcome is not to drive back and resolve the mistake -- you would have chosen to just get the correct order the first time and paid full price. Which is ultimately in your control.

It would be like if you had a child preparing for a field trip at school and the school gave a list of items each child would need to bring. You may give the list to your kid and tell them to gather everything up. You would not just assume the kid got it right. You would check. Because if they did make a mistake, the amount of inconvenience you would endure would be far worse than spending 30 seconds to check they got everything. 

So if you don't want to be inconvenienced by incorrect drive-thru orders, you need to accept that you are responsible to check the order before leaving. If you don't and the order is wrong, you being  inconvenienced is because you chose to not check."

* Wanting to delete this post. (Yes, I am giving examples that can have a direct effect.)
* Wanting to break this subreddit's rules to get yourself banned. (Moderators, I will not do that, so don't worry. It's just an example.)
* Excusing your actions by telling about intrusive thoughts.
* Harming yourself or someone in any way possible.
* Committing extremely messed up actions and crimes.
* Wanting to erase your homework.
* And more and more.

Yes, it can reach even further and feels like it breaks the ""fourth wall"" (it does not, but it feels like it). It can come in many forms and shapes, whether it be ruining yourself or ruining others in any way possible.

They attack all of your fears and weaknesses.

I think the reasons are pretty obvious. When a person gets ""memed"", then that meme, if it gets spread enough, becomes the thing they're most known for, and likely will ever be widely known for. And it can happen overnight and without the person's permission or knowledge.   

Before the internet, it was much harder to make and spread an image or video to the world so quickly. But now, technology has moved faster than our ability to think about the repercussions.  Most people acknowledge that tech has probably moved faster than our ability to think about the consequences.  

I'm old enough to remember Star Wars Kid. Me and my friends laughed at that video. But that video ""[ruined his life](https://medium.com/lessons-from-history/the-star-wars-kid-was-the-first-viral-video-where-is-he-now-449e2c5e7786)"". Not literally, but it made his life difficult in a way none of us would probably ever want.

There are many other examples. I will acknowledge that I think the internet has gotten ""nicer"" about memes, and I don't think Star Wars Kid would happen in this era, which is good. But even if a meme is not ""making fun"" of someone, becoming a viral meme still makes someone a celebrity in a sense, and not in a way they necessarily want, and not in a way they can easily escape from.  No matter where they go and what they do, when people find out that they're the person from some popular meme, it's probably going be hard to brush that aside in conversation, or become known for something else and something you control.  

I don't know the solution, other than to perhaps make a law about spreading media using the likeness of people that are not public figures without their permission. Or at the very least, making it socially unacceptable to create and share things like that.

**EDIT: Addressing some of the common points being brought up.**  

**""People are posting their likeness willingly"".** Many, if not most, that come to mind for me are photos taken of people in public or by friends or family, or of their kid, or their grandpa, or whatever, and not someone posting an image on social media of themself.  
**""Some people have gotten fame and fortune off of the exposure"".** But they never asked for it and may not have wanted it. It's turning lemons into lemonade, and what choice do we have but to do that?    

**""Memes don't have the lasting power like they used to""** This is a good point, but I think the reality is that they do, and probably reach even more people than Star Wars Kid did back when. I see the same memes showing up over and over, being remixed, reimagined, etc. That's kind of the whole point. I'm not really talking about viral sensation, cool son lip-sync backflip type of thing. I'm talking about the kid who made the weird face, someone took a picture of it, and now he's ""the guy from that meme"".

**EDIT 2: Scumbag Steve summed it up nicely, I think:**

Here's an excerpt from a letter form the ""Scumbag Steve"" guy:

> The part that will suck though is that there will always be those people that somehow think YOU did this, that you made the meme, and that you could stop it if you wanted to. That you have some control over it. You don‚Äôt. The internet birthed you and they‚Äôll decide when you (the meme) will die.
> 
> There will also be those people who assuage their guilt by telling you how great it is, how lucky you are to be a meme. Just smile. What they are really saying is, thank god it wasn‚Äôt me.

1,2023-07-14,CMV: The Sin of Sodom and Gomorrah wasn‚Äôt homosexuality or Sodomy,u/FerdinandTheGiant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14zv2c9/cmv_the_sin_of_sodom_and_gomorrah_wasnt/,changemyview,"I made a post earlier about Leviticus and learned a bit on there, so might as well make one about Sodom and Gomorrah. 

There‚Äôs a common narrative that the sin of Sodom was homosexuality or sodomy, however this does not appear within the biblical narrative and appears to have developed in later traditions spread after Philo and later Josephus. 

In Ezekiel 16:49‚Äì50 it is written: 

> ‚ÄúThis was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease but did not aid the poor and needy. They were haughty and did abominable things before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.‚Äù 

Some have said that ‚Äúabominable things‚Äù is a reference to homosexuality as it is referred to as an abomination in Leviticus, however the word used is *toebah* which indicates that it could be referencing a range of violations of the Mosaic law including but not limited to idolatry, worship of false gods, eating unclean animals, magic, lying, cheating, killing the innocent, homosexuality, etc.

The sin of Sodom that led to its destruction was their demonstration of inhospitality when they attempted to ‚Äúknow‚Äù Lot‚Äôs guests which were angels. They tried to rape angels. This is expanded upon in Jude 1:6-7

> ‚ÄúAnd the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day‚Äîjust as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire (sarkos heteras), serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.‚Äù 

The bolded part translates as ‚Äúwent after other flesh‚Äù. In the King James and many other versions it is translated to ‚ÄúStrange Flesh‚Äù. There is a case to be that Jude‚Äôs comment about sarkos heteras (‚Äúother flesh‚Äù)  is a reference to sex with angels not sex with other men. Verse 6 is likely an allusion to the sin of the angels in Genesis 6:1-4, which according to Jewish tradition, involved angels having sex with the daughters of men. So it is not far fetched to think that the ‚Äúother flesh‚Äù in verse 7 is a reference to the men of Sodom trying to have sex with Lot‚Äôs angelic visitors.

Even the reference to sexual immorality within the verse is also used commonly to refer to sex work or adulterous behavior, not just homosexual acts. 

There‚Äôs also a very similar story in Judges 19 in which a man entered a city and was accosted by the men of the city who sought to have sex with him but settle for his concubine.

> While they were enjoying themselves, the men of the city, a perverse lot, surrounded the house and started pounding on the door. They said to the old man, the master of the house, ‚ÄúBring out the man who came into your house, so that we may have intercourse with him.‚Äù And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, ‚ÄúNo, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. Since this man is my guest, do not do this vile thing. Here are my virgin daughter and his concubine; let me bring them out now. Ravish them and do whatever you want to them, but against this man do not do such a vile thing.‚Äù But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and put her out to them. They wantonly raped her and abused her all through the night until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let her go. As morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man‚Äôs house where her master was, until it was light.

This wasn‚Äôt about sexual desire, but their inhospitality to foreigners. Hence why they refused the man of the city‚Äôs daughters who he offered in the stead of the man. This same thing happens in Genesis; why offer your daughters if every man in Sodom is gay? Why would they accept the concubine? 

Again, I am aware that tradition in which the sin was taken to be homosexuality developed and remain, however those readings don‚Äôt seem unambiguously within the text and with that in mind I don‚Äôt think the sin or Sodom was homosexuality.

Edit: Since this needs to be clarified, the term ‚Äúsodomy‚Äù developed *after* the tradition of Sodom and Gommorah was accepted broadly to be homosexuality. I‚Äôm also not saying there was ‚Äúa sin‚Äù that doomed Sodom, just maybe one that broke the camels back. 

Also Wisdom 19:13-14

> The punishments did not come upon the sinners
without prior signs in the violence of thunder,
for they justly suffered because of their wicked acts; for they practiced a more bitter hatred of strangers. Others had refused to receive strangers when they came to them, but these made slaves of guests who were their benefactors."

Therefore I can reconstruct the question to be "" should the government have the ability to administer a drug to the general public?"" - my response is no

1. To administer a drug safely you must be a health care professional: dentist, physician etc**edit conceded

2. To administer a drug, their must be informed consent meaning the benefits, short term and long terms risks must be communicated thoroughly, no matter how low the risk factor is.

3. With informed consent must also come patient autonomy meaning despite being informed of risk factors patients have the right to still refuse treatment. 

Points 1-3 are either ignored/disregarded or poorly communicated, therefore a breach in the principles of medical ethics.

For my view change one would have to convince me that general public water system is an optional choice we choose to engage in and not one that is forced on us. Which I find hard to believe due to fact that we are constantly in use of public water- washing your hands, taking a shower, drinking.

edit* upon review of peoples responses I have now conceded my first point (1) as people have mentioned, the government is guided by the expertise of the dental community as well as several examples of patient self administering medications.
To really emphasize my main argument, I am not here to debate or refute the benefits or risks fluoride but rather focusing on whether or not the government has violated the principles of medical ethics."

How often do you see pennies on the ground that nobody bothers to pick up?

 Their only purpose at this point is for payments where the cent value is not a multiple of 5. 

One of the biggest concerns about taking pennies out of circulation is the idea that prices would be rounded to the nearest 5 cents."

A lot of people seem to think that Russia is an empire destined to collapse into a million little states, and that this will somehow benefit the people there. This is extremely unlikely because:  
  
1. Russia is not Austria Hungary: Even at its largest extent, Russians have always been more than 50% of the population within the empire. When the USSR collapsed, this number increased to 80%. Something everyone also forgets is that a lot of non Russians are immigrants from ex soviet countries (Central Asia, Armenia, Ukraine etc) and so have no stake in independence.  
  
2. Russia is no longer an empire: The USSR's collapse was the death of the Russian empire, and try as Putin may it is dead. Russia today is more or less a nation state akin to France (as it has certain regions with independence movements), and their influence in the former USSR is also similar to how France messes with its former colonies. The parts that could leave and be functioning nations left in 1991, and the rest of the country, even in most of the autonomous republics, is majority Russian.  
  
3. The non majority Russian autonomous republics can't function on their own: Sakha and Tartarstan are half russian and are completely surrounded by Russian territories, Chechnya is completely dependent on Russia and basically runs itself anyway as a little warlord state. Dagestan is a yugoslavia of ethnic groups and would collapse immediately into civil war.

4. Lack of interest: Most ethnic minorities do not want independence because they have been part of Russia for centuries, speak Russian and are fully integrated into the Russian economy. People forget that the fall of the Soviet Union was not all sunshine and rainbows but an event that produced some winners (the baltic states) and a lot of losers (basically everywhere else) with oligarchies, dictatorships and wars plaguing most post Soviet nations. People remember the sharp fall in standard of living and massive reduction of wealth.  
  
This doesn't mean Russia losing control of a few territories isn't possible, as Chechnya gained independence in the 90s and could theoretically reemerge, maybe along with Dagestan and Inguisha. But Russia isn't going to balkanize. They already have."

When we look back at the 40s, 50s and see our grandparents' generation (even the 70s,80s and 90s) could afford to buy a home, get married, have kids and live a good life on just 1 income... It's because the world's population was 3 billion. 

We have limited resources. We have limited jobs that need to be done and filled. We have limited money. Maybe we only have enough jobs for 2 billion people. That means if we have 8 billion people on earth, 6 billion will have no jobs. We only have enough resources to fee 3 billion people. Which means, 5 billion will starve. We only have funds to support 4 billion. Which means 4 billion will live in poverty. We only have resources to house 3 billion, which means 5 billion will be homeless.

If you could 100% prevent abortions by raising your taxes to the extent that you or your family could barely afford to live semi-comfortably, would you?

There was a time when I was entirely pro-life with virtually no wiggle room. And then someone asked me the question I posted in the first paragraph, and I decided I could either be a hypocrite or tuck my tail between my leg and change my view. I chose the latter. Now, while I still find ""convenience"" abortions morally wrong, I can't say I'd voluntarily live in a box and condemn my family to a life of poverty to save every possible life before it truly begins. This 100% makes me a horrible human being, but I can accept that and quietly bow out. 

I ask this question because I find that people who have a certain preferred standard of living tend to forget that the extreme spike in taxes that would be required in order to fully support every unwanted child would completely change their lives and way of living. 

So, pro-lifers, are you really and truly pro-life no matter what? When you picket outside of abortions clinics, would you voluntarily hand over 200k (a small price) to every pregnant woman there if it meant she'd choose not to abort?"

Instead, I think a better course of action would be to teach them about the potential dangers of sex like pregnancy and STDs and things, as well as offer free condoms and contraceptives in supermarkets, pharmacies, etc.

I think that teaching is a better way to go than punishing, and that's specifically for if they're not too far apart age-wise. Like, I don't think anything should happen legally if 2 13 year olds have sex, but like if it's a 13 and like, an 18 year old, the 18 year old should at least be fined or worse, depending on what was done, who initiated, etc., because then that allows teens to explore themselves (which is completely natural) while also keeping them as safe as possible and holding anyone older accountable for what they did. I think if we just started teaching kids how to explore themselves and find out who they are at a young age safely, we could greatly cut teen pregnancy rates and teen STD rates. "

I am not including AI issues and other concerns in this post; I'm just confused about the residuals.

Royalties make sense to me in some cases where the recipient is not paid a salary (other than perhaps a nominal advance from the producers). A book author, for example, makes money if their book sells and not if it doesn't. A singer makes money if their song becomes a hit.

However, at most jobs you get paid the same whether or not your product is successful. A software engineer gets paid every day to work on a feature even if it ultimately fails. If they leave the company, the company will not keep paying them even if they keep profiting off of their work. A pharma company pays a researcher the same whether the disease they work on turns into an epidemic or is eradicated. A wedding venue does not pay a construction worker for decades into the future even if they go from 1 to 100 weddings a year.

At most jobs, the company simply contracts the professional's labor for a set period of time and a negotiated wage. The professional is paid no matter what, and the company takes on the financial risk of failure. This is even true for crew members, who get paid into a pension for their work instead of receiving residuals. Theatrical actors are not paid residuals either.

Why is screenwriting or acting any different? These professionals are contracted for a specific gig, get paid for it, and do not lose anything even if the project flops."

Royalties make sense to me in some cases where the recipient is not paid a salary (other than perhaps a nominal advance from the producers). A book author, for example, makes money if their book sells and not if it doesn't. A singer makes money if their song becomes a hit.

However, at most jobs you get paid the same whether or not your product is successful. A software engineer gets paid every day to work on a feature even if it ultimately fails. If they leave the company, the company will not keep paying them even if they keep profiting off of their work. A pharma company pays a researcher the same whether the disease they work on turns into an epidemic or is eradicated. A wedding venue does not pay a construction worker for decades into the future even if they go from 1 to 100 weddings a year.

At most jobs, the company simply contracts the professional's labor for a set period of time and a negotiated wage. The professional is paid no matter what, and the company takes on the financial risk of failure. This is even true for crew members, who get paid into a pension for their work instead of receiving residuals. Theatrical actors are not paid residuals either.

Why is screenwriting or acting any different? These professionals are contracted for a specific gig, get paid for it, and do not lose anything even if the project flops."
1,2023-07-15,CMV: Cinemas cannot be saved and are doomed to be ruled by franchise films,u/MentalDespairing,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/150esvr/cmv_cinemas_cannot_be_saved_and_are_doomed_to_be/,changemyview,"(Mods, the most recent post about cinemas dying is 7 months old. I hope this fits the fresh topic friday rule)

I believe cinemas are doomed to be rule by franchise films. I love movies and thus desperately wants to be proven wrong.

1: There will still be some indie films and movies supported by co-productions, national grants and so forth, but I think many of these will also be made by companies intentionally knowing they will lose money and thus getting into a lower tax bracket. John Cusack tweeted recently about this Hollywood accounting and I believe it will intensify.

2: Most auteur directors we have now are living off their past successes and wealth to make their pet projects. We will most likely never see another upcoming director like John Carpenter, who makes successful movies without massive budgets. It will all be based on ""legacy auteurs"", as stupid as that term sounds. Spielberg, Lucas, Nolan etc. They have the weight behind them, but new directors will struggle unless they sell out to companies. One for you and one for me - make one movie they don't want to make to make one movie they actually want to make.

3: More ads and increase food prices cannot solve the issue. There are already too many ads (depending on you country) to the degree I have started to intentionally arrive late knowing the start time is incorrect and food is already priced insanely.

4: Attention span and video games. Video games make more money than the other industries combined and in video games you have agency and choice. Attention span to watch epic 3 hour films might be difficult for people growing up on shorts. There is a book called ""The Shallow"" about our modern attention span.

(Maybe John carpenter is a bad specific example, but I hope you get my point)

What will happen is that videogame adaptions will be the next trend and the audience will be gamers who wants to watch (and rage if is an inaccurate adaption) due to recognizing the names of their favorite games. Perhaps Bioshock, Fallout, Skyrim and so forth. However, **after this** I believe there will be crisis in the cinema system and only very small arthouse cinemas and state supported cinemas will survive. Hollywood companies will end up ONLY supporting movies that follow the Marvel franchise formula and will shove the extended universe model and crossovers down the throat of every story, even if crossovers and shared universes make no sense.

The only solution I can think off is massively selling out to China...but as China and West relations sour there will be so much censorship and edits that Chinese audiences won't even be seeing the real movie, perhaps editing out all LGBT and black characters and movies with ghosts and political issues. And probably this will only be a short time solution, IF it somehow works."

A leftist may accuse a right-wing activist of ""grooming children into their political ideology"", or vice versa. What these people fail to realize is that every ideology which operates on media exposed to children must participate in this ""grooming"" to some extent. Also, you may say that the use of the word ""grooming"" is a simple change in definition, but the change is a very intentional but unspoken attempt at associating your political opposition with pedophilia, knowing that there is no basis.  
  
Many right wingers also claim that the LGBT movement is an attempt at subtly sexually grooming children. But how would such a thing even operate? What incentive would the (hypothetically) pedophilic leaders of the LGBT movement have to normalize this behavior in general, rather than just grooming children for themselves? Any ideology, no matter how pure, can be used to sexually groom children, as is seen in certain priests of the catholic faith.  
  
But in less political matters, people still call each other pedophiles in a much more lax way. People act as though a 18 year old dating a 30 year old is pedophilia. But if the 18 year old is old enough to start a business, buy a house, marry freely, and become completely self sufficient, why is dating a 30 year old a step too far?  
  
The most frustrating part is that anybody who questions this new use of words is automatically labelled as a pedophile, proving their point right. This change in general culture (not just the internet) seemed extremely sudden to me, and nobody seems to care about it or even notice it."
1,2023-07-15,CMV: Majority of abortion is selfish,u/trevortins,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/150fxhv/cmv_majority_of_abortion_is_selfish/,changemyview,"I‚Äôm here to argue pro life vs pro choice but I do think most abortions are selfish. As someone who is pro life though I find abortions to be generally selfish because the reasons behind them. Majority of abortions are from unwanted pregnancy that came from consensual sex. 2 people made a decision to have sex but want to disregard the consequences of the sex which is pregnancy. 

What I find selfish is that people know that sex leads to pregnancy yet they have sex unprotected regardless because they know they can abort the baby if anything happens. I think it‚Äôs selfish to have an abortion because you wanted to have a half hour of fun with someone. Even with protection though that risk is still there and I think people should take that into account. 

Men are also to blame as they often will coerce women into getting abortions when they find out a girl they just wanted to have fun with is pregnant. But same thing applies to them down just lay down with anyone then get an abortion when your actions catch up with you.

Stopping a human life because you make poor decisions is just 100% selfish imo and I don‚Äôt see any other way around it. Really unless it‚Äôs a forced pregnancy or the mother will end up dead as a result then ending up at an abortion is just a selfish decision to cover up your poor choices."
1,2023-07-15,"CMV: Subs that mock the incel community, such as r/IncelTear, aren't helping the problem at all. If anything, they might be making it worse.",u/evilmonkey239,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/150glo6/cmv_subs_that_mock_the_incel_community_such_as/,changemyview,"I would like to preface this post by saying that I am not a member of the incel community. Quite the opposite, in fact, as I consider myself a feminist and someone who opposes sexism and misogyny and supports addressing the ways women are disadvantaged in our patriarchal society. 

That said though, I feel a lot of feminist and progressive communities really oversimplify the incel problem. It seems many people believe that these men are only involuntarily celibate because they're entitled assholes, as opposed to social ineptitude which from what I can tell, is more often the catalyst for men falling down such toxic internet pipelines. I mean, we can all agree that there are lots of assholes who *do* get laid and have relationships -- the main thing setting them apart from the assholes who don't is being socially adept. This is especially relevant when we consider that incel communities have shown to be disproportionately autistic compared to the general population. Maybe most autistic incels, for example, didn't started off as assholes, they were just consistently socially rejected growing up, and because many may have never even known about their neurodivergence in the first place, they never had a chance to really understand how it affected their social skills and how to work around it -- which would allow them to improve their skills at making friends and meeting partners. 

I don't think the solution to the incel problem is ""normies"" mocking them on the internet. If anything, this reinforces the idea that they are hated by the establishment of women and ""Chads"", leading to them becoming even more bitter which may yet fuel further violence. Also, considering how many incels are neurodivergent and/or mentally ill, what subs like r/IncelTear end up being in effect are a bunch of socially adept, well-adjusted neurotypical people making fun of socially inept, mentally unwell neurodivergent individuals. Definitely not a good look. Instead, what I think we need is to as a society do a better job socializing young men, especially those are say, on the autism spectrum, dismantling patriarchal ideas of masculinity such as sleeping with more women makes you more of a man, and for the autistic portion of the incel community, have more autism acceptance in society.

We have a toxic society that no one enjoys but almost everyone participates in

We are all more like children then we realize, but yet humanity is the most elitist out of all life on earth. Animals do fight and argue, but humans talk shit and bully others for the most goofy stuff. Like being gay or poor. Animals fight over stuff like mates and food which I get, and it wouldn't shock me if someone kills another over food money or over cheating in a relationship. Bad things to do but they make sense to get angry over. Does killing someone for following the wrong religion or having a different political view make sense?

There are lots of different types of people, so different to the point that if you were to go from Denver to Tokyo it would seem like two different planets. But the majority is arrogant. At the end of the day, none of us want to work hours to make what a billnaorie makes in a second, or have a judgemental strict society, or have to wear suits at work! Like why can't we just wear pajamas???? It's a stupid thing to get mad over but seriously, it would be so cool

Not all of the worlds flaws are ignorance, some things are out of our control or near impossible to fix. Some things people are currently trying their best to fix, and that effort is what's important. But society is just stupid. We've all been thrown onto this space rock together, but yet we hate anyone who disagrees with us in any way. Sometimes people just don't get along, but the current division amongst the world is insane 

All it would take is unity and life would be many times better. It wouldn't be perfect, but at least it wouldn't be a world where the biggest threat to humans is other humans

1,2023-07-15,CMV: Coworkers are not your friends,u/RaindropDripDropTop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/150j8ks/cmv_coworkers_are_not_your_friends/,changemyview,"To be clear, I'm not saying it's not possible to be real friends with your coworkers. If you actually regularly hang out with someone outside of work and you just happen to be coworkers, then sure I'd consider that as an actual friend. What I'm talking about is work ""friends."" People that you joke around with and talk to at work, maybe you have lunch with them every now and then, maybe you go to after work happy hour with them and other coworkers. Those people are not your real friends, they are just people you work with. 

Here's the thing, there are two extreme ends of the spectrum that you don't want to be. On the one hand, there are people at work who are antisocial and don't talk to anyone at work. On the other end there are people at work who think just because you get along in the office that you are actually real life friends. Both of these extremes are bad, you want be in the middle. Joke around and socialize with your coworkers so that you're not miserable for 40 hours a week, but keep your coworkers at a distance and don't fully reveal yourself to them. Keep it light and surface level. 

Bottom line is that you can't trust people at work. If you reveal too much personal information about yourself, people will gossip. Some people might get offended by stuff you say and hold a grudge against you. Hell, some people at work are snitches. Generally you can get a good idea about who is cool and who isn't, but you never really know and your best bet is to just keep a distance. Chances are, once you leave the company, you will never see most of these people again for the rest of your life. They are not your real friends, so don't treat them like they are your real friends."

The following are the arguments on which I rely and if you do not agree with my V please discuss the arguments

I go from my strongest to weakest point

1. *A trans woman is a woman / a trans man is a man*

In order to understand my argument, the first thing is to open your mind to the fact that man and woman are social constructors, feminine and masculine are the biological terms, woman and man are social constructors in the sense of what we associate with them, trans people are clear that biologically They are not biologically the gender they want to be, therefore the transition, there is no discussion there, what they want is to change how society treats them so that it goes according to their transition.  Bearing this in mind, I will use a comparison with another term, being an adoptive father or being an adoptive son, although an adoptive father will never be the real father, and he knows it, it is wrong to point that out to him, and in the same way if the adoptive father takes his non-biological son to the doctor knows that he should say the biological part, but that does not make him less of a father.

2. *Post-sex transphobia*

If someone physically attracts you and you sleep with him/her because of how he/she looks (just sex and nothing in a long-term relationship) it doesn't affect you in any way whether or not he/she is trans, in case he/she hasn't had surgery or something doesn't affect you. attract at the time of the act you have 100% the ability to leave and it is not transphobia, but if the way it looks attracts you and later you realize that it is, you realize that it is trans, it does not affect you at all.

I think this kind of thinking is associated with masculinity, that for example the sexuality of the butt, pawns or everything that is not penetration are considered less men for this reason, hence the insecurity when it comes to a trans person, if you liked it on the spot and you gave your consent there is nothing wrong with that, it is just your insecurities. 

3. *A trans person does not have to announce that they are trans*

This is my weakest point and it is based on the previous point

If you have an aversion to sleeping with a person of X political or religious position, it is not the responsibility of the other person to notify you in case you have a certain aversion, if it is true that a trans person is better off notifying them so as not to be in danger as they are a vulnerable population, but They shouldn't have to live in fear and in an ideal world they wouldn't have to warn, whoever approaches them and flirts with them and likes them shouldn't expect them to warn them all because of their own mental problems, if they're transphobic they may as well ask

This point is weak because I compare it with if you sleep with someone and then you realize that they have a partner, many feel betrayed and it hurts them to realize that they were part of an infidelity, at that point warning is cordiality but again it is not a duty of the person to warn you, if you have an aversion to it you can ask

Thanks for reading and I look forward to answers, please take it seriously as I plan to take the answers seriously"

1. Social issues think about, some models are predicting 10-15 percent unemployment by around 2035-2040 somewhere up in that range, so if we have these hot button social issues as we do today such as the debate over Trans rights with HRT laws, along with Abortion, we could see people just have nothing to lose anymore, same with the Far-right, if J6 were to occur with an bunk economy far more people would be willing to join militias same with anything else 

2. Political radicalism grows in such in context look at what was happening during the Great depression were people were drawn towards Huey Long and there was even an attempted coup


3. Growing income inequality another key thing in an automation driven conflict would be the common man vs the Machine owners, people would loathe the Machine owners for profiting off of them becoming homeless and such and them doing nothing so people would try to declare War on the owners and raid their HQs"

Thing is, I feel this was all intentional. The film is so stupid, so over the top, that I think it was in fact intended to be a parody of the many action films of the time (the ""Rambo"" films, for example).

Some women get so offended when their partner asks for a test and in reality, if they had nothing to hide, they wouldn't worry about a test being done.

There is no objective way to argue that the economy is somehow in a weak position right now. It's just not. It's honestly hard to imagine it being much better. People who attack Biden on the economy are either ignorant or arguing in bad faith."

Various competencies which require extensive experience have been overlooked by this business model, namely safety and quality assurance.

Lean methodology is only a sound theory on paper, because when put into practice, it monetizes skill without taking into consideration risk mitigation.

A single recordable safety incident or a recall caused by insufficient quality assurance can easily set a company back far more money than the supposed gains that Lean methodology promises."

I see them as idealists who believe in a better world. Some of them, like George Orwell, has produced great books that speak up against authoritarian socialism and communism, while some of them like MLK has lead massive progress in our society.


However it is my belief that democratic socialism will not work in the foreseeable future.


1: An democratic socialist society will inevitably require a far more massive government structure that will be very interventionist in the nation‚Äôs economy and even social structure. This would mean that in order for the country to not fall into authoritarian hands, it would require an extremely efficient check and balance system or a extremely smart and self-controlled voter base. Which both are hard to obtain, considering how bad American politics has been lately even with one of the best check and balance system of the world.



2: democratic socialism often, although not always involves open border policies, which could leads people who do not want to work into the country and those people overrun the welfare system in the nation, which causes crisis.


3: Democratic socialism require an radical redistribution of the wealth, which most rich people is not willing to do and could result in revolt of the upper middle class and the rich. Then it would leads the government to use force to repress those revolt. During those repression a democratic government could quickly turned into an authoritarian government. For example the Russian revolution was lead by multiple groups of revolutionaries. But after the war, the most radical wing aka the Bolsheviks gained power and erased the rest. Same thing could happen after a democratic socialist government took power. Because the high chance of upper class rebellion, a government military repression is very likely, and in turn causes a highly authoritarian regime because the policies they need to repress the rebellion. Plus war, internal or external, often results in the most brutal people taking all the power."

   I know I‚Äôm going to hear that ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt control it it‚Äôs their thyroid or some hormonal imbalance etc‚Äù but in reality the vast majority of people make very poor dietary choices and do not exercise enough.

I absolutely hate the term ‚Äúbody acceptance‚Äù because your weight is not like height or being bald where it‚Äôs out if your control and ‚Äúbody acceptance‚Äù is a valid perspective. Being over weight should not simply be accepted because it is in your control and the physical shape of someone is a direct reflection of the work ethic and discipline of someone. If you‚Äôre overweight it tells people that you lack discipline,self control and will power , you are also lazy. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre a bad person but we need to be honest with ourselves and promote a healthier lifestyle. If you really care about someone and they are overweight rather than enabling them and telling them it‚Äôs ok and they should be happy you need to be honest with them and help them stay alive longer and be healthier and happier. Not only will being in better shape help your physical health but your mental health will improve as well. Truly being proud of how you look and eating better food will make you feel better and have more energy and also will save you the embarrassment or shame of being overweight.  

We need to promote a healthier lifestyle and stop pretending making bad health decisions and giving up on your health and being lazy is not ok."

Given that some subreddits do not allow certain speech, and some control speech to varying degrees while allowing, the upvote-downvote system drives users into subreddits where there is a narrow range of variance in opinions.

[B. F. Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner), the father of behaviorism, established the concept of [operant conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning) with the classical experiment of the rat 'conditioned' to press a bar for a pellet. And then he added shocks to the equation so that the rat had to decide whether to take a shock to get the pellet - for simplicity for this discussion.

My view is that upvotes are positive reinforcement and downvotes negative. At YouTube, subscribers and likes are positive reinforcement and making videos for ten people is a bummer. So, people naturally to go for the positive instead of a negative because a pellet is more desirable than a shock. 

My view is that operant conditioning is a primary reason social media is polarizing. People get into a vein of like-minded people and proceed to reinforce each other. Disagreeing is asking for negative shocks. Many just want the pellet as an ego-booster. Online bullying associated with mental health issues is when the shocks have become overwhelming. 

Another concept of Skinner's is extinction. 
>Extinction occurs when a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced with either positive or negative reinforcement. During extinction the behavior becomes less probable. Occasional reinforcement can lead to an even longer delay before behavior extinction due to the learning factor of repeated instances becoming necessary to get reinforcement, when compared with reinforcement being given at each opportunity before extinction.

In this context, there's a relatively easy solution by finding a subreddit that's 'comfortable.' Prior to the takeover of Twitter by Musk, hearsay, because I have never used Twitter due to the bad reputation for free speech, is that wrong speech was brutally punished if not blocked altogether.

Common is the practice of declaring any contrarian speech as hate speech. So, some people were conditioned away from Twitter and others toward based upon operant conditioning.

Here, similarly, people are conditioned away from some subreddits and toward others, with the effect that likeminded are interacting with likeminded, and the shocks when they occur aren't as severe. That stifles interaction and debate and appreciation for other trains of thought so that we as a society have moved toward extinction on talking to people of different views. Those further drives polarization in a positive feedback loop. Everyone in the echo chamber is trading pellets, shocking invaders of the groupthink.

>First, change my view that social media is polarizing.
>Second, if social media is polarizing, change my view that ***operant conditioning*** is a primary driver of that polarization."

My view is that once a company goes ""public"" and is listed on a stock exchange it's no longer a ""family business"". It becomes another entity altogether and claims to family legacy are void. The securities cannot be transfered via the deceased estate but liquidated (via a rational legal process with the deceased shares placed into a blind trust and managed). 

My view is that once you are dead, you are dead. That's the end of your story and your rights to buy and sell on the market. The exchange is for the living and rewards the savviest of investors. Giving someone a position by birth handicaps the market from reaching it's potential.

This would obviously exclude private property and companies not listed on a public exchange."

The Spoiler effect, we all know it and love it's the process in American politics where an third party allegedly can drive votes away from the 2 major parties but I don't think it's an problem and at the end of the day should be encouraged since it shows people are willing to break the dynamic if the election gets thrown to congress and people don't like that then change will finally come with RCV, the Spoiler effect if prevalent enough can lead to change, why? Congress will finally understand the problems that come from FPTP, so they'll throw in the wrench and finally say, we're changing the system to stop this, on top of this Nader didn't rob Gore, Gore should've made himself look more appealing to the people, so in the end just let people vote their conscience and don't Shame em and burn the 2 party system"

I have a pretty shallow understanding of western classical music theory. keys, chords, progressions, melodys, etc.

I learned violin as my first pitched instrument so i was always most comfortable with treble clef over any other clefs.

Ive taken up orchestral songwriting as well as piano playing, which has had me reading a writing in Bass Clef and Alto Clef (mostly for viola).

Ive gotten kind of decent but in my experience these clefs have been nothing but pointless obstacle, an extra step between my translation and understanding of melodies.

One time i just wrote every instrument on a treble clef and it only made the songwriting process easier. Ive also done the same in making piano sheet music just two treble clefs. Also much easier.

Im considering doing everything as such but im also aware that theres so much about western classical music theory that i dont know. Can anyone explain any reason i shouldnt do this? I am definitly looking to keeo doing music long term"

Black and White is such an institutional concept if you needed to ID someone by their skin you could be more specific say tan, pale, very dark, very light, but instead we say Black or White, like that's better? Even racists don't really hate people just based on their skin, there's usually a little more to it. Smarter people realize that there are obviously huge differences between a Black person being from Africa and being from New York or being a White person from Sweden and a White person from Australia. 

  
It just seems silly to use these as giant general groupings of no real practical value. At least when you say Asian you're meaning from Asia. We could just say American, European, African, while being more specific as it's needed and eliminate White and Black from the conversation, but why don't we?  
White and Black is harmful language to me the same way Yellow would be it's just not seen as offensive for some reason. It's just too broad to the point it's almost useless. You can't just say I don't like White people for example, what would that even mean for example. I don't think anyone really feels that way, they might feel a specific way about some White people who act a certain way but because we have these terms we make it very Black and White and I'm not sure how it serves anyone any good.

The only potential problem in not using these terms would be if we just referred to descriptors when necessary like pale, dark, etc. Someone dark could be ethnically ""White"" and an albino ""Black"" could be pale, but these are fairly rare occurrences. I think the divisive nature of ""white and black"" causes more harm than that minor confusion could. "

The aerial bombings together killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people with the majority being civilians. This has caused many people to criticize to decision to use such a deadly and destructive weapon on civilian targets with some saying it was an evil and unacceptable act.

While yes the bombigs were very tragic with innocent men, woman and children being killed but the Japanese military/government left us no choice in the matter. The alternative to the nukes was ‚Äúoperation downfall‚Äù which was the allied plan for the ground invasion of the Japanese homeland. This operation would have saw FAR more deaths then the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the civilians of Japan.

The spring and summer of 1945 saw the Japanese planning and preparing for the Ketsu-Go, or the Decisive Battle for the Homeland (see http://fas.org/irp/eprint/arens/... for a more complete discussion). All school classes were cancelled which freed up more than 13,000,000 young people for the coming battle. By the summer of 1945, these people were divided into three types: Special guard Forces composed of older men who were assigned to build fortifications and transport supplies. The Independent Companies who were mobilized reservists who were building camouflaged landing strips for kamikaze‚Äôs and were trained for combat. And then there were the Civilian Volunteer Corps formed in June 1945, who were everyone else above the age of 15 and who were set to make munitions, food, and making last ditch weapons. The West was fighting against an enemy where even the women and children were being trained and armed with sharpened bamboo poles to kill the Americans. They were instructed to, ‚ÄúAlways thrust tall Yankees in their belly.‚Äù In short, everyone above the age of 15, male or female, was going to be a soldier to defend the Homeland. Around 2 million civilians were part of the Patriotic Citizens Fighting Corps that were trained for combat even if it was only with sharpened bamboo spears. By August, 1945, the Japanese had accumulated 5,350 airplanes, over 1,000,000 gallons of gasoline and 6,200 fast suicide boats in preparation for the forthcoming American invasion.

The Japanese had correctly identified the beaches where the Americans would have to invade their islands. The Japanese had planned a final stand with the Ketsugo Operation that was being prepared by a stream of reinforcements from the other islands. Over 5000 aircraft and a million gallons of fuel had been accumulated in secret caves ready to be launched against the expected invasion fleet. Our photoreconnaissance clearly showed that they were not planning to surrender, but to fight to the bitter end. They had thousands of cannon and machine guns aimed at those beaches. There are literal pictures online showing civilians practicing with bamboo spears to attack Americans during an invasion. There is not the slightest doubt that they would have fought as fiercely as possible against an invasion.

A ground invasion of Japan would have been severely more catastrophic not only for allied soldiers but for the Japanese population as whole as the Allies fought tooth and nail city to city until eventually reaching the capital. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki prevented the deaths of hundreds of thousands of lives that would have been lost if the U.S decided to use any other alternative to defeat Japan."

One time, he talked about his experiences growing up Muslim in Iran.

He gave a story about how when he was a child, he was so afraid of sinning and going to hell. He realized when he was 10 that if he were to kill himself while he was young he would still be considered innocent by Islam and be allowed into heaven. 

He proceeded to jump off of a building in a suicide attempt.

When he woke up in the hospital, his legs broken, he realized his mistake and apologized to his grief stricken parents.

Point being, this is one of many examples I've seen of people so terrified of committing a sin or of spiritual evil haunting them that it drives them to madness.

I've seen Christian women in 12 step programs because they want to give up masturbating.

I've seen lesbians and gay men living in total abstinence terrified, self hating, and alone because they want to appease God and their families and not live their truth.

For me personally, when I was a Christian back when I was a kid I was so afraid of Satan and demons that I used to wear crosses everywhere I go and carry a seal of Archangel Michael in my back pocket. I thought the circle stain in the center of my pool was demonic. I used to be terrified of going to sleep at night thinking I would be possessed by something or haunted.

As I grew up, I realized alot of the supernatural terror I experienced wasn't demons... But sleep paralysis, my unconscious mind, and superstition.

But I had psychotic levels of terror over any demonic influence in my life when I was a kid. Mostly in part to my Catholic upbringing and a wild imagination.

I would even go so far as to bow at every cross, say 10 our fathers every night, and never do any thing in intervals of 6 and only 7, 8, or 10. Because those are godly numbers.

My fixation on demonic attacks and angelic protection catapulted me into the occult at a young age. It wasn't until I was an edgy adult teenager that I actually started legitimately dabbling in evocation magic and actual ritual occult stuff. 

That utterly changed my perception of the supernatural and was a necessary step in overriding the paradigm of fear Catholicism instilled in me.

I'm more of a buddhist nowadays and stepped away from western beliefs entirely from my desire to not be associated with it either in opposition or as a part of the religion.

My biggest reason for leaving Christianity was how much it influenced me to be so utterly afraid of my own thoughts, feelings, emotions, and experiences.

I am more mentally healthy and emotionally stable at this point in my life than any point during when I was a Christian. I believe Christianity facilitated mental illness for me and amplified any existing ones that I had.

I see this in a large percentage of devout Christians that I've interacted with. As well as that, cruelty from those who they fear may break them away from their belief system.

I genuinely cannot see why people claim it's something that helps people. I can only ever see it making people worse off in almost every situation outside of drug addiction in SOME situations.

It made my depression, anxiety, and life innumerably worse. In part due to the philosophies, also due to the community regarding Christians.

I'm also bisexual and transgender, so I see alot of people comparing LGBT issues to indoctrination and making people suffer and commit suicide. But honestly, my life's never been better and I've never suffered more in this life than when I was a Christian.

I turned away from Christianity before I even realized I was bi or trans. But I do feel like I would have come to terms with it sooner if not for my very religious upbringing.

I want to know your opinion on this, how have you seen Christianity improve people's lives? Because all I can see is it creating more suffering."

I have returned to the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant for the second time this year to conduct an investigation into what is really happening there. What we know is that Russia has controlled the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. Does it make since for Russia to damage the plant they control and send Radiation across Russian territory? I think not. Next thing we know from my first trip to the ZPPP is that Ukraine has fired on areas the plant because we saw impacts that was clearly shelled from Ukraine territory.  
During this report I met with the head advisor for the General Director of the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom (ROSATOM), Renat Karchaa. ROSATOM is the company that runs the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant now that it is under control of Russian forces. Renat Karchaa told us that he had seen Russia do nothing to put the plant at risk and infact the reactors are very strong and exploding mines on them would NOT cause a nuclear disaster. He says the main threat is Ukraine firing a ""Dirty"" bomb to fake a leak.  
I also spoke to locals and workers at the plant and all said Russia was not doing anything to risk damage to the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant.

In fact, so much so that it has become a bit of a comedy genera. Just type SJW into YouTube and you'll see many of examples passionate activists not being able to respond to simple questions about their own claims.

**I am not claiming:**

1) That all activism is bad or irrational (I think sometimes it is very important).

2) That the activists need to know EVERYTHING about their topic and be able to answer every question.

**I am claiming:**

1) There are many activists who can't answer basic questions with anything more than an oversimplified slogan.

2) Have not thought about their message - at all.

3) Need to be able to formulate a reasonable argument defending the basics of their position BEFORE telling everyone else to change the way they see and live in the world. 

Again, I am not trying to paint *all* activists as irrational or wrong. However, there is good reason to believe there are a lot of irrational activists who have not done the cognitive work required to claim any authority on the matter they preach.

I am normally one of the most skeptical people you'll ever meet when it comes to aliens visiting earth and other crazy stuff like that. I never find any of the stories convincing. I've always been entertained by a good UFO story, but I never find myself actually believing them, but recently I've been going down a bit of a rabbit hole and I want to make sure I'm not insane. 

As many of you may have heard (or maybe not because I feel like it hasn't gotten enough attention in the news as it should), David Grusch, who is a former intelligence official, Air Force officer, and co-lead of UAP (government term for UFO) analysis for the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, who also helped draft the National Defense Authorization act, which includes provisions for reporting UFOs and whistle blower protection, recently had a private meeting with US senetors, and then gave a public interview in which he made some extraordinary claims. Grusch said that he has been made aware of multiple UAPs, as well as deceased non-human pilots, in the possession of the US military. He also claimed that this information has been kept from congress. 

The main criticism here is that Grusch is not a witness. He claims he was given this information, and not that he saw anything himself. He is simply a whistleblower. However, congress seems to be taking his claims very seriously, and according to senetors Marco Rubio and Chuck Schumer, [anonymous first hand witnesses have backed up his allegations](https://youtu.be/m4hmaflNoKU). Congress has scheduled a public hearing for July 26 that will hopefully include more witness testimony. 

And now legislation supported by both parties, titled ""the UAP disclosure act"" has been introduced to congress, and the language this act uses is... well... strange. It doesn't just use vague terms like ""UFO"" and ""UAP"". What it is talking about is very explicit. The act essentially says that any local, state, or federal agency must release all the information they have regarding ""extraterrestrial life"" and ""non-human intelligence"". Also gives the government the right to seize any recovered materials from military contractors that have them in possession. 

Now, I don't know much about this David Grusch guy. Sure, he has a lot of credentials, but if I just heard his claims I would dismiss them entirely, because they're pretty insane, but the fact that he went to congress instead of the media, and has still only had one public interview, tells me he isn't just trying to get famous. He didn't go on the Joe Rogan podcast or write a book... he went directly to congress. And the fact that congress seems to be taking this guy seriously makes me think that maybe I should be taking him seriously too. 

I want to be clear, I'm still not convinced, but I've never been more unsure about the subject. If you were to ask me how likely it is that aliens have visited earth, up until a month ago I would have said less than 1%... now I'd say I'm at about 20%, and it's getting higher as the days go on. Am I going crazy here?"
1,2023-07-17,CMV: Breaking Bad is incredibly overrated,u/Upset-Ask-6324,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1521b6d/cmv_breaking_bad_is_incredibly_overrated/,changemyview,"
Reason 1:Too much talking (literally, Skyler, Walter Hank, and Walter take a whole series by talking bullshit).

Reason 2:Bad character: In the whole show, every character did not develop at all. Still, the same annoying behavior remains.

The wife is a high-moral,stupid woman who basically creates to make people hate. But the show has to give her a little bit of sympathy, like she still cares for her family,because they want people to watch the show and seek sympathy and debate if she is a bad wife or not. The time she gives money to Ted is so forceful that I can't stand to watch this show anymore.

Son:Still naive,annoying voice, but handicapped to having sympathy from people and having an excuse that he's just a kid"". After the phone call at the end, I knew who projected that idea of Walter.

Reason 3:Bad antagonist:The whole show has one dynamic antagonist.

Tuco: (If you do that to any gang or any person, I can guarantee your house will be bombed.

Gus fring(- Always look cold and manic, but show has to be made to make him sympathetic by making him have a dark past to create sympathy again, but not explain how he became a killer. He became an antogonist for the sake of it.

Why did he not kill Walter already? Because it will get attention from Hank. Then kill Hank and Jessi already. Why do you need Walter that much and kill your crew who know the recipe? and why you can sense your car has been placed boom.

Answer: Because of plot armor and force drama.

stupid plan:The poison plan is very shaky and irrational. Let's say you poison the whole boss cartel, and they die. The crew will hunt you down, and just because the boss dies, they will not hunt you. That is the logic of the show, and it is not going to happen in real life.

Reason 4:Repeated: It's all the same thing:try to Poison the kid, Gus, and Lydia. That lazy writing

Expolson: Tuco,the car, to make you look cool.

Edgy conversation and unrealistic action: Say my name; this is not meth. To attract people, include kids.

Reason 5:Show don't tell: Literally, have Jessy tell us that Walter is smarter and luckier than you. Literally to have a book of WW on the toilet to have Hank read it instead of him figuring it out because Walter White is too smart that you couldn't track him. And endlessly try to make people around him so annoying and insuffble to make Walter White smart and sympathetic.

The only character that seems to develop is Walter White. But this kind of character, from good to bad, make like a milion time. If you like, I can name you a few. The depth of this character is not that deep; it is actually very shallow.

So this is my two cents: I have no hate for people who actually enjoy this show. because it is subjective. But I want people to counter my point and make me actually shut up."

However, I had absolutely no idea how deeply entrenched pro-Ukrainian propaganda had become on a site like Reddit where people have traditionally come to discuss all kinds of minority viewpoints, ranging from conspiracy theories, to lockdown scepticism, to genuine critiques of the establishment and subjects that have been scientifically endorsed.

There is all kinds of information out there that Ukraine is really just being used as a proxy war that is being used to further the agenda of the United States in destabilising Russia and expanding its own military industrial complex... and all of this can be disputed! But not when the argument is so heavily censored to begin with. Even on my own profile page, a post will be quickly and automatically removed for linking to websites such as rumble, wsws, hungarianconservative or covertaction, and not even using dot ru sites! 

I am shocked and amazed that somewhere like Reddit of all places is cracking down so coercively on anything that is vaguely sceptical of Ukraine as ""Russian propaganda"". Russia cannot even have its own subreddit without being quarantined and even on a subreddit called ""censorship"" I cannot even make this simple point about Ukraine scepticism being censored on Reddit without having my post swiftly removed.

They can just have distress over their ‚Äúsexuality‚Äù being disordered without having to had break any laws. It is shown that pedophilia can be developed due to an adverse childhood experiences. Every individual is completely different just like with any other disorders. 

There are countless paraphilias besides pedophilia disorder, such as erotophonophilia (sexual arousal or gratification contingent on the death of a human being.) Which stems from the discussion and studies of sadistic homicides.

I‚Äôve seen these paraphilias more widely accepted on neurodivergent platforms than pedophilia and why is that? Pedophiles (and POCD which gets confused with it often) are usually criticized and bullied and are kicked out of mental health safe spaces, often being shunned and given death threats or doxxing threats is commonly reported.

I believe a lot of pedophiles are also born that way. Which is something they didn‚Äôt get to choose and to shun someone for something they have no control over us wrong and immoral. They didn‚Äôt ask for it and to villanize them for simply having the attraction and the urges is not okay.

Not all pedophiles are rapists and not all child rapists are pedophiles. When we treat them as if they are a worthless rapist when they haven‚Äôt acted on those urges it‚Äôs our fault for putting them in that vulnerable position where they could offend. Why would that make any sense when you want to keep children safe?"

I'm also going to make some comparisons to what I feel are outlandish suggestions by some political actors, note that I understand that these are flawed comparisons in both scale and consequences of action, but they do have some commonalities. 

That said I was looking at positions for school board in an upcoming election and one of the questions centered around trans student safety. One candidate didn't really address the question and just said ""All students should be safe""; the other candidate suggested things like Coed Sports and Single Stall Bathrooms, which I'm ambivilent and in full support of respectively. That said they also suggest there should be markings around the school to let students know about safe spaces and LGBT+ friendly teachers and staff. To me this seems like there's a requirement for at least some staff in the school to come foreward and be willing to be a safe space for students to confide in about their sexuality. While I know I'm apples-to-oranging here, that sounds a lot like requiring staff who are comfortable to carry a gun in the event of a school shooting -- I know that's a poor comparison but it has a grain of similarity in that it requires teachers to step well outside the bounds of filling students heads with knowledge, and it also pre-supposes at least some critical mass of teachers are willing to be active agents in something so highly controversial.

I feel like the candidate who has actual suggestions is probably more interested in helping LGBT kids out than the candidate who's ""All live's matter""-ing, and will probably vote for the candidate who's putting forth actual suggestions. Full transparency: I don't have a horse in the lgbt race but because (among other things) anti-LGBT dog whistles are usually a great way to weed out candidates who will have other nasty political beliefs that I don't like. I just feel that the suggestion of requiring safe spaces is too broad and requires too much of teachers."
1,2023-07-17,CMV: Cannabis is a panacea,u/AltcoinShill,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1527h96/cmv_cannabis_is_a_panacea/,changemyview,"I don't mean any specific cannabinoid, but cannabis and its ability to produce a range of cannabinoids.  


I believe this because of the endocannabinoid system's (ECS) role as a master regulator. In most neurotransmitter systems, the signal flows from a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic neuron. The presynaptic neuron releases a neurotransmitter (like dopamine, serotonin, etc.) into the synapse (the small space between the neurons). These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, passing on the signal.  


The ECS, on the other hand, works in the opposite direction. When the postsynaptic neuron is activated, endocannabinoids (like anandamide or 2-AG) are synthesized 'on demand' from lipid precursors (fat-like molecules) already present in the neuron. Once created, they travel backward across the synapse, bind to cannabinoid receptors (primarily CB1) on the presynaptic neuron, and modulate what happens next.  


This 'backwards' signaling is called retrograde signaling, and it provides a kind of feedback mechanism. If the postsynaptic neuron is being overstimulated or understimulated, endocannabinoids can signal the presynaptic neuron to change the amount of neurotransmitter it's releasing, helping to return the system to homeostasis. This can help calm things down when there's too much activity, or ramp things up when there's too little. In this way, the ECS helps modulate and fine-tune many of our physiological processes.  


The role of the ECS in regulating some systems (opioid, acetylcholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, adrenergic, etc.) is proved and somewhat well-understood, but there is also evidence that it modulates and regulates every system to some degree, even systems that most people have never even heard about, such as the glycinergic, histaminergic, and adenosinergic systems.  


Most cannabinoids are only partial agonists of either CB1 and CB2, or both. This is because cannabinoid ligand affinity is more dependant on factors such as the G proteins or beta-arrestings that receptor is coupled to, the charge of the molecules, their ability to form hydrogen bonds, van der Waals force, as well as what other signaling systems it is coupled to.  


This means that there is potentially a possible cannabinoid molecule with partial agonism or antagonism relevant to each specific system that the ECS regulates.   


The ECS also has a much higher threshold for abuse or overstimulation than any other signaling system in the body because of its regulatory role. In the absurdly vast majority of cases, dangers only arise with the use of synthetic cannabinoids that are hundreds of times more potent than the natural cannabinoids, and because natural cannabinoids are usually only partial agonists.  


This also ensures that cannabinoid abuse is safer than most, if not all, other types of abuse. This is not an argument for recreational use, but an argument for exploring cannabinoids as medicines. Cannabinoid-based medicines that work on cannabinoid receptors modulating opioidergic activty will have much lower risk for health and abuse than opioid drugs, for example.  


But it also means that toking on some top-shelf bud is safer than most if not all other recreational drugs, including nicotine and ethanol, and that the full range of recreational cannabinoids is far from fully explored, and that legalizing cannabinoids is not a door of entry into other categories of drugs, but a door of exit."

He first submitted a notarized retelling of his holocaust survivor story. Clearly that wasn't enough evidence so the org said he couldn't claim the prize.

So what this guy did was sue them and in court he argued that self evident things don''t need to be proven. The sky is blue, water is wet, and there were gas chambers in the Holocaust. The judge found his arguments correct and awarded him a total of $90K.

Why would prize money being offered for proof of the existence of gas chambers need to be claimed using such obviously shady tactics? If there are people offering that much money for something that is supposedly so obviously true and extensively documented that it's crazy to deny it happened, why couldn't they just show the evidence of the death chambers in court or to the organization sponsoring the prize. Photos, documents, memos, anything.

Therefore based on this court case, it is logical to question the existence of gas chambers during the Holocaust and look through the evidence and details yourself to confirm what everyone claims is self evident."
1,2023-07-17,"CMV: European style policies regarding healthcare, welfare, and worker benefits would be equal or near equally effective in America as they are in European countries",u/JengaKing12,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15284l8/cmv_european_style_policies_regarding_healthcare/,changemyview,"Firstly, if you do not want to CMV me on all three of these issues and want to focus on just one or two of them, that‚Äôs okay.

Secondly, it seems the European model is just better on average than the American model.  Regarding healthcare, they‚Äôre doing better than the US, with the caveat that some still have significant issues while others are excellent. But regardless, the vast majority of European countries are just doing much better than the US on this.

Then looking at welfare, many European countries offer very generous welfare benefits to its citizens such free college education as well as generous welfare income as well.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm probably missing a few more examples, but you get the idea.

Then there‚Äôs the worker benefits.  In many European countries, the government has strict requirements not just for things like extensive parental leave policies where parent may get months off with paid leave, but also requirements for vacation or holiday, where I believe it‚Äôs very common for companies to be required to give a minimum of four weeks off to all full time employees, whereas the US has no such requirement.  Although it‚Äôs not a regulation or requirement I think standard is two weeks of PTO in the US and I think it increases with either age or work experience, at least in the white collar world, not as sure about the blue collar world.

So I‚Äôm looking at this and I‚Äôm wondering, why aren‚Äôt we doing any of this?  Like who doesn‚Äôt want cheaper healthcare that‚Äôs not any less effective?  Or even for something smaller scale, who doesn‚Äôt want more parental leave or vacation, that‚Äôs not even a class thing as you could argue that the upper and upper middle class (people that are putting down crazy hours in the office) could benefit from that just as much as anyone else? So what gives?  Am I missing something here that makes that stuff infeasible?  Am I being naive in thinking that we can have the nice things our European neighbors have?"

1,2023-07-17,CMV: No piece of music is objectively better or worse than any other music,u/BrockVelocity,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/152ajee/cmv_no_piece_of_music_is_objectively_better_or/,changemyview,"My position is that no piece of music is ‚Äúobjectively better‚Äù or ‚Äúobjectively worse‚Äù than another. Whether a piece of music is ‚Äúgood‚Äù is a purely subjective opinion. Another way of putting this is that when somebody says ‚Äú\[x\] is a good band,‚Äù all they are *actually* saying is ‚ÄúI personally enjoy \[x\]‚Äôs music.‚Äù  

I will refer to my view as ‚Äúthe subjective view,‚Äù and the opposing view as ‚Äúthe objective view.‚Äù 

Proponents of the objective view argue that music can be objectively good or bad, and that some pieces of music are objectively better or worse than others. They might also believe that all music could, theoretically, be placed in a single hierarchy of quality, from worst to best. However, I believe that all of the arguments in favor of this view fall apart for various reasons. Here are some of those arguments, and my counter-arguments.  


1. **Music is better if it‚Äôs more influential.** In addition to the fact that ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù is a nebulous concept that can‚Äôt be quantified, this view also implies that if music isn‚Äôt distributed widely enough to be influential, it isn‚Äôt good ‚Äî or at least, that there‚Äôs a ceiling on how good it can be. It also implies that a piece of music can retroactively become ‚Äúbetter‚Äù if its influence grows decades after it was recorded.
2. **Music is better if it‚Äôs more emotionally evocative/evokes deeper emotions in the listener.** I hear this a lot, but it‚Äôs one of the easiest arguments to refute, because ‚Äúemotionally evocative‚Äù is a purely subjective quality. A song that‚Äôs emotionally evocative to one person won‚Äôt necessarily be emotionally evocative to another; the same song will elicit two completely different emotional reactions from two different people, and there‚Äôs absolutely no way to litigate who is ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù in these situations.
3. **Music is better if it accomplishes what the musician(s) was/were intending to accomplish.** There are a few issues with this. First and foremost, the listener has no way of knowing what the artist was trying to accomplish with any given song. We can speculate, but we can‚Äôt know ‚Äî unless, of course, the songwriter gives an interview where they reveal what their goal was. But this would mean that we can‚Äôt assess the quality of a song in the absence of such an interview, which would mean we can‚Äôt assess the quality of \~95% of songs. Moreover, this view implies that an artist can easily make a ‚Äúgood‚Äù song if they set a very low bar and then clear it. Van Morrison definitely accomplished what he was going for with his contractually-obliged album Contractual Obligation, but nobody would say that makes it a good album. Lastly, plenty of musicians create their music without any intention, and instead, view the creative process as one of exploration & discovery.
4. **Music is better if it ‚Äústands the test of time.‚Äù** This is a vague phrase, but it‚Äôs basically pegging a song‚Äôs quality to its longevity. From this perspective, ‚ÄúHappy Birthday,‚Äù ‚Äú99 Bottles of Beer‚Äù and ‚ÄúFor He‚Äôs A Jolly Good Fellow‚Äù are three of the greatest songs of all-time, which I don‚Äôt think anybody believes. It also implies that no music is underrated, there are no ‚Äúforgotten gems‚Äù and, again, that music can only be good if it has widespread distribution.
5. **Music is better if the majority of people like it.** This runs into the same issue as Argument 1.

I also have what I might call a meta counter-argument, which I'll try to explain now. I've listed five arguments for the objective view, along with counterarguments to each of them. But even if all my counterarguments were invalid, that still leaves the big problem of determining *which* of the five arguments I listed is the proper metric for assessing a song's objectivity (or maybe it's another one that I haven't listed). For instance, do we measure the ""objective quality"" of a song by assessing its influence over time, or by the degree to which it accomplished the artist's intentions? Why? How could we ever determine which of those is the ""true"" metric for measuring a song's objective quality? We couldn't. There is no factual or logical reason to believe that any metric for gauging ""objective quality"" is better or worse than any other metric. 

I have a lot more thoughts on this but I'm eager to hear what y'all think. Thanks for taking the time to read!"

Quite a bit has happened in American politics over the past few years, and I think a healthy re-evaluation of our national symbols is in order. Every politician running for every Federal office pledges to ‚Äúshake up Washington‚Äù or ""Drain the swamp"" as a matter of course. Maybe it's time we end the narrative.  
  
We could address four issues by moving the US capital:  
1. The perceived mutual disdain ‚Äì whether its actually true to an overwhelming degree degree or not ‚Äì between ‚Äúflyover states‚Äù and ‚Äúcoastal elites‚Äù is a problem in the American body politic.   
  
2. At the time of America's founding, the US Capital was well situated, being roughly in the middle of the US, both geographically and by population. However, today the geographic center is in Kansas, and the population center is in Missouri.  
  
3. The number of voting seats in the House of Representatives has been 435 since 1913. By building a new capital, we can make a bigger House which would allow to fit more reps.  
  
4. It will create thousands of jobs for years to come in construction and tourism and stimulate the dying flyover states' economy and population.  
  
The two issues we need to address:  
A. Returning DC to Maryland or making it into a state.  
B. Convince the chosen state to give the land to the Feds, as per the Constitution, it cannot belong to any state."
1,2023-07-17,"CMV: When it comes to loan forgiveness, we should not focus on college graduates.",u/Ok_Candle_2915,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/152bkl4/cmv_when_it_comes_to_loan_forgiveness_we_should/,changemyview,"Loan forgiveness has been a popular topic and it seems our attention has been solely on college graduates. While I sympathize with graduates buried in student loans, the majority of our attention should not be on college grads. I believe focusing on college graduates does not lead to the greatest decrease in suffering and is thus a lower net benefit for the population. Also, if we're going to focus on education status, it should probably *decrease* the chances someone has for loan forgiveness.

Instead, we should focus on those that were most likely to be the target of predatory loans or have the highest debt burden. These may or may not be college students. For example, people that:

* Have extremely high interest rates (unlike college grads with subsidized, low interest federal student loans).
* Have the lowest likelihood of finding or maintaining employment (unlike college graduates, which evidence shows are more likely to be employed and with higher salaries). 
* Have large, necessary monthly expenses. A couple groups that come to mind are single parents and those in high cost of living areas that don't have the option to move.

Some reasoning for my view:

* Tax payer burden. Many students have federal student loans which are subsidized by the government. This means an even larger burden for tax payers than those without subsidized loans.
* Unfair to those with less financial education. I don't have evidence for this, but I find it very likely that college students in general, especially those that were accepted on merit, had better financial education prior to accepting the loan. This means they had better understanding of the implications, making it unfair to people with less financial knowledge.
* Eliminating the highest interest loans will lead to a larger decrease in poverty.

Two things I can think of that would help change my view:

* Arguments that loan forgiveness targeted to grads will have a larger decrease in suffering/depression/suicide/etc
* Arguments that my view is a straw man and we have displayed attention on groups other than grads

In summary: we should not focus on college grads for loan forgiveness. Thanks for reading and considering my view."

It views men's breasts as much less so. It makes sense, therefor, to distinguish between the chests of men and women.  
  
It follows that the modern movement to allow public toplessness for women asserts, intentionally or not, that exposing sexual, private body parts is acceptable - a notion I would agree with! I've seen topless women in public before, and it's never been a big deal. Exposed breasts cause no harm, and everyone simply goes about their day. So, why shouldn't the same apply to genitals?  
  
Of course, public nudity with the intention to harass or provoke is a separate case - but in terms of simply having one's penis or vagina out, what's the harm? If we allow women to go topless and expose what are certainly private parts, there's no reason not to go all the way, and completely allow public nudity.  
  
To change my view, explain potential harms of public genital exposure, or outline stronger differences between exposing breasts and exposing genitals."

Using Christianity and Islam as the case example: Both religions are similar. They promote viewpoints that are often homophobic, misogynistic, etc. They promote creationism that is at odds with science, to put it mildly. There are women who've had acid flung in their faces because they refused to wear a burka. Wife-beating is not rare in the Muslim world at all. 

If anything, one could argue that Islam - at least in the modern day - is **worse** than Christianity. You would be hard-pressed to find a Christian version of terrorism that is on the scale of al-Qaeda, ISIS/Daesh, or whatnot. (Note that I'm not saying that Christian terrorism, such as the occasional attack on an abortion clinic, doesn't exist, I'm saying that it's not to be found on the same organized *scale* and *intensity* as militant Islam.) Christians are homophobic for sure, but you'd be hard-pressed to find Christian nations that routinely execute LGBT people or have government laws authorizing such execution. (Before someone says, ""The Crusades and Spanish Inquisition"" or highlights some modern lone-wolf Christian attack - it's not happening *today* on any large scale.)

Yet, there's a curious double standard. Many progressives have no hesitation blasting Christianity full bore, giving it all they've got, for Christianity's misogyny and homophobia. But when it comes to Islam, progressives will often be considerably more muted.....and also quick to hurriedly tack on a ""Islam is a religion of *peace*. Some of them are bad, but not *all* Muslims, and also, remember how bad Christians are? You can't judge all Muslims based off of a bad few.""  In other words, there's often this inner lunge-to-defend instinct - a sentiment of ""We've got to go bat for the Muslims in America"" - in the minds of many progressives because Islam is perceived as a disadvantaged minority religion while Christianity is considered a privileged majority religion - at least in the West. 

This is why ""Islamophobia"" is a fearsome label to have in the West - no politician, professor, scholar or journalist wants to be branded as Islamophobic and be seen as a bigot - but being ""Christianophobic"" isn't really a thing, or something to fear.

Part of this is also because **racism or xenophobia is often mixed into anti-Islam sentiment, and so progressives are afraid that if they join in the criticism of Islam, they are playing into the hands of the right wing.**

On top of that, Muslims have more of a reputation than Christians for retaliating violently against those who mock them or Allah/Muhammad (look at the 2015 Charlie Hebdo killings, for instance), and so many progressives feel safer mocking Christianity than Islam. No one fears having a Christian ""fatwa"" out for their head.

Incidentally, Richard Dawkins was one of the refreshing rare exceptions to this rule. Dawkins was a progressive atheist, yet he criticized Islam just as harshly as he did Christianity, which was remarkable and unusual.

I‚Äôm 27. When I was 13, I started having weird throat issues all the time. It felt like my throat had a lot of pressure in it, like a weird burning like feeling, and the only thing that helped was when I ate/drank something or swallowed. This would help then it would come back a bit later. I had weird issues swallowing saliva too. I saw an ear nose & throat doctor about this and was told my issue was acid reflux. Doctor prescribed reflux medication and told me to sleep on an incline. I did those things for a while, but it didn‚Äôt help. Supposedly I was treating the issue and the doctor didn‚Äôt know why I wasn‚Äôt improving but told me to continue doing what I was doing to supposedly treat it. I saw some other doctors that weren‚Äôt sure either. Tried allergy meds. Those didn't help. I pretty much learned to just live like that but it was annoying and started to take over my life to the point that every day revolved around coping with my throat. I had bad anxiety, used to avoid things, had to make sure I always had something to drink to help my throat, and felt really stressed about it all and how it was affecting me.  
  
When I was 15, I started to feel a brain fog on top of the throat issues. It was like my brain felt like mush all the time. Like the feeling when you sleep bad and feel like crap, except I was sleeping 10+ hours every night. Felt kind of spaced out constantly, couldn‚Äôt concentrate as well, never wanted to do anything, apathetic, and just kind of crappy all the time. Wasn‚Äôt severe but was definitely impacting my day to day life, in addition to the throat stuff. I went back to seeing doctors. Lots of doctors said there was nothing medically wrong with me and some even said that the brain fog (and even the throat issues) were all psychological. I didn‚Äôt feel like that was it because my symptoms felt so real and physical but what did I know at 15? I was prescribed antidepressants and doctors recommended I see a therapist for anxiety issues. I spent the next couple of years trying multiple medications, seeing therapists, and making other changes but nothing helped. I thought I was going crazy. Psychologists made me feel even worse as they further made me think that all my issues were mental. In those few years that passed, I had slowly started to feel worse. It wasn't a day to day difference but a few months or so would pass and I would feel a bit worse than I did a few months earlier. By the time I graduated high school, the constant mental fog and tiredness were affecting me pretty bad. I felt stressed and anxious nonstop. Sometimes the anxiety was so bad I would literally start sweating. I had almost no social life during high school because of all these health issues and did just the bare minimum to get by. Because lots of doctors were telling me there was nothing physically wrong with me, I started to believe them about it being all mental. I thought it was something I was doing wrong personally. At this point I wasn‚Äôt even talking to my family about it as much since supposedly there was nothing wrong and it was all in my head. Especially when doctor after doctor were saying nothing was wrong and because my symptoms were mostly feeling tired all the time, what was I supposed to say? It felt like it was a personal failure for feeling the way I did. Everyone gave me crap for seeming lazy, laying down a lot, seeming out of it and not wanting to do things. They gave me the impression that my issues were because of me and I just needed to change my mindset and lifestyle and I‚Äôd feel better. Positive thinking, changing my behavior, antidepressants, therapy. I did every single thing doctors and therapists told me to do, but nothing helped. They made me question my sanity every day. By the end of high school I probably had at least a dozen doctors tell me there was nothing physically wrong with me. It was literal hell living like this.  
  
I was in no shape to go to college, but I did. I ended up going because supposedly there was nothing wrong with me and I was trying desperately to believe it was all in my head like everyone was saying. So I pushed myself to go, hoping I‚Äôd sort it out soon. I didn't. I spent the next 4 years slowly feeling worse, still seeing doctors but getting no legit answers. I'd go months and months at a time without seeing a doctor as I didn't know where to turn and had given up at times. I'd also go back to thinking maybe it's all in my head, but at the same time my symptoms felt more real and severe than anything mental could cause. Midway through college, I saw a doctor about sleep apnea but didn't seem to fit most of the symptoms. He asked me about things like waking up trying to get air, choking, stopping breathing, snoring, wasn't overweight, wasn't unhealthy, didn‚Äôt have a family history of it or other health issues. Doctor also did scans and didn't see anything abnormal. Still, I tried one of those moldable mouthpieces that‚Äôs supposed to help with sleep apnea but didn't see any benefit from it. So with all of this in mind, I figured it‚Äôs probably not sleep apnea. I was so desperate, I was constantly trying all sorts of medications, supplements, and other weird things to try and help myself. I felt like I was losing my damn mind. My mental health was horrible. Felt like crap 24/7. I literally felt stupid because my brain wasn‚Äôt working. Dealing with symptoms and figuring out what was wrong with me consumed my entire life. I would occasionally go to class after taking a big dose of stimulant drugs, but even those only did so much. No amount of caffeine pills, energy drinks did anything either. I was beyond that stuff helping. I experienced almost nothing enjoyable in those 4 years of college and had basically no life, really no friends, hobbies, nothing. Really the only experience I had during college was when I went on a study abroad trip but it was hell because I felt so awful the whole time. I had also joined a fraternity in the beginning of college but did almost nothing with them for the same reason. The mental tiredness had gotten so bad it felt like I was disconnected and living in a dream. Like I felt kind of drunk. I was so mentally and emotionally numb and exhausted I didn‚Äôt even feel human. Like I physically could not feel emotions and felt super spaced out. I was also still dealing with the throat issues. I‚Äôd get random dizziness, my vision got worse like being more sensitive to light and bad floaters in my eyes, almost no sex drive, my voice was sounding more monotone and dead. In four years, I also probably spent a couple thousand dollars on shuttles and ubers to and from appointments (I didn't have a car at the time and lived almost 2 hours from the major city), also seeing doctors that didn‚Äôt take insurance, buying supplements, drugs, etc. I somehow managed to graduate college (I could make a whole separate post about this) and finished feeling way worse than when I began.  
  
I spent the next year doing just the bare minimum to get by, living like a zombie. About a year after college (2019), I had a sleep study done and results came back with moderate sleep apnea. 17 times an hour I was having breathing interruptions while sleeping. For the first time I actually had an answer. Sleep doctor immediately prescribed a CPAP machine. Didn‚Äôt even bother to wonder why a young healthy person has sleep apnea to begin with, because it‚Äôs not normal. I spent about a year messing with the machine and the full face mask they gave me and got no benefit. I then switched to a different machine and a mask that only went into my nose and finally noticed some improvement when I was able to keep it on and sleep through the night with it. However, this didn't happen much as it was super awkward and uncomfortable sleeping with air blowing down your throat and a mask stuck to your face. I'd also wake up a bunch during the night, rip it off without knowing, etc. But I was desperately trying to make it work. When I was able to keep it on for 5+ hours a night I felt a bit better but it was really difficult to do so consistently. During this time I couldn‚Äôt really hold down a job, other than some really basic, short term jobs. And even those felt brutal. I was a complete zombie because the tiredness was so overwhelming. It was as an amount of brain fog and exhaustion I didn‚Äôt know was humanly possible. I was making myself basically sick with stimulants. Throughout all of this I was taking stuff like Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, modafinil. I was so tired none were really helping and even had a doctor at one point tell me that I should get genetic testing for depression or have my brain zapped with electric shocks. I didn't go that route. By this point, I'd had nearly every medical test someone could have done.  
  
After 2 years of messing with machines and still struggling, my sleep doctor then recommended I see a maxillofacial doctor to see what the underlying breathing issue was being caused by. The doctor recommended I get a custom mouthpiece made that shifts the lower jaw forward to help open the airway to prevent breathing issues while sleeping. The process of having it fitted and made took a couple months. I even took a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job during this same time because I had two different doctors telling me that this mouthpiece was likely to help me a lot. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt have gotten the mouthpiece fast enough. I ended up messing with the mouthpiece for months and had no benefit at all. Literally zero. The dentist who made the mouthpiece said that the mouthpiece wasn‚Äôt helping because I might just have ‚Äúweak muscle tone‚Äù in my throat and that I should see someone called a myofunctional doctor to supposedly improve muscle tone in the throat and tongue. I looked into that and it seemed like total quack stuff so I didn‚Äôt do it and completely dropped that dentist that made my mouthpiece and suggested this. I then saw an ear nose and throat doctor and later did a sleep endoscopy with him where I was put to sleep and had my breathing monitored with a camera down my throat. The doctor said that my breathing issues were being caused by my throat and jaw and suggested that since the mouthpiece wasn‚Äôt helping, I could get surgery or have a device called Inspire surgically inserted into my chest and neck to artificially help breathing. I held off on that cause it sounded pretty extreme and thought there had to be something else. During this time I had to leave the job I should‚Äôve never taken in the first place because I was so non-functional.  
  
I pretty much gave up for months. I eventually scheduled an appointment with another ear nose & throat doctor (the same kind of doctor I first saw when I was 13). I'd already seen multiple ear nose & throat doctors by this point but didn't know what else to do. Don‚Äôt remember how exactly it happened, but the connection was made that my issues were due to really abnormal nasal breathing. I had a really severe form of something called nasal valve collapse, which was causing both sides of my nose to almost completely cave in and block most air when breathing in, even when just breathing in a little bit. This issue is worse during sleep so all night I was struggling to breathe was slowly feeling worse over time as I was never getting quality sleep. So the bad sleep every night just kept accumulating over the course of 10+ years. He also explained that my throat issues were a sign that my nose wasn‚Äôt functioning normally, which was causing airflow issues and a throat pressure feeling as a result. Nothing specific caused this issue to happen. Just the way my face and nose naturally developed over time. Doctor said this issue is not common and when it does happen is typically the result of an injury or prior surgery as opposed to it just happening naturally. Prior to having surgery the doctor had me wear a plastic dilator in my nose at night to prop it open which helped incredibly. Everything finally made sense for the first time ever. I even recorded my sleep and sure enough I could hear myself struggling to breathe all night. Other things started to make sense too, like sweating during the night, breathing mostly through my mouth, I wet the bed a lot as a kid. It also made sense as to why the CPAP wasn't helping much either, especially with the kind of mask I was using that wasn't addressing my nose issue.  
  
Last year (2022), I had nasal valve surgery (the main problem) as well as a septoplasty surgery. It took a long time to recover from surgery and the years of sleep apnea damage but I feel I mostly have now. I may still have to look into revision surgery as the collapse is still fairly bad during the day when I'm not wearing the dilator but over time most of my issues have gone away since it was the poor quality sleep that was giving me most my symptoms. The slowly worsening constant exhaustion, brain fog and cognitive issues that started when I was a teenager. The severe anxiety/depression/stress I had since I was a kid. I‚Äôve also learned that another reason why I felt so anxious and stressed all the time was because sleep apnea and poor quality sleep itself puts the body into overdrive stress mode. Also, the throat issues were now completely gone. It was that obvious all along but untreated made my life constant torture. Feeling horrible nonstop, slowly getting worse over the course of more than a decade, not knowing why, being told there was nothing wrong with me or that it was all psychological, trying all sorts of things with no benefit, and having my entire life be ruined was a mental hell I wouldn't wish on anyone. I don‚Äôt feel like my teenage years and a good part of my 20s actually happened because I was in such poor health physically and mentally 24/7. I missed out everything. I wish I had been able to see good doctors earlier, but that didn‚Äôt happen. I‚Äôm not even sure how I wasn‚Äôt able to make the connection myself. I think I was just so used to really bad breathing since I was young that I didn‚Äôt know it was abnormal and had no reason to think I had some weird issue. I still struggle with the mental effects of I think living like this for so long. The depression and frustration about it all. The fact that all of this was so preventable and detectable. These issues consumed my life more than anyone knows. My life outside of this was total nothing. It's surreal to even think about how my life was for so long. Through all this I've learned there is nothing more important in life than proper breathing and sleep. Such basic, fundamental things most people never even have to think about. Unfortunately, a competent doctor could have prevented all of this. 

TLDR: Slowly worsening chronic fatigue/brain fog and other issues for 10+ years was due to really bad nasal breathing, predominantly severe bilateral nasal valve collapse that was leading to sleep apnea.

What reason do I have to share a photo? I have it already, so why show other people? Because I look good? Because I want people to think I'm social and have a life? Why should I care what followers think?

Part of me really wants to download Instagram again because I've been working out and it's Summer and I have a whole bunch of pictures to share, but I always double back and think ""why?"" I'm just going to obsess over the fact that there's not enough likes and comments as I want."

If you get a mediocre surgeon your face will just get butchered. Where I‚Äôm from plastic surgery is very common and there‚Äôs a lot of great surgeons so really do your research before committing. 

I don‚Äôt get why so many people have such a huge issue with plastic surgery. Why would you not make yourself look more attractive? Being good looking affects pretty much every aspect of your social life. People perceive you more positively in pretty much every way. People against surgery always leave out the obvious fact that your attractiveness has a direct impact on the attractiveness of the people you‚Äôre dating. I‚Äôm still young (20) and when I pick a partner for life I want her to be at least be good looking, not just average. I‚Äôm sure most people in my age range feel the same way.

I‚Äôm just really tired of all this wishful thinking about looks not being important, because they obviously are. Wanting to be more attractive isn‚Äôt shallow or insecure, it just means you‚Äôre realistic about how society works. It also doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt like yourself. I‚Äôm ok with my appearance, I just think I could look better

If you think you could look better and could reasonably pay for surgery (as long as it‚Äôs not a huge cost for you), you really have no reason to not do it in my opinion.

I'd say it's a problem that's been around for a while, probably since mankind existed. But I don't think there's a realistic way to fix it without limiting peoples freedom. 

I think it's just a fact that attractive people will get treated better for one reason or another. Humans like things they find attractive and appealing and choose to spend their time on those. There will always be people who want that treatment so they will spend their time or money to achieve the look to get those results. It creates a cycle where others will see this and want that treatment and will seek ways to get it. 

We can tell people to be fine with how they look but how effective can that be when the people saying this are still wearing makeup, have surgery or are just naturally very attractive. At this point, I think the best we can hope for is to make body image issues a mental health issue (similar to body dysphasia, dyspmorphia) and allow things like surgery, make up or even just therapy for it to be covered by insurance.

The only alternative to me would be to restrict or ban makeup and surgery, along with any other image enchanting things. But even then there will still be some people who are more beautiful so while it will soften the blow it won't change much and it will always be something that person has to come to terms with on their own or through therapy"

Nobody should be punished for seeing a deity, and if the deity tells them to do something to honor it, you can debate whether it was a legitimate experience, but not deny them the right to follow through with it as long as it meets other ethical guidelines (no human sacrifice for example). 

I understand cultural context is important, and people should attempt to learn the cultural context. However I believe if the cultural group refuses to work with someone they have the right to attempt to go out on their own in their spiritual journey. To say they do not has the implication that the deities have no agency of their own or do not exist outside of cultural traditions.

This doesn't mean any random white person can claim to be a medicine man or anything. Neopagans have really stupid practices in the name of being non-hierarchical. But I don't think believing or attempting some level of practice is a problem. "
1,2023-07-17,CMV: Disney has gone too far with what they are doing with Snow White,u/LucidCunning,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/152k1s7/cmv_disney_has_gone_too_far_with_what_they_are/,changemyview,"I understand both sides of the controversy over The Little Mermaid remake. Some people want to preserve it as the classic it is and they feel changing the characters too much would alienate older audiences (and it did in many cases) while other people argued that a fresh take would be fun and differnt, and why do the same thing twice? I didn't see that movie. I personally couldn't find anything about it tasteful, and that had nothing to do with who they cast as Ariel. I wouldn't have seen it if they had cast a pale redhead, either. I just bring it up to say, I didn't wasn't bothered to care either way. I wasn't advocating for its changes and likewise I didn't care that they changed it.

But Snow White? This is now getting absurd. What was before what I thought was a bunch of republican paranoia is now starting to get someone like me (I'm not political) to actually raise an eyebrow. Why are they casting a woman with Colombian descent into this role? The girl has tan colored skin. The name, ""Snow White"" is not only TWO allusions to the color of her skin, but the wicked stepmother, in asking the question, ""Who is the **fairest** one of all?"" is also inquiring about something relative to skin tone. To be, ""**fair**"" back then was a sign of prestige and nobility. It meant that as a woman, you didn't work in the sun. The fairest of skin was therefore very desirable. In any case, the Stepmother is asking not who the most beautiful is, but who the ""fairest"" is. This is INTENTIONAL because the name of the main character is ""SNOW-WHITE."" The original German fable confirms all of this.

To go even further, what the hell are they doing with the dwarves?

[https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/07/e344c-16894093857539-1920.jpg](https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/07/e344c-16894093857539-1920.jpg)

Is this a joke? The Dwarves are basically supposed to be family, not a racially diverse bunch of misfits. Also, has Disney forgotten that, ""Dawrf"" doesn't only mean a little person, but is also the name of a very respected fantasy race of creatures that many role-players and movie-goers love? Do the film producers realize the ORIGIN of Dwarves in folk-lore CAME from Germany, and that Snow White was one of the most famous early-tellings of this folklore, as Snow White is also a German fable? (They are actually ""consulting"" with little people for this movie. Did they do that for The Hobbit? For Lord of the Rings? Did they NEED to do that to make good movies?)

In the original Snow White, they look just like fantasy Dwarves. They are short, but not deformed. They have beards. They are stalky. They have that ""dwarvey"" voice. They're not deformed humans! They're a completely different race of humanoid!!! **They are meant to be dwarves from fantasy, not midgets.** I could nitpick on 3-4 other small things, but the main point has been made.

Thirdly, Snow White is going to be doing her own empowered thing. Whatever. I'd care less about this one normally, but is this seriously going to be the new plot of every Disney remake moving forward: ""Disney Princess can save herself and doesn't need anyone else's help?"" 

""Snow White and The Seven Dwarves"" is about the story of a human woman with the fairest skin that befriends 7 short and stalky humanoids of a different race from Germanic folklore. That's literally what it's about. In the new movie, they are removing the entire point of the name of the film. They are removing Germanic folk-lore dwarves and replacing them with... hell, I don't even know. But those costumes are fucking ugly as hell. Why even call it Snow White if you're going to change everything about it? What is even left any longer?

 as an example, let's take a pedo serial killer who abducts children, then abuses, tortures and kills them. in a state where the death penalty exists, they would obviously getting the chair.

but logically speaking, does this horrible human being actually care about what's to come to them after they're caught? from their POV, death would be the easiest way out as they wont have to actively face any consequences - so rather than killing them, they should be getting life in prison. having to spend the rest of their lives rotting in prison day by day would work as a mirror that shows them the consequences of what they did. 
also we all know what happens to pedos in prison lol


IMO, this is why the death penalty barely deters heavy crime rates - serial killers commit crimes having acknowledged that they might be getting executed."

But everything feels like too little, too late. I have a nephew that's going to be born before the end of the year, but with how the world is going, I almost hope that >!my sister miscarries so that he isn't born into such a cruel and chaotic world without even having the chance to see that wonderful things it has to offer.!< And I know that is a horrific and cruel thing to say or even think about, but I just can't imagine a good future for him if everything is burning, flooding and dying, especially with the unprecedented global biodiversity loss.

&#x200B;

I know that today, the world is far safer and nicer compared to last century and centuries before it. But how long will that last before the mass migration of hundreds of millions of people? You'd think conservatives would be in favor of protecting the climate to prevent this mass migration. I know the heatwave will end eventually, but how long is this El Ni√±o period going to last? How bad is it going to become in the next El Ni√±o? I hate the fact that I'm Gen Z having to deal with this. I hardly have any power compared to the aging fossils with all of it. As stupid and unreasonable as it sounds, I hate being young in today's world. I sometimes wish I was born in the 1950s or 1940s or some time period where I wouldn't have to deal with all this shit.

I know alarmism sells, but if I'm informed, I panic. If I ignore the news, I panic even more because I am unaware of the world around me. I've tried cutting as much screen time for myself as possible, I've gone on long nature hikes, I've touched grass, I've gone to therapy, I've taken prescribed medication, I've taken up as many hobbies as possible, I've spent as much time as possible with loved ones, I've done as much as I can to reduce both my own and others footprints, I've made a point to vote and help others vote. But this catastrophe keeps eating away at me inside and it won't stop no matter what I do it's like being consumed from the inside out. Not to mention the rise of right-wing parties in Europe and God knows what's going to happen there and also how the right-wing is becoming emboldened in the States. 

&#x200B;

I just don't know what to do anymore, the world around me feels like it's dying and I'm miserable. And none of my loved ones understand what I'm going through, the people around me are proceeding with life as usual and I can't understand how they can be so casual about it. I can't live in the now if the future is so bleak.  It doesn't matter if I live in a place that'll be relatively unaffected, I can't help but cry for the people in different parts of the world, I can't help but cry for the little kids I see playing on the street, I can't help but cry for the multitude of species around the world hitting endangered, critically endangered, and extinct statuses. I'm tired, I'm scared, I'm angry, I'm frustrated, I'm doing all that I can to hold on for the sake of the lives I care about but I'm in such a horrific state of despair that nothing I do to try to alleviate it helps. Please, someone, tell me it's going to be okay. Please tell me that I'm overreacting. I don't want to live in this world as a young person if it's only going to become so horrific that it becomes unrecognizable.

This unfortunately has issues as people can either subvert the process to pass laws they want or subverted through political infighting....

I propose that we should have a new method of making laws that is more experimental rather than political without the disadvantages that the later has. All laws will be passed without debate once proposed and it would be evaluated on the street for a period of several years such as a decade with the final deciding factor being the person on the street deciding if or if not he or she follows the law . Once the period is up, there will be a census done to see how many people follow the laws or not and those laws that have a majority do so will be implemented into law.

As for budget, it would be randomly decided through a random number generator selecting how much should the government receive. 

It would get rid of political infighting since all laws proposed will be passed with a trial period.

She is white and on the older side. She thinks trump is the worst thing ever, watches CNN and MSNBC etc. 

When talking about politics, she will often say things like ""he's an old white man"" or ""the last thing we need is another white man"" etc.. 

Although I acknowledge the history of oppression of black people in the united states and slavery etc..

I still feel that - to constantly point out someones skin color and seem to make a prejudgement about them based literally on the color of their skin.. is racist. If you want a world that is equal, stop turning every issue into one about skin color. Which is what many liberal people do. 

Personally, I could care less if your old, white, black, young, gay whatever if I think your the right person for the job, and/or you have good character and are authentic and genuine. Yet I see many people on the liberal spectrum - who see themselves as being on the right side of some good vs evil battle, and the other side as racist rednecks.. and yet it is THEM who make everything about race - which continues to divide people.

Also - the truth is, people of all skin colors and all cultures have oppressed other groups of people, thats not unique to white people if you know anything about history. Blacks, asians, latino's, whites, every race and ethnic group is guilty of treating another group as less then. Many black people make prejudgements about white people and call them slurs as well. Its sadly part of human nature. People like my mom though, seem to put all the blame on white people as if they are uniquely to blame or inherently racist or bad in some kind of way. "

There are three key ideas in the Simulation Argument:

- Technologically advanced civilizations might reach the capability to create authentic simulations of conscious experiences.

Sure, it's easy to call this an argument from ignorance, saying I'm speculating about a future we can't possibly predict. Yet, isn't all theorization based on projections and possibilities?

Yes, these civilizations might self-destruct or face unanticipated catastrophes, but that doesn't exclude the chance of some making it through. It's not survivorship bias, it's acknowledging the diverse outcomes of evolution.

The replicability of consciousness? That's a can of worms right there. I don't have concrete proof, but does the lack of current evidence negate future possibilities? Ever heard of the black swan theory? Just 'cause you've only seen white swans doesn't mean black ones don't exist.

- Assuming they're motivated, these civilizations could create a multitude of these simulated realities.

This isn't an overgeneralization, it's a consideration of potential. I'm not saying they definitely will, I'm saying they could. If they've got the tech and the means, why not? Ethics? Morals? They could differ vastly from ours, and it's a slippery slope to start assuming what an advanced civilization might consider moral or immoral.

- Given the potential for countless simulations, we could be more likely to exist within a simulated reality rather than a base reality.

Invalid probabilistic reasoning? Base rate fallacy? Not exactly. I'm not saying that because there could be infinite simulations, we're definitely in one. I'm saying it increases the possibility. It's not a matter of certainty, but a matter of probability.

Is the Simulation Argument speculative? Yes. Does it rely on assumptions? Absolutely. Is it an intellectual escape into fantasy? Or is it a testament to human imagination and intellectual curiosity, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of reality, and challenging us to think outside our comfortable boxes of known knowledge?"

This is a very specific phrasing designed to make the training process sound more unethical than it actually is. ‚ÄúUse‚Äù is a very very vague word. Usage of artworks can range from admiring, to studying, to copying, to using as jerk off material. 

Not every usage of existing work is infringement, and not every use case requires the consent from the artist. 

And here is why training an AI model is not stealing.

**1. Generating copyrighted work is theft**
To get this out of the way, if you generate something that is [substantially similar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_similarity) to a copyrighted work, it is theft and infringement; there‚Äôs no doubt on that. If you generate and publish art of mickey mouse, you should face the legal consequences, the same ways as anyone producing it with photoshop or pencils. The theft in this case is committed by the user, but nothing to do with how the AI was trained. 

**2. Training does not generate artwork**
Training and image generation are two very separate processes. The training dataset is **only used** during training. The only output of the training process is the model that is capable of generating images. The model does not have any access to the training data during generation. This is why people say training is like learning, because it merely gives the model the ability to generate images. A human can also study a bunch of pictures of mickey mouse, and learn to draw mickey mouse. Having the ability to draw mickey mouse is not theft **until they actually draw it.** This is exactly what training is ‚Äúusing‚Äù the dataset for - learning. If someone chose to use the model to generate copyrighted material, then it‚Äôs back to point 1.

**3. Should artists be compensated for contributing the training data?**
Of course not. This is a very unreasonable expectation and here is why. First, imagine you‚Äôre a human artist trying to draw a modern house. Human artists ‚Äúdraw inspiration‚Äù from real life, that is hundreds of houses and buildings they‚Äôre seen throughout their lives, and maybe hundreds of designs in other artworks. Either way, all of these houses are designed by an architect or a designer. Whether you like to admit or not, every building you see subconsciously contributes to the model house you draw. Should you pay every architect as well? **Again, of course not.** Why is that so? Because the contribution of individual building is negligible, like 1 in 1000 (0.1%). Your new design will contain many common elements with many of the modern houses out there, but it is still different from an individual building. You did most of the work by taking hundreds of minute elements and combine, aggregate and modify them into something new. This is the same with AI, except the individual contribution of each image is much much smaller. (One image out of 5.5billion is 0.00000018%.) So as long as it is justifiable for an artist to not pay the architects, it makes no sense for AI researchers to compensate the artists.

In summary, as long as you are not using the model to generating something similar to existing work, there is no art theft. Stealing is done by bad actors generating copyrighted images, nothing to do with how the model is trained."

Is it? I see survival as a neutral thing. Humans simply favor survival and avoidance of pain because those who held those views passed on their genes to the next generation, which also would consider survival and pleasure as positives.

Also, the state dislikes suicide because every person that kills themselves is a potential tax payer, soldier, mother, etc. So the ideology of the world pushes it down your throat that survival is good. However, a person who is suicidal should not be encouraged to be a parent or soldier, and has a chance of ending up on welfare, thus not really benefit the tax payer argument.

**""You are simply being edgy and emotional. Grow up.""**

I'm almost 30.

**""Going to therapy will help you, combined with going to the gym and socializing.""**

Disagree with my specific issues. The psychologists I have spoken with were not able to discuss philosophical topics that are the core of my issue, like moral relativism, cultural relativism, nihilism, objective external meaning, etc.

I also go to the gym 5-6 times a week, and whenever I end up socializing I lose interest because I want to discuss philosophical topics which would generally bring down the mood. Thus I remain quiet and nod because I don't want to ruin for other people. I let people dominate the conversations and I ask them as much as possible about themselves to make them feel good about themselves.

**""People who attempted suicide regretted it.""**

See, I believe people regretted it because after a person commits suicide they gets tons of attention and focus on them, thus it feels like people genuinely care about you. If a person attempted suicide for loneliness reasons it seems to the person like now the issue is solved, people do care about me. But this is not truly true - people cared about you only now after a massive traumatic event. To not be truly lonely people should have reached out to you long before any large even that implicitly forces people to contact you.

Also, if you fail suicide and want to try again there is no way you would admit it, in fear of being locked up somewhere or forcefully drugged down.

**""Why not just live a hedonistic life until you die? Worship art and literature, sex and pleasure. Worship yourself.""**

I think humans engage in art to forget about nihilism, as humans use metaphors and stories to stop thinking about how life truly has no objective meaning. I believe either Schopenhauer or Nietzsche was the first to say this. I also fucking hate the West's focus on creating your own values and existentialism, worshipping stuff like Absurdism and ""optimistic nihilism"" - optimistic nihilism does not even make sense.

**""Well, just join a religion then.""**

You can't chose to believe in whatever you want. After being taught evolution I believe it is correct, beyond any choice of my own. One cannot go back into ignorance. And yes, that includes Atheist Buddhism...whatever that means.

I'm not even gonna list anecdotes or emotional arguments, I assume you already understand why they are weak.

Thank you.

1,2023-07-18,CMV: Strike nurses are essential,u/RaindropDripDropTop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/152xqy8/cmv_strike_nurses_are_essential/,changemyview,"For anyone who doesn't know, strike nurses are basically traveling nurses who fill in for nurses who go on strike. Let's say a bunch of nurses at a hospital or multiple hospitals in one city go on strike. The hospital(s) will then hire strike nurses to come in and temporarily fill in those nursing positions during the strike. Generally speaking they make a lot of money doing so, and are very highly paid.  

I've seen this topic brought up online, with some people attacking strike nurses and calling them ""scabs"", with some even calling them ""rats"" or ""scum"" for crossing someone else's picket line to make money. In my opinion this position is incredibly ignorant and potentially downright evil. 

The health care sector is not like other industries. People's lives are at stake. If nurses in an area go on strike, without strike nurses then the patients who happen to be in the hospital during a nurses strike would be completely screwed. If there were no nurses at a hospital, more patients could and likely would die because of not receiving the proper care. Strike nurses are essential so that patients could still receive the proper care during a nurses strike. 

I completely understand supporting a nurses strike, but people who are against the existence of strike nurses are basically showing that they would be willing to let patients die just for the sake of making the strike more effective. I can totally understand attacking hospital management for not properly staffing their hospital, overworking nurses, not paying a decent wage to nurses, etc. but attacking the strike nurses is simply just vile. Patients still need to receive care during a nurses strike, and strike nurses are absolutely essential."
1,2023-07-18,CMV: Fetal personhood matters for the pro-choice argument,u/space_force_majeure,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/152ysnb/cmv_fetal_personhood_matters_for_the_prochoice/,changemyview,"Maybe this is a unique one, idk. I had an interesting debate that became surprisingly heated with a friend when we talked about abortion recently. 

Also let me start by saying I will not be convinced that abortion is wrong. If you are a pro-birther about to comment your pro-birth argument, just stop. **This debate is specifically about variations within the pro-choice viewpoint.** 

We are both pro-choice, and both agree that we would rather have abortion legal up to birth than eliminate abortion altogether. 

She said that fetal personhood (that is, whether a fetus is legally considered a person or not) has no bearing on the abortion argument because it should revolve solely around bodily autonomy of the woman. The government should not be able to remove the ability for you to decide what you do with your body, regardless of another person. We can't force organ donation, even from dead people, so forcing women to donate their bodies to another person is unethical, unfair, and essentially shows that women are less than people, even dead people. 

While I don't disagree with her arguments, I disagree that fetal personhood doesn't matter. Arguing from the bodily autonomy perspective means we *must* determine when the fetus becomes a person. If we determine it is prior to birth, then the fetus also gains bodily autonomy and has all of the exact same rights as the woman from that perspective. We wouldn't be able to do things to its body without its consent, like putting it in danger (abortion). 

Additionally, the government has a long history of telling you what you can and can't do with your own body. Drug laws, seatbelt laws, helmet laws, forced blood tests, etc, which undermines this argument. 

On the other hand, I believe a fetus isn't a person legally until birth and therefore has no protections of a person until then, so a woman's bodily autonomy takes precedence over a non-person, which is why abortion should be fully legal. 

The reason I believe this is mostly a logic/constitution based opinion, and it went something like this: 

People are granted the constitutional right to life, rights against false imprisonment, rights to due process, and rights to property. If we were to allow the argument that fetuses are people, then they must be granted all of these rights, not just the right to life. This is required of the constitution; all persons have these rights. 

This would mean we must release all pregnant women from prison, because a fetal person is falsely imprisoned if it was not convicted of a crime and yet is in prison, unable to leave. 

How about property? Can a person give land, houses, etc to a fetus? How would the fetus pay taxes for those things? Can the government then take those things from the fetus? How would they accomplish that without due process, allowing the fetus to defend itself? 

Next, the 14th amendment mentions that a citizen is ***born*** or naturalized. So fetuses cannot be citizens. Thus they are unlawfully present without papers and should be deported. To where, and how? 

Clearly none of these rights make sense to apply to a fetus. If we agree we must logically remove those unalienable, constitutional rights from the fetus, then it stands to reason that they are not people, and thus we can also remove the right to life until birth. 

So, CMV. I want to hear more detailed arguments to why fetal personhood should not be considered as part of the pro-choice argument. Alternatively, shoot down my arguments with some better ones."
1,2023-07-18,"CMV: I suspect Colleen Ballinger is being left under the bus by popular opinion so they can virtue signal about being more ""gender-neutral"" in their views than they might actually be. Please convince me otherwise.",u/Planet_Breezy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/152z7jv/cmv_i_suspect_colleen_ballinger_is_being_left/,changemyview,"When it was Mary Kay LeTourneau, the average person said ""nice.""

&#x200B;

When it was Debra LaFave, the average person said ""nice.""

&#x200B;

People try to blame the media for the above, but media just caters to either consumer demand or corporate sponsor pressure, and I'm not sure what sponsor has a vested interest in gaslighting the public into supporting such defendants.

&#x200B;

In the years since, those who suspected the average person wasn't entirely forthcoming about their opinions on gender issues often said *""wait a minute... if you really believe women and girls are just as horny as men and boys, or that the latter have just as high standards in a partner as the former, why isn't sex with the underage equally serious a crime regardless of the sexes of each involved""*?

&#x200B;

And yet, instead of just confessing (whether truthfully or falsely) to feigning opinions on such gender differences, people proceeded to throw, under the bus, those who took what everyone else was saying about cases like LaFave and LeTourneau and saying it a bit more vocally. Cenk Uyghur and Bill Maher come to mind; both were people who used to vocally defend such women and have the average person seeming to agree with them at the time, but now it looks like the average person is trying to claim they never did.

&#x200B;

And now it has culminated in the Colleen Ballinger case, wherein a woman is being condemned for the degree of just how sexually explicit her conversations with teenagers were, independently of whether or not physical sexual contact took place. Regardless of legal consequences, she's otherwise received more condemnation in the court of public opinion than the likes of LaFave or LeTourneau ever did.

&#x200B;

On this, I'm beside myself. On the one hand, I'm so used to thinking of most other men and boys as raging horndogs who'll cherish any sexual contact with any woman that it's counter-intuitive to think she's done something wrong. On the other hand, I also remember being a teenage boy and being so much more attracted to my classmates than my teachers it didn't matter at the time if the latter had all the attributes; superficial and otherwise; that I find more attractive *now*. I don't know if my teachers offering more lenient grading in exchange for sex might have made me go for it anyway, and maybe regret it. And I certainly don't want to create a condition in which that becomes a widespread risk.

&#x200B;

So I guess this boils down to 4 main questions.

&#x200B;

A. Did the public *really* side with LaFave and LeTourneau as much as they seemed to have, or did the media just have a perverse incentive to make it *seem* like that?

&#x200B;

B. If the ""former"" of A, did the public have a genuine change of heart or are they just backpedalling?

&#x200B;

C. If the ""latter"" of A, why isn't the public doing more about a media that supposedly misrepresented them?

&#x200B;

D. Is there anything else I'm missing here?"

I wasn't a ***huge*** fan of Dragon Ball, but it was cool. I watched it all through once, a few of the movies, and I enjoyed it. It was during my anime phase. I don't watch anime regularly anymore (or TV at for that matter).. Now fast forward and I have a girlfriend of 6 months. When we started dating we talked about our past relationships. Her previous boyfriend was awful to her and the final straw was threatening to rape her... I do what I can to not think about that.

Anyways, we were talking before and either the topic of anime or DBZ came up and she had made a reference to something, but thus far she had never mentioned she was interested in anime. So I asked something like ""Was that a Dragon Ball reference? You watch anime?"" and she says ""No but I watched the latest movie."" I said ""Oh, on your own or did you go with someone?"" to which she said ""My ex."" I said ""I gotcha"" and we continued talking, but almost immediately I had a bad taste for Dragon Ball whenever I see or hear anything about it because it reminds me of her ex.

As I type this out it does sound ridiculous because I also know some great guys who watch DBZ, and the biggest reason, I'm just associating two things that don't really belong together, but I've had this on my mind and wanted to share.

Some Asian individuals don‚Äôt abide by these customs, an example of which is my family.

I respect the fact that it isn‚Äôt taboo to call others out for their physical appearances (fat, skin color, etc. although not in a negative way) and eat non-standard meats (dogs, cats, scorpions, live animals (like squids), etc. These are some freedoms that Western culture restricts because they are deemed taboo.

However, when it comes to the social mindset, Asians are far behind Westerners.

In Asia, they emphasize the intellectual superiority of the old and the intellectual inferiority of the young. The old is said to be mote capable due to their experience, however, they are stuck in an outdated mindset that doesn‚Äôt adapt well to the current society. This created a culture of conservatism where societal development is slower than in other regions.

Asian families are also quite authoritarian and see their children as extensions of themselves instead of another human being. Thus, they try to control their children‚Äôs life into being tools to strengthen the family. This type of authoritarian parenting leads to low esteem, poor critical thinking skills, and low self-value. These are all negative traits brought by Asian authoritarian parenting.

Asian society values societal conformity in which everyone is expected to follow the norms of the society. This leads to a lack of diversity and creativity as everyone seeks to be the standard of society instead of something different.

Asian culture is also extremely hierarchical and many people seek to exploit the benefits they have. Bosses often force their employees to work overtime for little pay so they could gain more profits. If they don‚Äôt do so, the employees will be fired. Parents often force their kids to be moulded into what they want their children to be like. If they don‚Äôt do so, there‚Äôs the threat of abandonment. As opposed to Western companies and families, their employees and children enjoy more social freedoms.

Asian education is also extremely poor. It focuses on memorization to solve tests rather than creativity and logic which could be used in real life scenarios unlike the things you have to remember for the tests. The reason why so many Asians go to the West for education is because Asian education sucks and is backwards. South Korean and Japanese education is also like this and this is inexcusable since these countries are as rich as European ones.

Overall, although there are many merits in Asian culture such as the artistic value, the mythology, the fashion, etc. I feel like Asian social values are inferior to Western values.  "
1,2023-07-18,CMV: Congress needs to make a law dictating when life of a child/fetus begins,u/Final-Explorer-8210,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1531sfo/cmv_congress_needs_to_make_a_law_dictating_when/,changemyview,"We need to put an end to arguments once and for all.

1,2023-07-18,"CMV: The use of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in humans poses ethical dilemmas that outweigh its potential benefits, especially given the risk of unintentional changes to the human gene pool",u/Federal_Penalty5832,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1533tl1/cmv_the_use_of_crisprcas9_gene_editing_in_humans/,changemyview,"I've been delving into the complexities of genetic engineering for quite some time now, particularly the revolutionary technique of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 gene editing. Despite its promise in rectifying genetic disorders and improving overall human health, I maintain that the ethical quandaries and potential risks associated with its application in humans outstrip its potential benefits.

My reservations can be primarily categorized into three domains:

**Ethical Implications: Embarking on a journey to modify the human genome may lead us into the abyss of designer babies, potentially deepening socioeconomic divides. Wealthy individuals might be able to afford 'enhancements' for their offspring, such as augmented intelligence or athletic prowess. This could lead to a stratified society divided not only by wealth and opportunity but by genetic superiority.**

*""Isn't it fair to say we've always used technology to modify our environment, our bodies, even our very selves?""*

Modifying our environment or using tools doesn't compare to altering the very blueprint of life, our DNA. There's a stark difference between enhancement via external means (e.g., eyeglasses, internet) and altering our inherent genetic makeup. The former can be reversed or modified; the latter is permanent and heritable.

*""Inequality exists in society irrespective of genetic modification.""*

True, but wouldn't adding genetic disparity into the mix exacerbate this inequality exponentially? If left unchecked, we might create a dystopian society where the 'genetically enhanced' form a superior class, a notion fundamentally opposing our ideals of equality and justice. Thus, isn't prevention better than cure?

**Potential for Unforeseen Consequences: The precise long-term consequences of gene editing in humans are unknown. If we make heritable changes, these alterations will be passed onto subsequent generations. Unintended effects could manifest over time and may be irreversible, impacting the human gene pool in unpredictable ways. Moreover, a greater understanding of the role of ""junk DNA"" and epigenetics makes clear that alterations to one part of the genome can have a ripple effect.**

*""The unknown is always a part of scientific progress.""*

No doubt, but the unknown in this case could lead to irrevocable changes to the human gene pool. It's a risk of catastrophic proportions. Sure, once upon a time, the long-term effects of electricity, nuclear energy, and even the internet were unknown, but none had the potential to alter our species at a fundamental level. Do we risk such profound implications on the basis of an 'unknown'?

*""With rigorous testing, modeling, and protocols, the risk of unintended consequences can be mitigated.""*

We're dealing with complex systems here, where even a single genetic alteration can have unforeseen consequences due to the interconnected nature of our genome. Is it worth taking a gamble with the human gene pool?

**Informed Consent: As of now, it's impossible for a yet-unborn individual to consent to have their genes altered. If the modifications lead to negative consequences, the issue of violation of the person's rights arises. The decision made by parents or scientists could thus impose lifelong implications on an individual who had no say in the matter.**

*""By that logic, shouldn't we also condemn decisions made on behalf of children in numerous other scenarios?""*

The difference here is the degree and nature of the potential impact. Medical procedures or vaccinations have immediate, observable effects, and the benefits outweigh the risks. They're undertaken for the individual's immediate benefit, not for speculative, possible advantages that gene editing could bring. Is it ethical to meddle with an individual's genetic makeup, a core part of their identity, without their consent?

I'm aware that gene-editing technology, particularly CRISPR-Cas9, holds immense potential in eradicating genetic diseases and improving human health in ways we can't yet fully comprehend. However, I contend that the moral and societal implications, coupled with the risk of irrevocable changes to the human gene pool, significantly overshadow these prospective benefits.

The problem isn't merely 'navigating' ethical concerns but the fact that our actions might permanently alter the human species. This isn't a challenge we can simply overcome and move on from if things go awry.

The potential benefits of gene editing are enormous, no doubt. But do these prospective benefits justify the profound moral, societal, and biological risks it poses?

I'm open to alternative viewpoints and would welcome a robust debate around this subject. If you think my apprehensions are unfounded or overemphasized, please attempt to change my view."

Seriously, you need to rake in $120,000 AFTER taxes just to scrape by, and that's setting the bar low. The weight of value-added tax, city tax, and state tax crush any hope of financial stability and security for the future. The dream of having three kids and a cozy home? Comfortable retirement in the city? Yeah, that's more like an unattainable fantasy.

And don't even get me started on housing costs. They devour over half of your yearly income, leaving you cramped in these claustrophobic spaces that barely pass as a room. You can forget about finding peace and solace there. Noise pollution infiltrates every nook and cranny, robbing you of a clean, safe, and warm sanctuary to call home.

Food hype in this city: It's baffling to see people going gaga over overpriced restaurants. Personally, I'd rather whip up a healthy meal in the comfort of my own kitchen. I mean, seriously, what's the obsession with eating out all the time? Does a city really need 800 flavors of rice you can splurge on every day to make you decide to live here?

And don't even get me started on grocery shopping. Buying healthy food here costs $$$$. And to top it off, forget the convenience of loading up your car with groceries like a normal person. No, no, you get the privilege of waiting outside a Whole Foods for half an hour and trying to carry what you can through the subway.

Speaking of which, let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe subway system is a hot mess. It's dirty, dangerous, and you're guaranteed encounters with homeless folks, drug addicts, and downright dangerous individuals EVERY TIME you ride it. Harassment and assault become part of your daily commute, making minding your own business feel like a Herculean task. I had to commute through the 7 and 6 trains going up to the Bronx to go to college, and each stop going North gets worse and worse with weirder people boarding.

Let‚Äôs talk about the ""hot spots"" in Manhattan. What's there to do on a regular night for a regular guy? Oh, right, be some alcoholic drunkard at a bar, stuff your face at overpriced joints, or wait in never-ending lines just to get into an overcrowded nightclub. How is that a vibrant social scene?

And those tourist attractions they rave about‚Äîmuseums, Broadway shows, and such‚Äîdon't even get me started. Who has the time and money to go to them every single week? Yeah, I know, free passes for some, blablabla, but there aren‚Äôt 1000 different museums so let‚Äôs not pretend it‚Äôs an otherworldly new experience each time. Living outside the city and visiting them occasionally makes way more sense. Yet, the cost of indulging in these activities adds to the already overwhelming financial strain.

And let's not forget about the precious commodity called free time. The average worker in this city hardly has any of it to spare! You grind your way from 8 AM to 6 PM, desperately trying to make ends meet. And what do you get in return? Two hours to grab some food, either wasting time dining out or wasting money on unhealthy bodega junk. Or you drink until 1 AM, then repeat the same shit at 6 AM.

Doesn't it sound like a dream come true? The monotony, the lack of time, the perpetual exhaustion‚Äîit's like living in a twisted reality where you're constantly chasing your own tail.

Let's not forget Manhattan itself. It's becoming just a sea of chain restaurants and stores. Sketchers, McDonald's, Starbucks‚Äîyou name it‚Äîall the same suburban crap but with outrageous price tags. You used to be able to find niche places that only existed within the depths, but it‚Äôs rapidly becoming the town square of some town in Illinois.

If you dare to escape to upstate or hit the beach, get ready for more train rides accompanied by the unsettling presence of creepy and dangerous homeless individuals. Oh, and now you have to rent a car, which translates to even more hard-earned cash down the drain.

Honestly, the argument that the average white-collar worker will enjoy a good life in this city is laughable. The financial burdens, suffocating living spaces, hazardous transportation, and mind-boggling costs for basic needs and leisure activities make any sense of comfort and well-being seem like a distant dream."

My only 5 year old vehicle uses r-134a. It's ""just"" a greenhouse gas, but it's being phased out. I fear it too will become difficult to find before the vehicle's life is over. Yet I highly doubt private jets and yachts will go away first.

The attack on Monday came from underwater drone strikes run by the SBU, a unit of Ukraine's military. These NATO-provided sea based drones were launched around 3 AM. Ukraine immediately took credit for the terror attack. Why would Ukraine be attacking Crimea when the counteroffensive is nowhere near there? Crimea voted to join Russia in 2014 because of threats by the SBU.

""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"".

IMO, I think people confuse average looking with unattractive.

I've been around that have mentioned how they weren't initially attracted to their other, but that they grew to love them over time.  

I asked if she thought he was ugly?.  

To which she replied, ""No, of course not!.  He just wasn't my type"".  

I then asked, 

""What if he had an amazing heart, was kind, but say he resembled.....Jason Voorhees for instance?"".

Her response was....

""Well no of course not, there has to be some initial physical attraction.

So I'll stand by my view and say,

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder for average people and above,

154,2023-07-18,"CMV: The reason that American right-wingers are obsessed with ""groomers"" is that actual grooming of minors for sexual abuse is really common in right-wing institutions such as churches and private schools.",u/fubo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/153cnl4/cmv_the_reason_that_american_rightwingers_are/,changemyview,"""Groomer"" has become a default accusation used by right-wingers against people they don't like, especially LGBTQ+ people. In gist, the accusation is that someone is ""grooming"" children for sexual abuse; i.e. setting children up to be sexually abused. This accusation has been leveled against innocent teachers, librarians, performers, and many other people in social roles that involve working with children.

This accusation is typically both false and utterly baseless.

But why do they use this specific accusation? Why focus on ""grooming"" rather than other traditional accusations such as Satanic child sacrifice, cannibalism, or the classic ""Black Mass""?

The underlying reason is that right-wingers have life experience with right-wing institutions, such as evangelical churches and private religious schools ... and in those institutions, actual ""grooming"" and sexual abuse of children is extremely common.

Many of today's adult right-wingers were sexually abused as children, or had childhood friends who were. This was usually by perpetrators with a trusted social role, such as family members, youth pastors, or religious teachers.

In the United States, many modern right-wing institutions only date to the Reagan era (the 1980s), when many of today's parents were themselves young children. At that time, those people were kids who spent a lot of time in churches and schools run by what became the American religious far-right. And those institutions were chock-full of sexual abusers.

As a result, American right-wingers are unusually likely to have trauma related to sexual abuse. They are primed to watch out for it, for good reason ‚Äî but their vigilance has been displaced away from the institutions where they or their friends were actually abused, and their abusers were protected.

Instead of locating sexual abuse as a church and school problem, which occurs specifically in places that adults have total control over children, they have been taught to locate it as as an LGBTQ+ problem instead.

Actual public-school librarians are unlikely to be grooming children for sexual abuse. But right-wing youth-pastors are *very likely* to be doing that. The accusation of ""groomer"" applied to the librarian is a deflection away from accusing the actual church youth-pastor who really abused a child."

1,2023-07-18,CMV: Copyright and Trademark Infringement Goes Too Far in terms of Reselling,u/Accomplished_Race_39,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/153dw68/cmv_copyright_and_trademark_infringement_goes_too/,changemyview,"I'd like to start off by saying  I understand that the law is not on the individual's side. I am questioning the validity/morality of these laws. I will be using Pokemon as an example, but I am not claiming they are especially strict with these things, I am just using them because I am so very familiar with Pokemon products. I am not even sure if this is something that they enforce.

I have personally been selling official Pokemon TCG products for the past few years. I've been wanting to expand my selection beyond just cards, so I started selling official Pokemon pins. I quickly realized that there is VERY little variety when it comes to official pins considering there are now over 1,000 total Pokemon. I'm talking less than 10% of all Pokemon have ever had an official pin of them made.

Because of this, there exist many, many knock off Pokemon pins of varying quality. The vast majority of these knock offs are sold on sites like Aliexpress and most of these are Pokemon that do not currently have an official pin of them made. For example, if someone wants an Electabuzz Pokemon pin and they search it up on the Pokemon Center website and they find that no such pin exists, then they buy nothing. No sale for the Pokemon company. However, if they search it up on Etsy, they are likely to find an off brand Electabuzz pin and purchase it. Same result, no sale for Nintendo. However... I would argue that if this is this person's first ever pin that they purchased (Which they ONLY purchased because of a knock off Electabuzz existing because it's their favorite Pokemon or whatever), they may very well get into pin collecting and in the future purchase several official Pokemon pins. I am arguing it actively helps the Pokemon company financially.

So this makes me question...how is it wrong/hurting the Pokemon company in any way if a knock off Pokemon pin (A Pokemon that the Pokemon company has never made and does NOT sell) is sold by someone unaffiliated? On top of only about 10% or less of all Pokemon having an official pin, less than 1% of them are CURRENTLY being sold. The pins are made specifically with the Pokemon Trading Card Game in mind, meaning that when a Pokemon TCG set goes out of print, so too do the pins. This means that Nintendo/Pokemon is no longer selling or making money off of these pins. Off the top of my head, I can only think of 8 pins that are currently being made and sold by the Pokemon company. There are probably a few I am forgetting, but worst case scenario, that's at most 20 out of 1,015 total Pokemon that are currently being sold as pins.

For those 8-20 Pokemon that the Pokemon company is currently selling pins of, I FULLY agree with them having the ability to shutdown any store that is selling those same Pokemon but knock off versions of and being removed for infringement because I can see how that could hurt sales. I am not at all opposed to that. What I AM opposed to is Pokemon that have existed for 10+ years and have never had a single pin of them made and the Pokemon company having no intention of EVER making pins of them, yet still they strike down stores that sell them. Once again, not claiming the Pokemon company does this, just using them as an example for similar situations that other companies like Disney would most definitely do. Imagine an unpopular Disney character that appeared in 1 single 30 year old movie and never had a single product of them made, but then a store on Etsy makes an enamel pin of them and Disney gets them permanently banned from the website and potentially sues the person.

At the very least, I think there should be something in place where if a company hasn't sold a product in over 5 years or so AND they do not have any intention of selling it within the next few months or something, they should not be allowed to remove it unless they feel it damages their brand (Like a Pokemon holding up the middle finger or something). I do also believe to further protect the Pokemon company, all resellers should be required by law to state whether the product they are selling is official or not and give credit to the copyright holder if it's not official. I am sure there are further improvements and protections that could be made, but that is not what I am here to discuss. I simply wanted to express why I think the currents laws go too far, but I am entirely open to having my view changed."

I am from New York City, where right on red is forbidden within the five boroughs, and it surprised me when I moved elsewhere in the US and it‚Äôs the norm.

In urban areas, when drivers are focused on looking to see if any traffic is coming to their left, they are blind to a person starting to cross the street or a bike in a bike lane, set off or otherwise. Moreover, they try to turn even when they do see you, and I‚Äôve found myself needing to block a two ton hunk of metal with my sentient flesh bag if I‚Äôm to cross the street. Drivers seem less likely to fulfill an obligation to yield if they aren‚Äôt going up against another car. And I feel like I always have to be on high alert even when I have the right to cross.  

Even given the best faith, a motorist often needs to enter the crosswalk to even see that a car is coming. Because there is no blanket area ban, drivers will in my experience turn right even when there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúNo Right on Red‚Äù sign, whether because they didn‚Äôt see it, out of habit, or because the usual ability to do it makes them feel that they always should. Those people would be liable if anything were to happen, but that wouldn‚Äôt undo the damage. 

When I‚Äôve been on a moped in front of someone at a stoplight, I have had drivers get visibly annoyed with me that I wouldn‚Äôt compromise my safety to get out of their way because they wanted to turn. Not only does this happen where there is a single lane, but the extreme right one is where I‚Äôm supposed to be when there is more than one. While that might be able to be separated out as a separate issue related to the right of two wheeled vehicles to take a one, it is one that would also not exist if everyone abided by the same directions regardless of whether one is turning or not.

I sort of understand why right on red exists on suburban and rural roads, but I‚Äôm not sure what utility that having right on red provides that having sensors on stoplights would not provide, as long as the cost isn‚Äôt prohibitive. I could see wanting to cut down on emissions from idling, but it seems to me like I‚Äôm an urban area with a higher volume of cars that this would not actually meaningfully encourage traffic flow because of motorists with the right of way, and when there are fewer cars that the effect would be negligible.  Why have a situation where a road indicator changes given the circumstance, unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary?"

I think i improved myself and become better, so i managed to have girls in my life so right now i clearly see how a person approach me right now and how they approached me previously

But im still average, so i had this childhood friend that she stayed her whole high school to another country and came back to start her uni so we started to hang around. We always were connected, with socials so.. I confessed and got refused. things went weird and we are not talking to each other anymore.

I felt in love and i was delusional because she was enough pretty for me, while i wasn't for her so for her i was just a friend.

Im watching this new tv series the summer i turned pretty that sums pretty well what im talking about. The summer the protagonist turned pretty, her childhood friend started to fight to get her, but if she would have never turned pretty well..

For example, imagine a summer where u are forced to go to some rural area around the nature without any party, young people, clubs nothing, just boring old people and adults. If you encounter the sex u are attracted too and both the people are gorgeous this is the start of a incredible and romantic summer that both of them will always remember but if one of them is ugly, for the good looking one, it still would be a boring summer 

And it's just so sad that everything works around looks. But it doesnt stop here.

Even if nothing romantic will happen, looks still matter and works also in friendship. When you wanna plan something to do, obviously you plan to invite the best looking one

And i think im right because i did the same thing. As people over my league did this to me, i did the same with people lower my league and so on.

Only because i got hurt, im understanding this superficial thing that matters in our relationships between humans and it sucks. an anime called ""lookism"" summarizes this concept well. Good looking people and bad looking people lives in two separate world

This is partially a legal view and partially a moral one.

In my view, unless you get a paternity test, you accepted that a child is yours and that is that. You legally declared yourself as the father, and are therefor responsible for their financial well being. Morally, you have told that child you are her father and you are now responsible for their emotional well being now.

Say you find out the child isn‚Äôt yours. On the legal side, I say you still have to support that child. You could have asked for a paternity test but you didn‚Äôt, so you agreed you were legally responsible for the child until they are 18. I don‚Äôt believe that people should be legally compelled to visit that child because it‚Äôs bad for the kid if their parent hates them, but you are still financially responsible.

On the moral side, if you abandon the child you are a selfish, bad person. You agreed when you claimed the title as father that you‚Äôd take care of and be responsible for the innocent child who has no part in their mother‚Äôs crime. If you have a ten year old you‚Äôve bathed, loved, played ball with, etc and you walk off because of DNA? Shitty person and I wouldn‚Äôt associate with someone that cold. You never loved that kid in the first place.

I would say a grace period of say six months after birth is reasonable for the father to decide if he wants to dispute paternity. After that, you are the father and that‚Äôs that. 

Also in my view for this all to work the mother is not allowed to legally refuse paternity tests. She can possibly even be held responsible legally in some way for defrauding the guy, but the fact remains the child is innocent in all of this and a man agreed to be the father."

Whenever people are discussing the pros and cons of poly, nobody will ever bring up a lack of stability as a con. Many will even bristle if you suggest that it's less stable. They will point out that mono relationships end just as frequently. But I think a relationship can be unstable without actually ending

Because here's the thing -- I've seen many people on r/polyamory say that you're naive if you think your partner getting a new partner won't have any effect on your relationship. They'll suddenly have less time and energy for you, and will suddenly be experiencing NRE with a new person, and you're just going to have to roll with that

What would you call that if not instability?

And sure, other life events, such as a new job, medical issues, the birth of a child, etc can happen in mono relationships, and also cause instability. But usually these are changes that are happening *around* your relationship, not in the actual structure or expectations of your relationship

And just to be clear, I'm not saying that poly is bad. It can have many benefits -- ie: freedom, broader communal support, a chance to explore yourself emotionally/sexually, not having to cut off outside relationships, etc. I just don't see why no one acknowledges this as a con

To enforce this, I am going to borrow from Tom and Jerry and suggest it be done in a similar way to how Spike protects Jerry from Tom's abuse in several episodes, but instead of a whistle, the teen/young adult should be given a fingerprint-reading ankle bracelet that is almost impossible to remove or tamper with without setting off an alarm, which the teen/young adult can touch to notify the authorities that the parents are trying to stand in the way of their relationship.

Every time the bracelet is touched by the teen, a police officer will show up to check on the teen/young adult and demand a fine of 10% of the sum total of the parents' monthly income, plus the expense of sending out the police officer, requiring the parents to hand the cop cash, a check, or scan their card on a reader.

The parents would also be forbidden from kicking out their young adult child once this system of enforcement kicks in to prevent them from simply using that as a threat.

This would also have the benefit of bringing in more revenue for the government, and would result in a less bigoted society. Personally, all I see are positives, but I want outside perspectives on this before I go forward with advocating it."

In most big cities there is a rather big drug problem, particularly in the homeless community. Obviously that is not good and we need to address this. 

However, what is sending a drug addict to jail going to do? To me it seems like a temporary solution to keep drug addicts off the streets. But it is not a permanent solution and it is not addressing the root of the problem so they 90% of the time will go back to drugs after being released from jail. 

Not to mention drug related arrests are many times racially motivated and target primarily POC, who use marijuana or other low cost drugs while wealthy white people can easily get away with using drugs. There is a sort of ‚Äúimage‚Äù of who drug addicts are when the reality is many people use drugs and are heavily reliant on them, just some people have the privilege of being able to hide it better. That‚Äôs a whole other conversation though. 

There is an emphasis on personal use, because anyone who sells and distributes drugs to others should still be subject to legal action. 

I‚Äôm actually very open to other arguments. It‚Äôs a pretty complex issue I‚Äôm back and forth between based on how bad Portland has gotten since decriminalizing drugs (although Portland has had issues with drugs/homeless for a while) and while California has not decriminalized drugs, San Francisco has basically stopped enforcing most laws so it‚Äôs pretty bad there too. But I also don‚Äôt want to base my opinion on 2 big cities so would love to see some counter arguments."
1,2023-07-19,CMV: Gender is best thought of as EXTERNALLY defined,u/SaddleWasTaken,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/153lse3/cmv_gender_is_best_thought_of_as_externally/,changemyview,"Rising in popularity is the idea of self-ID around gender; you are what you say you are. For example, anyone who identifies as a woman is, in fact, a woman. Gender is INTERNALLY defined, and immune to outside scrutiny.

This line of thinking is inaccurate to how gender actually works in society, and turns gender into a useless concept.

Merriam Webster defines gender as ""the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with one sex."" This definition is easily applicable to the real world; we can say, for example, that men tend to express emotions like sadness less (a behavioral trait), and are rarely interested in rom-com movies (a cultural trait). So, although the concept of ""man"" is nebulous, and you don't need to have EVERY male characteristic to be a man, we can say that a person who is reserved about their sadness and prefers action films to romance films is more likely to be a man/more masculine.

Building from this, a transgender person is someone whose gender differs from their sex. A trans man, for example, is born female, but genuinely possesses the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with men. This means that if someone who identifies as a trans man acts very feminine in every way, they are not, in fact, a man/trans man at all.

So, who decides what traits are masculine and what traits are feminine? Part of gender is simply objective - it is a scientific truth that biological males have the psychological trait of being more aggressive, for instance, making aggression a masculine trait. Significant parts of gender, however, such as fashion and style, are socially constructed, meaning SOCIETY has a role in deciding what traits are masculine and feminine. The latter pretty much comes down to consensus; if most people feel that long hair is feminine, then it is, in fact, feminine.

So, the traits of each gender, and, by extension, what gender *you* are based on what traits you have, are decided by a) objective observation, and b) societal consensus, both of which are external factors. Self-ID is irrelevant.

To change my view, explain how self-ID may play a greater role in determining a person's gender, or how thinking of gender as self-determined is more beneficial to society."

You see this all the time on Reddit - gifted kids burn out. Gifted kids never learn how to study. Apparently, intelligence in earlier years curses you to never develop a work ethic and freeze in your late teens or early twenties. The stories from former ‚Äúgifted kids‚Äù are legion. They were gifted all the way up until Grade 10, at which point they realised they hadn‚Äôt learned the value of hard work and now they relish in mediocrity and relish in the nostalgia of having read at a Grade 4 level at Grade 2.

Except that‚Äôs not really true is it. IQ has been shown to be at least somewhat if not strongly genetic, and correlated to later life income as well as lifespan. No, this isn't me making a scientific racism argument. No, this isn't me saying that a low IQ person can never succeed, or that a high IQ person can't fail. But there are strong trends.

If you were told you were gifted and ended up turning out completely average, odds are you just weren‚Äôt all that gifted, dumbass. The vast majority of people I know in high powered careers such as medicine were gifted kids, not average people who learned the secret value of hard work.

No one looks at LeBron James being a humongous tall motherfucker and say ‚Äúhe never learned the value of jumping‚Äù. But with intelligence, that‚Äôs tied to our self esteem so people start making up silly stories so we don‚Äôt have to accept that some people just won the genetic lottery there and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. You can work hard, but so can they, and they‚Äôll turn out better.

1. irresponsible pet owners

many people, especially first time pet owners, are not very responsible. before even getting a pet, many pet owners are not fully aware of the level of responsibility they were about to take on. many did not have the time money or energy to take care of said pet. this leads to two harms. first to pet owners who are now stuck with a pet they cannot take care of. further still one must also consider the people they live with like roommates ,partners, children so on and so forth. many inconsiderate first time pet owners do not even consider those they already live with what more a pet. second, to the pets themselves are often stuck living in adverse conditions. many with pet owners that cannot or will not take care of them. remember, that pets cannot advocate for themselves. and thus are often stuck in those situations.

2. agency

many pet owners argue that the pets love them unconditionally regardless of the situation. this argument falls flat for one simple reason. pets do not have agency. one must remember, at the end of the day,no matter how you spin it, a pet is servile and the owner its master. they live and die, by your word, by your hand. it has to love you because they need you. of course a dog loves you it has been bred for thousands of years to love you. the part of their DNA that couldnt love has been removed through selective breeding. they do not have a choice."

Russia withdrew from the grain deal, which was brokered by the UN and Turkey in July 2022 to allow Ukraine to export grain from three Black Sea ports, yesterday (Monday, July 17).  
  
In a statement, Russia‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticised that over 70% of total exports under the initiative went to high-income and upper-middle income countries.  
  
The implementation of the deal and the agreement with the UN to facilitate the unimpeded export of Russian food and fertiliser to global markets has been ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù, the ministry said.  
  
    
**Black Sea Grain Initiative**  
Following Russia‚Äôs withdrawal from the deal, president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed the continuation of the initiative in a ‚Äútrilateral format‚Äù.  
  
President Zelenskyy made the proposal to continue the deal without Russia in a letter sent to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres.  
  
‚ÄúUkraine, the UN and Turkey can jointly ensure the operation of the food corridor and the inspection of vessels,‚Äù the president of Ukraine said on Twitter.  
  
Guterres said Russia‚Äôs decision ‚Äúwill strike a blow to people in need everywhere‚Äù, and stressed that the ‚Äúgoal must continue to be enhancing global food security and global food price stability‚Äù.  
  
‚ÄúWe will stay fixed on finding pathways for solutions. There is simply too much at stake in a hungry and hurting world,‚Äù the UN secretary-general said.  
  
Grain exports  
China has been the main destination for cargo exports of Ukrainian grain at 8 million tonnes, followed by Spain at 6 million tonnes and Turkey at 3.2 million tonnes.  
  
The grain deal has allowed the World Food Programme (WFP) to transport more than 725,000t of wheat to Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, the UN said.

I'm aged 18 (birthday Tommorow woo), so I will admit my life experience is little to none compared to most, and I do understand this post is going to have a lot of preconceived notions, but I feel as though I keep getting this nagging feeling in my mind. 

The feeling that, people today really just don't try enough to succeed in life.

Let me give some background on myself first.

I live in rural West Virginia, my mother is an immigrant from germany who moved here shortly after the reunion of East and West germany, and for all my life I've been poor. I'm the youngest of course, and well life's been a rollercoaster of step father's that never worked out, and subsequent unfortunate situations.

I took drugs in my senior year of high school, I hanged around with the wrong crowds, my grades dropped significantly, I hated life, everything felt awful, but one thing was apparent, I **always** blamed it on something else. It was always the fact I was born poor, or I lived in a shit hole with no opportunities, I was in a food dessert so that's why I was overweight, school systems are bad here which is why I'm failing. Which if you look at it from a very simplistic view, it's true. If I grew up rich, in a city, had a private school, had opportunities for fresh food, I would be much better off now, wouldn't i? But recently my life has been improving massively, and I turned my life around completely, I took life seriously, got into community college, got accepted into state university for my dream cyber security program (coming soon :D), learned to budget and save money, and got a 16.50$ an hour job (which is really good for rural West Virginia standars) and started helping out my mom more in life so she can enjoy nice things. I've even taken across the world trips for vacations, and hope to move to another country someday. Got accepted to 3 fucking amazing scholarships, Oh and I lost like 30 pounds. And I dedicate it all too getting that damn chip off my shoulder. I destroyed my grades, hurt my career in high school, nearly ruined my life and blamed everything on other things, when In reality? It was just me.

Now to get into the actual point here *ahem*, I think it's ridiculous in life hearing people bitch and moan about their excuses for this and that, I'd consider myself extremely empathetic, I'll always support you when you're down, thanks to online animonity though I can speak my mind a bit and be more straightforward. If you want to improve your life, stop falling into the mindset everything around you is the problem, the only thing you can do to change your life, no matter how bad it is, is to get it together and try hsrder, because I truly believe everyone in America can make it to a goal, with their mind in the right place, it might be tommorow, it might be next week, or next year, big or small. I believe that everyone can do it, and you can be that beautiful person you want to be. Obviously that's over optimistic, and there's always going to be failures in society, but I just hate the victim mentality so much now, and maybe some of you can change my view. It feels like to no end people always look for something to blame their mistakes on, when you just have to own it and keep going, no matter your circumstances."

Same thing with [pesticides](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-019-0488-0).  
  
That's because the U.S. tends to take a more reactive approach towards regulating food and beverage ingredients, instead of proactive. Only additives proven to be non-harmful are approved for use in Europe, while in the U.S. food additives are innocent until proven guilty.  
  
I believe this is a safety hazard to us all and to any country that buys our food. Just as American brands still sell their products in Europe, using different ingredients, [they could adapt and use those same ingredients here too.](https://foodbabe.com/app/uploads/2019/02/U.S.-vs.-Uk-quaker-oats-packets.jpg)

Almost all of the processing that occurs to food after it's pull off a tree our out of the ground somehow makes it unhealthy. Namely, when you break down the structure of the food, it creates something your body metabolizes more quickly, causing a blood sugar spike, as compared to the natural state when your body naturally breaks it down. 

In response to red meat and cow milk, veggie burgers and oat milk are becoming popular, but both are bad for you in their own ways, because of the additives and culinary trickery they have to pull to make something that is not meat or milk, seem like meat or milk. 

I have a feeling that eventually the fast food restaurants will have a reputation similar to ""big tobacco"", where we think back on the existence of ""food courts"", where there were twenty delicious choices to help you get fat and die early, and just one or two genuinely balanced food options. 

The reason things can't stay like this in perpetuity is rising health care costs associated with obesity, but also because the evolution of food as it is, seems untenable. Once you realize real milk is bad, and you realize that all of the fake milk is also bad, where do you go from there? 

In countries where they have fewer weight and food related health issues, they have more limited food options as a matter of culture and economics, and I think in time we will regress/progress to be more like parts of the world where there are inherently fewer food choices. 

As electric transport and automation become more advanced, the man power and energy cost of delivering fresh produce into population centers might naturally mean less reliance on preservatives, and more availability to food that's healthy and tastes satisfying at the same time."

A lot of these discussions lead to the other person stating that billionaires and large corporations are responsible for the vast majority of pollution in the world so our efforts aren't worth it.

While I do agree that it is important to acknowledge that rich corporations contribute a large (~70%) portion of total global emissions, we also need to talk about individual emissions.

Making a yearly salary of $100,000 puts you in the top 10% wealthiest earners in the world. This isn't something that is acknowledged a lot in western countries like the USA or UK. We are surrounded by wealth all the time. These top 10% earners contribute 50% of total individual global emissions. What would those in poor third world countries think? Perhaps that *we* should lower our CO2 footprints? Perhaps that their actions are futile toward the goal of helping the environment?

My point is that it is just ignorant to simply blame the rich and feel no sense of agency when it comes to the world's global warming issues. Everyone needs to do their part by reducing the pollution they contribute, and we need to vote to enact policies that restrict the amount of pollution large corporations can produce."

Here are the TOS that were provided during my ban:
>It is a violation of Reddit's sitewide rules against hate to do or encourage others to do any of the following: State or imply that trans (wo)men aren't (wo)men or that people aren't the gender they identify as. Criticize, mock, disagree with, defy, or refuse to abide by people's pronoun requests. State or imply that gender dysphoria or being LGBTQ+ is a mental illness, a mental disorder, a delusion, not normal, or unnatural. State or imply that LGBTQ+ enables pedophilia or grooming or that. LGBTQ+ individuals are more likely to engage in pedophilia or grooming. State or imply that LGB should be separate from the T+. State or imply that gender is binary

My comment did nothing of the sort. It is factually correct that the definition of the word woman was changed in order to include trans women.

https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/12/15/us/cambridge-dictionary-woman-definition-trans-cec/index.html

There is absolutely nothing within the statement ""the definition of woman has changed recently"" that would breach the TOS related to trans inclusion. Stating that the definition changed does not imply that trans women are not women. In fact, it implies the opposite, that by definition trans women are now women. The social definition changed a few years ago to include trans women and the dictionary definition changed less than a year ago yet making this claim is causing people to be banned from reddit. I do not think this is right, and I believe this to be reddits way of removing discourse from only one side on an incredibly politicized highly disputed train of thought regarding trans people. So much so that it actually hurts trans people.

I'll give an example. Let's say someone states: ""trans women arent women"" and you respond ""well actually the definition of woman has changed to encompass trans women"". Now both the OP and the respondent have been banned from reddit. This means someone who is pro trans was banned from reddit for being anti-trans. This hurts the trans ideology as a whole.

I'm open to understanding why it would be reasonable to ban anyone who states the fact that that definition of the word woman has changed but I can't currently see how that makes sense. Make it make sense and earn a delta."

2. French government does not condone religion and therefore helpful to society. For example, in the US South many states try to post the Ten Commandments on public property, abstinence only education and teach creationism. 

3.  Religious minorities still are allowed to worship their religion. In the USA , many states will go after minority religions  and minority groups discriminate against them.

1. Modern Day: obviously when women didn't have the right to vote, couldn't own property, couldn't have a bank account, etc. they were more disadvantaged. 

2. America: and most first world countries. The women getting kicked out of school by the Taliban are massively disadvantaged. 

3. Institutional: Women do still gave discrimination in America, but not by government backed institutions. Men face institutional discrimination through the draft, in courts (especially family courts), and higher education where men are an actively shrinking minority. Domestic abuse resources and homeless shelters ar far more available to women. There is no department of men's health. Women do face discrimination in their day to day, I don't deny that, sexual harassment for example is something that occurs far more often to women.

And I'll address a few things that I think will probably come up. A FAQ so to speak.

""The people discriminating against men are men themselves."" Domestic abuse is a good one to look at numbers for. It is initiated equally by men and women, 25 amd 25 percent. (The other half is mutual abuse). Even if that was true why should the identify of the perpeutor reflect in the care of the woman.

""Men have been the ruling class for thousands of years."" That is correct, but it isn't the case anymore. 

""The large amount of non institutional discrimination that exists for women makes up for the institutional discrimination men face."" First, that's a silly argument. You acknowledge that there's a problem but you don't want to solve it? Second, men face a lot of noninstitutionalized discrimination too. Homelessness blurs the line of what is institutionalized but men suffer at a far greater rate. The stoicism expected of American men has massive impacts on mental health reflected by men's far higher suicide rates."

1,2023-07-19,"CMV: Norah Vincent's psychological distress from living as a man is not evidence that life as a man is harder, but is evidence for the negative impacts of gender dysphoria.",u/Oishiio42,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/154ev7n/cmv_norah_vincents_psychological_distress_from/,changemyview,"Norah Vincent was not a trans man but she was a woman interested in gender and identity, and chronicled 18 months of her pretending to be a man through the help of make up, voice training, and participation in masculine activities and socializing. She wrote about her experience by authoring a book titled ""Self-Made Man"". Her experience taught her that she really likes being a woman and since then, viewed being a woman as more of a privilege, and gained a lot of sympathy for the struggles men go through, and claims that men do not have it any better than women.  
  
In manosphere circles, I will see this author, her experience and subsequent book cited as evidence intended to debunk feminist claims of patriarchy or male privilege. Norah described herself as a libertarian, did not view trans people as valid, was critical of multiculturism and postmodernism. Given her political views, I think she held a bias that would have prevented her from considering an extremely valid and obvious hypothesis that it's not being a man that was so stressful, but it was living as the wrong gender that was. Going out on a limb here, but I'm going to assume that those in the manosphere blog have a high correlation with people who are anti-trans as well, and therefore have this same bias, blinding them to this obvious conclusion.  
  
The main reason I think this is so obvious is just the lived experience of trans people, and the mental health and suicide rates of trans people who cannot access gender affirming care and are not accepted in society as valid. It is pretty well established that gender dysphoria is psychologically distressing and harmful.  
  
The other reason is the external experience of ""passing"" trans people. There are plentiful viewpoints from trans men who were socialized and treated as women, and trans women who were socialized and treated as men. They were treated one way before they were trans, and now that they ""pass"" as their gender, are treated the other way. They might not have the intrinsic experience of being both genders, but they do have the external one. They can speak to how society treats you different as a man, vs. as a woman. And I have seen accounts from both trans men and trans women, that they are treated more positively as a man.  
  
One other factor I think is relevant to her why her experience was stressful is homophobia/misogyny. Norah was a lesbian and considered herself ""butch"", but in her experiment as a man, was frequently clocked as a effeminate or gay man. I think it's reasonable to entertain the notion that some of her negative experience could have been influenced from being fully accepted as a man, or that her feminity that was peeking through at times was being viewed in a negative way, or leading to negative treatment.  
  
To change my view, you'd have to demonstrate that at least a significant portion of the psychologically harm from Norah's experience could not have stemmed from the instrinsic distress of living as the wrong gender, or from experiencing homophobia/misogyny from being considered gay or effeminate, but was in fact the same distress that real men experience just from being a man. Her hearing and empathizing with men who talked to her about their experience does not count towards her psychological distress unless she also experienced the same. And I will also need a good reason why I should consider Norah's experience a more valid representation of how living as a man is harder than all the trans people who have also experienced both saying that living as a man was easier."

They are sexy, and they don't get enough credit. People with fat bellies, stretch marks, big butts, and flabby arms. Cute chubby faces, squishy bodies, and squeezable selves.

Ok, here's the explanation: everyone knows skinny folks are hot. We get it - you have good BMI, you're fit as a fiddle, and the world is your oyster. I'm not taking that away from you - you deserve all the love and attention you get. You are beautiful. But the chubbies are slept-on. The squishies don't get enough credit. 

Here's why:

0) you are often sexy. I like the way some chub looks on you.

1) Your faces are just as pretty as the skinny folks. Most people like looking at a pretty face.

2) Your bodies are warm and soft and squeezable. People like squeezing soft things like pillows and stuffed animals, but then pretend they don't like chubby people.

Now you might say, hey being ""overweight"" is not good for your health and I'm attracted to healthy people. Well I say to you:

3) Skinny people are not all healthy. Have you seen a lot of dying people? They are often skinny.

4) Quote unquote healthy people also die every day. Just because you're ""healthy"" in terms of your body fat doesn't mean you are somehow a better equipped to survive this world. Mental health, diseases of nutrition, cancer, autoimmune diseases, car accidents... most causes of premature death are not related to a bit of chub. So stop acting like you'll live forever if you just eat the salad instead of the ice cream.

And finally the coup de gras. Please don't take offense at this.

5) Fit people can be stuck up and not approachable. This leads to a self-congratulatory self absorbed attitude in skinny people that is a HUGE turn off. We get it, you're desirable and you know it. Which is exactly what makes you un-desirable.

6) Fit people are uptight. Rules, regulations, can't eat that. Must work out. Life is not about enjoyment it's about doing the hard things necessary to be worthy. Well frankly I don't buy that -- like is to be lived on ones own terms. I refuse to be a prisoner of my body.

7) Skinny people are sometime judgemental and insecure. We get it, you don't want to be chubby - you're much too good to ever end up with any body fat. You've got it all under control. You discipline your self and you've earned it. It's not your fault all these chub mammas and daddies are out here slacking and eating all that ice cream. In fact, you're jealous of them. You know they are getting love even though they haven't made the sacrifices. They don't deserve it.

8) A lot of people will have more success and satisfaction in their life if they find a chubber. Stop limiting your dating/mating pool. It's a statistical fact that some of the best people in the world have fat bellies and butts and legs. Why are you so foolish to elimiate a huge, warm part of the dating pool? Are you silly?

So I'm pretty set in my view, but I'm willing to listen to your probably-ill-considered opinions. But I'll be honest I'm not likely to change my view.

That would increase the capacity of third class coaches by 60%, thus reducing prices by a margin of about 40%. Many people especially migrant workers and low income people can't afford high speed trains so they have to take a slow train and sit for 10~50 hours. Adding a Third Class would enable them to travel more efficiently.

1,2023-07-20,"CMV: Kindness is not necessary for civility, and we need to rethink our approach to disagreements",u/OneGrumpyJill,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/154i0a2/cmv_kindness_is_not_necessary_for_civility_and_we/,changemyview,"If we imagine that kindness and rudeness are on opposite ends (which seems self-evident) I would then propose that civility, which would be opposed to incivility (and I am using this word to show a difference between incivility and rudeness) does not require kindness.   


Kindness can be understood as, well, just that, kindness: to be considered and good to a person. I am not here to discuss whenever kindness is a better rhetorical device (which it often is) but to showcase that one's arguments cannot, and should not, be disregarded simply on the premise of being ""rude"".   


To begin with, rudeness implies aggression (often towards opposing idealogy, and/or people holding it), foul language, and high emotions. While those things can be bad, I fail to see how they are fundamentally bad as, if presented civilly, those show person's passion for the cause, and their willingness to fight for it. At the end of the day, we are fighting for our ideas by engaging in conversation (as we believe them to be true and right) and, therefore, a level of aggression is understandable/expected depending on circumstances.   


Civility implies proper order of actions, logical and supported arguments, good faith, and things that fall along those lines. If a leftist, say, were to debate a fascist, would they be wrong for cussing at the fascist during their time to speak while making their point? Should we not judge them both on their pathos and logos, rather than just writing them off? I find that approach to be a by-product of American branch of liberalism, and of this enforced optimism. Toxic optimism, if you wish. And if you think that such a thing cannot be possible, I present to you, say, American politicians who claim that ""global warming is fine and we can still make it just fine"" despite things getting progressively worse. There is tendency to ""sweep things under a rug and pretend that everyone is happy rather than approach matters directly"" which is prevelant in liberalism due to its passivism. Aggression, I think, is not sign of bad faith, but of passion and belief! Why should emotionally-charged and colorfully-written argument be disregarded simply on the basis of not being ""academic"" or ""professional"" enough? It is still civil, and it is still engaging with the argument fairly, if passionatly.    
   
 To that end, I find it troubling how people think that debates nowadays are useless, and how we should not engage with people. That, to me, not only reeks of intellectual weakness and unwillingness for defending ones position, but also of colossal misunderstanding of how these things work: a debate exists as a template for people watching, and even in individual setting, I still think a civil debate can be as healthy for oneself as a civil sparring match. Not one-to-one comparison, but the underlying logic is there.   


Disagreeing by itself is not bad: middle-ground cannot always be found. Fighting for your position, with passion and heart, is a good thing and a sign of good faith. I mean, do you think philosophers of the old were kind to one another? Hell nah   "

1,2023-07-20,CMV: Requiring a veterinary prescription for most dogs to get heartworm preventative is a scam for vets to make money,u/WingsByRedbull,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/154oa1i/cmv_requiring_a_veterinary_prescription_for_most/,changemyview,"I have become cynical about a lot of veterinary practices. Every year when my dog gets his annual exam it‚Äôs a coin toss as to whether they‚Äôll tell me his teeth look so clean it‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs a puppy too they‚Äôve never seen plaque so bad I need to schedule a cleaning immediately. I know mouth health is important, but when I can see his teeth are clean and their reaction flips back and forth, they lose a lot of credibility. 

A few years ago my other dog had a brain tumor and I thought he might have an earache. The vet said maybe and gave me steroids and the ear medicine, he send back to normal (the steroids) and when we went back for a follow up she went along with the ear ache thought. Before we left she casually made a statement that insinuated he might not live longer than a month, I didn‚Äôt realize that until later but it bothered me because it felt dishonest. When he was younger, every so often he‚Äôd get a stomach bug and I stopped taking him when that happened because it was always the same: give him bland food and come back if it keeps happening. 

I know that vets do incredible things, I‚Äôve seen that too. However, the annual checkup feels unnecessary when they‚Äôre current on their vaccinations. The only reason I still take my current dog is because you have to have a [prescription](https://www.lovetoknowpets.com/dogs/heartworm-pills-no-prescription) to get heart worm medication. For dogs who have taken it before and are on no other medications, this is one of the least risky things and one that can be really beneficial and life saving. I never leave the vet with a bill less than $300 though, and it feels like a scam. 

I don‚Äôt like being cynical about this, so I‚Äôm hoping someone can change my view. What won‚Äôt change my view is linking an article that is written by someone who profits from veterinary medicine or stating the common risks that are either noticeable (you‚Äôd go to a vet if it happened) or less worrisome than the side effects and potential hazards of everything else you can easily or likely often buy for your dog that don‚Äôt require a prescription."
1,2023-07-20,CMV: Some topics in fanfiction should not be seen as harmless just because they‚Äôre a fantasy,u/ZenTomatoToes,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/154pfum/cmv_some_topics_in_fanfiction_should_not_be_seen/,changemyview,"Let me start off by saying no I‚Äôm not a troll, and I‚Äôm not trying to be deliberately hurtful or obtuse. My aim is to have a meaningful discussion because at this point it‚Äôs pretty obvious I‚Äôm in the minority and I don‚Äôt want to be in my own echo chamber. With that said let‚Äôs jump in: 

I made a post yesterday in r/fanfiction which I think you can still find in my post history (got removed by mods so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs still available). The actual topic of my friend and her fic is not the topic of this post so I won‚Äôt go over it here, but the reaction to it is what I‚Äôll focus on. 

I made the point that just because something is a fantasy, it doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt affect the writer/reader in real life. I‚Äôm a gamer as well, so I do understand the reflex to eye roll at this statement because we‚Äôve all heard the ‚Äúvideo games make you violent‚Äù argument. It‚Äôs not true for the vast majority of people who play violent video games. Is it going to negatively affect the behaviors and thoughts of a few? Of course, because we‚Äôre all different. But it‚Äôs an acceptable fantasy to engage in mostly due to the fact that it‚Äôs fun to pretend to use a sword/gun/weapon against enemies, and in the end no one gets hurt. Same reason why action movies are so popular. 

Now why doesn‚Äôt this reasoning then apply to all fantasies? I just said no one gets hurt so what‚Äôs the fuss? And well I don‚Äôt think all fantasies are built the same and some do more harm than good. To bring it back to fan fiction specifically, I have come across stories that have themes of beastiality, rape, and pedophilia to name a few. 
And the problem here is not because the writers are engaging in these topics, since I don‚Äôt think censorship benefits anyone. My problem is when these topics are dismissed as harmless because they‚Äôre a fantasy. And within the story they are not handled as something that is wrong, and the people commenting on these fics don‚Äôt view it as wrong either. 
For example, I like reading about student/teacher relationships. As a teen I thought it was hot to think about an older authority figure like that. So when I would read fanfic with an underage character I didn‚Äôt bat an eye because I was underage at the time. As soon as I became an adult though I couldn‚Äôt keep reading the stories I used to as a teen anymore. As an adult it felt wrong to consume media where an adult is having sexual feelings for someone underage and for the story to treat it as that being hunky dory.  I know some people are going to bring up the age of consent in some places is 16, but have you spoken to a 16 year old as an adult? They‚Äôre still kids. Some are more mature than others sure, but they‚Äôre still kids who are figuring themselves out and so they‚Äôre vulnerable. 
Teens writing stuff like this for other teens is fine, but I think once you become an adult it‚Äôs just immoral. It‚Äôs not a fun fantasy anymore because any healthy adult should not want to sexualize minors for gratification. And this is where fantasies become harmful because they don‚Äôt exist in a vacuum. A person consuming this kind of stuff doesn‚Äôt have this interest switch on/off when they are reading/not reading the story. Even if the act of writing the story doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone, it doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt harm to be done. 
What about survivors of trauma who use fanfiction as a way to process what happened to them? To that I say it‚Äôs okay, because trauma responses are different for everyone and art is a great way to help someone understand and come to terms with what happened to them. BUT if the author wishes to post this they have an obligation to make it known that they are not celebrating these behaviors.
I have come across so many people defending grooming in fics as romantic and that since they‚Äôre just a fantasy no one is getting hurt right? 
I was listening to this true crime podcast called Hunting Warhead. It‚Äôs about an international police effort to catch a pedophile running the biggest server in the dark web. They have interviews of him, and when asked how did it all start he basically talks about how it was a fantasy at first and then he acted upon it because he had rationalized it that this was okay to do. 
And that‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm trying to make, just because it‚Äôs a fantasy it doesn‚Äôt mean it will always stay that way. I‚Äôm not saying everyone reading/writing these stories is a latent pedo and they‚Äôre gonna go out and hurt children. But there are a lot of people who DO. And in the space of fandom, by treating these topics (not just pedophilia) as only a fantasy, and normalizing it then we aren‚Äôt doing enough to keep the actual bad people away. 
Also I think it‚Äôs a disservice to the people in our society who do experience these feelings but don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone. We aren‚Äôt encouraging them to get help, instead we are sending the message that this is ok so no need to change it. 

A lot of people in fandom don‚Äôt agree with this line of thinking. They say fantasies are just made up scenarios and will always stay in people‚Äôs heads so no one is getting hurt. But that doesn‚Äôt address how people who do murder, hurt animals and children, these inclinations started as a fantasy for them as well. You can‚Äôt say fanfiction is only being created/consumed by people who have never hurt others in this way. 
I don‚Äôt think people will stop writing them, but I do think we should do more to not put them in a positive light. 


TLDR; I believe fantasies don‚Äôt exist in a vacuum and there is a point where they are actively harmful. In the space of fandom we are too accepting of taboo topics under the guise of no one is getting hurt, which I think is a narrow way of thinking. This isn‚Äôt the same as kink shaming, because adult sexuality is freaking weird but there are lines that we have become too comfortable being crossed."

1,2023-07-20,Cmv: we should be more creative with criminal punishments,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/154uba5/cmv_we_should_be_more_creative_with_criminal/,changemyview,"The current criminal justice system, with its emphasis on harsh and long jail sentences, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years. While it is crucial to ensure public safety and hold individuals accountable for their actions, incarcerating people for extended periods, without addressing their underlying issues, fails to serve the greater purpose of rehabilitation and societal reintegration. This essay argues that we should shift towards a more fair and creative approach to criminal justice, focusing on education, work programs, victim restitution, and community reintegration, while reserving lengthy sentences for only the most severe crimes.



The United States has one of the highest incarceration rates globally, leading to an overwhelming burden on taxpayers. The costs of maintaining prisons and providing basic necessities to inmates are immense. This expenditure could be better utilized to invest in preventive measures and restorative justice programs, which would benefit society in the long run.



Rather than merely locking people away, we should focus on rehabilitation to address the root causes of criminal behavior. Many offenders struggle with addiction, mental health issues, poverty, or lack of education. By providing access to education, counseling, and skills training, we can help individuals reintegrate into society as productive citizens. Emphasizing rehabilitation reduces recidivism rates, contributing to safer communities.



One aspect of reforming the criminal justice system involves adopting more creative approaches to sentencing. Instead of imposing decades-long sentences, we can consider tailored solutions for each case. For lesser offenses, alternatives like community service, restorative justice, and electronic monitoring can be employed, allowing individuals to remain connected to society while still being held accountable.



Incarcerated individuals should be forced to work and participate in educational programs during their sentence. This approach helps develop valuable skills and allows them to contribute positively to society even while behind bars. By facilitating personal growth, we can foster a sense of purpose and direction, reducing the likelihood of reoffending upon release. But structured in a way to both benefit society and assist them on release. Not pointless, unskilled garbage like pressing license plates, plus an actual wage so so not to encourage police to just arbitrary arrest people to fill the cells up with potential workers for companies. 



Victims of crime often suffer immense physical, emotional, and financial harm. Part of the proposed reform involves allocating a portion of inmates' earnings towards victim restitution. This step not only helps compensate victims for their losses but also reinforces the sense of accountability and responsibility in offenders.



Upon release, former inmates often face numerous barriers to reintegration. By working during their sentence, they can accumulate savings and acquire skills that make reintegration smoother. Additionally, support services and mentoring programs should be available to help them secure housing and employment opportunities, fostering their continued growth and success.



Not all crimes are equal, and a one-size-fits-all approach to sentencing is ineffective and unjust. For severe offenses such as terrorism or serial killing, long sentences and life imprisonment may remain necessary to protect society from dangerous individuals. However, for non-violent crimes or minor offenses, lengthy jail terms prove detrimental to both the individuals and society.


One of the critical issues with the current criminal justice system is the glaring contrast between how certain crimes are treated. While some individuals receive life sentences for minor offenses, politicians and other influential figures escape accountability for more significant wrongdoing. Creating a more just system involves addressing this disparity and ensuring everyone is held to the same standards."
1,2023-07-20,"CMV: Andrew Tate is not a conservative, he's just a bigot and a misogynist that's using conservatism to promote his dark views on women",u/maimonidies,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/154vibr/cmv_andrew_tate_is_not_a_conservative_hes_just_a/,changemyview,"I've noticed lately a lot of conservatives feel the need to defend Tate. They all admit that he's a bit polarizing and controversial, but ultimately they agree with his overall message. And the reason for that is I think mainly because 1. some of his views align with conservatism (pro marriage, kids, family, against promiscuity and trans) 2. he's openly against the media, or what he calls the matrix. I myself admire someone who is an independent thinker, and not a mindless idiot that just repeats the media's narrative, so I do understand why conservatives, or pro-trumpers would be enchanted with him. I think that's ultimately the reason why Tucker carlson, Candace Owens, Ben Shapiro (although the latter has some quibbles with him) etc. are into him, and defend him and think (or maybe want us to believe?) that he's not guilty of the allegations. But I think ultimately they are turning a blind eye to Andrew Tate's dark side, and are prejudiced to see him in a good light, simply because some of his values align with conservatism. In reality I believe Tate's beliefs are nothing about conservatism, and everything about the promotion of sex.

Admittedly, I haven't watched many of his videos, but I think I have seen enough to get the picture (which is why I'm posting it on CMV. maybe I have missed something). The way I see it, Tate is a two facer, privately in his own life, and even around ppl he trusts he will say the most outlandish statements (not quoting them exactly as they were said): ""men have authority over women just like they have over their dog"", ""men should sleep around with as many girls possible (but it's not ok for women to cheat and only fans is a terrible thing)"", ""a wife should submit to her husbands authority, cook their meals, stay home, only then can she be the happiest woman"", ""if you watch porn you're not a real man"". But when he's confronted on camera about these statements he just brushes them away as jokes, taken out of context, he says you have to see the whole four hour video to fully appreciate what he means by that, etc. But I believe what he says privately between his fans are his true colors, and what he says on interviews are just a cover up. 

 The rise of Tate has always been linked to sex. Tate and his brother made millions from their webcam business. He was basically selling porn. Whether he forced those women to work for him is beyond the scope of this post (he has admitted using emotional manipulation tactics), but suffice it to say that hiring females to work for sex is usually not done for the greater good of society, it's for your own benefit, not for the benefit of the women, that's why prostitution is illegal. Would you ever listen to a pimp telling you how to be a better man, and tell you what girls *really* want? How could anyone take this guy seriously?  Most of the videos I've seen of him is him talking about sex: How to get girls to sleep with you, how to dominate them more, how porn is bad for you (coming from a guy who sold porn not so long ago??), how girls on onlyfans is a terrible thing, how much girls need to submit to their men, etc. That's really what Tate is all about, men getting more sex and sleeping with as many girls possible. He packages it in conservative terms, he'll quote the bible frequently, he'll say marriage is good for you, women should be obedient housewives, but it's not because he really believes in those values; if he would he would be against men fooling around, that's at least what a typical conservative would promote, but he's not, because he's all about men getting what they need and women submitting to them. It's nothing about the bible, its nothing about conservative values, it's all about the men dominating women. In a hit piece from Vice, after a long hard day, he finishes talking to his fans in the War room and concludes with ""ok time to enjoy yourselves, there are some chicks from I don't know where, enjoy!"" and with it he walks out. That's when it hit me what this man is really all about. 

So that's why I get so mad when I see conservatives trying to defend him, that he's innocent, that he has never raped or harrased anyone. He's most likely not innocent. And even if he is, his views on the role of genders are toxic (even by conservative standards) and he should be called out for it, not encouraged and praised for his courage to speak everything on his mind. 

p.s., I should add that a lot of my views are aligned with conservatism, so it bothers me when conservatives defend him, it puts them in a bad light.

If tipping is eliminated, the menu price will be adjusted by the market; customers will not pay less on average, but they will lose that freedom.**  
Suppose you and your friends go to a regular restaurant and spend $100. People would normally tip 10-20%, with an average of 15%. Because of the tipping culture, you as a customer are allowed to pay whatever you want between $110-$120, based on your experience and the service you received. You have freedom within that range. Freedom of choice is always good.  
If somehow the local law suddenly banned all tipping and gratuities in restaurants, you thought you'd spend less because there would be no tipping. But the market is still there. **To reflect the cost of running a restaurant and to keep the business going, guess what the entire restaurant industry will do? They will adjust the price on the menu so that what used to cost $100 will now cost $115**. I would say it could be even higher because the restaurant is now entitled to pay more taxes - tips are generally less taxable than salaries. Now, if you order the same thing at that restaurant, you will pay a fixed amount of $115, no matter how much you enjoyed the food and service. You can't choose.

I understand that most people are frustrated with the tipping culture, but what they're really upset about is the egregious behavior that uses tipping to generate more profit. For example, some iPad/point-of-sale machines set unreasonably high default tip percentages and intentionally make it inconvenient to set a custom tip amount; or sometimes a very unprofessional restaurant staff will stare at you when you choose to tip in order to pressure you. Some restaurants add automatic gratuities or other surcharges that surprise you, hoping that most customers won't notice.

Those things should be eliminated, but not the tipping culture itself. **Allowing customers to pay a flexible amount is always a good thing, and most importantly, you don't actually pay more because of tipping.**"

He is 80 years old and voters are concerned about whether he could serve another 4 years as president. I think that there will be a major Democratic challenger that will challenge Biden for the nomination. They would probably have a 50/50 chance at winning the nomination against Biden. His approval rating is very low which means most people hate Biden. Because of all these issues, I think Biden would lose regardless of who the Republican nominee is."

It also makes sense to grab up land in Alaska or canada

With rising sea levels, the beach location will change. This means it is advantageous to buy property near the ocean, but above current sea levels. When the sea levels rise, this will end up being beachfront property and its value will increase 

Alaska and Canada are also good places to purchase land or property. Warming temperatures should make them into pleasant places to live with nice weather and increased property values

I have never seen anyone discuss this, so I'm wondering if there is something I am overlooking or missing"

Even the ones who aren't, are still infinitely to the left when held up against people like Desantis. 

To refuse to adapt to these changes, and to refuse to improve upon what is flawed, for some people that refuse to think entirely, and to refuse to govern (instead being the party of ""no."") is...crazy.

They're not based on having the same culture. Racial cliques aren't always based on being the same race. THEY'RE MAINLY BASED ON BEING ANTI-WHITE OR NOT BEING WHITE. It may consist of a group of asians, latinos, a white person who's dating a black person, and etc. with many different cultures and nationalities. It makes some people feel singled out because they look different. It may attract weirdos who want token friends. Racial cliques may lead into identity politics. Just because someone is asian, it doesn't necessarily mean they're not prejudiced towards latinos. Why tf do people act so surprised when a stupid white girl with a black boyfriend has antisemitic beliefs? You're only surprised because you took someone at face value. You saw them for their race or their interracial status, instead of their personhood (personality, lifestyle, or their interests/hobbies). Sometimes people change in order to fit in with the gang they created because they didn't have anything interesting about themselves or their life to begin with. Why is it surprising that they built a racial clique instead?

I've came across some people who disagree with me about racial cliques, but they didn't fully explain why I'm wrong. They either gaslighted me about this and told me it doesn't exist or they brought up how they supposedly have common life experiences with other 'non-whites' which isn't always true. If you disagree with this, explain to me why I'm wrong about this. What good things came out of a racial clique? Btw, before you call me a white person with no clue, I'm racially ambiguous and I'm not always perceived as white."
1,2023-07-20,CMV: It is morally wrong to consume as much fossil fuels as the average American.,u/jthomas94,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1558rxz/cmv_it_is_morally_wrong_to_consume_as_much_fossil/,changemyview,"US per capita CO2 emissions are something like 15 tons per year, one of the highest rates in the world. For comparison Costa Rica's per capita emissions are 1.62 tons/yr. 

A [fairly new paper in Nature found](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01132-6) that 1.2 average Americans emit enough carbon over their lives (~1,200 tons) to essentially make where one person lives uninhabitable, I am paraphrasing the paper but it is incredibly bleak. The worst impacts will be in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where famine, drought, and unsurvivable heat waves are likely. 

It's easy to see why US emissions are so high, I'm an American, grew up in a suburb, and our infrastructure is absurdly car-dependent, public transit is abysmal, and cross-country and international flights are very common. Not to mention the high rates of beef consumption and disposable plastic use. Also, many suburban Americans drive huge SUVs and lifted trucks, even though they work office jobs, seeming to not care about the unnecessary fuel costs. This is even with knowledge of climate change and environmental problems being widespread for over 40 years.

I don't think the individual US resident had much to do with setting up the country the way it is, but I also don't see bad infrastructure as an excuse to continue engaging in hugely polluting activities. To me, it almost doesn't matter how inconvenient it is, I have to do the right thing, even if everyone around me is behaving poorly. Personally, I'm never taking a plane vacation again, because I see this as harming others unnecessarily. You could even measure the impact of a plane trip in terms of the amount of time it subtracts from an average South Asian child (for example) having a habitable climate, if my napkin math is right, a round-trip from NYC to Paris (2 tons CO2 equivalent) is shaving off over a month. Just from one vacation! Now think of a frequent flyer or cruise family.

There are two main responses I see to this line of argument. First, shifting responsibility onto corporations, governments, or the super wealthy with private jets. I completely agree that these are all terrible actors, and political action like abolishing the fossil fuel industry is required. I'm involved in local politics and activism, and I think everyone should be. But that still doesn't put the average Joe in the clear. One of the statistics frequently cited is that 100 corporations are responsible for 71% of carbon emissions. While this is true, I often see it used to excuse polluting behavior, and I think that's a misinterpretation. Those 100 corporations are fossil fuel corporations, who indeed burn fossil fuels to extract more fossil fuels, but they do that to sell their products to us, the consumers. [Residential electricity and personal vehicles are huge chunks of US emissions.](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector#direct-industrial-processes-5-2) I think part of what makes the fossil fuel companies so evil is that they successfully convinced Americans to have massively polluting lifestyles through marketing and lies! 

The other response is that it's hopeless, individual action won't do anything because civilization is already doomed. This response is harder to argue against because it may be true, but regardless, us being screwed still doesn't make it ok to do morally wrong things, and this kind of thinking will only hasten our demise, and the demise of those less fortunate than us."
1,2023-07-20,CMV: It is not normal for a young person to commit a heinous crime,u/Conkers-Good-Furday,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1559miq/cmv_it_is_not_normal_for_a_young_person_to_commit/,changemyview,"I am greatly frightened by this recent societal development of completely absolving young people of any and all moral accountability. I cannot understand what kind of logic could have possibly led people to think a study that shows the neurology of why young people are more likely to make impulsive decisions like drunk driving suddenly means a man who shot twelve black kids should be let off the hook because his 25th birthday wasn't until tomorrow.

Men are more likely than women to do heinous things because of testosterone, but we don't use that as an excuse for everything criminal men do from stealing a mug to committing genocide, so why should it be any different for young people? Normal means that most or at least a large percentage of a group does something, but most young people do not commit heinous crimes despite underdeveloped brains, just as most men don't despite testosterone.

Even if you're really that worried about young people being harmed unfairly by justice, do you really think it's a good idea to frame every single one of them as fascist murderers who are one bad day away from shooting up a school? That will surely end up doing much, much, MUCH more harm for most young people in the long run."

1,2023-07-20,CMV: People who surrender animals to the shelter shouldn't be required to do paperwork that identifies them or go on a 'sh*tlist' that prevents them from adopting from that shelter in the future.,u/ForsakenTakes,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/155bzei/cmv_people_who_surrender_animals_to_the_shelter/,changemyview,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a licensed and registered veterinary technician who has experience working in clinics that do 'bulk' reduced cost spays and neuters for local humane societies and shelters.   
Yes, the sheer numbers of unwanted puppies and kittens- especially in the spring and fall -are next to impossible to keep up with. I hate seeing animals come in and out of the clinic that have been returned to their respective shelters, neglected, abused, or needlessly pregnant or intact as much as anyone else, because in the end it IS irresponsible people that cause these situations...   


However, I do not think that these shelters should be keeping what we call ""shitlists"" on people who responsibly surrender their pets they can no longer care for and go through the proper channels to surrender.   
What any shelter or rescue is doing by having you sign paperwork or anything regarding your surrender is basically adding you into a database of ""irresponsible pet owners"".   


Sometimes, this information is shared with surrounding shelters and rescues to deny future adoptions to people who've surrendered an animal *anytime in the past*. As far as I can tell, these databases are *forever*. If you surrendered a dog in 2002 because you lost your job and had to move into housing that doesn't allow pets for a few years, for example, they keep that surrender -and your reason- on file. And if you go in to adopt a pet today from that same shelter, you could be denied adoption because you're flagged in the system as an ""abandoner"". If your recalled reasoning doesn't match the original paperwork for surrendering an animal in the past -they will automatically deny you and assume the worst.  


I feel like making people identify themselves during the surrender process is counterproductive. The reason for this is it encourages blind dumping or abandonment at these shelters. We have so many pets left outside of these rescues/shelters that have requirements to fill out paperwork and provide identification that *more are dumped than people following protocol* by going in and physically filling out the paperwork. Because people know that they're going on some shit-list they don't know whom it will be shared with if they go in and ""do the right thing"".   


Sometimes these abandoned pets are left injured in crates- during the weekend or at night in harsh conditions when no one is there, simply because they fear being identified and judged for abandoning a pet they cannot care for. That's a big reason people re-surrender their animal- they get sick or get into an accident and the owner cannot afford the veterinary bills and are embarrassed and heart-broken.   
Allowing a 'no-questions asked' policy and 'baby boxes' have worked wonders for fewer unwanted babies being dumped in trash cans or irresponsibly on hospital property. Why can't we apply the same mindset to pets?   


I also don't feel like punishing someone for life is fair when people's situations change and improve all the time. Just because someone hit a rough patch 10 years ago and had to bring their cat back to the shelter doesn't mean they'll always be some irresponsible pet-dumper. (I think this is the reason they're so worried about the nature of the surrender, and want the paperwork in the first place.)   


Their hearts (shelters and rescues) are in the right place, but they're making things more difficult than they need to be when housing all of the pets that need it. There are way too many pets in need of homes to scrutinize potential owners to the point some of these shelters do. Some of these requirements are higher than many people in society hold to be a necessary threshold for caring for their own children and are excessive and ridiculous.   


TL;DR: Don't make people ID and ""tell on"" themselves when surrendering an animal because it makes more people just dump them instead. Also, don't just assume someone's a pos dumper for life just because they had to surrender in the past."

People are still buying AAA games... and let's be honest, not every AAA game is a buggy mess with MTX. We have enough good AAA games in this year: Tears of the Kingdom, Resident Evil IV Remake, Hogwarts Legacy, Final Fantasy XVI, Dead Island 2, Street Fighter VI. And there are many good AAA games in 2022.

Oh my god, I just don't understand why people are pretending as huge indie gaming fans to just look cool. Most of indie fans played only mainstream indie games and then they are going back to AAA games when a new good game from big studio gets a release. Also... each day Steam gets a release of 40 indie games, and most of them are just bad. They either way a buggy Unity mess, or another generic 8bit platformer/roguelite. Let's say there are much more bad indie games than AAA games. Then again, we have some hyped bad indie games like Cube World, Hello Neighbour (release version) and, of course, Yandere Simulator. 

I think indie gaming fans are just poor people who can't afford a good console/GPU and can't buy a 60$ game. And their love for indie games is a copium mechanism. That maybe explains ehy today's indie scene becomed some sort of fast food restaurant where easily to learn and simple indies are getting a cash (Vampire Survivor, Among Us, roguelites) while indie games created for art are overshadowed by them."

Yeah me neither. Ever seen a bike take up an entire lane of traffic? Like, all the time? Yeah me too!

Bicyclists are clearly establishing a double-standard for themselves, where they can follow some traffic laws and demand that other vehicles in the vicinity respect that while just eschewing the ones that are inconvenient for them, like having to actually stop at a stop sign.

If you ever saw a car blow through a stop sign because ""there doesn't appear to be a need to actually stop there"", you'd be very concerned, if not pissed off about it. And if you ever saw a car driving down the sidewalk, you'd probably not be too happy about that either! I say this second part because while I obviously think the former is a problem, the latter is also not exactly the right solution, nor should it really be something bicyclists ought to do if they want to be respected on the road.

This attitude is obviously very dangerous for the bicyclist, but it is dangerous for everyone on the road also. If you have to slam on the brakes because a bicyclist instantaneously transformed into a pedestrian for a few seconds as he cruised through that stop sign intersection, that could cause a collision with any of the cars around you. When bicyclists don't respect traffic laws, it is impossible to predict what they will be doing, and having to ""guess"" at what any vehicle on the road is doing is clearly going to cause a lot of accidents.

I think bicyclists need to decide one way or the other: are you a road vehicle or a pedestrian? And whichever you choose, you gotta keep to that, 100% of the time. If you choose to be a pedestrian, then you don't get to take up an entire lane of traffic or have any cars have to respect your presence on the road; you being on the road would be as much of a concern as me walking down the road and getting in the way of other cars. And if you choose to be a road vehicle, that means you actually fucking stop at a fucking stop sign, because that's what road vehicles are supposed to do. You get one or the other. You don't get both, especially not when *you feel like it.*

CMV.

Edit: a point I would like to make: I was referring to people treating stop signs as NON-EXISTENT, not as yield signs. Many of you have strawmanned my view and said it is irrational to not allow them to be regarded as yield signs, but my view has to do with them treating them as non-existent signs. The conversation of whether stop signs ought to be regarded as yield signs is different. At the very least, if you want to get through to me, you have to approach this fully understanding my view and not strawmanning it. Because it is easier to dunk on the view if you think my problem is with bikers taking SOME precautions, isn't it? And my problem is with the ones who take NONE, which is what makes the ""why aren't you okay with them treating it as a yield sign?"" angle a strawman."
1,2023-07-21,CMV: Episodic TV is better than cinematic TV.,u/Reviewingremy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/155mvjw/cmv_episodic_tv_is_better_than_cinematic_tv/,changemyview,"All TV these days seems to be cinematic (by which I mean it's just one long movie) but episodic is just better.

Episodic gets to devote more time to character growth and development without feeling like the writers are padding out the show. 

It allows the show to grow and explore different themes, and ideas. 

It's easier to introduce new viewers into the show.

And it's fun and easy to rewatch particular episodes.

It's also perfectly bindgeable if that's what you care about. Particularly if the show or season has a throughline which a lot do. 

.

.

By contrast cinematic TV feels like any watch has to be from season 1 episode 1 onwards. You can't just skip and watch a particular thing or character focus. 

They're nearly all fast paced action. Rest, exposition and characters are secondary. The important thing is explosions. (I'm not here but I will cite numerous examples if pressed).

And after watching 12 episodes in a weekend 18 months later when the next season comes out, you usually forgot everything from the last season except the broadest strokes. So you inevitably end up ditching the show. 

Episodic TV is better."

I am a person unable to deal with existentialism and post-modern philosophy. I think humanity is in a crisis having realized Nihilism is true and have accepted no moral system is objectively correct and everything is subjective. I do not believe in religion and I believe Nietzsche is not a solution since a world of either ubermensch or master morality would be a cruel world.

I think justifying morality and punishment based on democracy and arbitrary traditions and agreements and statistics is nonsense. If moral nihilism is true then no criminals or violent acts should be punished. A subjectively created desire is meaningless. A thing must be external to be real.

Sometimes I consider studying a philosophy degree, have an opportunity to do it in just about a month, to perhaps find my way out of this mess. But I think it is too risky, since if end up reading pessimistic or nihilistic literature as part of the syllabus...well, if a philosopher argues non-existence is good I would consider figuring out how to move to a country with euthanasia or some other way to be non-existent. Not just read them and move on - if I agree with a philosophers advocating something dangerous I will do it if I genuinely end up believing they are correct. Thus is is extremely risky for me to study philosophy...but it might be the only solution as well?

Please CMV that I should jump into philosophy even though it might destroy me. Currently I intend to just avoid any philosophy, news and politics even thought it feels morally wrong. I will live off welfare and mostly just consume fiction books, games and movies. I will be a ""useless eater"".

1. I cannot drink the coffee on a regular basis because it‚Äôs too expensive (increased suffering due to longing for that taste again)
2. The knowledge of the greater taste will degrade the taste of my ordinary everyday coffee   


I therefore believe I should avoid evening experiencing the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù coffee in the first place because since I am already content with my ordinary coffee (the only taste experience I have) there is no reason for me to change it.

 I‚Äôve said jokingly (with a hint of seriousness) that ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt know, it doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù But I do actually adapt this mind-set in real life as well. It‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt drink soda or eat candy, etc‚Ä¶ because if I don‚Äôt have the knowledge of their taste then I cannot suffer from it. This goes with a lot of experiences in life.

But I would say that there is a huge accountability problem within most democratic systems, one which career politicians and lobbyists exploit to their own ends.
In a dictatorship, if a dictator makes policies and decisions that people disagree with, they cannot be held accountable for that and if it gets bad enough, people will rebel but in a democracy if you vote for a leader based on certain promises or policies, there is no guarantee that once in power they will still stick to these.
In fact, it‚Äôs more likely that they won‚Äôt because there really is no reason for them to as there is no real punishment, voters are always told that if they don‚Äôt like what the current government is doing they can go out and vote for another one but what‚Äôs the point if every politician can just break their promises, other than the possibility of not being re-elected but given that many of them will occupy coveted positions in private industry afterwards, I don‚Äôt see that as being much of a disincentive."

I'm a Conservative in that I completely reject the Enlightenment / French Revolution principles of ""liberty, equality, fraternity"" / am extremely skeptical of democracy and even more skeptical of ""equality,"" believing it to be not only suboptimal, but completely *undesirable*, in almost every imaginable case. (""Let's get back to 1220, not 2012"", as Michael Knowles put it).

_______________________

The ""Try That in a Small Town"" song sparked some of my thoughts here, so I guess I'll start there. I'm not a country music guy, but when I heard the libs were getting this mad over the song, I'll be honest, I had high hopes. With how they were talking about it, I was expecting something shocking, something Johhny Rebel-esque or at the very least on par with that old banger *""And he's dead, dead, Michael Brown / the deadest thug in the whole damn town / His whole life's long gooone / Deader than a roadkill dog""*

Instead it's...this? Don't sucker-punch people and try to steal guns in muh small town because we take care of our own 'round here? How is this even remotely controversial?

We keep hearing about the Conservatives ""defending"" Aldean as if his song needs any defense. Aldean himself gave a speech many conservatives praised about how he ""wants to get back to the country we used to have before this mess"" or something.

But that country never existed - not in his or any of our lifetimes. Not in the 50s. Why do you think the 60s were so awful (bringing the 4 horsemen of the Civil Rights Movement, Sexual Revolution, Vatican II, and the acceleration of feminism)? The seeds were sewn long before.

This I think is the major mistake that modern so-called Conservatives make in the US. You can't keep your MLK but then (rightfully) condemn BLM. You can't condemn ""third-wave feminism"" but praise ""the good ones"" back in the first-wave. Feminism is rotten down to its very root, down to its very first accomplishment, down to its very first idea. MLK was a socialist agitator and no real conservative can in any way dedicate a day to his honor and praise him. 

____

In Congress recently, another incident: Rep. Eli Crane referred to black people as ""colored people"" during statements about a military bill. Instead of debating the issue, some sick, demented Democrat creature started screeching about how she wants the phrase ""stricken from the record"" because it hurts her feelings. Mr. Crane gives in and agrees to change it to whatever her preferred phrase it but she keeps on screeching, and then later even *Speaker McCarthy* condemned the language as inappropriate.

I mean, if this doesn't make you lose hope as a Conservative, what does. This is the Republican speaker. Who the so-called ""freedom causus"" got on board with. And he bends to the will of some screeching demon and castigates his own party-member for not using PC language on capitol hill. Who needs enemies with friends like these?

________

It just shows me that the vast, vast majority of Republicans, even allegedly ""MAGA"" ones, are totally unserious about actually dismantling liberalism - top to bottom, from all institutions, public and private, no holds barred. 

Most of the contentious issues are, as stated above, just the ""conservatives"" stemming (often quite temporarily) the most insane and outrageous abuses of leftism. Say ""Don't drug and mutilitate children,"" and they'll larp as civil rights crusaders against you. Say ""maybe don't teach gay erotica to my 14 year old in school"" and they'll paint you as supporting ""book bans."" Say, as I mention above, ""hey, we'll defend ourselves if you sucker punch people in our small towns"" and they'll hurl all their -isms at you. 

This clearly is where the battleground is on almost all discourse today - ""should we do the absolute most fringe, radical, novel, far-left thing imaginable, or should we maybe not do that quite yet?"" Isn't this an overton window that's as far-left as we can imagine? How can anyone see this state of affairs and think the overton window is shifting *right,* when the *Republican speaker of the house* is denouncing un-PC speech from his own members at the behest of black Democrats.

Ultimately, as I said, this ""stem only the most absolutely insane and egregious abuses of liberalism"" strategy doesn't work. We've seen it over the past 50-100 years - ""conservatives"" have failed to conserve anything. A serious, methodical, comprehensive strategy to systematically dismantle liberalism entirely is the only way we ""conserve"" anything, but obviously no one wants to do it, so I don't see how Leftists are feeling threatened right now when they basically have 2 parties playing for their team.

The right to life is a human right and by having an abortion you‚Äôre killing a human which would violate that right. This usually leads to the argument of bodily autonomy as a human right, that a woman has the right to control her body in the way she chooses and this trumps the right to life or something of that nature.

Now for this view I‚Äôm going to ignore the low hanging fruit perspectives which clearly show we don‚Äôt have bodily autonomy and there are many laws that govern our bodies. For the sake of the this let‚Äôs ignore those.

I saw a very interesting hypothetical that I‚Äôve been thinking of for like 2 months and I‚Äôve come to a conclusion. The hypothetical went as such:

Say there is a woman who‚Äôs pregnant and plans to keep the baby. In the hypothetical, she willingly does something she knows can cause severe harm to the child (In the hypothetical it was a pill which would have a chance to disable them, but this could also be drug use or something). These actions lead to the child being born severely disabled. The question is should the child be able to sue the parents for harming them. 

Now in my opinion, which I think everyone might agree with, is yes. Because they were negligent in a way which caused long term harm. But at the same time if we say yes, then that would be justification for violating bodily autonomy for the woman.

On the other hand we can say no, preserving the woman‚Äôs bodily autonomy while also saying it‚Äôs justified for her to violate the child‚Äôs autonomy. 

So either way i think theres a violation of humans rights. I would like to get others opinions on this as I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs many ways to think about it and possibly cmv

If I'm not mistaken, the group of people who hate ""tipping culture"" are upset about the fact that they are essentially required to spend ""extra money"" on their meal. They had some general sense of how much their food and drinks cost, but now they have to tack on this extra 15% or more, and that's bad, because we all worked hard for our money and having to surrender more of it is a problem.

What I guess I don't understand, though, is 1) why anyone actually does THINK OF this as ""extra money"" without realizing that this likely represents the total sum they were going to pay, tipping culture or not 2) at least when tipping is optional, you can exercise the right NOT to tip.

Tell me where this logic is wrong: if we suddenly decided tipping was to be eradicated, we absolutely HAVE to increase server wages to at least SOME extent. The system is currently designed in a way that a large chunk of their actual income comes from tips, and if that source dries up entirely, only the craziest of servers will continue working that job. They HAVE to have their wages increased to compensate for this. And where will the restaurant owner come up with the money to pay those increased wages? It seems only natural, then, that the cost of the food itself will increase. So at the end of the day, when you bought that $10 burger and then left a $1.50 tip and were big mad about the $1.50, it seems pretty likely that the food simply becomes a $11.50 burger, meaning the amount of money coming out of your wallet is the exact same amount. Where else is the money going to come from to pay these servers?

If your viewpoint here really is ""I care more about my money (and perhaps also my family which I support with my money) than I care about the livelihood of the guy who brought me my food"", then why on earth would you NOT support tipping culture, seeing as how you can just always leave no tip and get your food for less money out of your pocket? If we did away with tipping culture, that will almost certainly increase the price of your food and force you to pay more money, so then why WOULDN'T you want tipping culture in place?

Finally, can someone just help me understand the sheer OUTRAGE over anyone taking a stance that perhaps people have the wrong ideas about tipping culture? I'm writing this after reading [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/15667lr/comment/jsywlp5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which was received VERY poorly, with aggressive counter-attacks like

>Tipping only give stress everyone, just stop it.  
>  
>Congrats on being part of the problem

This is a thing I've noticed, that not only do people disagree, they are HOSTILE in their disagreement. I mean I know this is reddit, I know it's the internet, but for real, when I see people discuss this issue, I see downright HOSTILITY about it which has always baffled me. That makes me think that people are far more protective of their money than I thought and that this perceived ""extra money"" they are spending or whatever must be extremely offensive because of that. Anyone who can help me understand the outrage? Clearly I'm missing something because tipping culture has always just been another thing to discuss in my book, like one's favorite movie or what kind of salad dressing one prefers to eat. It's literally just a thing to talk about, but people are FURIOUS about this one, and I just don't get it.

Granted a trade/barter system could replace it, but then you‚Äôre trading one commodity (illegal drugs) for another (legal, say bags of sugar, that must be (in this scenario) bought with a card payment).

I understand that gender stereotypes are harmful to people and their mental health, but prentending to be the opposite gender just supports these ideas. Instead of labeling yourself as something else, why not just be who you are, or wear what you want, without deciding to change your gender?

I will use your preferred pronouns and stuff, but I personally think people who identify as it are just trying to look cool. For info, I am 14 years old. I have a 12 year old sister who is still in middle school. She told me that like half the girls in her classes identify as she/they and that the other kids told her they do it because they want to still be girls but also part of LGBT because it's cool and gets them friends. Now I know these are like 11 and 12 year olds, so obviously different from adults and older kids. But when people explain it to me, it seems like they are describing personality. I even saw some people on youtube straight up say that gender is your personality. Even though I am a girl, I always since I was little bought clothes from both the boys and the girls section, never played with a single doll and threw away any that anyone bought me, instead playing with my (now like 500) different hotwheels and hosting ""car shows"" with them. I essentially went by he/him on Minecraft (which I used to be chronically online on) just because that's what everyone assumed I was. I am extremely unsocial and can't connect emotionally with anyone easily (though I am neurodivergent) When I was younger, I had a pretty deep voice and people misgendered me fairly often, and a lot of times I didn't correct them because I couldn't care less. To me identifying as they/them is a ticket to the cool kid club and is pretty pointless. I don't even know what people mean half the time by ""gender"". I'm pretty convinced its the same thing as sex and people are making a big deal out of nothing. Especially when people identify as she/they or he/they. Like isn't that just saying you want to be unique but also want to be able to say ur oppressed while all you change is your pronouns. People always talk about not being able to be accepted but to me it seems like LGBT people are accepted the most, are always praised by both teachers and other students. and it makes me feel pretty jealous.  It also seems like anything can be called LGBT these days. the best examples I have are people saying they are ""demisexual"" and stuff like that which is another way of saying you're a normal person with preferences. I think gay and bi makes sense, and even though I don't understand trans that's fine, but nonbinary makes 0 sense at all.

The United States itself has thousands of WMDs. Well over a dozen nations around the world have WMDs. Even Tom Clancy, the famous military-thriller author, complained that the Iraq war lacked a good *casus belli* \- it had no good justification for it.

Fast-forward nineteen years, and Russia invades Ukraine on a similarly flimsy pretense - that Ukraine has ""fascists"" and that ""NATO is expanding aggressively near Russia with hostile intent."" Both of these pretenses were just as laughable and empty as the Bush administration's WMD justification for the invasion of Iraq - but what did the United States do? The U.S. promptly responded by sending $47 billion worth of weaponry to Ukraine, condemning Russia and imposing various sanctions on Russia, etc.

This is hypocrisy. America's ""justification"" for going into Iraq was just as flimsy, if not even more so, than Russia's ""justification"" for going into Ukraine.

I don't necessarily think this is  a bad thing. But essentially I think the value proposition of say Harvard is that a normal student gets to be around the legacies and network with them. Harvard does not have better teaching than say UofT or many other mid-high universities, its sole value proposition is networking. And the teaching ceiling seems to be being hit more frequently by universities now too.

Do I like the fact that Ivy Leagues are these networking spots? Well I think there's a genuine social value in making friends and such and intergenerational activities. But I also see this as exclusionary and contributing to economic inequality.

I feel the final straw that made me decide legacy admissions should be abolished is affirmative action being abolished. Because I think at least in theory disadvantaged people meeting advantaged legacies would offer rich social good, while now I see that as no longer applicable.

I think the value of universities has generally been declining due to them being too competitive to get into. Turning them into places of competition more than places of networking."

1) Abolishing all privacy. Google is trying to abolish all the privacy the internet has that we take for granted. Trackers, Manifest V3, and just today, Web Environment Integrity.

They want to give us the crappiest experience and collect data off of us in favor of profits. And I  that soon, they'll lobby to abolish every privacy law regarding the internet, and make it look like China. 

2) Companies buy everything. Companies try and buy more and more properties so competition doesn't happen. Google bought FitBit, they bought Breezometer, they bought Waze, and they'll continue to buy existing properties, and I believe they will then buy other companies until they have a monopoly on everything in existence in the entire world. 

3) Propaganda and censorship. This has happened with YouTube for a while now, and is only going to get worse in the foreseeable future, pumping out negative and fake news on a massive scale, and silencing those who speak out against it. I believe in 20 years from now, there will be dystopian laws where you could get arrested for speaking out against certain viewpoints that Google tries to set forth. 

I believe Google will continue to get bigger and bigger, until it monopolizes every last bit of our lives and becomes a dystopian techno-government like in those movies. CMV."

I'll first explain the GOP before trump, the Trump's affects on the GOP while he was POTUS, and the GOP's possible plans and best scenarios post Trump. And use historical comparisons to back it up.  
One thing hes done was securing the Supreme Court for the GOP for decades to come by putting in conservative judges.  
Anyway, political realignment (in America) typically occurs every 30 to 40 years under the two-party system; the most recent realignment occurred in the 1960s during the Civil Rights movement. I contend that FDR's New Deal initiated this realignment, but the 1960s effectively ended the party swap. The Reagan period brought greater right-wing neoliberalism, which altered the economic landscape of America. The GOP is appealing to Southerners' cultural beliefs (States rights, limited government, gun rights, and Christianity) but minorities are also flocking to the Democratic party. This began in 2016, and we are now witnessing it as a result of Donald Trump, the most adored, despised, and divisive figure in America. After 2008 wars in the Middle East costed them voters especially with the election of Obama. They lost Presidential elections in 2008 and 2012 (despite winning some midterms) as they were losing appeal with the Reagan era policy. 2016 changed all of that controversially, Trump brought in and ushered a new era of the GOP that was stagnating, revolving around protectionist, nationalist and pro-worker. Some of Trump's policies like the tax cuts didn't benefit the working class but he had to cater to the old guard wing of the GOP that disliked him as for much of the rest of his term. 

  
*People also forget the reason why Trump won, its because after decades of failed promises, wage stagnation, industrial decline and corporate profits, people wanted to vote for an outsider that catered to their issues. That also worked, populist rhetoric towards the working class especially in the rust belt and other places that voted for Obama in 08 and 2012.* 

  
In politics there are a lot of talks about his two impeachments, january 6 and some conspiracy theories as to why he damaged the GOP's credibility. Along with rise of MTG and Boebert showing how radical the GOP has become. First off whenever a nation is largely divided (and in a culture war), the radical small minority on both sides are typically the loudest. We seen this during the Civil War with the radical republicans abolitionists vs the dixie aristocratic slave owners, and also in the 60s-70s with the emergence of the hippies, and Nixon's silent majority. And what the media does is record and focus on those people and tell the population that ""tHeSe PeOpLe ArE tHe DaNgEr To ThE nAtIoN, uNdErMiNiG dEmOcRaCy"" essentially being the opium of the masses.  And the MSM certainly hopes it turns away voters from the GOP. But hey some of that criticism is largely correct like January 6 being bad for democracy and the danger of Covid conspiracy theories. But thats not the point, point is that Trump saved the GOP. What Trump did was he breathed a new life into the GOP that was dying and looking for an identity.   
As a result, there was Compared to Romney in 2012, 2016 attracted more Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters to the GOP. In just 4 years, Trump earned the second-highest number of votes for a presidential candidate in US history, despite the scandals, media hyperbole, and catastrophic covid pandemic. Trump got more votes¬†than Obama, who was surpassed by Biden in terms of the number of votes received by a victorious candidate. People don't realize that there are still significant portions of the populace that agree with Trump's ideals and¬†rhetoric about putting America first. Even with the high voter participation and how controversial Trump was, one might assume he wouldn't have as many votes and it would be a blowout, yet the reverse is true. We also see trails of that with the midterms in 2022, an increase in the amount of hispanic voters to the GOP  along with Muslim voters. The culture war also has took part in this along with trans issue in schools. The Democratic party alienating parts of their coalition base voters that are typically more conservative than the progressive agenda they've been embracing and pushing.  
Lets take it back to Trump. His rhetoric wasn't Presidential and damaged some credibility people had to the system, but people catered to that and felt he was anti-establishment crusader. All the media is doing is fueling this by always presenting him on the news and criticizing him. What they're making him appear is for Trump to look like a common man figure thats hated by every other establishment elitist. 

  
Trump's affects has made demographically the GOP more diverse, multiethnic and more working class like I already mentioned. They're losing college educated suburban voters who tend to be more  wealthy and left leaning, and reject the Trump affect. The Democratic becoming more aligned with the coastal big city and suburban elite. So to say that the GOP will become racist white nationlist party is stupidly idiotic and overblown, and we've seen this in the past take place. After the civil rights era the Republican party despite losing northern voters and utilizing the southern strategy, they didn't become the party supporting segregation as this will be political suicide and lose voters. They catered to the South through conservative cultural values which remained to day which are more small govt, pro-gun, and christian religious values. Barry Goldwater and Reagan followed up on solidifying this. So it wouldn't make sense to say the GOP today is going to be a white nationalist racist party today when they didn't after the civil rights era. Clearly then being pro segregation after the civil rights era is going to cause you lose elections especially when you had wings in your party that supported the civil rights movement. Therefore I don't see this happening with the GOP today flirting with white supremacy, in a more diverse and racially counscious society.   
Party's beliefs are always shaped their voters demographics, and they change when their is a major demographic change of voters. There voter base has shifted from very white to increasingly multi-ethnic. This strategic change is very different from a decade ago when the party was supported more by big business corporations and suburban voters. As for The Democrats they've been catering more to the affluent or educated white liberal on social issues in which wokeness and polarization being their platform. That has largely alienated many of their coalition, white working class, hispanics, blacks and muslims voters who are more traditionally conservative. One could think Trump's anti muslim rhetoric and anti-immigrant ideology would backstab the GOP but it hasn't. GOP has largely been more culturally connected to these groups which is also the main reason why the wings of the party (RINOS, evangelicals, neolibs, Trumpers, small govt) have still been united despite dislike and opposition to the Trumpers of the party.  
Also lets focus on recent political events that political analysts think will hurt the GOP. Remember when everyone were saying that the Republicans were trying to restrict voting and become more increasingly authoritarian and anti democratic? There was an outcry from everyone, from the MSM, to corporations, to even the MLB. People were saying that this will further radicalize & alienate the GOP within itself, but this hasn't even took place. They were thinking that this will be a huge issue in the 2022 midterms but instead they took over the House, and also have mostly maintained governorship in the midterms. And no losses in key states that passed these voting laws. And with  flipping a governor seat in Nevada, a state that voted for Biden in 2020. I don't see anybody talk about voting rights as a major issue for the upcoming elections, not even the mainstream media themselves. 

  
The new issue that took up that culture war instead has been abortion after Roe vs. Wade was overturned. Media analysts are saying that Abortion will become a big issue in the 2024 election but that's overblown. I don't even think this will be a large talking point after the election as the average American's main issue has been the economy and inflation. Abortion is going to continue to be talked about but then fade away and end up more of an issue between the states unless the GOP passes somewhat a federal ban on abortion which would cause massive backlash.   


  
What I expect to take place for the Republican Party post-Trump is, as the old wing of the the dies out and leaves, the Trump wing remains and it becomes the majority symbol of the party. With Trump's ideas and policies being the platform. (Protectionist trade, anti-illegal immigration, stronger borders, anti-China, anti-big tech and wokeness).  Right after the disappointing result in the midterms members of the GOP have called on the GOP's elites to change and appeal demographically along with taking the populist rhetoric that Trump given them.  The gop memo: [https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20534328-banks-working-class-memo](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20534328-banks-working-class-memo)

  
As history shows , party's align and always appeal to their demographic voting base, they also adapt to the changes of the population.  

  
In conclusion 2016 changed American politics just as it did right after the War of 1812 (emergence of the Whig Party and end of the federalist), right after the Civil War and reconstruction (Radical Republicans taking hold of the party), right after the Great Depression (Increase in black voters for the democrats), and right after the Civil Rights era (GOP becoming southern centric, Democrats becoming the party for minorities). Demographic change occurs first before political economic change, which is what we're witnessing, a great party realignment. *2024 is going to be the next step in that party realignment. And I certainly think Trump played a big role in this change and mostly to the GOP's benefit.*  
I'm curious on any refutations and disagreements. And hope for a good discussion"

I think the trends in the US are terrifying and will have a catastrophic climax in the near future. Civil unrest seems to be at an all-time high due to a variety of factors. I am very left/libertarian leaning and I see right wing and liberal outlets promoting highly charged news, racial tensions on the rise, police brutality, class warfare, and identity politics taking center stage as major contributors.

The news. Headlines are what news outlets thrive on, and the more extreme or outrage-y drive traffic to the articles, meaning that positive and uplifting stories are either left in the dust or not written in favor of something more likely to increase engagement. This means that context and nuance are buried in favor of opinion pieces that cause people to be irritable or in despair. Reporting biases gear audiences to a place of discontent. I know this isn't necessarily a bad thing on its own, as this can be a catalyst for change, but given some sources and motivations, such as right wing media trying to cause change against ""wokeness"", this can ruin interpersonal relations as people begin to hate their fellow person. I know that politics has a massive presense in society, but when people see humans just existing as ""political"" or ""woke"", they can easily otherize humans into something not themselves, making it easier to hate.

Racial tensions. This is relatively self explanatory as white supremacists are pouring out of the woodworks to attack movements like BLM and policies like Affirmative Action. It makes it difficult to be a person like me, cis, white, male, and working in security. I know I make black people uncomfortable because without knowing me, they might be quick to assume I have white supremacist ideals or biases. Anecdotally, I had to pull aside a group of black kids at one of my posts because they were causing problems at the establishment, and I kept having to get onto them about what they were doing. I pulled them aside to explain how the actions they were engaging in were problematic for the establishment and why management kept having me get onto them. Basically a ""look, people are paying for a certain experience, and are complaining because you are getting in the way and being disruptive. If you want to be here, that is fine, but you have to follow the rules."" As I was talking to them, an older black gentleman walked by and stopped to listen to what I was telling them. He told me after they left that he appreciated the way I talked to them and handled the situation maturely, and he stuck by because he was a little nervous because he saw ""a white rent-a-cop talking to a group of black kids"" and he wanted to make sure that everything was on the up and up, which I totally get. We talked for a while about the state of police and race issues, and largely agreed on several positions.

Which brings me to my next point, police brutality. It is no secret that Law Enforcement is... problematic in the US. I know it isn't just the US, but my focus is here right now. Connecticut just had several hundred police busted for over 20,000 fake and falsified tickets over a several year time span. As phone footage and body cam footage is released we see a really dark reality for minorities in the US. People being murdered or beaten for a variety of reasons, dogs being released on people and uncontrolled, and militarization of the police force given budgets that far outweigh things like parks and recreation or mental health. These issues are felt nation-wide and the average citizen can do nothing to redress their grievances, or it further hurts them because the State backs the cops. Qualified Immunity has been abused to the point where cops can just violate your rights and get away with it because ""they couldn't have known they were violating your rights"". The average citizen is powerless against the police, which is by design. If a cop draws on me and I were to shoot in self-defense, I would have a greater degree of a burden of proof than a cop would if it were the other way around, or even if I didn't draw. We saw that with kids being murdered by police for toy guys or adults being murdered for a hairbrush that was assumed to be a weapon.

Class warfare. People are being kicked out of house and home due to wage stagnation and supression, while the rich just get richer. We can see a direct example of that concept with the Hollywood debacle. Streaming services are massively profitable, requiring next to no cost compared to the older ways of distribution, and yet shareholders are raking in profits while actors and writers are being paid less overall due to the elimination of residuals through the streaming model. Massive shifts in technological advancements result in more money being accumulated by those already at the top. While I can go on about the inherant flaws of a profit-driven economy, the real facts are that CEOs and investors are gaining net worth and value while every day citizens are struggling to get by. More and more Americans are living paycheck to paycheck because of these things.

Identity politics. For whatever reason, LGBT+ issues are now taking the forefront of the GOP's platform. ""Wokeness"" is something that they are now dedicated to fighting, with baseless accusations being thrown against these minority groups of grooming and pedophilia, with the rise of acceptance and more people feeling comfortable enough about coming out being used as evidence of a conspiracy to turn everyone trans and gay. Children taught that it is OK to be different are somehow being indoctrinated in to this cult of degenerate behavior. The falsified outrage against the minority groups is being used to motivate hate crimes against anyone who supports them. Are there discussions that can be had about the type of information and when it is appropriate? Sure, but this isn't their goal. It was not and never has been about ""protecting children"" evidenced by the anti-trans bills being passed nation-wide that are trying to ban or raise the age to 25.

There are other issues at play, like rising mass violence and conspiracy theories, but these are kind of my main focuses. I am terrified that we are going to see an unresolvable schism in American society that will lead to a civil war with a death toll higher than any war to date. The lines won't be as clean this time, since before, people were mostly aligned with their state. In this time period, I would be more likely to catch a bullet from my neighbor than someone from another state, as was the case in the Civil War we know from history. Please, restore my faith in our ability to avert this catastrophy and come to a better solution. Some of my positions, such as my ideology or views on minorities and trans, you will not be able to change, those aren't the focus of this CMV. I just don't want to be worried I wake up and hearing about the new Fort Sumter."

The first act was a mixed bag and the marketing was good. But the final act is extremely preachy, bitter, and quite frankly disturbing. Instead of Barbie and Ken realizing that their common humanity and coming to the understanding that they should treat each other as equals, the ending concludes that society is best when women rule.

Even before that, the ""patriarchal"" real world is an unhinged distortion of what even the most radical feminist might view the world as. They explicitly decry every interaction with men as potentially violent and portray pretty much all men as prowling perves. Its demeaning and grossly sexist (remember this is supposed to represent the real world). The Mattel scenes are also hilarious when you realize that Mattel's board is literally 90% female. So they quite literally altered facts about the real world to suit their radical agenda. 

There is also this insidious undercurrent of hating both traditional femininity and masculinity which I would argue is actually anti feminist. From the opening scene of the girls smashing the dolls, decrying the idea of motherhood or being a caretaker. To the jabs and bro-hood throughout the film.I think both femininity and masculinity should be celebrated as they both have positive attributes.

1,2023-07-23,"CMV: Major League Soccer should be structured like a European league system, not an American sport",u/adjectivenounnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1578ydj/cmv_major_league_soccer_should_be_structured_like/,changemyview,"It's very clear why MLS is structured the way it is: Sole-ownership with ""franchises,"" no promotion or relegation, and a salary cap with a limited number of designated players exempted. Like other professional sports leagues in America, it's set up this way for the benefit of the owners and sponsors, who want to make sure that only certain cities with large enough populations can compete.

However, this system also means that the league struggles to compete for talent with Europe, and the best players in the world look to the European leagues to make it. Unlike American sports, the US does not have a monopoly on ""soccer,"" so the top leagues remain in Europe.

Nate Silver recently described this as a ""[weird market inefficiency](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1682576641933950976?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet),"" but he's totally wrong. It was designed this way to reflect the way that American sports leagues operate, to attract investors (""franchise owner-operators"") without them worrying about the prospect of relegation, or having to compete with salaries in eg. the Premier League or La Liga.

Opening MLS up to promotion and relegation would not only make the league more fun, it would also increase the quality of players coming into the league. It would attract more investment into the ""grassroots"" levels of the game, providing more pathways outside of colleges and MLS academies for young talent to emerge. Moreover, ending sole-ownership and switching to a European-style ""club"" model instead of a ""franchise"" model and getting rid of the salary cap would allow American clubs to compete for talent directly with European teams.

Ultimately, and unlike Nate Silver's quite ridiculous suggestion, American clubs will never compete in the UEFA Champions League (I don't think he knows what the E stands for in U**E**FA). But if MLS changes their format to match the way the rest of the world does it, a combined all-Americas competition including clubs from South America, Central America and North America could be just as exciting and high-quality as European football, and would be fantastic for the global game and for American fans.

Apart from the self-serving interests of the owners, what are the arguments for keeping it the way that it is? Why wouldn't MLS fans want to have promotion and relegation? Why would they want to keep a salary cap and this seemingly arbitrary DP rule?"

Well, the easiest way to get an insecure person to 'feel good' and release some dopamine and feel a high is to compliment them.  Another way to make an insecure person feel good is to shower them with attention.  That's why for extraverts, compliments and attention go so far, even if the compliment is fake or attention is negative.  

For example, you can literally throw a bunch of hidden jabs and put downs to an extravert, but the attention they are getting overrides the fact that you actually aren't kind to them.  You can also give fake compliments to extraverts to trigger that high, even though you don't really mean it.  It's just being social.

In other words, extraverts are just insecure people that have learned to get fluffed up through attention and compliments.  In fact, they value feeling secure so much that they'd prefer that over being treated kindly - which is usually what introverts value. You can't fake kindness as easy as attention and complimenting another person.

That's why when an extravert meets an introvert, and the introvert doesn't give them attention, the extravert feels crappy on the inside because it triggers their insecurity.  They aren't getting that dopamine hit.  Meanwhile, when an extravert gives an introvert too much attention, the extravert isn't being kind and mindful and respecting boundaries.

CMV that extraverts are just highly insecure individuals that have learned to gain security through attention and fluffing and introverts are more secure and don't need the attention and fluffing so value kindness more.  Hence communication issues between the two."

I couldn't have put it better myself'.""

We live in an epoch when it is fashionable to always assume the least charitable reading of an opponents argument. Perhaps because on some level it makes us feel superior.

When a conservative says 'I am pro life', rather than considering the complex ethical, philosophical and scientific basis for their belief. The difficult questions about when life starts, and when human rights begin. People often jump to the knee jerk assumption that they are mysoginists or religious zealots purely driven by a will to control women.

Whenever a liberal says 'we should strive to be anti racist in policy making''. The knee jerk reaction is to assume they are anti-western, 'woke' or other derisive terms. Rather than assuming the more charitable reading that they are just looking at historical injustices that are still engrained in some areas of policy.

Even when people express a clear and logical argument for their beliefs. The charge is often levied that they are just 'dog whistling' to mask their secret communist/fascist beliefs.

Why do we allow this thinking to drive a wedge between people?

Why don't we start as a baseline that, unless they have directly expressed otherwise, we steel man arguments rather than straw man that.

If we truly believe in our causes, surely that shouldn't be a frightening prospect. And should allow us to engage more respectfully, and more convincingly to others still making up their minds."

The main reason is that they are more flexible. Unlike a human politician who tends to be set in their ways, a robot can be easily be reprogrammed for various political policies either through classical programming (opening up it's guts and reprogramming it) or through plug and play features that alter parts of their political policy stored in their brains, allowing them to adapt to change without their self interest getting in the way since they would not have AI and would just act out what is stored in their programmes. 

Moreover, it would help to make it easier to form political parties for better representation by reducing it to just one guy/girl and their robots rather than having a complicated party system.

Well, you ask, you just put power in the hands of those that make those robots? They are obligated to make those robots blank slates that are only uploaded with various political policies once they reach the hands of those political parties.

And what about those that prefer human politicians or want to run? Outlaw human politicians with a penalty of death or 20 years to life imprisonment.

The characters aren't big enough assholes to be enjoyable to watch like Always Sunny, but they're also not actually likeable.

Ross and Rachel's relationship is so awful and unnecessarily complex, yet it warps the entire show around them. It feels like they just make their personal drama a problem for the entire friend group every season, it's so very tiring and repetitive. It feels like the show barely progresses, it just slowly gets wackier as the writers go through hundreds of plots. The others have plenty of issues like this too, but these two are the main focus of the show and exemplify its issues the most. Maybe a large issue is my hatred of ""will they won't they"" plots because it just strings the viewer along in the most frustrating way, building towards some grand wedding towards the end of the final season everyone knows is coming. It just feels like an easy way to guarantee audiences will engage with one of your main plots and allows you to string them along indefinitely. Friends managed it for 10 seasons and people still think Ross demanding Rachel not follow her dreams to be with him is a romantic gesture.

The Office and P&R just have cringe millenial humour that absolutely doesn't work for me. A lot of it's based on how awkward characters are, with P&R characters all being some level of socially awkward and that's the whole joke. In The Office, it's how they're all kinda shitty and awkward, that's the whole joke. They do things with it, sure, but it has to be funny and interesting to begin with. Jim and Pam constantly bullying Dwight being a big easy example. He's a caricature of autism to a degree that almost feels offensive, and the extreme lengths they go to just to mess with him being shown as cute and quirky. Maybe it's just because I struggled to buy into the what the show was selling, but it came off as malicious harassment of a guy that's admittedly a pain to work with. But that makes it alright to hire a babysitter and spend hours learning morse code just to fuck with him. It's cute!

&#x200B;

Maybe it's because these shows are all a bit before my time and I just don't get it. Maybe a lot of this is coloured by the passing of time, like how Ross is a massive incel which has morphed from ""cute and quirky"" into ""borderline dangerous"" over the past 20 years or people that make watching the office their whole personality like others do for Disney and weed, but people still seem to enjoy these shows to this day.

1,2023-07-23,CMV: All weight loss/gain boils down to calories in/calories out,u/Amekyras,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/157gzgj/cmv_all_weight_lossgain_boils_down_to_calories/,changemyview,"First off, disclaimers: the title is phrased really provocatively and I'm not sure how best to not do that given format restrictions, but it's not meant to be aggressive. Also, if we could steer clear of moralising about body weight and explicit fatphobia that'd be awesome, cheers.

So basically, I don't really see how weight change can be anything other than CICO. Excluding things like haircuts, amputations, and liposuction, and that drinking a litre of water doesn't mean you gained a kilo etc - if you intake more calories than the body is using, that surplus is either excreted or converted to tissue. If you intake less, the deficit is made up for by stored fats, protein, glycogen, etc. 

This usually gets addressed by people pointing out that other factors exist, namely genetics, environment, current body composition, etc. And this is obviously true - obviously a 4' 9"" woman who commutes in her ca, has an office job where she doesn't leave her desk much, doesn't have time to exercise, and has PCOS or another condition affecting metabolism, is going to burn fewer calories than my 5' 11"" 19-year-old female student self, who walks a fair bit and is on ADHD medications that may slightly increase metabolism. And we're both going to be dwarfed by the 6' 6"" mid-20s gym bro who spends half his day in the gym and does marathons on the weekends. And that's not even bringing up access to quality, filling, cheap, easy to prepare food, and the myriad of other factors.

My problem is that I just don't understand when a news article will say 'this is why weight loss is more complicated than CICO!!!' and list the above factors. It's still CICO, just that we are not perfectly controlled variables who can know our exact input and output in a lab setting, we're human beings with lives and preferences and unique bodies that need more or less energy because of our size, composition, activity, efficiency etc. 

So yeah - is there some magic point that I'm missing that explains all of this? Has my autism just taken the 'it's not just CICO' statement too literally when it wasn't intended that way? Pls help :)"

It's simply impossible. But I feel very strongly about it nonetheless.

As a society I feel as though we have placed so much importance on sex that it has led us to treat each other poorly.

I know a lot of people who have experienced a lot of terrible things, and when I look at the core of it it almost always has to do with sex.

One of my close friends was drugged and raped at a party. She now has a boatload of deeply rooted trauma she has to work through, all because that monster decided he was too horny to control himself.

I‚Äôve known someone who willingly hooked up with a person that sexually assaulted her in a parking lot because he was ‚Äúcharming‚Äù and she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt resist him‚Äù. What he did to her suddenly didn‚Äôt matter, all because she was sexually attracted to him.

I‚Äôve seen people cheat because they prioritized sex over their own partner‚Äôs feelings. I‚Äôve seen people get cheated on and develop trust issues and insecurities because they felt they were not good enough to have sex with. I‚Äôve had people open up to me about how they were harassed and sexually abused. Sometimes last week, sometimes when they were children.

I‚Äôve experienced a mild case of sexual harrassment myself. It wasn‚Äôt traumatizing but looking back it was definitely something I should‚Äôve done something about instead of just letting it happen. The guy who harrassed me said ""this is the most sexual attention you're ever gonna get in your life"" before he groped me. He went on to do worse things to other people. If society didn't view sex as this badge of honor that people base their respect for you on, that probably would have never happened to me, and it would happen to other people far less.

I‚Äôve heard so many stories about people who cry during sex, or who can‚Äôt have sex because of trauma and end up getting left by their partners. There are so many children out there who have parents that don‚Äôt love them because they never wanted children and were too horny to care about whether they used protection or not. So many people have died to STD‚Äôs like AIDS.

People are so enamored by the pleasure that comes with sex that they‚Äôll go to such extreme lengths for it. Other people take advantage of sexual pleasure and use it to manipulate their partners by putting them down or hurting them. There are so many rapists and pedophiles and abusers and monsters in the world who will do horrible, sick things just so they can get their rocks off.

Sex makes babies and we need it. But people's desire for it creates so many problems. It‚Äôs hurt so many people in so many different ways.

The more I think about it the more it seems like society would be far better if recreational sex was looked down upon. There would be less rape, less infidelity, less pedophilia from people hurting children for their sick selfish desires. There would be less children in the world who don't feel loved. People would be less insecure. There would be less predatory business industries that prey on people's insecurities. So many pros. What are the cons? People have sex less often, & that's bad because sex feels good. That's it. That's the only con I can think of. There's a million other things that feel good. Why does sex have to be the one that we all fixate on? 

I'm not a prude. I don't feel uncomfortable or repulsed by the idea of sex. But logically speaking it just seems like if people didn't care as much about it, the world would be a better place."

This may be true in some cases but this isn't another easy case of powered fabric looms or ordinary computers boosting productivity.

In fact, I have a very hard time thinking of any job that isn't in jeopardy.  

Support, service, and maintenance roles seem obvious.  But what about anything information related?  We're seeing a big reaction in Hollywood now, with the shocking notion an actor or extra could be replaced by fake images.

I think it goes further here.  Writers and producers are probably in trouble if AI goes unfettered.  Have you tried letting ChatGPT or Bing have a go at creative writing?  Try, it will spit out something in seconds for any combination, scenario or premise you care to try.

Children are being caught handing in assignments written for them by Bing.  I think teachers themselves could wind up replaced by an AI interface.  Yep.

Journalists.  Writers of any sort. Artists and content creators of any kind.

Any kind of labour heavy resource work-farming, mining, logging, harvesting, physical maintenance of literally anything.

Judges, courts, lawyers, it's already the case these specific ones are leaning heavily on AI to cut their workload.

Basic engineering design.  Coding, websites.  An AI smart enough will write your code for you.  What's left for you to do?

Another rebuttal is AI cant' replace roles calling for judgment.  Can't it? We apply rules to situations to justify our decisions.  An AI can do an awful lot of that.

Any organization or company is going to face huge pressure to do it, to save money.  

There's too much hand-waving and reliance on history to assuage us.  I think AI is fundamentally different.  It isn't better in any respect.  

But it is sure as hell faster and cheaper.

They try to convince me that religion isn't necessary to be a moral person. Sure, I agree with this, because I believe that God has instilled some moral instincts on all of our hearts, and people can follow them even if they reject or are ignorant of God.

But if atheists / secularists are right? We're all just hyperevolved apes? Then it seems to me that morality can't actually exist, not in any meaningful way.

_______

- Many have tried to show how morality ""evolved"" to help us grow and flourish as a species. Okay, sure, these impulses could have evolved for that purpose through evolution, but then there's no reason I should follow those impulses today. We have lots of evolutionary impulses that we don't give in to when we calculate that it's not best for us.

-Some point out that there are many ""objective"" precepts which, if obeyed by everyone, lead to mutual flourishing, to get some sort of secular ""objective"" morality. But this would only prove why I should *work to brainwash/convince everyone else to subscribe to this code,* while I secretly cheat and lie and steal behind the scenes to gain an advantage on all these do-gooders in society. It would be just like that game show where the two people stand to gain the most money if they both chose the ""cooperate"" option. You try to convince the other person to sacrifice for the greater good and to cooperate, but you have no incentive or reason to do so yourself.

- Some say that even if this is all true we'd still have reasons to structure societies to protect the weak, etc. But this only gives us laws, not morals. This is just the *Leviathan* idea - before the ""social contract"" the big bag guys killed and robbed their way to the top, so to outdo them, people have to come together to make the biggest, baddest guy of all - the ""government,"" - to subdue these scoundrels. This just means morality is the will of the strong - the law of nature, which few secularists will accept.

- Some would argue that my account of morality isn't much better. But that doesn't really answer the dilemma. Most secular moral talk is full of claims about these ""rights"" of ""bodily autonomy"" and ""equality"" and all this stuff. I don't see any reason to believe in any of it. If there's no God to enforce the moral code, why can't we just acknowledge that it's all totally fake, chemical impulses that may have served our ancestors but which we should readily set aside if we stand to gain a little pleasure from doing so?

Take for example a man walking alone late at night with a huge stack of cash out in the open, he gets robbed, you'd agree it was partly his fault for taking such a big risk correct?

People often think that i automatically hate Jewish people. I don‚Äôt. You can be an Israeli Jew, which in this case, I probably won‚Äôt like you, but not coz of your religion. I really don‚Äôt mind Jews just like not minding any other religion. I respect all of them. But people who assume that hating a nation that is ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù is anti-Semitic, are very narrow-minded. I just dont understand how people can support Israel. It‚Äôs equivalent to me saying that I support Russia. Of course race plays a major factor here (Arabs are ofc the bad terrorists so no one gives a fuck about them), but I won‚Äôt get into that."

All the power to them. But by trying to empower *all* women, society is inadvertently putting a lot of pressure on women. Strong women are always celebrated and weak women are always looked down on. I think there is a tremendous amount of unspoken shame in any women even daring to dream about finding a decent man to protect them. But there will always be naturally weak women. Shy, timid, meek. And society is basically telling them to toughen up. That‚Äôs like telling an introvert to be an extrovert. Or telling someone who naturally sucks at math to get good at math. Everybody should live a life that best suits their natural temperament and skills. Their best course of action is to find a decent capable man who can take care of them. 

There is also nothing wrong with a man seeking a delicate woman to take care of. There is nothing wrong with a man who wants to be the provider for his family. We should be grateful for such men because it offers a solution to naturally meek woman. It offers a balance in the world.

To use a geeky analogy, it‚Äôs ok to be a support class. Not every gamer has to be a tank or dps. And not everyone is suitable to be a leader and make all the decisions. Some gamers just like to sit back and support the group. Just how there is pride in being the provider, there is also pride in being the supporter for the provider. Some women are naturally healers in an mmorpg and it‚Äôs my view that society should stop looking down on healers."
1,2023-07-23,CMV: It's near-impossible for a beautiful or slim person to not know that they're beautiful or slim.,u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/157obqr/cmv_its_nearimpossible_for_a_beautiful_or_slim/,changemyview,"I see a lot of beautiful or handsome people trying to claim/pretend that they don't know that they're attractive, and.......let's be honest, either there's some severe body dysphoria at work, or they live in some unusually-attractive region where most people around them have an above-average appearance (like the saying, ""a 9 in Kansas is only a 5 in Hollywood""), or else they are fishing for compliments. 

Over the course of a beautiful person's lifetime, they would experience hundreds, if not thousands, of encounters with people that would affirm the fact that they are attractive. They would get compliments, people would ask them out, they'd be told repeatedly as such, or other people would be nicer to them (""beauty privilege"" is a real thing; just ask an ugly server, cashier or some other customer-service worker how they get treated compared to their attractive coworkers). 

Now, to be sure, of course, some of these encounters may not necessarily be the kind of affirmation anyone would **want** \- for instance, no beautiful woman wants to be followed home at night by some creepy stalker stranger who's smitten with her lovely looks, even if that affirms her beauty. But at least there can't be *doubt* about it. 

And, of course, everything's on a scale. Someone who is a 9 may mentally downgrade their esteem of their own looks down to a 6 or 7 (and all of this is subjective anyway) - but there's no way they could be so blind as to think that they are a 1 or 2. (Yes, the whole one-to-ten rating scale is deeply flawed, but sometimes it's the best way to convey a concept in the simplest terms.)

It's the same with fat: There's no way a 110-pound adult can seriously think they're ""fat"" - not unless they're raised in a family or society with utterly unrealistic expectations, or they have anorexia nervosa, bulimia or some eating disorder.

All we know is that the decision was hers to keep the baby, and the sex that impregnated her is so horny that the risk of having to drop out of school if she keeps it didn‚Äôt hold them back.

But it seems to me that it does have benefits.

I read about it projecting violent views on sex and all sorts of issues that later materialize in disgusting behavior of men towards women. But most of those seem to emphasize violent videos or videos with actors of very young age, etc. 

It is also intertwined with human trafficking, which is even worse than the stuff above. 

But both issues above could presumably be tackled with strict regulations. 

But it's unavoidable that there is always gonna be a large subset of men rejected by women. Masturbation is the only way to satisfy a biological need for them, and consensual porn allows to not imagine the women you know while doing that. I am a guy, but I suppose the majority of women would be very grossed out that their friend/coworker/classmate/etc thinks of them while rubbing out. And neither would I feel good, if put in this position, to imagine a girl ego has 0 interest in me. Consensual porn allows to make it a paid service where women who don't mind it allow men not to degrade the image of women they know and allow women not to be subject of perverted fantasies. Or at least allow that to happen more rarely. 

And the worse outcome of removing porn is even more frequent cringe pickup attempts, even more stalkers, even more street rape, etc. Obviously the majority of men would never do that, but the small ""active"" minority would more than make up for this. Idk how this effect could be measured, but it's disregarded for some reason. 

Isn't porn doing bringing some good by preventing this all? Why is it not regarded as an industry that can potentially be good and needs regulation?

Pediatricians have suggested using weight loss drugs like Metformin or Wegovy to tackle obesity in kids as young as 12. The FDA has approved this. Much like the arguments for puberty blockers, some doctors feel like the health concern of obesity is better addressed earlier with pharmaceuticals than later.

But if you recognize pharmaceutical intervention as a viable prescription for gender dysphoria in children, why not extend the same rationale for body dysmorphia and not just the BMI standards of obesity? 

Both body image issues can lead to depression and suicide in youths.

If a 12 year old feels like they‚Äôre fatter than they want to be, has body image issues, tries to lose the weight but can‚Äôt, should we make weight loss drugs more accessible to kids?

My own opinion is that both societal body standards (Read: fatshaming) and gender norms produce body dysmorphia and gender dysmorphia for people who don‚Äôt neatly fit into these boxes. 

I think pharmaceuticals enable these norms to persist via a magic bullet solution rather than the much harder work of changing paradigms of both our society and the affected individuals."

1,2023-07-23,CMV: The Free Use kink is just another way for men to subjugate women in the name of sexual liberation,u/mylackofselfesteem,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/157tnyi/cmv_the_free_use_kink_is_just_another_way_for_men/,changemyview,"I was responding to a comment thread in offmychest and saw a lot of other comments seemed to hold the opposite of my long held views on Free Use kinks. This is mostly what I commented with a little light editing to make it more legible. 

Basically, in case you need more detail about free use, it‚Äôs a kink employed a lot of times in dominant/submissive relationships, and can include scenarios like the wife cooking, cleaning, or doing anything really, and the other person gets horny and will just come up and stick their fingers in them, or/then bend them over and start fucking them. Maybe some women are wet all the time, but I have to imagine they are dry at the start a lot, as this kink does not specifically include warm-up, foreplay, or even asking within its parameters. It can happen, but it‚Äôs not the main component. I definitely view it as CNC and rape adjacent. 

I‚Äôm also not discussing free use in the sense that you wake someone up with oral (though that can lead to the same feelings of guilt if you say no that I mention down below) as that at least starts with foreplay and doesn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. 

One issue (and this issue exists in a lot of kink-defined relationships ime) is the fear that if one chooses to safe word out, they might feel guilt that they‚Äôre ‚Äònot up-holding the free use agreement‚Äô. I‚Äôve personally seen bad dominant‚Äôs get all shitty and pouty about this and other similar scenarios. So if you‚Äôre afraid of making your dom mad by saying no, (because you‚Äôve agreed to free use, or whatever kink), then is that really consensual? Or is it just something you put up with to stay in the relationship?

It also seems like it would be very easy to slip into an unequal relationship dynamic with this kink. As it definitely needs to be thoroughly talked about, regularly reviewed, and done between two people with very similar libido‚Äôs. How often is this truly the case? How good is peoples communication, really, even in the BDSM community?

I‚Äôve seen women on the Internet say they love free use, that they‚Äôre always revved up and ready to go, but it‚Äôs hard to take that seriously because 1) again, what woman is wet all the time (disregarding some sort of bacterial infection?) and 2) people on the Internet lie all the time, so are these even women? If they are women, are they just fantasizing? 

I‚Äôve also seen doms brag about using their free use agreement while their wife is sick, or when they‚Äôre nursing their baby or otherwise caring for them. Which I think is gross, and has probably negatively colored my view of it.

As to the crux of the matter, I think it‚Äôs gotten increasingly common for shitty men to claim this is their ‚Äúkink‚Äù because they want to go back to the 1950s where women couldn‚Äôt say no because marital rape didn‚Äôt exist yet and if she left she would lose everything. So for bad actors, it allows them to further control women, only this time in the name of ‚Äòsexual liberation‚Äô. And, of course, we‚Äôre not supposed to shame peoples kinks anymore, so they‚Äôre getting away with it, and if a woman pushes back she‚Äôs deemed not open enough, or not supportive enough. This creates another situation where you might feel guilt or shame for saying no, because who wants to be known as someone who ‚Äòyucks another‚Äôs yum‚Äô?

In conclusion, I am wary of any man who claims that he has a free use kink, and I view it as a red flag. Other people seem to disagree about that, so change my view?"

I grew up in the LDS faith and had a unique view of the same-sex marriage debate. Admittedly this is a very tough temptation for me‚Äî I have a very strong case of same-sex attraction and love the way guys make me feel. That said, I still believe the act, rather than the temptation, is a sin. Here is why:

1. Most of the world religions warn against homosexuality. For whatever reason, homosexual behavior must have presented some anthropological disadvantage historically. Some obvious reasons include the arrangement not being procreative in nature and the destabilization of the family unit. I posit that we still don‚Äôt fully understand the unintended consequences of embracing homosexuality on a societal level. 

2. LGBT folks, gay men especially, face unique challenges. Sexual access is abundant and is unrestrained by female selectivity. This in part results in the proliferation of sexually transmitted diseases and sexual promiscuity. Open relationships and aversion to commitment create emotional harm for those involve. 

3. I believe each human has a deeply encoded moral intuition that can help discern moral permissibility. Even though I know that these feelings are very real and ostensibly wholesome, I still feel deep down that same sex behavior is not aligned with my ideal self. Opponents often insist that this anecdotal feeling is simply collateral damage from religious indoctrination, however, I feel that greatly delegitimizes the shame I feel when I indulge on these temptations. It seems to be more than just internalized homophobia. 

I have never had sex with or dated someone of the same sex. I have done more wholesome things such as kissing and cuddling, and while they feel undeniably good, I still feel that deep down it is wrong and not what God wants for his children. I recognize that I am somewhat hypocritical in this stance. 

I apologize if any of this comes off as judgmental towards LGBTQ folk. I love them as my brothers and sisters and know their situations are very real and complicated. I love them and admire their incredible compassion and empathy, and believe emphatically that they make the world a much better place. 

I am open to new perspectives and hope we can keep the dialogue civil."
1,2023-07-23,CMV: Men Should Never Tell A Woman How They Feel Unless They Are 100% Certain It Is Reciprocated,u/Donny-Bandish,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/157ul74/cmv_men_should_never_tell_a_woman_how_they_feel/,changemyview,"i think it goes without saying that women are at a clear advantage in the dating game. they‚Äôre constant recipients of male attention, fielding amorous advances from men wherever they go. whether it‚Äôs a lingering glance or a more direct form of courtship, women are never at a loss of choices for to date. this includes women who are average or below average; unlike ugly males, their female counterparts are still recipients of frequent attention from dating prospects.

So, when it comes time to finally reveal to a woman how you feel - whether it‚Äôs one with whom you‚Äôve been friends for years, or someone you‚Äôve been dating for a few months - i think it is in the best interest of men who don‚Äôt want to left holding the proverbial bag to wait until they‚Äôre absolutely certain what they‚Äôre about to reveal will be reciprocated.

even if you‚Äôve been intimate, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean she cares about you on that level. i think heartbreak in men would significantly diminish if they waited until the objects of their love made some kind of overture that clearly indicated she felt something for you."

Just like when someone says they have an ‚Äúaverage body type‚Äù they typically don‚Äôt mean severely overweight despite that being the average body type) 

So I know the biggest thing people will say is the power of fitness. And I don‚Äôt think that can push you passed your cap. I don‚Äôt think a person born a 5 can become a 9 by virtue of getting in shape. This is because in order for someone to be an 8, they need a much better starting position. Especially for fitness to being them up. 

Getting in shape is beneficially but only only so much and in certain cases. It‚Äôs less that getting in shape helps and being out of shape hurts. If someone is morbidly obese that drops them down significantly. Transitioning from obese to at least normal weight and body fat level is a jump enough to take someone back to normal. 

This is because of how much fat loss changes the face shape. If define the jawline and thins cheeks the body benefits are secondary. That‚Äôs why most fat celebrities that are considered attractive don‚Äôt have fat faces. Just fat bodies. Once a persons body type crosses over to fit, that‚Äôs when they start going up but only so much.

Muscle mass does weird things to your body depending on your proportions. Short guys look blocky, average guys can still look pudgy, and tall guys can look scrawny. In order for muscle mass to dramatically improve the way you look, your body has to be shaped right. If not it‚Äôs not going to help. Ideally if you‚Äôre tall putting on a lot of muscle and becoming sculpted will help a shit ton. Otherwise your ability to become more attractive is capped at about a 6 or 7.

Other cosmetics whichbpeoole also say help (dress, hair, makeup, skincare etc) I believe help, but still are dependent on the way your body and head is shaped. Dress and hair especially. Hair growth is genetic of course and for men we can lose our hair and then just be a permenant 0 for the rest of our lives. Facial hair is also something genetic and out of our control. Even if you can, skull shape determines what looks good. Like simply having a pronounced forehead makes it so you can‚Äôt be more than a 5.

For clothes and makeup, we‚Äôve all heard you can‚Äôt put lipstick on a pig. Your clothes can‚Äôt fix the way you look as they change nothing about you. If it did, I could put on Channing Tatum‚Äôs clothes and be almost as hot as him. But that‚Äôs crazy right?

That‚Äôs my point, cosmetics won‚Äôt change a thing if your genetics aren‚Äôt optimal to begin with."
1,2023-07-23,"CMV: Modern Afrocentrism is toxic to the ""black"" community.",u/dwedhako,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/157wz0l/cmv_modern_afrocentrism_is_toxic_to_the_black/,changemyview,"*A quick disclaimer before reading:* ""black"" with a lowercase 'b' is referring to the racial category and Black with an uppercase 'B' is referring to the Black ethnic group in America.

For the record, I am a phenotypically black, mixed-raced Kenyan-American who grew up in the States. My makeup is split down the middle with my European lineage (50%) being Celtic and Iberian, and my African lineage (50%) being Nilotic. My majority ethnic identity lies with the Luo people of Kenya. 

Admittedly, I identify as an Afrocentrist... but the term that it was at its origins, not the term of today. The definition of yesteryear encouraged black people in the diaspora to be proud of their African roots. Today mainstream Afrocentrism has Black supporters claiming that ""we"" were the original Jews, Vikings, or the original people of the Americas (Native Americans), of Australia (Aboriginals), of Egypt, etc; but the question to ask is: when did black people become a monolith? 

*Sidenote:* I am not discrediting the fact that there are Ethiopian Jews. 

Respectfully, ""we"" do not exist. Africa is a huge continent comprised of over 3,000 indigenous ethnic groups... lumping everyone with ""sub-Saharan"" lineage is absolutely insane and a by-product of racist ideology. Irish people should not claim the ancient civilizations of France. Spanish people should not claim the ancient civilizations of ancient Germanic civilizations. Black Americans should not claim the ancient civilizations of the entire African continent. 

Moving on to why I am invested in this discussion: the claim that ancient Egypt was ""black""... well duh. The various **Nilotic** tribes indigenous to the Nile valley have incredible ties and contributions to ancient Egypt and other ancient civilizations like Nubia and Kush. This is not me saying that modern-day Egyptians don't have ties to ancient Egypt as well... look at the geographical location and the history of invasion. Egypt has been a mixed society for thousands of years thanks to the admixture of European, Levantine, and Nilotic farmers. Admixture happened prehistorically.   


*Sidenote:*  this is not me saying Cleopatra was black... in my opinion, at most, she was mixed-raced, as her mother is unknown; however, Cleopatra represented her Macedonian lineage as an occupier of ancient Egypt under the Greek empire. 

Obviously, with a Nilotic lineage, I feel personally attacked when false claims of ancient ancestry of Egyptian, Nubian, or Kushite are made. I feel the same way as I would imagine Jews, Natives, or other ethnic groups listed above would. My annoyance comes from some Black Americans spitting mainstream Afrocentric ideology and saying ""we,"" when your ancestors are most likely responsible for other amazing ancient civilizations like the Mali Empire, the Yoruba Empire, and other West African powerhouses. With such rich history of your own, why claim other's roots? 

Imagine, 1,000 years from now when Black Americans have made their own gene pool, when the American civilization as we know it is no more, and your descendants are living in a place where other people who phenotypically look like you are claiming the Black American story... even if their roots are continents or oceans away. How much sense does that make? 

Better yet, what if America decides to give reparations to descendants of slavery (something I am in full support of), but every ""black"" person living in the US gets an equal handout? Meaning less for those whose ancestors were actually affected.  

Lumping ""black"" history together is erasure and it needs to be stopped.   


Know thyself.   
Peace!  


P.S. - Now my challenge of modern mainstream Afrocentrism is not an invitation to attack Black Americans in a derogatory way, but to challenge the way we view our ethnic identities vs. racial categories. 

\*\*\* ""Sub-Saharan"" and ""black"" are in quotations are words that, although still heavily used, are often looked down upon in higher education academic settings because of their ties to racism and racist ideologies. "

Yet I think there is a hidden element in all of this. Thanks to conservative policies wealth inequality has reached all new highs and will eventually lead to a general collapse of the economy. As we know rich people simply don‚Äôt consume enough goods to sustain an economy, and their money is simply hoarded in vacant properties and land, and any number of assets. 

As money and resources are funnelled and hoarded upwards the general population can spend less as their wealth is stripped from them and they will cut back on extras first. So this will result in people watching less movies/shows which will then destroy the entertainment industry so tough luck for anyone holding Disney shares! Then people won‚Äôt eat out more so goodbye restaurants! Hope you don‚Äôt have any shares in McDonald‚Äôs! Follow this logic and soon people will be stuck existing on the bare minimum leading to the collapse of many industries, cars will become unaffordable so goodbye pollution from vehicles and the factories that make them. 

Apple will be one of the first companies to go I reckon as when regular people can‚Äôt afford iPhones they‚Äôll go belly up. Bye bye Apple shares. So all that terrible cobalt mining will stop.

When people ask you if you had a gf and you say ""nah"" then they all get confused and start to treat you like an alien. It is as if it was obligatory to find a partner the same way it is obligatory to change tires an a car. It is everywhere. The whole concept of ""love"" is skewed. Finding love for the sole reason of not being left behind is has nothing to do with it at all because ""loving"" someone is valuing that specific person and not having that person as a means to an end. It is actually quite ironic when you contrast that with number of romantic books and movies. What most people actually want is sex hidden behind series of learned niceness and deeds.  
For me it's useless to exert myself like that, too much hassle for something so ephemeral. I won't pretend that I am a very romantic person. Feelings quickly go away and people are together out of sentiment and fear of being alone. Sex is treated like 1# must have experience but your average person does not even look like in porn.

Transitioning and causing irreversible changes to your body when you don‚Äôt have gender dysphoria is just as damaging to your mental health and should be taken just as seriously. Let them wear whatever they want, play with what they want, change their name, change their pronouns, socially transition, anything but hormones and surgery until they are old enough to make that decision themself.   
  
I had never even heard of de-transitioners until the past year and they are increasing more and more at an alarming rate, this shouldn‚Äôt be happening, no one should regret this choice. Suicide rates are just as high among trans individuals AFTER transitioning than before transitioning. This means transitioning isn‚Äôt always the answer and doing it could be just as damaging. You should be challenged on these views to make sure you‚Äôre 100% making the right decision.  
  
In some states trans adults are now being denied medical treatment they've been having for years, this is absolutely disgusting.   
  
This new movement is hurting genuine transgender and transexual people. Trans support is at the lowest it has been in years and I‚Äôm honestly not surprised, the new left activism is just as bad as extremist, far right Christians, live how I live, believe what I believe, change your views and language for my beliefs. The new activism is violent and aggressive and it‚Äôs disgusting to see you undo so much of the work the lgbt+ community has done. This has never been our way of activism and protesting.   
  
Literally no one cared about sharing a bathroom or female only spaces with trans women until this self id law. So you‚Äôre telling me that a man who has made 0 effort to surgically, medically or socially transition can LEGALLY become a female and be allowed into our bathrooms, public changing rooms (with children), domestic and sexual violence shelters, prisons and we‚Äôre bigots and terfs if we don‚Äôt want this. There are men who get horny wearing women's clothes, it‚Äôs a kink and they‚Äôre allowed in our spaces. There are men who are predators and will use whatever they can to their advantage to get close to potential victims, they are allowed in our spaces. We are bigots and terfs if we oppose this. This has already happened since the law was passed, it will continue to happen.  
I know womens safe spaces aren‚Äôt already protected and women have already been abused in them but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm okay and comfortable giving the wrong people easier access.   
  
From a very quick search on a very biased google  
Bathroom - https://nypost.com/2017/10/20/transgender-woman-convicted-of-sexually-assaulting-girl/  
Prison - https://amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/25/trans-woman-isla-bryson-guilty-raping-two-women-remanded-in-female-prison-scotland

Shelters- https://www.foxnews.com/world/trans-woman-crawled-bed-assaulted-female-resident-womens-shelter-police.amp  
I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt like my sources, there‚Äôs multiple articles from different sources. You‚Äôre more than welcome to go read more yourself. 

No, before you all start I do not think trans people are predators or dangerous people, I have never cared or given it a second thought sharing female spaces with them, I do not care what adults do with their body and life, live and let live. I think MEN who are predators and dangerous will use the self id law to benefit them and get closer to victims.   
  
Jessica Yaniv (trans woman) who is a creep, sued and got a female owned beautician shut down because the owner was uncomfortable waxing her dick and balls. Self ID laws allow this. Is this okay?  
  
The self id law is the whole reason bathroom laws have come in and now fully transitioned trans people can't use the bathroom they identify with. This law is destroying trans rights. Self id, gender affirming care and transitioning minors is not the hill to die on.  
  
No one cared until self affirming care. No one cared until minors were easily getting medication and then surgery. No one cared until self-id.  
The fact that women are being shamed and silenced when we speak of our concerns of this new law further proves we should be concerned. We have been abused, raped and murdered by males for all of time, we are allowed female only spaces. We are not bad people or transphobic for this. We don‚Äôt want to take any chances on giving predators easier access to us.  
  
I will be shocked if my opinion even gets approved even though there is literally no transphobia in here. 

I blindly followed along side of this movement for years thinking I was doing the right thing, but after doing my own research, challenging my beliefs and listening to trans women/men who disagree with what's happening I cannot support this stuff.

Rights that took years to make are being destroyed because of this.

But everything feels like too little, too late. I have a nephew that's going to be born before the end of the year, but with how the world is going, >!I almost hope that my sister miscarries so that he isn't born into such a cruel and chaotic world without even having the chance to see that wonderful things it has to offer.!< And I know that is a horrific and cruel thing to say or even think about, but I just can't imagine a good future for him if everything is burning, flooding and dying, especially with the unprecedented global biodiversity loss. Obviously, nothing bad is going to happen that'll jeopardize the health of my nephew. When he is born, I will make sure he is loved, cherished, kind and teach him fun things and take him to fun places.  
I know that today, the world is far safer and nicer compared to last century and centuries before it. But how long will that last before the mass migration of hundreds of millions of people? You'd think conservatives would be in favor of protecting the climate to prevent this mass migration. I know the heatwaves this year will end eventually, but how long is this El Ni√±o period going to last? How bad is it going to become in the next El Ni√±o? I hate the fact that I'm Gen Z having to deal with this. I hardly have any power compared to the aging fossils with all of it. As stupid and unreasonable as it sounds, I hate being young in today's world. I sometimes wish I was born in the 1950s or 1940s or some time period where I wouldn't have to deal with all this shit, even though I know for a fact that the world is safer today than any period in history.  
I know alarmism sells, but if I'm informed, I panic. If I ignore the news, I panic even more because I am unaware of the world around me. I've tried cutting as much screen time for myself as possible, I've gone on long nature hikes, I've touched grass, I've gone to therapy, I take prescribed medication, I've taken up as many hobbies as possible to distract myself, I've spent as much time as possible with loved ones, I've done as much as I can to reduce both my own and others footprints, I've made a point to vote and help others vote. But this catastrophe keeps eating away at me inside like a cancer and it won't stop no matter what I do it's like being consumed from the inside out. Not to mention the rise of right-wing parties in Europe and God knows what's going to happen there and also how the right-wing is becoming emboldened in the States.  
I just don't know what to do anymore, the world around me feels like it's dying and I'm miserable. And none of my loved ones understand what I'm going through, the people around me are proceeding with life as usual and I can't understand how they can be so casual about it. I can't live in the now if the future is so bleak. It doesn't matter if I live in a place that'll be relatively unaffected, I can't help but cry for the people in different parts of the world, I can't help but cry for the little kids I see playing on the street, I can't help but cry for the multitude of species around the world hitting endangered, critically endangered, and extinct statuses. I'm tired, I'm scared, I'm angry, I'm frustrated, I'm doing all that I can to hold on for the sake of the lives I care about but I'm in such a horrific state of despair that nothing I do to try to alleviate it helps. Please, someone, tell me it's going to be okay. Please tell me that I'm overreacting. I don't want to live in this world as a young person if it's only going to become so horrific that it becomes unrecognizable.  
Please change my view."

1,2023-07-24,CMV: The Way the American School System Functions is Absolutely Detrimental to our Children.,u/Local-Tea8631,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1581dha/cmv_the_way_the_american_school_system_functions/,changemyview,"Ill start off by saying that I‚Äôm 17 and I am not yet finished with school, so I have  very up-to-date experiences with our current school system. I also live in Indiana so how my school(s) function may be different from other fellow Americans from other states.

Alright so my view is that how our school system works is horrible for our kids and dare I say, our society as a whole. Let me explain. It has been scientifically proven that children and teens need more sleep than adults (https://www.uclahealth.org/medical-services/sleep-disorders/patient-resources/patient-education/sleep-and-teens#:~:text=Teens%20are%20at%20an%20important,teens%20from%20getting%20enough%20sleep.) Waking up for school at around 7:30 to 8 is too early and with the factor of homework playing into everything, it seems to be pretty much impossible to actually be able to go to sleep at a reasonable time so that I can get up and be healthy and happy and alert for the next day. When I‚Äôm mentally and physically exhausted, the last thing that I or ANYONE else that experiences this needs is waking up early to go to an uncomfortable environment and immediately start using their brains. Being sleep deprived makes everything harder i.e. listening and learning. 

The environment is subpar and promotes conformity more than education. If you are like me than you cannot sit in a plain, cold, uncomfortable, and bright room while having to learn just by listening to a mundane voice and writing things down on paper or a laptop and possibly learn anything at the same time. I need more than just that, and I need a sense of motivation to make me feel like I want to learn. I feel like people that cannot just sit there and take in information like a robot just gets neglected. I felt like I was absolutely stupid and no good because I couldn‚Äôt remember things or do well on a test because I couldn‚Äôt sit there for hours studying. My self loathing got so bad to a point where I was suicidal and got sent to a hospital for a week. No one needs to feel like this, especially a young teen.

Bullying is so bad and so casual and not taken seriously in schools. Kids get made fun of for things they cannot control. It‚Äôs hard to understand how people can be so horrible and not care about other classmates and do things knowing that it‚Äôs silently destroying the victim inside. It‚Äôs worse knowing that nothing really seems to get done about it. 

The food is horrible. For a place where kids are meant to be taken care of and helped and wanted to be healthy, they sure do feed kids like shit. Kids need to be healthy to be happy and to be energized and to be willing to learn. When you are feeding them garbage then you are messing them up and making some of them even more depressed. 

All in all, when you are forced to learn things and you have to do it in a way that you may not be able to learn with and when you are constantly ridiculed by classmates, and you have to eat horrible food, and get made to feel like your stupid and no one cares, you don‚Äôt tend to be a happy teen and grow up to be a healthy adult. 

There are unfortunately many MANY more problems that could be talked about, like how lots if kids feel unsafe and fearful of a random act of violence happening, but if that was all discussed in this post it would be more like a book than anything. If you want to, please talk more about how you feel and what other problems you think there are."

My issue with the idea, however, is that it does not check out at all: if you say ""Oh, this character is bad is their personality could be boiled down to just being gay/black/etc., and that is bad"", your issue is not with ""wokeness"", but with bad writing. By hyper fixating so much on the idea of ""woke"", you do what you accuse the creative work of doing in the first place. ""Wokeness"" can only be a problem if you think that ""wokeness"" itself, if you wish, is fundamentally bad for writing - that would imply that you just want less gay/black/etc. characters in your work. I imagine that most people will say no, and that they just want ""well-written characters"", but that goes back to my point - the issue at hand is writing then, not this whole woke thing.   
What bugs me the most is that queer folk had, like, the word for it for ages: queerbaiting. Or, you know, racebaiting for racial things. Point being, this concept of ""wokeness"" that people of, usually, more conservative nature tend to use is not even new, the phenomenon had a word for a long time: the issue that I have, however, is that the term queerbaiting implies fault on the side of the work (as in, they wrote a gay/otherwise character simply to pull in those good karma points) while the concept of woke implies that those ""woke things"" are fundamentally bad. The argument as a whole is flaud, and is just another example of far-right idealogy sneaking its way into a liberal mindset.   
Long story short, the term woke, even if it had a meaning before, is now a complete memetic virus and needs to be scrubbed from our terminology. As far as I am concerned, anyone who uses the word woke unironically is either disingenuous, bigoted, or just not smart. "

If you shot a man while he was asleep square in the brain, you're still killing him. You can't just say ""It was a painless death"" to the cops. 

The bacon on your plate probably went through more pain than the dog you saw getting cooked on video in Vietnam or something. Sure, it may seem cruel to slaughter a dog for it's meat, but know that that dog is no different from your lunch.

It's a popularity contest that places results second, and (sadly) directs political parties to put forward candidates that will primarily be best at winning over people's affection, and only secondly how good they will actually be at their job.

*Having said that, I acknowledge that often who gets put forward is a more complex topic than this, such as understanding that inter-party politics play a role, the candidate being put forward does not even necessarily need to be best as they'd have the entire party apparatus to do the work (it's how I see Biden, I digress). But for this CMV, I kindly ask you to not to focus too much on this, as my view is primarily about at what point in the democratic process should people get to vote.*

Therefore:

**1)** Instead of voting to get candidates elected, I believe whoever is currently serving in office (presidents, ministers, etc.) should have their term analyzed and put forward to the public, and have the public then vote for that politician to stay in office or vacate the position.

If the public were to vote for the politician to vacate the position, the position is then ceded to someone who is put forward by the government. And I say the government because if you recall from the title, I sad ""no political parties"". Here's why:

**2)** If political parties would remain, this system would not work, as there would be no democratic mechanism to decide who is next in line. Our current answer to this problem would be elections - but I'm here talking about a system that has no public elections to get people into office. So what then?

In a no-party government, politicians in office would organize themselves, allocate who does what themselves, from within, just like how a political party currently operates ... so the systems for that are already in place and running. Just how parties elect their presidents of the party and so on themselves internally, so too would this new no-party government system work. It's nothing revolutionary really.

These internally elected government officials would then do their terms, and once their terms are up, and results of their work can be seen and judged, elections to validate their continued service to the people are organized - and people go to vote if they want the same people to continue to run the country or not.

I believe each political party, as a whole, strives to manage itself as efficiently as possible, and therefore who is put in charge within each party (unlike who they put forward for public elections necessarily) is to a significant degree a meritocratic decision, otherwise it would sooner or later impact the party negatively. I see no reason a no-party government would operate in a much different way, and so I would trust the government to place in office capable politicians - who will then either prove themselves or not, and who's continued service will be enabled or not by the votes of the people.

I appreciate this way of thinking will rub some people the wrong way, however I hope we can all approach this with an open mind. I am sure we can all agree our democracy is not perfect and discussing potential improvements should be encouraged. I am certainly willing to be educated about flaws in my idea.

I‚Äôve seen a growing number of stories about people refusing to give up their seats, and being proud of it as if they‚Äôve held their ground against an unreasonable demand. 

Of course, noone should be compelled to move from their assigned seat, and noone should be expected to give up their window seat for a middle seat, but if you would just be moving to an equal seat, and all it would cost you is to walk a bit more, then you‚Äôre a bit of a dickhead for denying people the chance to sit together.

Benefits of this idea 

* almost every  other industry does this, from construction contractors to restaurants to tire  shops 


* reduces price gouging by allowing patients to price match other hospitals

* hospitals would be required to charge a standard fee for an operation, regardless of complications, thus shifting risk onto them

* allows patients to view and object to inflated bills before service 

* forces hospitals to stay ethical with their billing practices instead of being deceptive and dishonest with hidden fees

There would obviously be an exception for unconscious or incapacitated patients who are unable to provide consent"

He also filed a whistleblower complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, meaning he is going through the correct legal process and is not whistleblowing illegally like Edward Snowden. Grusch will testify under oath before the House Oversight Committee in a bipartisan hearing on Wednesday (remember, perjury is illegal and carries a punishment of jail time).

Since then, we have heard from Senator Marco Rubio (a member of the Gang of Eight) and seen in a press release by the Senate Democratic Caucus that numerous other whistleblowers (described as a ‚Äòvast web of individuals‚Äô) have come forward with similar claims, and have provided credible testimony and evidence to support them. This has led to Senator Chuck Schumer (the most powerful man in Congress) unveiling a bipartisan bill called the UAP Disclosure Act, which will create a commission to declassify all government records relating to UAPs and non-human intelligence, described as a ‚Äòcontrolled disclosure plan‚Äô. The bill makes frequent reference to ‚Äòlegacy programs‚Äô which are defined as programs which retrieve, study and/or reverse-engineer UAPs and biological evidence of non-human intelligence. This lends credence to the claims made by David Grusch and the other whistleblowers, and I do not believe Schumer would unveil a bill with such incredible wording if he had not been shown clear evidence.

I am well aware that this topic has a lot of stigma attached to it and unfortunately I am expecting some ridicule and insults for posting this, but I genuinely want to have a debate about this and believe it is time the public takes this issue more seriously."

I am certain that Joy in real life was a complete shrew based on the movie AND based on articles I read to compliment the movie.  
Or maybe it's confirmation bias. Unsure.  
Anyway, Joy was portrayed all throughout the film as this perpetual victim, even though she's supposed to be this feminist superhero.  
There was nothing empowering about her. She put her family at risk for some crappy mops, causing the family to lose their house.  
She wanted everyone to put their whole ass on the line for these mops, which failed (initially). I know they eventually made a killing, but it was an idea conceived in her victimhood mentality.  
Also, the flashbacks of her younger days was simply cringe, especially when they were showing the days of her marriage.  
Here's her husband, who works two jobs and has a dream to become a singer, as he gets mocked by his wife and his father-in-law for his dreams.  
One day, he's too sick from working his moonlight job that he can't work his day job.  
Joy invalidates his sickness (""You're not sick, you're hungover"") and demands he get in his car and go to work when he's in no condition to do so, and then cries victim when Tony doesn't roll over and comply, which eventually leads to divorce.  
Joy is not a doctor nor is she Tony, so she had no right to tell Tony he wasn't sick.  
I cross-corroborated it with an interview that Joy conducted regarding her divorce.  
According to an interview with People, ""\[H\]e was still being free and having a fun life.""  
I couldn't find anything to substantiate that any further, but that screams bitch energy to me. Sounds to me like she was jealous that Tony didn't share the permanent victim mentality that she did."

I believe there is no objective argument, not grounded in morality, not prudish, to be against incest. 

Understanding incest as a **consensual sexual/romantic relationship between closely related adult family members** or those descended from a common ancestor. 

And when I talk about ""being against incest,"" I refer to viewing it with disapproval, judging it, stigmatizing it, or even legislating, for example, to prohibit marriage between two closely related adults.  
  
Yes, I understand that children of a genetically related couple have a high probability of being born with genetic disorders. However, in our times, it's possible to know during pregnancy if the baby will be born with malformations or related issues. Moreover: what if the couple wants to adopt to avoid such a probability? Probability which, by the way, is only higher than in non-incestuous couples. It is not exclusive to babies produced by genetically related couples.

Why do we forbid it both socially and legally? Why do we view it negatively? If two adults love and desire each other sexually, who are we to judge and tell them that they shouldn't be together just because they are first cousins? I insist: I'm talking about consensual adult relationships.

I believe it has to do with an ingrained taboo rather than reason and logic. But I am more than open to having my view changed! For real

1,2023-07-24,CMV: The 2010s was the best decade for hip hop / rap,u/RaindropDripDropTop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/158kvx6/cmv_the_2010s_was_the_best_decade_for_hip_hop_rap/,changemyview,"**DISCLAIMER** I know that this is just my subjective opinion, everyone has different preferences

(1) Better beats 

With improvements in technology, it became possible to create an infinite amount of new sounds using digital synthesizers. In modern hip hop you hear so many sounds that would have been impossible to create even 15 years ago. Add on top of that improvement of audio effects such as reverb and time modulation that can alter sounds even further. There are also a much better variety of drum and percussion samples for producers to work with, and they sound much cleaner and more crisp than ever before. 808s hit way harder now. There are also artists who are able to creatively use autotune to add a psychedelic flavor to their music (Travis Scott and Future are great examples of this). Overall, artists and producers just have so much more to work with, and as a result the sound scapes of modern hip hop are much more interesting in general than in old school hip hop or even bling era hip hop. 

(2) The evolution of the genre

The hip hop genre has evolved in ways that really enhances the music. The genre has seen a lot of influence from pop music, electronic, psychedelic, R&B, and even punk rock, and these influences have added so much new variety to the genre. It's way more common to hear melodic vocalists who are sort of a hybrid between rappers and singers. So many modern hip hop songs have amazing hooks nowadays. For people who are still into the more lyrical focused type of old school hip hop, you can still find it (e.g. with artists like Kendrick Lamar), but there are also tons of other styles to explore that focus on different aspects of music.

(3) Better party music

Trap music in general is just amazing for parties. Booming bass coming from the 808s, fast hi hats that add speed and energy into songs, larger emphasis on hooks and vocal melodies. Trap music brings the hype in a way that old school hip hop doesn't. This is a huge reason why in many ways that modern rappers have become the new rockstars. Larger than life personas making great party music. Obviously the OGs from the 90s were making great party bangers and were stars in their own right, the newer generations of rappers have taken it to the next level. 

To add some context to where I am coming from, here are a list of some of my favorite hip hop artists in no particular order:

Playboi Carti, Travis Scott, Future, Young Thug, Metro Boomin, Pop Smoke, Lil Uzi Vert, JPEGMAFIA, Migos, 21 Savage, Kodak Black, Kendrick Lamar, MF DOOM, Death Grips, A Tribe Called Quest, Mobb Deep, Wu Tang Clan, Outkast, ASAP Rocky, Denzel Curry, Rakim, Biggie, Tupac, NWA, Nas, Hieroglyphics / Souls of Mischief, Vince Staples, Waka Flocka Flame, Chief Keef, etc."

Apparently, the media says that airport/airline passengers are becoming unruly in ""epidemic proportions""  


That's a straight up lie. Here's why.  


First, just because some guys carried out an attack that should have been stopped months before it happened on 9/11, security is ridiculous, especially with not being able to carry more than 100mL of fluid.  


So, it takes 3 hours to get to our gate. The lines for security are long and employees have no sense of urgency to rush because any push back will result in the person getting arrested for ""abuse of an airport employee"" or some BS.  


Then, airlines take forever to get people on board, or they delay because of some frivolous reason. Having traveled back from Disney World, my flight back was delayed 2 hours because of the verbiage on paperwork when maintaining the seats.  


By then, passengers are tired and frustrated by the time they get on the plane, and it takes surprisingly little for someone's powder keg to go boom.  


And to add insult to injury, everyone on the plane gets punished for one person's powder keg.  


Instead of instilling competence in employees, the air travel industry cries to the media on how ""we have a passenger epidemic.""  


Reminds me of the episode of South Park where Mr. Garrison invents a vehicle to compete against airlines, but the federal government shuts him down when they bail out the airlines, who are losing money because of their own incompetence. They had a point there, and it's deadly accurate how right they are in that episode."

As a result of this, overcrowding and underfunding are a major issue. (Some prisons don't have working A/C and prison food in general is terrible.) An approach that focuses on restoring instead of punishing could reduce the prison population, leaving more funds to spend on the people who do need to be tbere. 

There are some restorative justice programs in major cities, but far too often it seems like progressive prosecutors are choosing to drop charges entirely.

[There are some people who don't care. According to them these crimes are a result of capitalist oppression and it's actually the white collar executives who are hurting people. People are just doing what it takes to survive. While I understand why some people feel that way, I think it's shortsighted.]

The CIA ticks all of those boxes. They are definitely political, created as a direct response to communism, that is widely accepted. They violate international laws on torture and have been proved to partake in whiteroom torture, waterboarding to straight up beatings with batons. This is mafia behaviour but a US government aligned organisation is doing this. They bring people to Guantanamo Bay with no evidence in many cases because it's a legal grey area to do it outside US territory, not only that but they supported dictatorships in Latin America like the drug dealing thug Manuel Noriega until he became an inconvenience and was then arrested for tax evasion and racketeering after years of doing that with the CIAs greenlight. Also read up on Dignity Battalions. Yeah the man was a lunatic from the start. They actively infiltrated the black panthers with drugs and of course good old torture you know for political reasons. Whatever you think of the black panthers I don't care but that is terrorism. Using terror as a weapon to infiltrate the black panthers. Those were just a few examples and unlike Panama there were regimes the CIA propped up until the very end. Doesn't get closer to being an international terrorist organisation than that right."
1,2023-07-24,CMV: Israeli juducial reform does not impact their democracy,u/ATNinja,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/158nbxv/cmv_israeli_juducial_reform_does_not_impact_their/,changemyview,"From what I understand of the judicial reform, the current law passed today and the overall plan, israel is not becoming less democratic. Arguably more democratic because it gives more power to parliament but certaintly not less. 

The main issues with the judicial branch in israel is they are not democratically selected or nominated by democratically selected people. And they have the ability to reject laws based purely on their own judgement and not previous laws or constitution. The second thing being what was eliminated today. 

Both these issues are inherently undemocratic. 

They are moving towards a system more similar to the us where judges are selected by the government and their judgements are supposed to be based on existing laws passed by elected officials. While the US system isn't perfect, it isn't a threat to our democracy. 

This is all to say, I am no expert so maybe I'm missing something. Please explain to me how these changes are undemocratic.

I realize the current government is pretty corrupt and these changes are intended to strengthen their party. However, the changes themselves are not the issue and if the population elected another goverment, they will be able to use the laws to their advantage as well, just like in the US. So being implemented by bibi does not make it undemocratic. 

Another note is sometimes democracy needs to be limited to protect against the tyranny of the majority. It's valid to be against these changes on those grounds, but that does not mean democracy is being reduced.

So please tell me why I should consider the judicial reforms anti-democratic ."
1,2023-07-24,CMV: The US should use a Two-round system to prevent dilution of the vote. The Electoral College can stay.,u/Dr_Macunayme,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/158njbq/cmv_the_us_should_use_a_tworound_system_to/,changemyview,"First, I'm proposing that the Electoral College stays not because I think it's a good system, but because approving an amendment in the near future to end it is not feasible (so I ask folks to not focus on the EC part).

Meanwhile, you could implement the TRS with a regular bill in congress:

1. Basically, on the Fall before Election year, the parties would have their primaries, choosing candidates and whatnot.
2. Then, in Spring during election year, we would have a first round of votes consisting purely of popular vote.
3. The two most voted in the country go to the second round in November, with the Electoral College.

Why? Simple, many people feel that voting third party means throwing out their vote and helping either the Dem or GOP, basically serving as a spoiler. Let's look at the election of 1912.

* Woodrow Wilson, the democrat, received 40% of the popular vote.
* Roosevelt, running as a third party after leaving the GOP, won 27% of the vote.
* Republicans, running for re-election with Taft, won 23% of the vote.
* And Debs, running on the Socialist ticket, won 6%.

Roosevelt was really popular in that campaign and won almost 1M votes more than the Republicans in a party he had just created the year before. Unfortunately, he split the ticket which gave the presidency to the Democrats (Who were the conversative party of the time). Now, under my system, Roosevelt and Wilson would have had a runoff and the world would have been very different.

I feel like, currently, third parties are not viable in the US because everyone is always voting to prevent the other party from getting into power. But my system allows people to vote freely, because the election cannot be decided on the first round so you don't have to think ""I can't let X win"", you would think ""who do I like the most""."
1,2023-07-24,CMV: Your eternal destination is decided by your birth zipcode.,u/1doublezero,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/158o3e1/cmv_your_eternal_destination_is_decided_by_your/,changemyview,"If you were born in the US, chances are you were raised to believe in the Christian God and that following this path leads to heaven. In contrast, if you were born in Pakistan, you'd likely embrace the Islamic faith. But think about it: Is it not utterly perplexing to believe that a person's eternal destiny is determined solely by their place of birth?

  
Consider the implications of this notion. As a Christian, you may believe that those who follow Islam are mistaken and worship the wrong God. Consequently, according to your belief system, they are destined for hell. But pause for a moment and reflect: why should the child in Pakistan, who was raised with as much devotion as you, following their parents' teachings, be any different from you?

  
The idea that your religious beliefs grant you an advantage solely because of your birthplace is, in itself, a deeply unsettling concept. It implies that the divine power behind the universe arbitrarily decides which group is bestowed with the keys to heaven based on geographic location alone. Does this not raise significant doubts about the fairness and impartiality of such a system?

  
It becomes evident that subscribing to a particular religion simply because it was ingrained in you from birth is a questionable practice. Blindly accepting the faith handed down to you without critical examination overlooks the fundamental issue: the role of chance in determining religious affiliation.

  
So, let's challenge the status quo. Engage in introspection and question the beliefs you inherited. Ask yourself: What if the child in Pakistan had been born in the US? Would they still embrace Islam or adopt Christianity due to their new environment? How much of our religious convictions are truly based on thoughtful exploration and personal conviction?

  
Embracing a religion should be a deeply personal journey‚Äîa quest for truth and meaning. It should not be a lottery of salvation based on where one happens to be born. Instead, let us encourage open-mindedness, curiosity, and a genuine search for understanding. Every individual deserves the freedom to explore their own spiritual path."

1,2023-07-24,CMV: It‚Äôs not an unfair/misogynistic double standard to view men who sleep with a lot of women more favorably than women who have slept with a lot of men.,u/ILuvEmoGurrrls,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/158pm0f/cmv_its_not_an_unfairmisogynistic_double_standard/,changemyview,"I would say this for two main reasons, one being that for a man to have a lot of sex specifically with multiple women they have to be specifically outstanding. The second being that women are the gatekeepers of sex and are the ones deciding how much sex any given man has.

When I say a man has to be outstanding in order to have sex, I mean that (with the exception of prostitutes) in order to have consentual sex with a large amount of women you must incredibly attractive. Either personality wise with good enough rizz to pull a lot of women, physically attractive enough to make women want to sleep with you by simply existing, or you must have enough money to flash around to lure in gold diggers who are willing to have sex with you in order to be in your proximity. These are qualities that you either have to be born with or work incredibly hard to develop and maintain. 

Even then, these aren‚Äôt a sure fire way to get women to sleep with you and it requires a lot of work passed this.

Women don‚Äôt need any of these particular skills. I mean there‚Äôs a reason. They just need to exist. Male attraction is a lot more diverse (and in a lot of cases more desparate) than women‚Äôs so for sex physical appearance doesn‚Äôt really make a difference passed a certain level of attractiveness.

Something like this is evident when you look at things like match statistics on dating apps. For tinder, the average match rate is 0.6% for males. For women it‚Äôs 10%. I‚Äôd also like to conduct a small thought exercise. If a man walks into a bar and decides to ask every woman there if they would like to spend the night with him how many yeses is he getting? Now swap the genders, how many? Obviously the woman will come out on top.

This is partially what I mean when I say women are the gatekeepers of sex. In the stoichiometric equation for sex, women are the limiting reactant. Men spend time looking for a yes, while women are wading through suitors until they find someone who‚Äôs fit to sleep with.

Women have a lot more to risk after all, they also risk their physical safety as the average woman isn‚Äôt as strong as the average man. As a result they have to gate keep sex for their own personal safety."

1,2023-07-24,CMV: It's incredibly selfish for balding men to propagate their inferior genes. They should instead forgo their selfish desire to have kids to reduce suffering that may be conferred upon unwitting future generations.,u/UnsuccessfulLobotomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/158s1uo/cmv_its_incredibly_selfish_for_balding_men_to/,changemyview,"It's a well known fact that male pattern baldness, a.k.a androgenic alopecia (and probably other types of alopecia) has a strong genetic component and is arguably hereditary in most cases too. The only cases where it's not hereditary is when the reason is due to nutritional deficiencies, dermatitis, COVID, etc but in the vast majority of the cases, if you have follicles that are genetically predisposed to being sensitive to DHT, then you will most likely go prematurely bald if you're an adult male. And there's not much you can do to stop it. Moreover, if you're a man cursed by the ""balding gene"" (or set of genes), the psychological impact of it are extreme, the nature of which can't be grasped by people not dealing with the same. Depending on what stage of life this curse befalls you, it could play a significant part in how you develop as a person and virtually affect every part of your life from professional to personal. It might appear as though all this is over exaggeration but I assure you that these are the thoughts that most men who have just begun grasping the genetic aspect of this curse. As a man, who started balding in his 20s, I've seen the difference in the way people treat me with and without hair. Not to mention, my self confidence and dating life took a nose dive virtually overnight. And the only reason for that is because I carry the genes that puts me at an unfair disadvantage and not due to something that I voluntarily chose to do. And the only ""mistake"" I did was being born to parents who were in one way or the other, carriers of these genes. My selfish, balding dad wanted kids so here I am, being forced to go through life in hard mode in this world where physical attraction, superficiality and vanity takes precedence over substance. 

So, men who are balding (or are well aware of the genetic risks that run within the family) should have to be extremely selfish to put their needs above and beyond everything else if they convince themselves that passing on their genes does anyone any good. Moreover, the people who still continue to have kids should be ashamed of themselves for not even considering this aspect, or worse, ignoring it willfully. You're literally the reason for some poor guy suffering down the line while desperately trying to go through adulthood while the follicles on his head are genetically programmed to miniaturize and wither away.

To preemptively cast aside some of the typical responses (as such a post can attract a lot of unwanted virtue signalling):
1) Not all bald men are unattractive. (Yes, but bald men are on average, considered less attractive by both women and men as demonstrated by numerous studies, surveys, pop culture, etc. There's a reason why the hair industry is thriving on people's desperation. The reason being that having a full head of hair is absolutely vital for ones self image. Hair provides definition to the face. It's not even debatable that proper geometric definitions like a strong hair line, chiseled jawlines, etc add to facial aesthetics. It's the same reason why not all randomly assembled notes make good music. There are certain patterns that just work and certain ones that don't)
2) Baldness doesn't define ones worth, confidence matters more than look and other copium tropes (Sure. There's more to ones worth than a head full hair but not having hair does detract a lot from one's overall perceived worth. In theory it shouldn't, but it becomes a case of body dysmorphia that's hard to get rid of. The importance of having hair, especially while going through early adulthood, cannot be understated)
3) Baldness isn't determinedly heritable. Meaning, you could still have kids who aren't going to lose hair prematurely even if you're bald and vice versa. (Yes. But the odds that your son will bald the same way as you are much higher if you're bald and still go onto have kids. In the worst case, your progeny may end up being a carrier of the gene even if they don't get expressed throughout their lives for whatever reason. At the very least, if every bald guy on the planet willingly chose not to procreate, over time we could potentially eliminate baldness from society)
4) There ""may"" be a cure in the next few decades (We are always in this stage where there ""may"" be a cure. If anything, we are decades-centuries behind cures for so many chronic issues that plague society. There are people literally dying because they can't afford epipens for diabetes in the richest country in the world. Heck, most of the meds we use for a lot of chronic ailments are still from the 20th century since pharma companies prefer to do research to extend patents rather than create revolutionary drugs. Not to mention, drug discovery is a very complicated and the process of entering the market comes with a significant cost that runs into billions of dollars. Moreover, the only FDA approved drug for hairloss wasn't even designed for it and was found by accident. So if you think the pharma industry has its foot on the accelerator to produce baldness cures before its able to treat much more debilitating things of cancer, neurological ailments, etc then you're just fooling yourself).
5) You're such an inCeL. This is such a 1st woRld pRoBleM tO hAVe. You should be more grateful for what you have (Yeah, nah. Please, do better. Trying to keep this discussion free of baseless, childish adhominem attacks)"

 - As time goes on, the US is becoming more distant from its past of enslavement and disenfranchisement of black Americans. Additionally, among black people, an increasing proportion of them are of voluntary immigrant origins rather than descendants of American slavery.

 - Conservative groups are ramping up protests against drag queens, mostly only against drag performance in front of children, but a few seeking to ban drag completely.

 - Women continue to gain greater social standing, and criticism from women decrying drag as misogynistic is also increasing. I imagine that some of these women sympathize with the aforementioned anti-drag conservative groups, even if they may disagree with them on most other issues.

 - As racial definitions and boundaries in the US become less clear and society's understanding of the history of racial categorization in the US also improves, transracialism (identifying as a different race from what one was born) also appears to be increasing in acceptance.

With these factors, I think it is only a matter of time before society comes to see drag on an equal footing as blackface. One scenario is that we will come to see both as offensive caricatures of women and black people respectively, unnecessarily lewd and bereft of any value other than shock. Another possibility is that they will both become acceptable as entertainment for adults, where the two activities will be regarded as an artistic appreciation rather than mockery or appropriation, without regards to any potential historical links to these groups' oppression.

Please note that I am not passing any value judgement on drag or blackface; all I am doing is to try to guess on a future scenario that very few of us can predict accurately. I am just having fun predicting the future of some niche activities that nobody should be betting any money on. If you disagree that my predicted outcome will not come true, and societal perception will remain the same or perhaps go in a way that I am not predicting, then please try to change my view by explaining why."
1,2023-07-24,CMV: The Solution To The Abortion Debate is a Common Sense Compromise,u/Dawntodusk87,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/158wi6e/cmv_the_solution_to_the_abortion_debate_is_a/,changemyview,"I am of the belief that the terms pro-life and pro-choice or purposely meant to sound appealing to an outsider who is unaware of their actual definitions. After all, most people like life and like being able to choose.

With the fact that abortion has become a front-and-center topic in political discourse today, I decided to give my two cents. **Please be civil.**

I feel as though the pro-choice movement has lost their way; their motto in the 1970s was ""Keep abortion safe, legal, and rare."" to showcase that their goal was to keep abortion legal and regulated, but reduce the need for it. Today, several people celebrate it as empowering or openly brag about it which I feel is unnecessary and reduces the chances of civil debate. Seeing someone who identifies as pro-choice get mocked for saying the need for abortion should be reduced worries me. Calling a developing embryo a ""clump of cells"" is silly because every multicellular organism fits that description. It just feels like a buzzword just meant to be dismissive. 

The pro-life movement, for the most part, I believe is misguided. Trying to outlaw abortion will only increase the likelihood of illegal abortions. Pregnancy is a major commitment and it is cruel to force it on someone who is not prepared for it. 

Better ways to reduce the need for abortion would be better sex education, improved access to birth control, better family planning, child support programs, etcetera.

I am not blind to the value of a child though; after a child is born, regardless of what circumstances they were conceived from or what complications may have occurred during the pregnancy, they have unlimited value and we should do absolutely everything in our power to protect and support them through education, maternal/paternal leave, childcare, family planning, etcetera.

TL:DR - The solution to the abortion debate is to keep abortion legal, but reduce the need for it."

The whole ‚Äútrans women/men are or aren‚Äôt women‚Äù has become a big talking point in American and western society as  a whole really since there‚Äôs been a lot more discussion about trans women/women and I think both sides are going about this the wrong way. 

Each side is treating their viewpoint on it as though it‚Äôs fact even though it‚Äôs an incredibly subjective and relies solely on the individuals to decide what women/men and how trans women can or can‚Äôt fit into that view. 

I‚Äôm going to use the thought exercise of Mary‚Äôs room to explain how it isn‚Äôt this talking point has a definitive answer. Mary‚Äôs room is a thought exercise where Mary is in a black and white room and she reads about the colour red but never actually sees what red is, it‚Äôs only when she goes outside to see what the color red is to know it. 

This thought experiment is shows that some words can really be understood if you experience them and this ties into the trans debate because everyone will have their own definition of women due to their experiences with them and decide if trans women are or aren‚Äôt women so no one would really be wrong but to themselves only they would be right.

This viewpoint of mine is heavily influenced and based off of this video which goes into this argument a lot more in depth than I do."

One example they give is that not every man or woman has the same level of sex hormones in their system, so they can't be equally man or woman; they are in different places in the gender spectrum. But this isn't a scientific fact, so an argument can be framed in any way. I can say that the level of the sex hormone is inconsequential to this argument and the way to determine gender is by identifying the dominant sex hormone. Is testosterone dominates, it's a man and is estrogen dominates, woman. Gender is but a physical, hormonal, and psychological manifestation of biological sex. What are your thoughts about this?

P.S. This is not a hate post. My confusion is genuine and I'm looking for well articulated explanations and opinions to broaden my perspective."
1,2023-07-25,CMV: the universe isn't infinite,u/Neo359,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/158yc9l/cmv_the_universe_isnt_infinite/,changemyview,"The popularized premise of the big bang is that infinite everythingness was singularized and suspended in an inconceptual nothingness outside the realm of time. The existence of this ""singular infinite everything"", by most older accounts, has been that its always been there even though the concept of ""always"" is semantically problamatic. In other words, it makes no sense to question the past of a beginning. We are given the example of trying to head north from the north pole. It seems to have escaped people that if you head south you eventually end up north again. But I digress. The universe being in a state without time is the actual perplexing issue here. A state without time would be the inverse of eternal time. I bet my left testicle that everyone unconsciously conceptualizes a reality without time as everlasting in some sense. Afterall, if we try to imagine a space without time, we just sit there imagining a permanent void of activity like a dumn ass. But it's precisely the opposite. A dimension without time would be a sort of Planck Time. Or rather, where eternity approaches 99999999999... seconds. No time would approach 0.000000... seconds. In other words, as soon as a singularity would exist, there would be instananeous expansion. The only possible explanation to all this is a multiverse. But we know through the cosmic microwave background that our universe is homogenous. Meaning: if the universe is infinite and homogenous, all possible realities would already exist within our universe. There would be no function to a multiverse - needless repetition. Ultimately, if there is a multiverse, the universe is definitely finite. I would also suspect that if there isn't a multiverse, big bangs are on repeat. After all, matter cannot be created of destroyed. The end of time basically predicts a total expansion of elementary particles. Paticles that we've observed to be able to interact with other paticles irregardless of distance. Between quantum entanglement, quantum fluctuation and the fact that there is an obvious speed limit to the rate of accelerated expansion (speed of light)... It only seems obvious there is a cycle. So the real question is: what came first, the chicken or the egg?"

Wouldn‚Äôt it be a lot more lucrative to develop an app that is guaranteed to find you love and make you pay for it in stead of the freemium model, I do believe only a tiny minority have the paid version of the app e.g. Gold on tinder.

In that case I would feel responsible for them being in an even worse place. 

What if my partner is living with me and has depression and barely able to work, how could I basically put them on the street, ruining their life? What if my friend has become an angry, mean person due to trauma and I cut them off, even though I know they're suicidal? What if they kill themselves because I was the only friend they had left? It's an extreme example, but I think it shows my issue the best, since you never know what effect your actions might have.

How would somebody be in the right to put their needs over another, even if that could lead to that other person dying? It seems like my needs just don't count as much as the other person's in that case.

I am someone who believes that it is completely upto people (both partners) and their choices whether to have zero, one, two or more kids. 

It‚Äôs a very personal choice and should be made at an emotional, physical, financial and even spiritual level. 

However these days to counter the traditional pressure of having kids, I‚Äôve seen millennials and younger generation people who are married, yet to be married or single deride and take cheap shots about having children right to the face of unsuspecting parents who are just walking around with a baby or a toddler.

Things like 

‚ÄúOh we don‚Äôt want kids btw. Why add to the already overburdened population?‚Äù

‚ÄúHaving kids in such a horrible world is such a heartless thing to do.‚Äù 

Etc. 

Again I‚Äôm talking about these things being said unprovoked. More like an agenda propagation or things said out of insecurities. 

I‚Äôve literally seen and faced this where there was no mention about the said couple at all in the conversation, leave alone pressure.

I know of a friend who also (both of them) who had fertility issues and went from pro having a child to making these terrible statements later on after finding out that they can‚Äôt.  

Again- personal choice, health reasons, economic concerns. That‚Äôs all fine. 

But if you are driving some agenda or defending your insecurities in an unprovoked manner, you are as toxic as those who pester and annoy tf out of people advocating for kids."

On top of that there are hundreds and hundreds of more plugins that can be used to add effects to sounds, such as reverb, EQ, time modulation, chorus effects, saturation, compression, side chaining, autotune, etc. 

DAWs also allow anyone to create entire songs as well as mix and master them, all of which can be done simply using a laptop and few hundred dollars worth of software. With just a computer you can layer as many synths and samples as you want, create compositions in a midi, create whatever drum and bass patterns you want, and combine it all together to make an entire song, then mix it and master it to make it all come together. 

Another huge benefit of computers is that it lowers the barriers to entry of making music. Take rock and metal music for example. In order to start a rock or metal band, you need to spend thousands of dollars worth of equipment to have all the instruments, e.g. guitars, bass guitars, drum kits, keyboards, etc. Not only that but you need the physical skills to be able to play the instruments well, which takes years of training. While obviously skilled players are impressive in their own right, with computers you take away the need for physical motor skills, and it becomes purely about creativity and understanding of music. With a computer, someone who is incredibly creative and has a great ear for music isn't limited by their skills at working with their hands, they can just create anything they can imagine. 

I add the microphone as the other best musical instrument because it allows artists to record the human voice, which allows rappers and singers to ride on top of a beat or a song and take it to the next level, adding hooks, verses, ad libs, you name it. 

Obviously there is a ton of great, more traditional music played with live instruments. Some of my favorite albums of all time in particular come from the rock and metal genres.

Hip hop, trap, drill, pop, electronic, etc. all of which have hundreds of different subgenres.

With just a computer you can layer as many synths and samples as you want, create compositions in a midi, create whatever drum and bass patterns you want, and combine it all together to make an entire song, then mix it and master it to make it all come together. 

Another huge benefit of computers is that it lowers the barriers to entry of making music. Take rock and metal music for example. In order to start a rock or metal band, you need to spend thousands of dollars worth of equipment to have all the instruments, e.g. guitars, bass guitars, drum kits, keyboards, etc. Not only that but you need the physical skills to be able to play the instruments well, which takes years of training. While obviously skilled players are impressive in their own right, with computers you take away the need for physical motor skills, and it becomes purely about creativity and understanding of music. With a computer, someone who is incredibly creative and has a great ear for music isn't limited by their skills at working with their hands, they can just create anything they can imagine. 

I add the microphone as the other best musical instrument because it allows artists to record the human voice, which allows rappers and singers to ride on top of a beat or a song and take it to the next level, adding hooks, verses, ad libs, you name it. 

Obviously there is a ton of great music played with live instruments. Some of my favorite albums of all time in particular come from the rock and metal genres. However the variety of music genres that can be created just using a computer and a microphone is also incredible. Hip hop, trap, drill, pop, electronic, etc. all of which have hundreds of different subgenres. Obviously the big studio productions in these genres will use much more expensive equipment, studio time, and audio engineering, but for up and coming artists within these genres, all they need is a laptop and microphone to start making music.

Of course the counter to this is that anyone (well anyone able-bodied) can get a driving privilege. However I've taken a few lessons and not only are all the instructors I've had astonished that I don't know anyone with a vehicle to help me practice between lessons, but when I couple that with only having one lesson per week they seem to think it's unlikely I'll be able to retain much without back-to-back lessons. Of course I'm considering doing full weekends, but forcing people to either quit their jobs or require them to have something scheduled 7 days/week for months (and God forbid you have an emergency in that time) just to get permission to buy something to use the things that make your life worse if you can't is extremely infuriating.

I propose that as long as the US prioritizes drivers over non-drivers, your job should be required to coordinate with any professional driving schools and give you as much PTO as they require to get a driving privilege."
1,2023-07-25,Cmv: The Monty Hall problem really is 50-50 and is bullshit.,u/Da_SnowLeopard,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/159jzqs/cmv_the_monty_hall_problem_really_is_5050_and_is/,changemyview,"I‚Äôve seen 2 explanations as to why the odds are 66-33 and not 50-50. I‚Äôm not convinced by either. I‚Äôve also shown my own evidence on the image linked below showing why it is 50-50. 

The first argument I see often is something along the lines of say 1 is prize, 2 and 3 are goats. 

If 1 is picked, 2 is shown. If you switch you lose, if you stay you win. 

If 2 is picked, 3 is shown, if you switch you win, if you stay you lose. 

If 3 is picked, 2 is shown, if you switch you win, if you stay you lose‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. 

Thus giving 2 wins for switching and 1 win for staying, making it 66% likely to win if you switch‚Ä¶.. 

What this argument misses is that if 1 is picked, you can ALSO BE SHOWN 3. Not ONLY 2‚Ä¶. When you include this into your decision tree, you now can now be shown 3, switch and lose, or stay and win. Adding another possibility of winning upon a stay. Making it 2 to switch and 2 to stay. Thus 50-50!    This is visually proven in my attached photo. 


The second argument exaggerates the problem stating, imagine 10,000 doors with only 1 prize. Monty will shut the 9,998 losers and leave only the winner and your chosen door. It is essentially saying arguing, you very likely DIDN‚ÄôT pick the right one out of those 9,998 doors. Thus switch. 

I‚Äôd have to agree, I think in this particular situation, the problem and solution of switching IS real. But I DO NOT think this analogy actually applies to the real game with only 3 doors. 

I can not exactly explain why, but I have a feeling this analogy doesn‚Äôt make sense. It might be because I‚Äôm convinced my game tree photo evidence is correct, thus I don‚Äôt believe this analogy even if I can‚Äôt explain why its wrong.

However on countless occasions I‚Äôve heard people who believe guns are the problem explain that there is nothing wrong with pit bulls but rather the problem is with their owners. These arguments seem equivalent to me. Both are disproportionately deadly compared to alternatives (for example other means of self defence or other breeds of dog) and thus should not be widely available. The vast majority of homicides are committed with guns. The vast majority of fatal dog attacks involve pit bulls. Personally I believe both should be banned but particularly it seems hypocritical to be against one and not the other.

I knew he hit his wife when i was small, about 12ish. I would tell my mom that it wasn't right but I got the normal- it isn't our business remark. I'm now 25 and I have a simple relationship with my brother thats very surface level. Ill fix your shower, you take my kids to school this Tuesday, ill help you if your struggling type deal. We say I love you- and I think he means it.
My brother lost all his kids from truancy for being 10-30 minutes late to school everyday (in ky 3 will result in an absence) and he was an ass to social services.

The thing is I have no evidence she is continued to be hit- do I think its possible- yes- the last time I remember seeing herbwith black eyes was 6 years ago. 

I don't believe he hits his kids- but he does threaten them. The oldest told me he hates his dad and thats why he stays at his girlfriend most of the time. I have behaviors out of these kids that isn't normal and I just have no proof. I don't have the resources to help these kids and at the bottom line- I fully believe with all my heart that

1. If I betray my brother, he will kill me. Literally kill me.

2. If I tell and he doesn't kill me he will follow every step for the social worker and make them happy and then run away with all of them- never to be heard of again. 

I fully believe he is a smart, manipulative, narcissist. But the only one who can change the situation is her. 

I'm damned if I do, im damned if I don't, and im damned if I do nothing. 

I have a line with the kids because they know I won't tell anyone- and if something bigger goes on im going to be the only one they tell. Do I break that line? 


The only thing I have that is current

1. Someone close to my sister in law reported her having black eyes about 2 months ago to CPS- i don't know who. 

2. He is verbally abusive to the mom saying things like ""your a stupid peice of shit, who belongs in this stupid town. You a weak p@$$?"" Type stuff and he always says ""I'm gonna kill you"""

Of India‚Äôs key cities & the states surrounding them, Delhi is ruled by AAP, Bengaluru by Congress, Chennai by DMK, Hyderabad by TRS and Kolkata by TMC. All of these are parties opposed to the BJP. Only Mumbai is ruled by a leader from an ally of the BJP, Shiv Sena.  
  
Is that the death of opposition or democracy we are worried about? If we don‚Äôt believe in the sanctity of the election commission, why is Modi even spending time doing election campaigns? Why did BJP lose elections in key states?  
  
And if these elections are not legitimate, can we declare all these victories as invalid and put them in President‚Äôs rule? Will India‚Äôs parties sign that?  
  
If the courts are not considered independent, why Modi not immediately arrest all the leaders from non-BJP parties? If you don‚Äôt believe in the sanctity of the Supreme Court would you also support the reversal of all its recent judgment protecting various groups?  
  
If you don‚Äôt believe in press freedom, can you just declare all media including The Hindu, Quartz and Wire as pro-Modi.  
  
The truth is that India is very viable democracy with an independent election commission, free and fair elections, an independent judicial system, a Constitution that is not tampered with in nearly 10 years by the ruling party and a free media.  
  
But, this won‚Äôt stay long if this continuous lie about ‚Äúdying democracy‚Äù is repeated. BJP has a habit of turning a continuous lie into reality. Remember the jibe about Chaiwala and Chowikdar that BJP used to turn around and thump the opposition.  
  
Vajpayee led a very liberal regime, that as constantly attacked as Hindu right wing and voted out. In case, a little hardline Modi. But, Modi was very liberal in the first few years with all the government focused on secular activities such as Swachh Bharat, JAM, GST etc.  
  
After being continuously called Hindu nationalist and a very big drama conducted in the form of ‚Äúaward whapsi‚Äù, BJP started looking seriously into adopting Hindu nationalism. In came, a leader who took the harder line, Yogi and came the policies such as Bulldowsering. By Modi 2.0, the government started taking more steps such as building ram mandir in Ayodhya and scarapping Article 370.  
  
If you constantly cry that I‚Äôm slapped you when I never did, at some point I would slap you. If I‚Äôm anyway blamed for what I didn‚Äôt, I would at least have the satisfaction of getting blamed for what I did. That is what happened with BJP regarding Hindu nationalism. They still have not moved far enough, but constantly pushed they would.  
  
And the same for this democracy thing. If Biden and other world leaders don‚Äôt care about India is a democracy or not, and it is more likely that large countries such as China would take India more seriously as a dictatorship, would it not be more incentivising for Modi to take dictatorial.  
  
That would be bad for me and you and most Indians. But, that is the reality that would happen if you keep repeating the lie that democracy is under threat in India. Modi and BJP would be even more emboldened to make your lie into a reality because you seemed to have used all your cards and no one seems to care about that.  
  
By calling Modi as dictatorial Hindu nationalist and anti-Muslim, you are strengthening the India‚Äôs right wing hardliners. They don‚Äôt consider any of those adjectives as negative and would happily wear them."
1,2023-07-25,CMV: Lincoln was primarily responsible for the U.S. Civil War,u/PrometheusHasFallen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/159m8g3/cmv_lincoln_was_primarily_responsible_for_the_us/,changemyview,"Simply looking at the facts surrounding the start of the U.S. Civil War, it is hard for me to come to any other conclusion than Abraham Lincoln started the deadliest war in U.S. history. Warographics does a good [account](https://youtu.be/TGLGeB0F19w) of the facts surrounding the Battle of Fort Sumter.

I'll try to cover the most common narratives I hear about why the South was primarily to blame...

**Fort Sumter was attacked by the Confederates. Lincoln had to respond!**

(1) Most federal forts in the South were already taken over by Confederate troops shortly after each state seceded. Federal garrisons were mostly non-existent. Really the only two holdouts were Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens in Pensacola.

(2) Major Anderson wasn't even stationed at Fort Sumter. He unilaterally decided to take the fort on the night of South Carolina's secession. Fort Sumter was still under construction at the time but was in a more strategic position than the other two forts in Charleston.

(3) President Buchanan, could have ordered Major Anderson to withdraw, but he refused. Instead he attempted to resupply the fort with a civilian ship but warning shots were fired at it from the Confederate troops.

(4) Lincoln comes into office in March, several months after the stand off had begun. His Secretary of State William H. Seward argued that Lincoln should withdraw the remaining few federal garrisons in the South but Lincoln refused. Instead he makes a public stand to take back all federal forts from the rebel states.

(5) Lincoln sends a letter to the governor of South Carolina which in essence tells him to allow Fort Sumter to be resupplied. Lincoln have had to have known how this would be taken in light of events thus far.

(6) Lincoln sends a resupply ship now escorted by several U.S. warships down to Charleston.

(7) General Beauregard, commander of the Confederate forces surrounding Fort Sumter, sends a delegation to Major Anderson offering him full military honors and escort back to Washington D.C. if he surrenders the fort. Anderson refuses. He tells them in 3 days I will surrender once I run out of food. Beauregard gives him one hour.

(8) After the hour, the order is given to finally fire on the fort. The garrison returns fire. This lasts until the next day until another delegation arrives under a parlay. The same offer is given to Major Anderson. This time he accepts it.

(9) Not a single person was killed during this battle. Two union soldiers died accidentally in the ceremony which followed because they improperly loaded a canon. Officially the first two casualties of the U.S. Civil War.

(10) Full military honors were given to Major Anderson and his garrison and a steamer was provided to transport them up the coast. Confederate troops saluted them as they departed.

(11) Based on these events, Lincoln was now able to call for his 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion. This action caused the remaining southern states to quickly secede, most notably Virginia, and raise their armies in defense of their lands.

**The act of secession was itself a declaration of war.**

This I have a hard time fathoming. One part of an existing country, union or empire simply seeking independence does not justify war. Would you say Great Britain was justified in its wars against the United States, Ireland and India? And it's not like there's never been peaceful declaration of independence throughout world history, particularly in the 20th century.

It should also be noted that several of the original 13 colonies were quite explicit in having to ability to secede if this United States experiment didn't go to their liking. Procedures of secession were even written into their state constitutions. South Carolina was one of these original 13 colonies and by rights they exercise their power - though I would have vehemently disagreed with their decision to do so. But I also think that Nazis have a right to publicly demonstrate, despite their disgusting ideology.

Right now, we have Russia using similar justifications for repossessing their breakaway republics - at one point they were under the same empire so therefore our invasion is 100% justified. Just no. That's not a good reason.

**But wait, Lincoln was justified because he was going to free the slaves!**

This is a good narrative to tell to children but Lincoln as far as I know never brought this up to justify the war. His reasons was solely to suppress the rebellion and reunify the United States. The Emancipation Proclamation came two years after the start of the war, and even that declaration was a bit suspect because it only applied to slaves in Confederate held territories and not the many slaves who were in the Union - you know the ones Lincoln could do something about. It was actually Congress and the state legislatures who freed the slaves through the passage of the 13th amendment.

I think it's also important to note that the vast majority of Confederate soldiers were not slave owners, nor would even a slave owner fight and die for the right to own slaves... and the vast majority of Union soldiers were not abolitionists, most of them actually being prejudice against Blacks, both enslaved and free. For the most part it was ""defend our land"" vs. ""put down the rebellion"" mindsets.

Lastly, I can't think of another country or empire which had a excessively bloody war just to free slaves. Maybe there was but the ones that come to mind for me were relatively bloodless. In the 1830s, Great Britain abolished slavery acrossed its empire so there was already a standing precedent which the U.S. could have potentially followed to free the slaves. In essence, ending slavery does not justify war because there are other, more peaceful ways of accomplishing the same goals.

**DISCLAIMER:** I genuinely would like to hear compelling arguments for why Lincoln shouldn't be blamed for the U.S. Civil, hopefully arguments based on facts. However, if you're simply trying to disparage me based your own internal assumptions and not based what I've said in this post, then you will blocked and reported if it violates this subreddit's rules."

    Yes I am aware this is just the Catholic church‚Äôs teachings of hell but I gave an example of a denomination‚Äôs version of it.

Aside from people saying Hitler ruined the toothbrush moustache and the swastika, and of course Bin Laden ruining air travel, I've noticed plenty of stories of people who had future company/school policies ruined because they took unfair/egregious advantage of them.  


Just because one person broke the rules doesn't mean we all need to be punished now and in the future.  


Another reason I'm posting about this is because of the rash of people throwing things at singers while they're performing onstage. I know that this is going to mean that concert experiences going forward are going to suck for everyone else.  


I could give a few more examples:  


I can't rush a stage at a concert anymore because some schizo who was off his meds thought it'd be a swell idea to cap Dimebag Darrell. All I wanna do is high-five Patrick Stump and I can't. Not to mention just because Dimebag got capped musicians get this douche attitude about them of ""stay the fuck off the stage."" Bro, not everyone rushing the stage is going to cap you. Chill out.  


I can't drink throughout an entire basketball game because alcohol sales are prohibited after the 3rd quarter. Why? Because a Pistons fan thought it'd be a swell idea to throw beer at Ron Artest, who decided to run into the stands and beat up a dude half his size.  


When I was in 3rd grade (1999), my school banned Pokemon cards because other 3rd and 4th graders were getting into disputes and getting ripped off while playing/trading Pokemon cards.  


When I was in 8th grade (2005), all 7th and 8th graders had to stay an extra 20 minutes after school from December to about April because one 7th grader got into a scuffle with some drug dealers who started making threats.  


When I was a Junior in High School (2008), a couple of people were caught cheating during a Chemistry exam, so the school made the punishment for having a cell phone much more stringent. (i.e. 15 demerits/suspension on 1st offense, expulsion on 2nd or 3rd offenses).  


Just because one person does it, doesn't mean everyone has half a mind to do it. There are other ways to mitigate the risk without punishing everyone in the future."
1,2023-07-25,CMV: Altruism is inherently selfish.,u/_crash_nebula_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/159mw5s/cmv_altruism_is_inherently_selfish/,changemyview,"We, as humans, are limited by our own individual experiences of the world. We can only feel and perceive reality through our own bodies, and therefore, all we do is, in a way, inherently selfish. We only make decisions based on what we think is best in our worldview, so, everytime we decide to do something, we are going for what we think will make us feel the most positive. 

For example, when we drink water to quench our thirst, we are mostly doing that because our brains evolved to make us feel bad in case it feels we are getting dehydrated, so we feel ""thirst"" which is a bothersome sensation and we drink water in order to make such bothersome sensation subside. 

Even altruism is inherently selfish. If a very altruistic person chooses to donate all of their money to charity, even though that will not help them financially, they made that decision because their worldview made them infer that that's the right thing to do, making them feel a good sensation for donating that surpasses the bad sensation of having less money and a less comfortable life.

I disagree for a multitude of reasons. I was in a similar situation recently where after class I was walking home and saw a guy on the street being unusually abusive towards his girlfriend or wife both verbally and physically but I along with everyone else on the street passed by without interfering. When I got home I told my friends and they all unanimously thought I should‚Äôve done something.

I think people are completely justified to ignore something happening to a stranger they don‚Äôt know to ensure their own safety first and foremost. Nobody should be expected to stick their neck out for a stranger they have no connection to. There was a case of a girl being stabbed in India in public and nobody did anything. The comments were ridiculous expecting some passerby to put his life on the line to try to prevent a guy with a fucking knife viciously stabbing someone while being completely unarmed themselves.

Even if there is no visible weapon it‚Äôs completely idiotic to risk your safety trying to interfere and contain a situation you have no connection to. I think people brave enough are free to do so but that doesn‚Äôt make everyone else with a sense of self preservation cowards. 

It‚Äôs the job of law enforcers and not ordinary citizens to police people. I shouldn‚Äôt be expected to care about some random on the street.

On common argument the heroes have against killing a villain that it would make them ""just as bad"" as the villain, which is stupid beyond belief. Villains mass murder scores of innocent people in pursuit of their own selfish gain or for some like the Joker or Carnage, simply for pleasure. A hero who kills villains is doing it so they won't do that anymore and nobody else has to die because of them. In what universe is that considered ""just as bad""? Not to mention, many a villain openly voice full intention of killing again and when they do, they're quick to rub into the heroes' faces that it's their own fault for refusing to finish the job when they had the chance. Through that and continuing to spare the villain, the heroes might as well be saying that they don't care how many innocent lives the villains destroy, and that their ideals matter more to them than the lives of the innocent people that they claim to be fighting to protect. It's also ridiculous how when a hero does kill a villain, all the other heroes shun and despise them, treating them as monsters, saying that there's no coming back for them, even when that villain is not only responsible for numerous atrocities, but voices full intention of continuing.

Let's run down a few examples:

1. Carnage is easily the most monstrous villain Spider-Man has ever faced, with only the Green Goblin able to give major competition, having been a bloodthirst maniac well before he got his Symbiote. However, Spider-Mn has always not only spared Carnage, but openly stopped people from killing him, like in Carnage USA, where Carnage conquered a whole town and killed scores of innocent people for pleasure, yet Spider-Man had stopped both a grieving father who lost one of his kids to Carnage's madness, and Flash Thompson, who was at the time Agent Venom, from killing Carnage.
2. Batman is famous for not only refusing to kill the Joker, but even refusing to allow him to die, even going so far as to protect him from the Spectre, the living embodiment of God's divine will and punishment. In Injustice, after the Joker tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane and their unborn son, which set of a nuke that destroyed Metropolis, killing millions, when Superman killed Joker, Batman instantly turned against him, calling him a monster and every bit as horrible as the Joker, which likely played a not-so-small role in Superman becoming the dictator he ultimately turned into in that story.
3. In Young Justice Season 3, Brion killed his evil uncle, Baron Bedlam, who had conquered their country, killed Brion's parents, sold Terra into slavery, and did any manner of other awful things, and voiced full intention of continuing to so long as he lived and even with that in mind, the rest of heroes with Brion at the time were disgusted by his actions and cut the strings between them.
4. In Season 4 of the Flash TV series, Barry adamantly refused to allow Ralph to kill the Thinker, and Thinker took advantage of that by depowering and killing the last remaining Bus Metas, stripping Caitlin of her powers, and nearly brain frying the entire planet, and the fallout of the final battle gave way to the rise of Cicada and other meta-tech metas, who were the chief villains of Season 5.
5. In Season 8 of the aforementioned show, Barry was very close to killing the Reverse Flash for causing the death of Iris, and was already responsible for numerous atrocities, chief among them the murder of Barry's mother. Barry's children Bart and Nora begged their dad to spare Thawne, saying that killing him would make him ""just as bad as him"", and Barry relented. Shortly after this, Thawne, empowered by the Negative Forces of Nature, went on an indiscriminate killing spree, and even directly told Barry that if he just had the guts to kill him, all those people would still be alive.
6. In Superman Vs The Elite, Superman is disgusted by the Elite for their lack of qualms when it comes to killing, even after watching them kill Atomic Skull, who after being arrested for a murderous rampage, quickly broke free and went on another killing spree, and Superman actively tried to keep the Elite from killing Atomic Skull, even after seeing first hand how ineffective prison is as a solution.

With all of these examples, the heroes still adamantly cling to their belief that they must never kill villains or allow for villains to die no matter what , seemingly regardless of how many innocent lives are destroyed, often as a very direct result of the mercy they show.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, the rule of heroes never killing villains no matter what is totally ridiculous, does way more harm than good, and all it really screams is how selfish the heroes truly are for seemingly happily letting their rules take priority over innocent lives, and is generally nowhere near as ""noble"" or ""heroic"" as they constantly claim it is."

4,2023-07-25,"CMV: Progressive Circles Seem Too Tolerant of Hypocrisy, Mainly in Regards to Climate Change and Capitalism",u/MyFavoriteArm,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/159oyty/cmv_progressive_circles_seem_too_tolerant_of/,changemyview,"I am someone who has been moving left over the last few years and has been engaging in more Progressive circles. (I live in the USA btw)

One thing I notice is that there seems to be a lot of looking the other way in terms of hypocrisy.

For example, both Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio are both well known climate change activists. Both are praised for leading awareness of said issue. I am gonna state the obvious so no one gets the wrong idea, CLIMATE CHANGE IS ABSOLUTELY REAL. The science is settled on that issue.

However, both still contribute more to the problem than the average person by trotting around in private jets, and both live in multiple properties that eat up more of electricity than some some third world countries. Whenever you bring this up in progressive circles, it gets dismissed because they are ""on the right side of the issue."" 

I disagree with that logic. I believe if you have a platform, you have the responsibility to practice what you preach and lead by example. I am a manager at my job, and my number one rule is that I will not make you do anything that I myself am not willing to do. Say what you will about Greta Thornberg, but at least she leads by example.

I believe climate change is real, but I am not an activist. That would make me a hypocrite, because I still own a car and drive and use an air conditioner. I don't want to be a hypocrite, as that would be a betrayal of my principles.

Another issue I see is in terms of capitalism. For example, a lot of progressives I encounter seem to really hate Apple and rail against it, yet still own iPhones. They also rail against social media (particularly twitter/facebook), yet still use it and believe it is an ""important tool"" in society.

While there is aspects of capitalism I dislike, I cannot be an anti-capitalist because I still believe it has a place in society, and that would make me a flagrant hypocrite. Especially when the alternative is only government brand everything. 

Before anyone responds with Mr. Gotcha or by saying ""yet you participate in society,"" I am well aware of the existence of that comic and actually believe the first two panels are actually a valid criticism.

I am open to changing my view, as I would like to hear more perspectives as to why I might be wrong. 

Thank you!"

I also think that telling people they are ‚Äúspecial‚Äù based on a number despite the fact that they accomplished nothing is really bad. There are studies that show that the majority of ‚Äúgifted‚Äù kids end up working average jobs. You also get those obnoxious ‚Äúformer gifted kids‚Äù who blame their lack of success on ‚Äúbeing too smart‚Äù rather than looking inward. On the other end of the spectrum, telling kids that they are ‚Äúnot gifted‚Äù based on a number they cannot control can create a defeatist attitude and make them believe that they cannot do great things. I also think that despite having an average IQ a lot of kids who are more curious/conscientious than ‚Äúgifted‚Äù kids most likely do better academically. There are also studies that show that children of color are less likely to be selected to be part of gifted programs despite meeting the criteria. I would love to hear other opinions on this!"

To solve this, political offices should have many limits on their power save for those strictly relating to their portfilio such as treasury/finance strictly being about finance. Additionally, politicians would be required to forfeit all their rights for the period of their term, scaring away those who want to seek power for their own gain and prevent backsliding.

And what about too little people willing to become politicians? Conscript people of all ages and walks of life for the various political parties then.

I either have to slow down, or sit in the oncoming lane for upwards of 10 seconds if I want to get passed them. 

To me this is completely nonsensical. To me, if the choice is between allowing someone to speed up by 10 or 20 km/h for a few seconds in order to pass someone, or forcing them to sit in the oncoming lane for far longer periods of time just to get passed someone and resume their normal speed, its pretty clearly safer to allow people to do the former.

1,2023-07-26,CMV: The US made the right decision to drop the bombs on Japan,u/ImSomeRandomHuman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/159xomn/cmv_the_us_made_the_right_decision_to_drop_the/,changemyview,"I believe that the US made the right decision with dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is because even though the bombs took hundreds of thousands of lives, they saved the lives of possibly tens of millions Americans and Japanese. The Japanese clearly were going to throw every last man, woman, and child at the Americans like they did in Okinawa and Iwo Jima. If America kept on advancing towards Japan, millions would definitely be killed. This is why the bombs were necessary, because there was no better alternative.

People often rebuttal with the fact that japan was suing for conditional surrender. However, accepting the conditions would have been much worse than dropping the bombs since the conditions required:

1. Keeping the imperial system in place with the emperor on top

2. Having Japan control its own disarmament and war crime trials

3. Japan would keep all of its territorial possessions in Japan, Korea, and Manchuria

Considering how Japan killed millions of people under its colonial rule, letting Japan keep its territorial possessions in China and Korea would have caused way more deaths than the nukes would have taken.

People also say that the U.S. could have had a naval blockade of Japan, but considering how bad mainland japan was with self sufficiency and how it lacked many crucial resources, a blockade would have cause a mass famine with millions of deaths, way more deaths than the nukes would have caused in addition to a universal drop in quality of life in Japan.

People also say the U.S. could have nuked a military base instead of an empty island. But military bases are usually close to population centers, and it‚Äôs not like high altitude single bombs are very accurate to begin with.

 There also is the fact that Japan didn‚Äôt even surrender after the first bomb on a civilian center, so it‚Äôs not like bombing a random island or military base in the middle of nowhere would cause the Japanese to feel much pressure into surrendering.

 We also only had three bombs available for that summer, so we couldn‚Äôt have just kept on bombing random islands to force the Japanese to surrender to begin with. 

Finally, we already were bombing military centers with our normal Air Force, and the Japanese weren‚Äôt surrendering, so a big bomb wouldn‚Äôt have made a big difference. The only major military centers left were in the hearts of civilian centers.

So in short, the bombs saved more lives than it took, and there were no better alternatives.

Since children cannot be expected to make consistently good decisions, they cannot be given full control of their healthcare but this doesn‚Äôt mean parents should have complete say. As long as all the decisions are good or somewhat comparable it is better to give kids the agency to pick which one, and they can be trusted to not make horrible mistakes because both options are (somewhat) good.

In this system, all common health issues or general care would have a ‚Äústandard‚Äù option, and more specialized conditions might have general outline. For the first the kid would be able to choose between the ‚Äústandard‚Äù option or what their parents wanted. For something more specialized the parents would have to pick a course of treatment within the recommended outline if the kid was against the parents choice. 

I believe this should be an option for any child 5 years or older."

And then my friend asked how I did it and I tried to explain it to her and some other people, but I just couldn't get the right words.  But my friend somehow understood my cave man explanation and turned it into the words that made sense.  And then everyone was actually better/ faster at it than me after that.  So at the end of the class, I was behind everyone.  And I was on 76mg of Concerta as well lol.  I think about that class a lot whenever people call themselves intelligent or someone else stupid.  It makes me think they're only looking at part of the picture.  They probably could never have understood my bad explanation and then instantly turn around and teach other people, only my friend could have done that.  Even the dude that invented derivatives says he can see far because he stands on the shoulders of giants.  I'm a big believer in the theory of multiple intelligences 

When I was in middleschool I had my reading level tested and I was at an undergrad level.  I thought I was really special.  Yeah, it turns out ""comprehension"" is one of my very few talents.  I can understand things I see hear or imagine intuitively without using words.  So if i read something once i can have a really good feel for it immediately.  I specced all my ability points into this trait and that's not always useful.  I'm personally a total failure in life, it's not really that helpful outside of academics

Starting with the Regan/Thatcherite 'greed is good mantra' putting one's self first has become the default setting for people in the west.

Nowadays this circle is complete with the complete aversion to anxiety/stress or indeed any other negative emotion in the endless pursuit of personal happiness. Whether it's the Boomer exploiting tax loop holes to hoard their wealth, millennial backpacker off to India to 'find themselves' (at the expense of the environment), or the gen Z kid deplatforming any idea that makes them remotely uncomfortable.

We live in a world where the self comes first at all costs.

Now I'm not against individualism, free expression, loving who you want, living as you want etc.

But the obsession with personal happiness has become pathological in some. All people talk about is getting a bigger house, going on a nicer beach holiday, having a faster car, sleeping with a hotter man/woman. It's the legacy of the swipe left generation, the grass is always greener. There is always a happier you, just around the corner.

Nothing good was ever built on personal happiness. From civil rights leaders, to artists, to doctors and nurses. Everything that's worth doing involves stress and strife. 

Imagine if Martin Luther king decided marches were causing him too much anxiety. Or Einstein decided his theory of relativity was too stressful to think about (Einstein actually made himself very sick and almost died whilst working on general relativity).

I would replace this obsession with happiness with one a want for contentment. Contentment is something you feel after a long day volunteering at a homeless shelter. Or that a doctor feels after a 13 hour shift on a COVID ward. Or a firefighter feels after tackling a burning house. It's not happiness, there's stress, fear, pain involved. But the overall feeling is contentment.

And in your fullfillment of your contentment, you will have helped others. So they can go on to feel content.

On your deathbed you can either look back on your life and see a meaningless list of hedonistic pleasures - beach holidays, big TVs, duvet days. Or see a contented life in the service of others."

1,2023-07-26,CMV: Disney buying Marvel was both the best and the worst for the franchise.,u/JKpatakpa15,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15a41x1/cmv_disney_buying_marvel_was_both_the_best_and/,changemyview,"
Hello everyone I‚Äôm a comic book fan and I‚Äôm here writing this text regarding how Disney buying marvel was both good and bad for the comic book business and I‚Äôll explain why. Firstly I have to say that Disney buying Marvel was beneficial for instance Disney help fund and build the successful MCU franchise which has help elevate Marvel today. But the problem is that since Disney has brought Marvel it has caused some negative impacts. One example is the cartoon shows one being Avengers Earths Mightiest Heroes. That show was comic accurate and portrayed a brilliant representation of each character. Then came along the first avengers film back in 2012 which caused Disney to create Avengers Assemble which was hardly good compared to its predecessor. Lastly Marvel comics is trying to a lot like be the MCU these days for instance Ms Marvel is not an inhuman instead she‚Äôs an mutant which is strange and now in the comics they are making her part inhuman and part x-men which is strange."
1,2023-07-26,CMV: Total lead time would be a better decider for penalty shoot-outs in international football matches (soccer),u/VertigoOne,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15a51jg/cmv_total_lead_time_would_be_a_better_decider_for/,changemyview,"Penalty shoot outs have always seemed an excruciating and frankly painfully stressful way to decide higher level international football matches (Euros, African Cup of Nations, Copa Asia, the World Cup etc). A much better alternative in my view would be lead time.

&#x200B;

To explain what is meant by this, lead time would be the total time that a given team was in the lead in a game, and by how much. The team that was in the lead for longer, and by a larger margin, would win

&#x200B;

So for example, take this game between the Republic of Hypothetica (RH), and Testland (TL), that went like this

&#x200B;

First goal - RH - 05 mins

Second goal - TL - 16 mins

Third goal - RH - 25 mins

Fourth goal - RH - 39 mins

Fifth goal - TL - 62 mins

Sixth goal - TL - 88 mins

Seventh goal - TL - EXT - 112 mins

Eighth goal - RH - 119 mins

&#x200B;

In this 4-4 game after extra time, the points go like this

&#x200B;

First five mins - 0-0 - no lead time

Between 1st-2nd goal - 0-1 RH - 11 mins with lead of 1

Between 2nd-3rd goal 1-1 - NLT

Between 3rd-4th goal 2-1 RH - 14 mins with lead of 1

Between 4th-5th goal - 3-1 - RH - 23 mins with lead of 2

Between 5th-6th goal - 3-2 - RH - 26 mins with lead of 1

Between 6th-7th goal - 3-3 - NLT

Between 7th-8th goal - 3-4 - TL - 7 mins with lead of 1

&#x200B;

This then makes the winners RH because TL was only in the lead for seven minutes, while RH was in the lead for a total of 74 minutes, of which 23 minutes were a lead of two.

So if we count it as 1pt per second per goal lead, that means RH had 5820pts, while TL only had 420pts

&#x200B;

The big advantage of this system over the current one is that it puts the pressure on the game as a whole. It makes every part of the game much more impactful if every second you are in the lead means points. All the team is now much more involved, rather than just the dramatic moments at the end.

&#x200B;

It also removes the heros and villans element of things, which has created some really awful drama for many players throughout history (as an English person I think of how David Beckham was reviled after one particular WC, but that's just one example)

&#x200B;

While this kind of system obviously wouldn't be practical for lower level games without good equipment, I feel it makes sense for high level international play, because it makes a focus on the whole team and the whole game, not just five minutes at the end.

&#x200B;

Just a note about the discussion - I'm only interested in arguments about why the current system would hypothetically be better than this. Not arguments like ""wouldn't total possession be better?"" or ""wouldn't X OTHER METRIC be better"". I'd just like to compare this system against the current system of penalties."
1,2023-07-26,"CMV: ""Loli art"" is CSEM and the people who like it are pedophiles.",u/SixStrungKing,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15a5jsq/cmv_loli_art_is_csem_and_the_people_who_like_it/,changemyview,"So whenever I put this view for it, the pedos come out. I'd like to put it in a neutral ground so people that don't give me the ick come out and maybe then I'll hear an argument that doesn't make me wish the cops would search people's computers.

Seriously, the last guy who talked to me about this told me he'd ""do anything to get cunny."" Let that marinate.

I also saw a video of a woman at an anime convention holding up a sign that said ""Sexualising Lolis = Pedophilia"" and the guy following her recording was demanding to know if she was looking for a fight. That's... That's anime fans, however this dude felt so comfortable demanding a fight over it... I got no words for bow that makes my skin crawl.

I know this is reddit and it attracts pedophiles like flies to honey-slathered shit, but I'm hoping to hear from some normal people who disagree.

So, I'm reasonably firm of the belief that Loli is CSEM (child sexual exploitation materials), pedophiles tell me it's not CP, it's a drawing. But then when you ask ""A drawing of what?"" They say doesn't matter, it's still a drawing. When the whole conversation is about what it's a drawing of. Regardless of whether it's real, it's a drawing of a child being raped. It's literal CSEM.

I'll admit, there is a barrier between art and reality, but when we look at Johnny Rebel songs and the people who listen to them, are we not fair in admitting that ""Send 'em All Back To Africa"" is a racist song made for racists? If not, why not?

Legitimate artistic expression? Yes.

Does it tell you something about the artist and listeners? Yes.

Exactly what kind of person wants to view pornographic depictions of a child being raped? Outside of pedophiles I think im correct in assuming exactly 0 people.

And if you're going to tell me that it's not pedophiles looking at loli, then I've just got to ask, really? It's not pedophiles looking at child porn? I've seen the research, the studies abstract was a poll, people lie in polls, it did not put the participants through a sexual deviancy test. It did not do any brain scans to measure the difference between gray matter around the cerebral cortex that separates a pedophilic person from someone without a paraphilia condition. I understand I'm looking at the situation and carving its face up with Occam's Razor, and that may be a flaw in my thinking, but come on.

I've seen other research which shows that people who have a paraphillic tendencies, who engage in pornographic materials that reflect that paraphilia, are most likely to offend as a first offence or residivisticly, paraphiles who do not, are not as likely to offend. Those who have offended and stop engaging with said materials show a dramatic statistical reduction in recidivism.

I understand that's base survivors bias, those who do seek out materials reflecting their offensive behaviour are more likely to offend.

They also tell me that if I play fictional video games where fictional people die because I fictionally murdered them, I must admit that it's not any different than looking at fictional porn where fictional children get fictionally raped.

I can see the egg of an argument here, however the function of a video game and pornography are different. I do not feel as though my urges for any particular thing are being engaged by video games, I play them to have some fun, challenging task that I can get better at with relatively minimal effort. 

I've never taken pleasure for killing people in a video game, though. I've never thought ""man I enjoy killing that guy."" I've taken pleasure in beating the game, doing well at it, beating other players, but never from the murder aspect.

When I'm watching porn it's a different story, I'm taking direct sexual pleasure in watching people have sex. You might say if I'm watching for that reason, then I'm admitting to voyeuristic urges. I'm going to be embarrassingly upfront here. You are correct in assuming that. I have on several occasions, with consenting adults, asked or was asked and been allowed to watch them do their thing. I've also taken enjoyment in being watched, hell, I have even enjoyed being watched when i was performing solo.

Again, I must reiterate, I asked or was asked, did my best not to make anyone feel pressured and accepted it as an end of story if and when I was told no and I knew all parties involved were consenting adults. I may be a pervert, though I do have a sense of morals.

I also hear ""it's not illegal.""

... Yes it is. In the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, The UK, basically the entire English speaking world, it's illegal. I know there's jurisdictions, but in all of these countries, if you're dealing with federal police and they catch you with ""loli art"" you are going to be arrested for child pornography.

Personally I think this argument comes from people who don't bother to look up the law, people who look up their jurisdictions laws and decide to stop reading there, or people who desperately don't want you to report them to the police.

And personally I'm glad if someone gets caught with it by a fed. A pedophile with two cuffed hands has no hands left to touch kids, I tell you what.

And the one argument that makes me actually angry, ""So its purely the number 18 thats important, you think its wrong to have sex with someone one hour before they turn 18, but not one hour after.""

I liked 18 year old women when they were close to my age. Now they're not, and I find them kind of... look, I'm not being mean to 18 year olds, but I can't like you like that anymore. You guys are inexperienced in the whole dating thing, inexperienced in everything. I can barely feel comfortable having you guys as coworkers without thinking you're gonna fuck something up and burn down my place of business while I'm not looking.

It wouldn't be illegal for me to have sex with an 18 year old, that wouldn't make it right. I can't view it as morally responsible to sleep with one.

It makes me angry because you're making a pretty sharp assumption about my sexuality. I have always been attracted to people close to my age, sometimes older.

I can't think about the people who like Loli without assuming their pedophiles. I know it's an assumption and I understand that a lot of my opinion is based on an emotional gut reaction of ""Looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, has a nine inch explosive corkscrew penis like a duck, must be a duck"" so I'd like to hear any counterpoints. Please just don't get weirdly sexual over children and send me links to the creepy body pillows you intend to buy like some of the priors."

1,2023-07-26,CMV: Liberals are much more inefficient than conservatives when it comes to winning in politics.,u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15a5lhg/cmv_liberals_are_much_more_inefficient_than/,changemyview,"Let's look at the 2016 election as an example:

There is *no way* that a Republican version of Hillary Clinton (imagine, say, someone straight-laced like Robert Gates or Mitt Romney, or someone highly experienced as a senator and SecState) would have lost to a Democratic version of Donald Trump (imagine some overweight 70-year old liberal candidate who bragged, ""Just grab 'em by the pussy,"" \[or, 'grab men by the dick?'\] or mocked a disabled reporter, grinned with a taco bowl saying ""I love Hispanics!"" - or, maybe, posing with a bowl of grits and leering, ""I love Southerners/rural voters!?"", taunted John McCain for having been captured in Vietnam, pronounced ""II Corinthians"" as ""Two Corinthians,"" spoke thousands of documented lies, etc.) **No way.** Such a Republican would have crushed the Democratic Trump, maybe something like 400 electoral votes to 138. Landslide.

Even Hillary herself complained during a speech in 2016, ""Why am I not 50 (percentage) points ahead?""

But instead, Hillary lost to Trump - by a narrow margin, but a defeat nonetheless.

Now let's fast-forward to 2020. There is **no way** that a Democratic president who was the liberal version of Trump - having uttered 13,000 documented lies, having bungled the handling of a pandemic and gotten half a million Americans killed as a result, a wrecked economy, publicly adored Kim Jong Un, Putin, Xi, Assad and other tyrants, would get anywhere *near* a Republican challenger. Such a Democratic incumbent would - again - be **demolished**. But.....in real life, Trump performed astonishingly well in 2020, considering the circumstances, and was actually just *a few stadiums' capacity of voters* away from winning reelection, had he gotten just a bit more votes in swing states. A lot of people don't realize just how close Trump came to defeating Biden in 2020.

And the amount of outrage that Trump received for his gaffes was way lower compared to what a Democrat would have gotten, on a per-gaffe basis. Can you imagine how Republicans would have reacted if Obama had said, ""The continental army captured the **airports** during the Revolutionary War,"" for instance? 

I could list many more examples of Democrats underperforming compared to how they *ought* to perform, but I don't want this to become a 10,000-word thread OP. Liberals have the media advantage, the numbers advantage (there are 20 million more registered D's than R's in the nation,) the youth advantage, but don't win like it at all.

Basically, liberals are the equivalent of an NFL football team that has 15 Pro Bowlers on their roster, yet do no better in the playoffs than the conservative team that has only 2 Pro Bowlers - in fact, often performing even *worse*.

Example 1:

[https://youtu.be/E3qI2mqvo8A](https://youtu.be/E3qI2mqvo8A)

The media will try to make the hospital look bad for kicking an obese man out of their obesity program for ordering a pizza. Of course, Steven Assanti was the one who perpetrated it. 

I am certain that ""ordering a pizza"" was not the reason why Steven was expelled from the hospital, as he posted this video on his YouTube while he was in that hospital.

[https://youtu.be/a87SkHd77Rs](https://youtu.be/a87SkHd77Rs)

They media didn't mention that Steven was being abusive to the nurses. When Steven was kicked out, I'm certain the conversation went something like this:

>Hospital: Mr. Assanti, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to dismiss you from our program.  
>  
>Steven: Why?  
>  
>Hospital: First of all, it's clear you're not committed to bettering your health, as evidenced by the fact that you're ordering food that is strictly prohibited. Second of all, you've been verbally abusive to our nursing staff, shouting racial and misogynistic slurs at them.  
>  
>Steven: So, you're kicking me out for ordering a pizza?  
>  
>Hospital: That's part of it.  
>  
>Steven: Do I need to call the news?  
>  
>Hospital: That's your perogative.  
>  
>Steven: \*calls news\* Hello, I got a story for you! I'm 800 lbs and was in an obesity program, and this hospital kicked me out for ordering a pizza. Can you believe this? I have nowhere to go, I'm fucking homeless!  
>  
>Media: \*eats that shit right up\*

Example 2: 

[https://youtu.be/JJ8CiHFqhF8](https://youtu.be/JJ8CiHFqhF8)

I know it's an old story.

This particular story is from 2008. It's also an example of how personal responsibility has gone by the wayside.

The news briefly glosses over how the boy has had a history of misbehaving in class, but the parents' focus is on how the boy was saying how the teacher is mean to him. Instead of making the connection between his bad behavior remarks and the teacher being mean, they decide to plant a recording device on him and they catch the teacher at a bad time.

It was clearly late in the school year, and apparently the boy was misbehaving the whole time, and the teacher had had enough. 

Instead of the parents punishing the boy for misbehaving in school, they get the teacher suspended. It's bullshit and it doesn't paint a balanced story.

Example 3:

The infamous ""gobble gobble"" incident

[https://www.insideedition.com/19984-mom-left-heartbroken-after-teacher-snatched-mic-from-autistic-son-during-school-play](https://www.insideedition.com/19984-mom-left-heartbroken-after-teacher-snatched-mic-from-autistic-son-during-school-play)

This is *INSIDE EDITION*. It's supposed to be a well-respected, reputable news program, and they dind't bother to do thorough journalism. They went off the 30-second clip that was circulated on Facebook. 

Had they done some thorough reporting, they'd know the following facts:

* The program was OVER, which was why the teacher had taken the microphone
* The boy in question did not attend any rehearsals and his parents didn't sign permission slips
* The parents showed up on the day of the production to demand that the teacher put the boy in the play
* The teacher, out of the kindness of her heart, put him in, but with no speaking roles
* **If you watched the whole 12 minute play**, you'll see that the boy runs up to the mic, despite not having any lines, and ad-libs some random stuff
* The media keeps going on the lie of ""he only wanted to say 'gobble gobble.'"" That's not true. He had no lines. When he was up at the mic the last time, we don't know if he wanted to say ""gobble gobble"" or the new colorful language he learned from the 6th graders.

As a result of the media's misinformation, the school's phone lines were jammed up with death threats to the point where the teacher's safety was in jeopardy.

Example 4: 

On average, the news is on for 33% of the TV's scheduled programming, but they also feel the need to hog the other 67% they're not scheduled for at their own discretion, especially for issues that aren't that important, such as a celebrity dying, a former POTUS or FLOTUS dying, a presidential speech, or weather. 

I'll concede that informing us of those events is important, but if I'm watching Jeopardy, God damn it, let me watch Jeopardy. If it's urgent, flash it across the screen. Regarding POTUS speech, give us the cliffnotes version at your next news hour.

However, they also have the tendency to make people who speak up against them cutting into their programs look like the bad guys.

Go fuck yourself.

I don't need to go into intimate detail on how much flying sucks. Thanks Osama. By the time people are on the plane, they're powder kegs waiting to go boom.

But the Airlines and airports don't want to address how shitty the process is. They just want to cry to the media when someone's powder keg goes boom.

I watched the trailer for the first time a few weeks ago, and I was... excited? I mean, it looked goofy, comedic, and overall a breath of fresh air to enjoy, so I went to the theatre today expecting to have a good laugh with some friends. God was I dissapointed.  
  
Yeah, the movie is basically feminist propaganda.  
  
Let it be known that I have nothing against feminist messages in movies and media, but- this movie is basically feminist propaganda.  
  
The entire movie was basically just: men bad, patriarchy bad, girls rule.  
  
The main argument for the movie I've seen on other posts is That Barbyland is basically a representation of the patriarchy where the genders are reversed, where women have all of the seats in the Supreme Court, they have all the occupations, and men are just decorations/eye candy who don't even have a place to live. So if I don't like how the kens are portrayed in Barbyland, I'm just a hypocrite.  
  
But that isn't how women are treated IRL?  
I mean, women hold four seats in the Supreme Court, and they have no limitations when it comes to job occupations, so if Barbie really wanted to portray the kens like how women are portrayed in real life, wouldn't they give them half of the jobs, four seats in the Supreme Court, places to live, etc.? But no, Barbie just wants to show how women are just so oppressed in society and soo powerless...  
  
With that out of the way, let me talk about the main storyline in Barbyland.  
  
In the beginning, the Barbies rule everything, and Barbyland is basically just a matriarchy where the men are treated as complete decorations to the place, and basically mean nothing. After Ken came to the real world, he realizes that men aren't just decorations and eye candy, and can be something other than just- Barbie's boyfriend. Ken then Uses this knowledge to overthrow the Barbies, and kind of gives Barbie a taste of her own medicine by turning Barbyland into a patriarchy and turning the Barbies into decorations and eye candy. But suddenly when Ken does it, it becomes a problem. Barbie, with her friends, then uses the power of modern feminism and their ideals to save the day, and turn Barbyland back into an oppressive matriarchy where the Kens are again treated like decorations and eye candy, which is supposed to be a good ending to the movie??? The movie literally has the main Ken denounced the ideals of the patriarchy and completely accept the matriarchy as the best choice, instead of equality.  
  
Now, I know many of you might argue and say that since the Kens were supposed to represent women, and the Barbies are supposed to represent men, The ending might represent the patriarchy oppresively taking back barbyland from the matriarchy, and that's why it makes sense? But that's also a stupid argument, because it means that the movies ending, which relies on feminism, is bad and villainous? If it sounds stupid to you, believe me, I find it stupid aswell.  
  
I'm not even going to get into how men were portrayed as complete pigs that demean women in the real world, because anyone who isn't completely brainwashed would know that that's BS...  
  
The movie also heavily talks about the struggles of women and how they have to go through so much and they have so many problems, With many of the points directly insulting men and the patriarchy, but I'm not gonna get into that either.  
  
Barbie is shit.  
  
Don't watch it."
1,2023-07-26,CMV: The Barbie movie is low key a critique of radical feminism,u/RaindropDripDropTop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15abi5d/cmv_the_barbie_movie_is_low_key_a_critique_of/,changemyview,"**DISCLAIMER** There will be spoilers of Barbie (2023)

First of all, I will just say that I enjoyed Barbie, it has amazing visuals and set design, and was overall a fun time at the movies. It wasn't a masterpiece or anything like that, but it was at least better than most blockbuster movies we get these days. I also do not think the filmmakers (Greta Gerwig and her husband) intended for this to be a critique against radical feminism, I would say that this was probably unintentional. It's one of those things where the intent of the artist doesn't necessarily mean the art itself reflects their intent. 

Anyway, the core premise of the Barbie movie is that the power dynamics of the real world when it comes to gender are reversed in Barbieland. The Barbies run everything and have all the power in society. Barbie is the president, Barbies hold the Supreme court, Barbie is the leading physicist, doctor, astronaut, business executive, etc. Meanwhile the Kens are essentially objectified and treated as accessories and second class citizens. 

Barbie and Ken then go to the real world, where Ken discovers the concept of patriarchy. He sees men in positions of power in society, he reads a bunch of literature about the patriarchy, which then radicalizes him. He returns to Barbieland, brainwashes everyone, and then the Kens end up taking the control of Barbieland. Kens become the president, Kens control the supreme court, become the physicists, doctors, business executives, leaders, etc. 

We then find out later in the movie that achieving all these positions of power in society did not actually fulfill the Kens or make them happy. Ken outright states that running everything actually kind of sucked and having all that responsibility made their lives more difficult. In the end the only thing the Kens really wanted was to have relationships with the Barbies. 

If you don't see how this is actually low key a critique of radical feminism, just remember that the core premise of the movie is that gender roles are essentially reversed in Barbieland. The Barbies have the stereotypical gender roles that men have in the real world, and the Kens have the stereotypical gender roles that women have in the real world. For all intents and purposes, the Barbies represent the patriarchy and the Kens represent the plight of women in the real world. For the record, I'm aware that radical feminism is not advocating for a matriarchy, that it's advocating for equality, but also keep in mind that everything in this movie is exaggerated and taken to extremes for comedic effect. 

Some other things to note about this movie. (1) Barbie is supposed to be a feminist icon that empowers women and help solve some of issues women face in the real world. However, once Barbie goes to the real world, she finds out that those issues still exist in the real world and that Barbieland was just a fantasy. (2) Barbie's character arc is that Barbieland is the perfect ideal world where Barbies run society and can be anything they want, but she has an existential crisis and in the end of the movie she decides to become a human because she would rather be the person idealizing about the empowerment of women, rather than actually being the ideal herself.

Another thing I will add that's not really relevant but interesting nonetheless, after Barbie becomes a human (i.e. a real woman), at the very ending of the movie, ""Barbara"" goes to see the gynecologist, which if you think about it has a bit of a TERF undertone to it."
1,2023-07-26,"CMV: Women are nowhere near as terrible as so many men claim, and the reason why so many think they are, is because they find it easier to hate/blame women than put in the effort to look within and sort out their personal issues",u/FormerShadow1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15ac5vx/cmv_women_are_nowhere_near_as_terrible_as_so_many/,changemyview,"I often come across this recurring issue in my personal encounters with men (whether directed at me or another woman), and it has increased quite significantly in recent years. It has also blown up like a supervolcano on the internet. Let me clarify that I understand this does not apply to all men, as there are women who display equal rudeness towards men. However, in recent times, I have observed a noticeable increase in such behavior from men towards women. It seems that many men enjoy preaching about how all women are shallow, entitled, gold-digging individuals who solely pursue men over 6 feet tall or men who are extremely wealthy. I will first say that this is a highly exaggerated stereotype that is not based in everyday reality. Women do not chase after tall, handsome rich men any more than men chase after ditzy, underweight supermodels. Their expressions of hatred, attacks, and overall negativity towards women they either just met, or haven't even met at all, are truly disheartening. 

I can't help but wonder, where do they obtain their information? Popular reality TV shows like the Kardashian Show? TikTok? Movies? If so, you need to understand that these are severely exaggerated versions of society. If you take a closer look at the couples around you, do you only see women with tall men? Do you only see men with young, skinny women? The truth is, when you examine married couples, you'll find that many of them are genuinely happy. But they don't portray that in the media because that's boring. People want drama, hence the reason we primarily hear about the negative. 

Among all the women I've personally encountered, including myself, I can hardly recall a handful of instances where someone rejected a guy based on his height, income, or any superficial criteria. The only time I witnessed such behavior was back in high school. Please don't misunderstand me; I acknowledge their existence, as I've come across them online and may have encountered a few in person without truly knowing them. Undoubtedly, they are unpleasant individuals. But let's not forget that we, too, understand what it feels like to be rejected based on our appearance. During high school, I had friends who were far more attractive than me, and guys would often approach me just to get closer to them. I am well aware of the pain caused by such treatment. However, it's crucial to recognize that these experiences are not representative of everyone, and it is not acceptable to attack an entire gender based on the actions of a few individuals.

We don't hold men to any higher standards than we hold ourselves. We simply expect them to be financially responsible, prioritize bills before indulgences, take care of their health, be kind-hearted individuals, and be good partners. Now, before you retort with, ""Yeah right! Women always claim they want a nice caring guy, but they're liars! They just want to use us as backup options until they decide to leave us for someone more attractive!"" I'd like you to honestly evaluate your own attitude. Are you genuinely being ""nice""? The truth is, you come across as rude, bitter, self-loathing, and emotionally draining. You wouldn't want a woman who treats men in that manner, so why would we want a man who treats women that way? If a woman cheated on you or betrayed you in a significant way, I genuinely sympathize with your pain. Whoever did that to you is indeed a horrible person. However, it's important to recognize that her actions don't define all women. Women don't cheat; cheaters cheat. People of either gender cheat because they, as an individual, possesses a significant character flaw. Its not a gender problem.

In reality, it's important for both men and women to have their lives in order when seeking a partner. It's not just about someone ticking off all the right boxes on paper; there needs to be a genuine connection. Chemistry plays a significant role, and there's a biological aspect to it that goes beyond society's conventional standards of beauty and lifestyle. Finding the right partner is a challenging process, and in the dating world, both sides will experience rejection before finding compatibility. That's just a part of life.

Also, regarding ""body positivity"", it's essential to clarify that women's support for ""body positivity"" doesn't mean what a lot of people seem to think it means. It does not involve promoting obesity or encouraging destructive behaviors. It simply means treating people with respect and refraining from shaming or any kind of destructive criticism. People don't need to be told what they look like, let alone shamed. They already know. Yes, that includes men as well, and I (alongside most) agree that it is very hypocritical if a woman rejects a man because of his appearance but then protests if he does the same to her.

Another controversial topic is ""modern feminism"". it's important to recognize that most women do not endorse the so-called toxic feminism that some men assume we follow blindly. We don't believe in entitlement or expect special treatment without reciprocating. It's true that there are women who misunderstand the concept of ""equality"" and demand privileges while avoiding responsibility. Personally, I find such behavior appalling, as do the majority of women. However, it's crucial to note that these individuals are rare and do not represent the whole.

Unfortunately, many men tend to generalize and attack all women based on the actions of a few. Therefore, I want to make it clear that our dislike for these particular individuals has nothing to do with their height, income, or assets. Such factors are irrelevant when it comes to choosing a lifelong partner. It is the attitude that repells us. Men do not enjoy the company of women with such attitudes, so why would women want to be around a man who behaves in such a way?

From my perspective, there is very little evidence to support the emerging trend of hating women. I believe that many men have experienced pain, whether it's due to childhood incidents or past toxic relationships, and instead of addressing the root of their issues and working on personal growth, they find it easier to place blame and harbor resentment towards women. The same can be said for women who claim that all men are terrible. They are equally responsible for perpetuating a harmful mindset. Blaming others in this context serves as a convenient avoidance tactic, and it's crucial for people to abandon this behavior.

So, let's take a moment to consider the sources of our information. Reflect on what you observe in real life. I am open to having my perspective challenged and my view changed if I am mistaken."

This isn't a ""diversity bad"" take. This is a "" studio exec tickboxes may screw up the show, even if those tickboxes come originally from good intentions"" take

Here is a count, by Phase, of Marvel projects which had someone that's not a white dude as either the main character, the main antagonist, or the new character spotlighted over the main character (such as Loki or Hawkeye). For team movies, the ""main"" character is the one with the most focus (let's be honest it's usually Ironman)

Phase 1: 0/6
Phase 2: 0/6
Phase 3-1: 1/6
Phase 3-2: 3/6
Phase 4: 12/14 (all except Thor 4 and Spiderman 3)
Phase 5 (current information): 11/12 (all except Daredevil: Born Again)

In hindsight, it's crazy it took almost a decade to get the first movie to qualify (Thor: Ragnarok). Shows pretty adamantly the need for a big shift.

A full show about the antagonism between two white dudes, who have already had three full seasons about them, is very likely to sideline either one or both to make way for new characters more in line with recent trends.

With Secret Invasion, Marvel has showed they can take a slam dunk and turn it into a warm yellow shower. So the idea of the new Daredevil show avoiding these pitfalls feels unlikely.

That would be a shame, because I loved the Daredevil show, and I'd love more stories about those characters, but trends point to that not being the case."
1,2023-07-26,CMV: Modern corporations would rather have our current capitalist system instead of slavery.,u/Human-Advertising-64,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15aeykq/cmv_modern_corporations_would_rather_have_our/,changemyview,"Let's use Walmart for our corporate example. 

In the current system, they have access to millions of ""government raised"" employees at any given moment. If they have an open position, they hire some kid for $12/hr with no other strings attached. They'll give him/her part time hours, so they're not responsible for health care, benefits, 401k, housing, etc.

They even have a built-in ""rebate"" system to cut costs even further. Walmart apparently has the most employees on welfare out of any corporation. That means their employees pay taxes, part of their taxes come back to them in the form of food stamps, and then they spend their food stamps at the walmart they work at. It's genius.

Now if slavery was legal and let's say each Walmart location required 200 employees to operate. That means you need to purchase roughly 400-450 slaves to operate both shifts. Adjusting for inflation, the cost of each slave today would be roughly $25-50k. So the upfront cost of the slaves could get up to $20-25 million, if not more.  

You then need to build massive housing complexes to house them. You need to feed them, bus them to and from the Walmart location, have 24 hour security to prevent escaping at the housing complex AND at the Walmart location, provide some form of entertainment/distraction in order to prevent rioting and improve morale, etc.

If a slave gets sick or injured on the job, you are responsible for surgery, wasted time in recovery, etc. Otherwise you risk losing a $50,000 asset. Conversely, if a normal hourly employee gets sick, they take unpaid sick days and don't cost anything. If an hourly employee gets a herniated disc from stocking shelves, they are essentially fired and most of the financial responsibility is shifted to the state/government via workers' comp and SSI/disability."

Then we have a bunch of other people who say ""Oh, most feminists are not actually like that"" when they ARE actually like that. And I am starting to realise feminism isn't equality nowadays, maybe it used to, but it isn't. It is usually just people who hate men. They say ""helping one gender helps the other"" while they actively do stuff like this and then post articles like this. That just isn't ""equality"" it is supremacy of one gender. And then when someone actually comes forward and says all of this, they are ""a tool of the partiarchy, mysogynist"" or have ""internalized mysogny"". It is all so stupid.

Now onto other things, such as rape and child support. First lets look into rape: You can get your life ruined by 1 false allegation made by a woman, made possible by the #meetoo movement. Don't get me wrong, it is/was a good movement, but the pendulum swings both ways. I would like to suggest 2 videos made by GEN, the youtuber is really good. Quick side note: the gender pay gap isn't real in the western society. Now child support. I am not here to comment on how men pay child support more often than women, there are reasons to that, but I would like to say is that a woman has a choice not to pay it. Now, lets say a woman gets pregnant. She has the right to abort the baby, and if she doesn't, the father has to pay child support\\stay with the kid for 18 years. Now, I know many of you will say ""sHOuLD, HAVe KePt it IN hIs PaNTs"" but that can swing both ways so don't even BOTHER.

There is no science behind art and none of these designers are Einsteins so its pointless trying. Most logo changes ends up looking pretty much the same which ruins the purpose of making them recognizable and easy to memorize.

Some changes are not even noticeable, the blue color you get when highlighting stuff on Google Chrome, it is now two shades darker for some reason.

These bans are good because they can save the lives of many people through the banning and required registration of these weapons (my favorite one so far is the  Illinois ban which bans everything semiautomatic going forward and requires registration. That's how you do it right there!) under penalty of prosecution. Who knows how many mass killers have been stopped by California's AWB? We'll never know because there's no reliable info on it. We have info from every other nation that's enacted gun bans and it shows a drop in gun crime across the board.

With the GOP losing hard next year we might even see a real chance at another national AWB! With the SCOTUS being completely spineless they won't touch it either.

But I also don't NOT believe it, if it makes sense. On this issue, I am truly torn. If anyone in this subreddit is ever truly coming to you accepting that their opinion is flawed and who is looking for a conversation rather than a debate, trust me, I am very much that person. Also, FWIW, I am indeed single myself, 38 year old male, and about ready to just give up on trying to find love.

This is a two-part belief, both that one is better off in a relationship and also that everyone believes it. Let me go through the second part of this first and explain why I think you all have this opinion: just look at the rhetoric surrounding the timelines we follow in achieving various things in our lives. Any time someone comes to you and says ""dear me, I am 30 years old and still single, what ever has become of me"", the response is always ""don't worry about it, plenty of people find partners much later in life!"" But did you catch the subtext there? The subtext is clearly ""you should indeed still get yourself a partner"". It's never ""well, if you've reached this point in your life and are still single, perhaps you've just actually just realized that you're happier as a single person and should embrace that"". You NEVER hear this. It is ALWAYS something like ""make the most of this time to get to know yourself!"" \[subtext: that time is meant to be temporary, clearly\]. Or the aforementioned business about getting to that point whenever is best for you \[so long as you still try to get there eventually, right??\].

You know what r/singles is? It's sure as hell not a support community for singles or a place for singles to come and collectively talk about the being-single experience; it's people advertising the fact that they are single *so that someone can snatch them up and make them non-single.* The embrace of single life simply does not exist.

Why do I believe that everyone is better off in a relationship? All the statistics out there seem to say that those in loving relationships are happier than those who aren't. They also just live longer because of it. People write beautiful songs and poems and paint these amazing works of art in the name of love but never in the name of getting full control of the remote for the evening. I imagine that's because one of these lifestyles is very, very clearly better than the other.

You might come here and say, nah, you do you, man, you stay single if you want to, whatevski. But do you really believe that? Like, REALLY believe that? Because I sure as hell don't, and I'm even someone who probably really, really enjoys single life a hell of a lot more than others seem to. I hear about married folks who talk about how they're so BORED because their spouse isn't around...like are you kidding me? If I had hardly any time to myself and then finally got some, do you have any idea how many freaking books I have to read, TV shows to watch, short stories / novellas / maybe even full novel I want to write, photography sessions, going out for drinks with an old friend, finally figuring out how to reach diamond league in Starcraft 2, etcetera etcetera etcetera? I'm often bummed to have to go to sleep at the end of the day because I didn't have nearly enough time to do all the things I wanted to do, and I'm even a single dude with all this time at my disposal! And STILL I cannot shake this belief that actually I'd be better off in a romantic relationship, sharing my life and my time with someone else. 

It's quite odd and I can't make sense of it. So help me, dear members of r/CMV, and please, CMV."

I don't want to sound out-of-touch, but there are ramifications to any method to attempt to relieve petrol prices:

* Lowering the fuel excise? That will mean less money for the government to spend on other programs and/or provide an excuse to raise other taxes.
* Petrol subsidies? See above.
* Price controls? Would fail to address shortages if prices are lower than demand and/or create a black market where petrol would be available at the price where it would organically be.
* Increasing oil production? Requires investment in more oil infrastructure, not to mention the environmental costs of increased fossil fuel consumption.
* Securing the oil supply? Will require [unjustified wars of aggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq) and [political interference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNNMD1sVoc8) \- and Australia has been guilty of both in the past - not to mention the human and economic costs of war and political interference.

You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs. We have to understand what it would take to reduce petrol prices, because all the options have some negative consequence.

In my opinion, we are in this rut because we have consistently elected incompetent politicians (i.e. the sort who'd be 2/2/2 or lower in *Europa Universalis IV*) who have failed to implement long-term solutions (e.g. we've had governments who suppressed renewable energy investment). This in turn makes democracy look bad, and makes people struggle with cost of living pressures. In my opinion, the Liberal Party are not the solution, but for impoverished Australians who can't afford to cut back further (and thankfully, I'm not ""impoverished""), I don't see how any party can be the solution.

The closest thing I can imagine to being a ""solution"" is to introduce mandatory fuel efficiency standards, [which Australia lacks](https://www.iea.org/articles/fuel-economy-in-australia). But even in this case, a lot of impoverished Australians will still complain that they can't afford a new and more efficient motor vehicle."

If they want to die nobody should stop them. There is nothing negative about the state of being dead, and the value we ascribe to life is extremely real to us yet doesn‚Äôt objectively exist. 

Most people have to die against their will and full of fear. Genuinely wanting to die at the time you die is a gift in a weird way. 

Someone dying is absolutely a mental scar for other people who know them, but it doesn‚Äôt matter at all for the person who is dead. I don‚Äôt think any person should owe their being-aliveness to other people if they don‚Äôt have children. It sucks but it is what it is. People die. It‚Äôs just a product of the human ego to be so resistant to death. 

This isn‚Äôt real and nobody asks to be here. If someone wants to nope out, I don‚Äôt see what the big deal is. Even if they‚Äôre delusional and would get better, it still doesn‚Äôt matter because again there‚Äôs nothing bad about being dead.

It‚Äôs literally just extremely sad and depressing to think about as a person who‚Äôs alive. And like the hypothetical potential alternative future we make up in our heads. There‚Äôs no objective issue it‚Äôs just sad for other people. 

If someone consents to not being alive, and does it by their own hand, why does society have to stop them? 

Like would it be a bad hypothetical world to have death be treated differently? What if suicide could be a happy and open thing where you have a going-away party for someone and make a day out of it and accept their choice, and are by their side as they finally get their peace. 

Wouldn‚Äôt that be better than freaking out and having to call an ambulance on your friend and they get hospitalized for a while and then suffer for another five years before they get the motivation to try again?

This trend will lead to a huge portion of our society unprepared for adulthood or working regular, stable jobs that earn the national average in terms of income. Anecdotally, three friends through university dropped out to focus on their OF business. I‚Äôve had full-time colleagues drop down to casual work to do the same thing. This career in particular provides a pension, benefits, and a solid income when compared to the national average.

Looks are temporary and don‚Äôt last forever. When that easy money stops, will people be prepared to take jobs that aren‚Äôt glamorous? Will they be able to wake up at 6am to go to work for a 12 hour shift?"
1,2023-07-26,CMV: I don‚Äôt see how incels are wrong about the ‚Äúit‚Äôs over‚Äù aspect of things,u/BonusBrotherz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15apsj2/cmv_i_dont_see_how_incels_are_wrong_about_the_its/,changemyview,"So I‚Äôm not trying to argue that incels are right about everything. I‚Äôm anti misogyny and do not agree with incel views that are misogynistic. Just with this specific thing, I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôre wrong with this specific thing.

So what I mean is that the idea that certain people that are destined to be alone due to factors out of their control (mainly physically appearance and inherent personality traits). 

I think this is 100% a valid belief. I mean whether we want to admit it or not, most people desire to be physically attracted to their partner. Yes there are demisexual people who make up a tiny fraction of people, but most aren‚Äôt willing to give a chance to a person they aren‚Äôt attracted to. Unfortunately there are some people who are just really ugly. I‚Äôm one of them and denying that people like me exist is just harmful and isolating.

Simply being ugly greatly reduces your chances of finding someone. I mean I‚Äôm 22 and went thought 4 years of college never meeting a girl who found me attractive enough to give a chance to. It‚Äôs just how things happen. Enough people exist that I think simply saying guys like me don‚Äôt exist is a statistic impossibility, if you wanna argue that most incels aren‚Äôt in my shoes that would be fair, but I don‚Äôt think saying anyone can find a partner regardless of how they look is right.

I also think there are inherent personality defects that some people may have that make ‚Äúit over‚Äù for them. For example, I‚Äôm a severe introvert, have awful social anxiety which prevented me from devolving socially when I was young. Now I struggle a lot and there‚Äôs not much I could do to change that. My brain chemistry is just not built in an attractive way. Just like how some people are naturally charismatic, witty, and funny, some of us are incapable of being that. 

I mean if everyone was, why wouldn‚Äôt we all be.

I just think there‚Äôs some factors that at least when comboed in the dating market make you unwanted."

For the sake of definitions, there are good and bad people, though hard to define objectively. I know some might say ""good and bad people don't exists, there's just animals, we all are redundant animals in a world of torment"".

&#x200B;

* ""No good deed goes unpunished.""
   *  The good person carries the weight of being a good person and having to do the good deed because they are cursed with the knowledge of knowing if they don't do the good thing, the guilt will consume them. The bad people however to not know how to be a good person and/or don't care, they aren't cursed with guilt. They are happy. 
      * The good person cannot stand when bad people break the rules that the good person has to follow. The good person feels betrayed over time, by others, his own people. The good person descends into madness over time. 
   * Regarding the quote. I'll say this quote is true. If you try to live by the rules of what a good person ought to be, all that comes with it is, pain, suffering and utter confusion when you're met with people who appear to be the total opposite of character to you. As we know stress takes it's toll over time, whereby many good people eventually cave to the stress and develop mental illness. Whereas the bad people use others as their crutch, they don't take responsibility for their actions and give all the emotional labor onto others, by externalizing all of the stress, someone else takes the fall. Do this enough times you will get good at externalizing all your stress, twisting words to suit your narrative, painting the pictures you want to see and others will not know how to deal with such advanced maneuvers, of course, being good people, they won't even have defenses setup correctly as they're too busy with the weight of being good people, easy targets for bad characters who lack integrity. 
* Are good people always creative? I don't know but I reckon There's no need for creatives nor creative thinkers. Look at every great dead mathematician. All of them became mentally ill and recluses. There was nothing the greatest mathematicians could do to better those with money and power. Stupidity rules. AI will outdo you all. The only reason for humans to even think for themselves is for their wants, needs and the big one; to survive. As for all creative pursuits, the jobs will be less and less. The demand is higher but people with money will invest it into AI instead of people, and your cozy career will be gone before you could get comfortable. 
* Teachers in school would rather repeatedly victim blame than deal with a highschool bully. When the kid commits suicide from all the emotional neglect (of what they feel is the entire school), the teachers all have a little cry and then it's back to work like it never happened. How many times has a school teacher ever been able to correctly deal with bullies before they had their fun, versus how many victims have complained? Even damage control most teachers cannot do correctly. There is a reason for all this. Teachers know that the kid who keeps getting bullied should just go with the flow, he, being a good kid, should quit pretending/being a good kid at some point in his life and become like the bully. The bully is the ultimate in capitalist ideology which the school teachers recognize as pioneers and upstanding citizens to-be. The victim however is seen as nothing more than a helpless, stupid,  screaming woman in the middle of the street. Who cares for some nobody with no future?"

Consider this hypothetical experiment: if you could freeze the whole universe for a moment, and record the state of distant parts of the universe without being limited by the speed of photons, then you'd have a universal now everywhere in the whole universe, exactly as logic dictates.  
Therefore, that universal ""NOW"" as a point in time without duration, always exist simultaneously in the whole universe, despite YOU (the little human being) cannot capture distant parts of the universe and verify it experimentally, due to the limited speed of light, and lack of a better means.

Humans have evolved into the apex predators of the world. Watch a Lion tear a gazelle to shreds, is it ‚Äúethical‚Äù? No, but the food chain is a fundamental part of nature. I'd respect activist once they approach a pride of lions and demand they go vegan because they're exploiting their prey. If both humans and lions are biologically designed to consume meat, why is it problematic when we eat meat but not them if we‚Äôre both apex predators? 

Here are the reasons I think vegans cause more harm than good

Reason #1 
More vegans would mean we‚Äôd need more farmland which would lead to more deforestation/habitat destruction. This would force animals to relocate to a more packed habitat where there‚Äôs increased competition for resources leading to only the survival of the fittest or they die. 

Reason #2 
Increased pesticide usage would devastate local ecosystems making plants herbivores eat more scarce which would cause a domino effect of predators fighting for less prey. Pesticides also run off into lakes, rivers, and eventually the ocean killing wildlife. 

Reason #3 
Increased natural resource and energy usage. Increased energy usage will result in more pollution. Excess water usage results in more energy used which results in pollution. This would lead to further habitat destruction.

Reason #4
Having lived on a farm in Texas for a short period of time, I‚Äôve seen first hand how many pest are killed. I‚Äôve killed dozens of feral hogs in a day. Countless pest get killed daily at vegan farms/plantations.

Tldr: I think veganism kills more than it saves by destroying ecosystems which is less humane."

The issues I have are specifically with regards to:

Colourism: The notion that people should be differentiated based on their 'shade of black'. I've heard of performing arts students writing gushing, sanctimonious essays. Preaching about how it's supposedly wrong for someone to be cast in a role if they have the wrong shade of skin colour. 


https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47468011

Whilst I'm less concerned about the impact on rich a list actors. This filters down to advertising and theatre. Where performers are not rich and need every job they can get.

In an area where people of colour are already under represented why create an additional barrier. Particularly when it's not a barrier a white actor would face if they wanted to play someone  who had a tan.


Segregation: The idea there should be accomodation and institutions only accessible to people of a certain race. In the UK there was a production of a play recently that only allowed black people at the opening night. Similarly I heard a comic on a BBC comedy podcast (nothing to do with race) call for black only schools where the curriculum is radically different and centered around race. Or in Washington university where they have already created black only campuses:


https://housing.wwu.edu/black-affinity-housing


Affirmative action/positive discrimination: the idea that people should be selected for universities or jobs, not based on their intelect and hard work. But on skin colour. 

In particular the impact on Asian students who were systematically refused places based solely on skin colour. This is not only unfair on students excluded, but deeply patronising to those who were only granted places to tick boxes.

The fact that they called this a ""scandal"" is nothing short of slanderous.

And also the fact that they do this documentary in 2003, four years after Michael passed away, where he didn't have an opportunity to defend himself, was also crappy. 

The episodes aired in 1984 and were not re-ran again until the documentary released, because CBS considered it an ""embarrassment."" I think that's pretty shitty, considering how he died in 1999 and never got the opportunity to see his episodes again.

But, back to the point: the only thing Michael did was have a lot of free time of his hands. He was an AC mechanic and an ice cream truck driver. Both of which are summer jobs. The fall lineup for TV coincides with slow periods for him, so he had a lot of free time on his hands to watch a lot of TV, one new show in Fall 1983 was *Press Your Luck*. 

All he did was look for a loophole and he found it. He saw that there were only five patterns of 18 light sequences, and if you have free time on your hands, it will be obvious to see. 

Not only did he memorize five patterns of 18 sequences, but he also observed how there were two squares that never had a ""Whammy."" Not only did they never have a ""Whammy,"" but they also contained an additional spin.

There may have been producers and executives at CBS in the studio that day with college degrees and decades of business- and tech-savvy experience, but that day, an unemployed ice cream man was the smartest man in the room.

The second smartest man in the room that day might have been Bobby Edwards, the contestant coordinator who initially didn't want to book Michael before he was overruled by Executive Producer Bill Carruthers.

What Michael did was not a ""scandal."" It was a rags to riches story.

The 15 years in between his triumph on *PYL* and his death are another story, but...he will always hold that W that fateful spring day in 1984."

Offshoring exacerbates this because it is a very carbon-intensive process that is not properly accounted for.

Take textiles, for example. Right now, it is cheaper to harvest cotton in the US, ship it overseas to be spun and woven into cloth, ship it again to another country to be made into garments, and then ship it back to the US than it would be to simply do all that domestically. The problem is that all that shipping emits huge amounts of greenhouse gases. A carbon tariff would tax those carbon intensive goods at the border, which would make importers take those environmental costs into account.

I could go into it in greater detail, but I haven't the time. The principle, though, is that getting rid of plastic straws, making more EVs, etc. will be of limited effect if our enemy doesn't pitch in.

A mixture or sometimes maybe just 1 of the following: 

**Drugs** (whether it be weed, alcohol, psychedelics, etc.) - at some point in their life, usually growing up they dabble in it. We know that drugs can expand the mind, especially when you're creating music it can give a sense of freedom and it breaks down the walls that we put up from fear of judgment from others. Throughout the history of music, it's been known that bands or artists simply evolve from some sort of altered state of mind.

Some sort of **childhood trauma** \- seems like studies even suggest that early trauma can help someone be more creative and it brings their pain to the forefront of their music which gives it that extra life. I think back to the Blues and how that was birthed from slavery and extreme pain.

**Natural Talent** \- Goes without saying, but some artists can achieve a great deal of success by hard work rather than having some natural born talent.

In the last few years depression, suicide and virginity have gone up in men. I believe some of this is due to female liberation, now I‚Äôm not saying women are at fault for men struggling however their success creates a byproduct that in turn creates struggle for men. 

You have all these female liberation movements, increased college education, increased success in the working field, increased income and sexual liberation (onlyfans especially). All of these things have been extremely damaging to men and their livelihoods. 

The reason for this is because men are programmed to want to be the leader and men are also programmed to want to reproduce. These things become more difficult to do in a society where women have more freedom and authority. Back then, pretty much every man got a wife, why? Because since women had less choices, they‚Äôd settle for the average man. Also, as men you can never truly be fulfilled if you‚Äôre doing worse financially than your spouse, it emasculates a man when his wife is paying most of the bills or buying the house for them. As a man you‚Äôre instilled to be the lead and this is very damaging when a man isn‚Äôt the lead in a relationship. 

It‚Äôs not really women‚Äôs issue to fix but more so an issue men created by being too nice, but ultimately the stronger the female portion of a society becomes the weaker the male portion of a society becomes.

It's a theory.",u/Lonny_zone,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15b7jxj/cmv_the_science_behind_anthropogenic_climate/,changemyview,"I first became *skeptical* of climate science because of the lies told on part of the NGOs and governments that have lead to money/power grabs on the part of oligarchs, or the oligarchs simply aren't practicing what they preach (e.g. grants and philanthropy become slush funds, climate change is an implanted political alignment used to control politicians, the science cannot be questioned, lithium refining for electric car batteries and the power grid necessary to sustain them is just as polluting as gasoline fuel, there are no restrictions regarding replacing plastic packaging with paper, Europe is closing clean nuclear plants for dirty fossil fuels in the name of climate change, fossil fuel companies fund most climate change ads and activists and try to force the end consumer to suffer on their behalf).

Now remember, I said I am *skeptical* of climate science. I don't claim that I *know* whether or not anthropogenic climate change is real (or as relevant and imminent as people think). So far I am doubtful that the current data on anthropogenic climate change indicates significant harm to our species for thousands of years, but I am open to more information that makes the destruction more imminent.

Those ideas I mentioned that made me skeptical -- false or not -- are actually immaterial to the *fact* that climate science isn't settled. I can prove the science isn't settled because the following questions have not been answered (obviously AFAIK, and I mean answered with sufficient data -- not theories):

\- **To which extent do exothermic reactions of the Earth's core change the climate?** (My current understanding is that they change climate greatly and most climate studies completely ignore the phenomenon. All studies I have personally analyzed, meaning not simply reading an article that analyzes them for me, have not taken exothermic reactions into consideration. They just assume anthropogenic origins to the pattern every time. The lack of sufficient data on the impact of exothermic reactions indicates the science is not settled.)

\- **Since carbon dioxide is absorbed by plant life wouldn't we see a dramatic plant life increase/decrease/change regarding an oversaturation of carbon dioxide?** (The lack of a sufficient data pertaining to the effect of excess C02 on plant life indicates the science is not settled.)

\- \*\*If the polar ice caps are melting and this is leading to a dangerous rise in sea levels why is it that the goalposts shift every time the last prediction for a sea level rise doesn't happen? (\*\*It's always by 19XX-20XX that the sea level will rise, and it never happens. If you have lived long enough you know what I mean. The constant shifting of goalposts indicates the science is not settled. In the 90s they had to change from the term global warming to climate change because only then did they realize the terminology was dumb. **How can they judge anthropogenic climate change results 100 years from now if they get predictions that are a decade away totally wrong?** For the record I do believe the ice caps are melting but the extent of the fallout is not settled IMO. For all we know exothermic reactions could cause rapid evaporation of melting ice...just throwing that out there because scientists totally ignore it.)

\- **If anthropogenic climate change is definitive science then why is any questioning of it treated like apostasy or lunacy?** That's the trademark of science that isn't settled: every question that challenges legitimacy should have an answer -- or at least a viable set of data that heavily indicates an answer (For example no one can provide -- with intellectual honesty -- an unanswered question regarding the fact that living humans breathe oxygen. No one can come up with an example of a human that does not breathe oxygen yet still lives, or an example of a human that breathes something other than oxygen. It's settled -- homo sapiens need oxygen to live.)

\- **Why can't meteorologists predict weather with 100% accuracy yet they can say with 100% certainty that the weather patterns indicate that the climate is changing from human activity?** (The way people answer this question is a huge tell to unsettled science. I have seen experts and layman conflate weather and climate when it suits them and then later on say that weather is not the same as climate when the conflation they were so happy to perpetrate minutes ago proves anthropogenic climate change isn't an accurate theory. Stinks of people not knowing what the hell is going on.)

\- **Why does it make sense to build space stations on Mars or the Moon to ensure the survival of the species when bio-domes on Earth would be many times easier to build and sustain? Why not build these bio-domes right now rather than spending billions on campaigns and philanthropy designed to convince the average person climate change is real? Why not make a profitable industry out of building and selling bio-dome real estate (if the answer to the previous questions is that corporations are greedy)?**

There are many other reasons to be skeptical and many other unanswered questions.

If you just send me a link to an article then I won't read it. Try to avoid getting fixated on this: I have spent a lot of time on this in the past week and every study on climate science I have analyzed is extremely weak and usually assumes a correlation is a causation and/or clearly has the intent of proving anthropogenic climate change rather than legitimately testing a hypothesis and/or disregards conflicting data and/or is funded by an extremely corrupt organization.

If the science is so settled and you personally are so sure anthropogenic climate change is real then you should be able to answer these questions easily. I want to hear from you, not some article you barely read which seems to prove me wrong -- then I investigate it and it links to a ridiculous study that analyzes the sea levels on one tiny island over the course of a month. (There really are some ridiculous climate change studies out there if you dig deep enough, I am just using an especially silly example.)

As far as I know everything can be put in layman's terms outside of the furthest flung quantum physics, and climate science does not require quantum physics. If you can't personally answer these questions then you have to admit you do not know for sure that anthropogenic climate change is an imminent danger, you are just a sheep that believes the ""most scientists agree"" line that was also used to say cigarettes/drugs/treatments and so on are safe when they aren't."
1,2023-07-27,CMV: I'm getting dissapointed by Islam,u/VitaFiresoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15b8wy7/cmv_im_getting_dissapointed_by_islam/,changemyview,"I don't have nothing against muslims, but I'm lately noticed problems islamic states are having. Many of them are living in poverty and not democratic, violating human rights. Of course, some countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkey Islam is divided from government and laws here are not based on shariah. But, as you can see, they are still not democratic since presidents here could regain their status for unlimited time. Sure, Saudi Arabia and UAE are rich countries, but they are violating human rights.

I decide to check information about islam and, sadly, I noticed how Islam, unlike many other religions, is based on fundamentalism. According to Muhammad's teachings, Islam is the only true religion and it' laws shouldn't be changed. Of course, in medieval, islamic states where more well developed than european. But as time moves on, europeans noticed that relying only on religion is a wrong way, and they decide to go on secular way, abandoning fundamentalism. 

I guess that Islam, being an authoritarian religion, created a specific mindset among arabian and turtic nations. A mindset of following to authoritarian rule, which maybe explains why Saddas Hussein was popular in Iraq.

I'm against forced conversion into other religion, and I consider an act of burning the Quran as disrespectful and stupid. After all, every human being has a free will, and a right to choose a religion he likes. If we want to converse people to, for example, into christianity, we shouldn't force it, but instead, we need to make it attractive and give to person an option."

Incels identify with incel because they have not see any proof that any woman is romantically or sexually interested in them. I‚Äôm not here to debate whether or not incels are right or wrong in any of their beliefs. I‚Äôm just stating that as why they belive they are in the situation they are in.

Most never get any form of romantic or sexual attention from women their lives so far so there is not any form of real life proof that they are not doomed to be alone. When it comes to femcels I would say they don‚Äôt have that proof. They are simply virgins. 

We all remember the story of r/foreveralonewomen needing to go private for a period of time because their posters were getting too much sexual attention from men. I would argue this proves that they cannot be incels. This is because if they have sexual attention from their preferred sex, it means that they have the option to not be celibate.

I would also argue to simply test if a woman can truly call herself a femcel is to simply start an online dating account. If they are able to at the very least arrange a meet up (not necessarily go through with it) which most women can easily do simply by offering sex, they are not truly incels. They are instead voluntarily celibate."

1,2023-07-27,CMV: You can prove that the Abrahamic god doesn't exist,u/Canofair8300,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15be620/cmv_you_can_prove_that_the_abrahamic_god_doesnt/,changemyview,"To get to the topic at hand, first it‚Äôs important to address that it‚Äôs widely believed one can‚Äôt prove a negative, but this isn‚Äôt necessarily true.  
  
For instance, take Russell‚Äôs teapot; if Russell was to assert that between Mars & Earth there is a microscopic teapot orbiting the sun, then, in this case it might well be (or as good as) impossible to prove the negative.  
  
But if Russell was to also assert that the teapot is both entirely made of china and entirely made of steel, then we can prove the negative because this concept violates the law of non-contradiction, which states that contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time.  
  
Nothing can be made entirely of china and simultaneously entirely of steel ‚Äî this simply isn‚Äôt possible. And hence, by using the law of non-contradiction, we can absolutely prove the unreality of such a concept.  
  
Anyhow, with a clear understanding of this law, we can now apply it to disprove the existence Abrahamic god.  
  
While definitions of a non-deistic god vary, the most popular definition, at least today, is 'A transcendent and eternal being who created absolutely everything, who's \*\*omnipotent\*\* (meaning that it has unlimited power), \*\*omniscient\*\* (meaning that it has unlimited knowledge), \*\*omnipresent\*\* (meaning that it's everywhere at all times) and \*\*omnibenevolent\*\* (meaning that it's all-loving and infinitely good).  
  
This can be rather trivially proven false - and we can do so by demonstrating that one or more of it's attributes are internally contradictory; that one or more of its attributes contradict a law of thought; or that two or more of its attributes contradict one another. And so, let's note just a few of these contradictions, starting with \*\*omnipotence\*\*.  
  
We can prove that the very concept of omnipotence is self-contradictory by asking the simple question: 'Can an omnipotent being create a stone so heavy it cannot lift it?'  
  
If the answer is yes, then the being's power is limited because it cannot lift the stone; if the answer is no, then the being's power is limited because it cannot create the stone; and hence, an omnipotent being cannot exist.  
  
Moving on, let's review another contradictory attributes that are incompatible with reality. If a being existed with both omnipotence and omnibenevolence then it would necessarily create the best possible universe, as a consequence of it's unlimited power (omnipotence) and it's infinitely good (omnibenevolence), but one can trivially think of a universe that's better than this one -- for example, one in which innocent babies aren't born with cancer.  
  
Or to put it another way: is god willing to prevent evil, but unable? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but unwilling? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? And in this case, if such a being exists then it logically follows that evil cannot exist, but evil does exist, and therefore this being does not exist.  
  
Is he neither able or willing? Then why call him god.  
  
So, to recap, in many cases you can prove the negative (even if you aren't burdened to do so), and, depending on the attributes assigned to the Abrahamic god, you can prove that god doesn't exist.  
  
\*\*Countering Counter Arguments:\*\*\\- ""

We don't know with absolute certainty that nothing can violate the Law of Noncontradiction""

I would reply to this by saying that, with the exception of our own feeling of our existence, we know absolutely nothing with absolute certainty, so demanding to have infinite certainty when proving a negative, but not when proving a positive is unjustifiably inconsistent -- and so this objection doesn't stand."

&#x200B;

Generally, my perception is that whenever a debate starts over politics in the west bank/the holy land/Jerusalem, most debate takes place about sovereign borders or even whether Israel or Palestine has any legitimacy as countries. Now, to be fair, many people simply say ""this is bad the human suffering being caused here/loss of life"", which I agree with, but this still doesn't take into account the fact that peace comes with politics, and if fighting stops, side x or y might be wronged by the rules put in to place economically.

I think the first approach is also counterproductive or even unjust because I believe both peoples have a legitimate right to self determination in their homes. The current peoples of Arabs and Jews were mostly born there. Their homes are there. They live in communities with markets, cultures, temples, and other pillars of communities. Shouldn't they run their own persons/communities? Why should one national government/law have absolute authority? 

Okay, so by now you might be wondering why I think a simple two-state solution with absolute borders isn't practical or even wrong. Well, because life's complicated. Not only do both peoples have rights, but individuals and minorities have rights. Many of these minorities--and even some individuals-have been living their longer than the majority people of their country, so I think--especially religiously and linguistically--self determination must prevail in accordance with the rule of law. 

&#x200B;

The main manifestation of this that I can think of is Jerusalem. I think it should be under special status that accommodates all religions, languages and neighborhoods. It can't be controlled just by one or split up between two, the whole thing is important to everyone, everyone has a history there!

&#x200B;

Now, so far I've tried to be neutral, but still, by my generational logic, I've sort of tried to show that Israelis, too, have a connection to the place. I mean, it also defends the idea of judea overall, but given that Islam believes in Jewish prophets and the OT just with more from new prophets, and that the current Israel isn't connected to the old one besides through Judaism, that doesn't really matter in terms of sovereignty or communities.

&#x200B;

But now I want to turn to the Palestinian side. Often, what Israel-supporters say centers around ""whatever you think about countries or communities, Israeli individuals and Jews have the right to live in Judea without fear(terror). They also often accuse any Palestinian militant of being a terrorist. I saw a video of a Palestinian with a gun being interviewed about his resistant ideology on Youtube. Many were quick too assume he was a terrorist. Come on, guys, we're better than this. Are IDF soldiers terrorists? Why is fighting for your cause of justice for your people automatically terrorism? I could fight even for my own self interest, but if I do it in accordance with principles of order and justice, I'm not a terrorist. Just because you don't like the end doesn't mean the means are bad. And vice versa. But as I just explained, both sides have legitimate ends! 

Maybe if they actually registered what he said, they would treat him more justly. He was talking about having to live in camps, executions every day. Especially in the US, where having a gun is a reasonable thing as long as it's used justly, picking up a gun shouldn't be considered terrorism, especially when you're doing it in response to such brutality. Is only one side bringing terror!?

&#x200B;

Look, I don't support this guy turning his frustration into wishing for no Israeli jurisdiction, but the way you stop fighting isn't by saying ""STOP YOUR MEANS, NO MATTER THE END"". This goes tenfold for when you're saying it to both sides. I dunno, maybe stopping combat shouldn't be done combatively?  In order to COMPLETELY stop conflict, you need political solutions. 

And them's ~~the facts~~ my beliefs you should try to change, that sovereignty is a bad idea for such a complex society, that both parties to the conflict are legitimate and should be respected, and that PEOPLE have the right to self determination, which trumps ""sovereign"" homogeny. "

I think managing to develop confidence in yourself at such a young age is a big accomplishment that needs a lot of work, and by contrast school is easy.

I genuinely do not understand why people reach this conclusion as a valid response to criticism. I understand why it can seem productive to promote letting everyone form their own opinions about things and let people agree to disagree, but the whole point of legitimate criticism of *anything* is to point out that there may be good reasons you *shouldn't* like X or Y. It's to promote critical thinking about things you believe, behaviors you have, or media you consume. 

If an individual accepts that criticism and disagrees with it, or accepts the criticism, agrees with it, but feels that the issues aren't worth disliking the movie/eating at a different restaurant/etc. then so be it - but outright saying it's better to let people uncritically enjoy anything (especially something low stakes like media) is toxic."

If you're intentionally trying to offend somebody, it's not funny and you're likely just being abusive, or, at best, are insensitive.   
Along with not intentionally offending someone, I think it's important to know your audience so as to not affirm some ignorant belief they have. Like racially charged jokes. If you make a racially charged joke to your friend who isn't racist (and you know this) that's one thing. If you make that same joke towards someone you don't know well, this person could actually be racist and take this as affirmation of their bigotry.   
With that said, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with dark humor. Dark humor is, essentially, laughing at something because it's messed up in an ironic sort of way, or laughing at a stereotype because it's ridiculous. Accent humor is a perfect example of this where an accent is over exaggerated for the sake of joking at the stereotype. Like, I live in the south. I have a mild southern accent. I'll often greatly over exaggerate my own accent for a joke, usually when saying something stupid making fun of the stereotype of ""southern people are stupid."" Jokes like this can be funny with the right crowd, though I wouldn't do so with my friends who do have thicker accents than myself as it could be seen as making fun of them.   


Another example would be a drunk driving joke. Making a joke about this can be funny, but I wouldn't say the same joke to, say, a woman who's son was killed by a drunk driver.   


Again, audience is key. Not because you're trying to disguise some horrible belief you have, but because you exercise common sense and understand different people have different sensibilities and ignoring this either makes you an asshole or insensitive, and that's giving the benefit of the doubt that you aren't a bad person who actually *agrees* with these things, which is why you think it is funny.   


Again, there's a difference between thinking something is funny because it's messed up, ironic, etc, and thinking it's funny because you agree with whatever it is. So, to give another example on how to articulate this better, let's use race humor again. Blackface was used by white actors in early Hollywood as a means of making fun of black people for being ""inferior."" At the time, this was ""funny"" because the population was mostly racist and agreed with these things. There was no irony, it was ""funny"" because racism was popularly acceptable. This is racist and not ""dark humor.""   


But contrast this to something like Family Guy which makes loads of dark jokes, many of which are racially charged. However, we all understand that the jokes here in Family Guy aren't like blackface of the past, they're ironic and making fun of the stereotypes which is funny because stereotypes are ridiculous, which, in this regard, is almost *anti-racist*. The stereotype isn't funny because it's true, it's funny because it's stupid and it's making fun of the stereotype, which, in turn, is making fun of the people that actually *do* believe in these stereotypes.   


I will elaborate more in the comments if needed, but it's for these reasons I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with dark/edgy humor. Change my View!"

The countries were economically tied together thanks in part to the economic system the USSR used. This lead to good B f.ex being produced in Latvia, bur shipped to Estonia, Poland and Lithuania. When the USSR collapsed it all had to change, and there were extreme shortages.

It has led to multiple conflicts within these ex-USSR countries (Ukraine war, Nagarno-Karabakh), multiple countries have become authoritarian and oligarchies, freedom of speech is only getting worse in Russia, and 30 years later we are still seeing the effects, like the exodus of people leaving these countries for a better life, such as Lithuania, where before the collapse it had a population of around 3.5 million. By the next decade it will be less than 2 million.

So I guess my question is: how is this better than if the USSR never collapsed, even though it was totalitarian, had a stagnant economy for years, and before the last few years little freedom of speech?"

Usually, they'll say something like ""I've been stressing lately because my dog just died"" or ""I've been stressing because my girlfriend broke up with me."" Well let me tell you something, those are very trivial things. And stressing about it won't suddenly reverse what just happened. Like alright fine I get it, many people think that their dog is also part of your family. But stressing about it will do absolutely nothing. Nothing at all. If your girlfriend broke up with you, how does that DEFINE YOU AS A MAN? Literally how? There are so many other woman out there that you can get. Stop letting these trivial occurences define who you are as a man. I get it, for women, whatever get stressed because all women do is complain and stress about anything but for men, what are we doing? When you stress about things, not only are you spreading negativity internally, but you're also not changing anything about your circumstances. Now let's say something happened to you that actually affected you and you're stressing about it; such as losing your job. Well it's likely your fault you got fired, you most likely did something that caused you to get fired. Even if you didn't find a different job or live off of unemployment perks. Stop victimizing yourself, please. Enjoy your life stress-free. Consider getting therapy. What happens to you does not define you. External events do not define you. What happened to you now will be extremely insignificant 200 years later. Live life, already."
1,2023-07-27,CMV: Men feel dejected and drawn to more toxic men support because there is a deficit of positive groups for men,u/MattGaetzHater,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15bk5pm/cmv_men_feel_dejected_and_drawn_to_more_toxic_men/,changemyview,"I wanna say this up top, I support feminists and feminism. This isn‚Äôt a critique of feminism. 

I feel that in the western world a lot of men are hurting. Especially young men. Young men have grown up in the midst of a new wave of feminism and came to age in a time where women did get a shift in social power that was even magnified through the lense of social media. As a result many of us saw what looked like a lot of hurt felt by women being healed (or treated). They of course saw this as not a step to social equality, but as women getting a step ahead.

This is because there is not a single group for men that has any meaningful power, desire, or ability to fix the hurt we are feeling. Instead men‚Äôs groups are often reactionary. There‚Äôs a reason why posts on incel, MGTOW, and MRA subreddits were always about women. Those are groups that do not serve to make men‚Äôs lives better, but only to paint the picture that the advancement of women‚Äôs role in society is harming men. 

Another example is the ‚Äúalpha bro‚Äù movement with stars such as Jordan Peterson, Andrew Tate, Myron Gaines, and others. This movement is probably the most popular modern men‚Äôs support group and as most people recognize it‚Äôs incredibly toxic. Instead of being purely reactionary, it is more manipulative. They are essentially snake oil salesmen who sell the view on the secret method to ‚Äúget rich, get bitches, and find a submissive tradwide‚Äù.

So these groups fill in the gap, if we hurt, see women feel momentarily less hurt and need some way to feel better, we‚Äôre going to be pushed into thinking that feminists are what is causing us to hurt.

Is it right? No, I don‚Äôt think so. But it‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. In order to rectify this, there needs to be a positive masculinity group. One that doesn‚Äôt preach a focus on superficial things, on emotional stoicism, or on returning to a pre feminist world."

Justice Antonin Scalia stated so in his majority opinion for District of Columbia v Heller (2008). Here‚Äôs just a portion of what he said:  


>Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues.  


He goes on to mention the ‚Äúhistorical tradition‚Äù in the U.S. of restricting dangerous weapons. That is a very broad statement. Would that also cover travel restrictions, sales restrictions, large magazines (over 10+), trigger locks, or stabilizing braces? How about licensing and training requirements?  SCOTUS has taken such a broad view of the 2nd Amendment this century, that it would be hard to believe the Court would rule against restriction. 

  
SCOTUS appears to have given Americans an unlimited right to buy every type of weapon imaginable except a howitzer. Precedent no longer matters. In a country full of people with simmering emotions, that could be dangerous. 

Here are three excellent articles that sum up the issues:

* Gun control is constitutional ‚Äî just ask the Supreme Court | The Hill
* Gun Control Is Constitutional. A Frightened and Divided Nation | by C.J. Mullen | Jul, 2023 | Medium
* The Effects of Firearm Safety Training Requirements | RAND

I am all for the liberation of sex workers and all that. I believe people should be free to do what they want with themselves. But it remains an instant turn off to me and I struggle to not feel a certain ""ick"" about it. 

I feel differently about people posting sexual content to platforms designed for such. But when it's on something like Facebook, it makes me wonder why anyone would feel like it's a good idea to just throw it all out there for their friends/coworkers/family to see. Like what are we searching for? Is this a symptom of some deeper pain within ourselves? Or am I overthinking it entirely and it's actually not that deep?"
1,2023-07-27,CMV: Music is the best type of art,u/RaindropDripDropTop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15bmlgd/cmv_music_is_the_best_type_of_art/,changemyview,"Music is by far the most versatile type of art. It goes well with so many situations. If you're throwing a party and trying to turn up, music is essential, you gotta throw on some trap bangers or something. If you're driving your car to go somewhere, turn on something with some fat 808s or anything with nice low end and make them windows vibrate. If you're bored at work, throw on some headphones and listen to some classic albums or a custom eclectic playlist you made. If you're exercising, listen to some music that hypes you up. If you're feeling down, listen to some sad songs that relate to your mood. If you're feeling heady, throw on something lyrical and try to dissect the meaning. If you're reading a book, throw on something instrumental. If you're off the molly, the xan, the lean, percocets, acid, alcohol, whatever, throw on something vibey with a crazy soundscape. I could go on and on. Pretty much any situation can be enhanced by having music on in the background. 

Music also goes well with every other type of art. Movies and video games are a prime example, they are greatly enhanced by having a great soundtrack. Think of all the times some big epic spectacle is happening in a movie and the symphony starts heating up and increasing the scale. You're playing a video game and even before the enemies slide on you that boss music starts playing and you realize it's about to go down.

And when any other person asks a question or presents a valid argument, they can just say, ""did you go to med school?""  As if that is a justified response to valid statements. Med school + residency is the way it is, so big corps/pharma can limit public knowledge, doing that by making doctors face extremely strenuous training for many years so that the corporations don't actually have to do anything, the entitlement of doctors after becoming a doctor does all the work for them.

School is just about memorizing and repeating what you've been told. It figures that the best gate keepers would be doctors, they have an 8+ year proven track record of being exceptional at memorizing and repeating what they're told. Look at any profession that school is required for, you have to have a degree (prove that you can do what you're told, stay in the lines, repeat what you hear to succeed) 

Kinda funny... 

With that said, I guess schooling for any job seems a bit unnecessary. I guarantee I could do any of your jobs (this is not true, I couldn't be a professional athlete at this age, but beyond being an absolute beast at something like athletics, I believe it's true) if you let me shadow you/spent time teaching me. And I guarantee, in the case of doctors, I could learn it much quicker than the 8 years + 4 of residency, quicker than a law degree, etc. Sorry if that's insulting to your sacrifices, schooling, the years you put in, etc.

 I may not possess all the knowledge you do, but purely by ability to preform a job, I think so. And fuck it, honestly, the amount that medical knowledge changes, your knowledge doesn't even give you a leg up at the end of the day, because the more you know, the more stuck you are behind the waves and waves new information that comes in. When something you've been reciting as fact for years gets discredited/proven wrong, you don't realize how far out those beliefs have extended in to other beliefs and knowledge you have, potentially tainting things along the way."
55,2023-07-28,"CMV: Tarantino saying the N word in Pulp Fiction is no different to, nor any worse than any actor portraying any other unethical or immortal action within a movie.",u/dirkthrash,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15bogov/cmv_tarantino_saying_the_n_word_in_pulp_fiction/,changemyview,"I understand that the word is confronting, offensive and hurtful for many people to hear. So are other mean, hateful acts. These actions when performed in movies are not a representation of the actor's beliefs, desires or their character. Of course it's true that an actor can portray a character who's moral failings can align with their own, but the portrayal of these character faults is not an indicator of the actor's character (nor the writer).

I saw an argument online today where a person  insisted that the portrayal of violence or robbery is not as bad as saying the N word in a movie. Their reasoning is that the violence or robbery is pretend, but Tarantino actually says the N word. This would likely then lead into the question of whether intent, or context matters when it comes to speech and offensive words (which is a different topic to this one.)
 
I understand this distinction. But does the same judgement of an actor apply if he is portraying an abusive husband who screams at his fictional wife. Insults her, belittles her, calls names etc? Clear examples of the portrayal of real life abuse. Immoral, wicked actions. The actual immoral act is being carried out by the actor in this hypothetical scene, the only difference between it and real life would seem to me to be the following aspects and other similar aspects that are fairly obvious in my eyes:
- The intention of the actor.
- The understanding that he is portraying a bad person who does bad things, and the actions he is portraying are not an indicator of his own beliefs or desires. 
- The wife doesn't actually feel abused. And she in fact is not being abused, because it's an act that they're both consenting to. 

I think that the reasons why a fictional portrayal of abuse (such as the hypothetical outlined above) is acceptable are the same reasons why the fictional portrayal of abuse such as the Tarantino scene should be deemed acceptable. 

I'm more than willing to have my mind changed here if I'm looking at this from a flawed angle."

1,2023-07-28,CMV: Saudi Arabia‚Äôs national sportswashing strategy must fail.,u/BrokkenArrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15bwkl6/cmv_saudi_arabias_national_sportswashing_strategy/,changemyview,"Title says most of it. A tyrannical, theocratic, absolute monarchy is using its vast oil wealth to brute force its way into prestige world sports, with no intention of changing its ways, and it‚Äôs nauseating. 

They‚Äôve already taken over golf, they‚Äôre trying to get tennis, and they‚Äôre doing their best to peel off elite (albeit past their prime) football players to bolster their league. 

‚ÄúBut why do you have to make it political?‚Äù I hear you say. Because it is political. The money Cristiano Ronaldo is being paid, for example, is not a sum of money that Al Nassr just has on hand. Bringing one of the best footballers in history to Saudi Arabia is a *public sector* investment. It was a political decision with a political aim (sheen of prestige for domestic league), so it can be criticized in political terms. 

But any country should do what it can to grow its domestic sports industry, right? Yes (and it‚Äôs a very good thing when smaller leagues grow!), but they usually run into stumble blocks because athletes don‚Äôt just play somewhere, they have to LIVE there, with their families. Part of attracting talent, therefore, means making the place more attractive to live. In highly repressive societies, this would mean having to loosen the stranglehold you have over segments of your population. But Saudi has enough money to make players overlook that, since they will be living in a customised bubble. It would be hard, otherwise, to convince someone to move to a place where their wives and daughters would become second-class citizens as soon as they step off the plane. Not to mention if they happen to have gay family members. 

You could argue that for golf or tennis, the massive injection of cash will benefit their ability to expand further worldwide. For something like football, however, is pretty unambiguously bad. The contrast between Ronaldo in Saudi and Messi in the MLS is pretty drastic. The MLS is a league that is actually growing at a rapid pace, and football will soon be rivaling the NFL, MLB and NBA for eyeballs over the next decade or so. Noone in the foreseeable future will ever care about who wins the shitty Saudi league, nor should they. Messi‚Äôs matches will be attracting bigger audiences, while Cristiano will drown out. It‚Äôs a shame that such a player has gone into what is effectively self-imposed exile from the game. 

There is hope, though. Kylian Mbappe rightly rejected what would be the most lucrative offer in the history of sports. He chose the game, and glory, over money. 

If there was much by way of indication that Saudi Arabia was becoming more moderate in tandem, then it wouldn‚Äôt really be an issue, but they want their cake and to eat it too, and it‚Äôs in the best interest of sports, and frankly the world, that they abjectly fail in that endeavor. 

(I should note that this is not a criticism of the players themselves. Far be it from me to shit on someone for accepting eye-watering sums of money that will set their families up for generations, this is purely a criticism of the sportswashing.
Also, while this post is specific to Saudi, it also applies to other authoritarian monarchies, notably Qatar, which bribed its way into hosting a world cup and is trying to buy up half the teams in Europe.) 

There should be an understanding that sports develop as society does, and you don‚Äôt get to buy shortcuts without improving life in your country, even if it means giving up your own power. I‚Äôm not proposing a strategy here to make them fail, just that we should all hope they do, and discourage sports leagues, organizations, and players from participating. I‚Äôve yet to see a reason to be in favor, or even neutral, about this."

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/world/europe/a-london-subway-experiment-please-dont-walk-up-the-escalator.html

Walking on the left also damages the escalator faster due to imbalance leading to more frequent maintenance when NO ONE can use the escalator.

https://macleans.ca/society/why-the-escalator-etiquette-of-stand-right-walk-left-is-wrong/

Taken together I believe I should stand on the left, especially in facility with ""no walking"" signs to which I can point when challenged.

However many people think that this is an ""assholed move"" and I should just let people walk on the left. 

Am I missing something?

Edit: I have given out delta to specify that my view applies to rush hour when there is a line to get on the escalator"

1,2023-07-28,"CMV: The modern use of ""agnostic/gnostic"" as a modifier to theism/atheism is a bad change to the language, and it's widespread adoption in atheist communities is an example of indocterination, and is intellectually lazy",u/joalr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15bydeu/cmv_the_modern_use_of_agnosticgnostic_as_a/,changemyview,"For anyone who doesn't know, there has been a trend in recent years (last couple decades) to separate people's answers to the question of God into two distinct categories, Belief and Knowledge, and that these categories are represented on two separate continums of theist/atheist and gnostic/agnostic.  A theist is a person who believes in God, while an atheist is someone who does not believe in God.  An agnostic is someone who has no knowledge to the existence of God, while a gnostic is someone who does.

So I'm not going to go too deep into the history of the words, because I believe it to be largely irrelevant.  Words change in time, and those changes can be good or bad.  My issue with the new schema is not that it's new, but that it's worse than the previous one.

The *only* reason I will bring up the historical use is because the way the words are often explained in atheist communities (like /r/athiesm) is that these are the technical uses of the word, which is simply untrue.  It is a fairly recent development, and isn't really used in academia.  This isn't really an argument against it, just a response to people who seem to believe this is the proper use of the terms.

So onto my critique of the terms.

I'll start with my strongest critique, it adds ambiguity where none existed before.  Specifically, it lumps together ""lack of belief"" and ""disbelief"" into the same category.  These are not the same things at all.  I'll demonstrate this point real quick.

Imagine I said I am going to be eating dinner tonight, and it really could be anything.  I then ask you ""Do you believe I'm having tacos tonight?"".  Well, on what basis would you be formulating your belief here?  I think most people would probably respond with ""I don't know, I have no idea"".  If this was a person's response, does this person reject the notion I'm having tacos tonight?  Of course not, for all they know, I absolutely am.  But they also aren't taking on the belief I'm having tacos tonight, they simply have no actual formulated belief. 

In comparison, if I asked ""Do you believe I'm having dog tacos?"", I think most people (in most places in the world) would respond with ""No, I do not think you are"".  This is an active disbelief in the notion.  

The positions of belief in these examples are fundamentally different, but in both situations in the paradigm above, they would fall under ""atheist"".  In fact, because you don't actually have knowledge of my dinner, and there isn't anything physically stopping me from having a cat taco other than cultural norms, both would fall under ""agnostic atheist"" in regards to my dinner.  

In the preferable schema, we would map a lack of belief to agnosticism.  In the above examples, we would be agnostic to tacos, but athesit to dog tacos.

There have been other terms to express this separation, like strong and weak atheism, negative or positive atheism, etc.  However, these are more common in academic circles and not really used in everyday speech.  Agnostic is used most commonly to express this.  So attempting to use agnostic atheism to express a belief that there is no god, but a lack of knowledge, goes against both academic and layman uses and is really just a niche use in modern atheist circles.

My next critique is I don't think ""knowledge"" is a really relevant factor when it comes to belief in God.  I don't think anyone has any real knowledge of God, as far as I'm aware. Now, one issue with this argument I'm making is it is *highly* dependant on what definition of God we use, and what we mean by ""knowledge"", but I do believe that what is *actually* being expressed is ""how strong the belief really is"".  ""Gnostic atheists"" do not have any stronger knowledge than ""agnostic atheists"", they are simply more adament in their belief.  They have greater certainty.  Certainty in your belief does not equate knowledge, and I do not see how it is even possible for someone to have actual knowledge on this topic.  All arguments I've heard on this really point to ""I'm pretty certain in this belief"", which I have nothing against, some beliefs you CAN feel pretty certain about.  I'm pretty certain in my belief, for a great number of reasons, that there is not a teacup orbiting Mars, however, I do not have any actual knowledge about the location of all teacups in order to state I have knowledge about it.

To be even *more* clear, I don't actually object to people using these terms for themselves.  If someone describes themselves as an ""agnostic atheist"", I believe there is ambiguity in that, but I don't really care, there's ambiguity in all terms and if they identify with that one, that's fine.  The issue I take is when they attempt to remove ""agnostic"" from the dialogue entirely as a category a person can identify as, because they claim it isn't a separate category.  I think in order to make this claim, they need to have *some* foundational explanation as to why it's better, and as of yet I've heard none."

You don't become a physicist without achieving the appropriate academic requirement, so why should anyone who can write fancy words in their blogs or add quirky jokes to their YouTube videos be taken seriously as a critic?


Note: Obviously, criticism is different from having an opinion. Everyone can have an opinion because they are the target audience. What I am saying is that not everyone should have the right to earn money through these opinions and their research when they haven't put in the time to learn the craft.

Edit: Thanks for all your responses, I still think that I didn't communicate my side of the topic well, which is ironic because I am criticising people who are actually good at communicating their thoughts. Anyways consider my mind changed."

[https://youtu.be/C6OhhUDQJU4](https://youtu.be/C6OhhUDQJU4)

So, an early season of *America's Next Top Model* involves a contestant, Tiffany Richardson. She was on the previous season, but didn't make the final cut due to failing psych exams and getting into a bar fight.

Tyra put Tiffany through Anger Management. Tiffany talked about how her grandmom deferred paying her electric bill for her to have a swimsuit to go on the show, and yet Tiffany had a defeated attitude throughout the show despite all that.

The crux came on her final episode. During the challenge, even though everyone suffered temporary illiteracy, Tiffany took it harder than the other girls, to the point where she didn't want to read it because she couldn't.

To the shock of nobody, Tiffany (and another girl) went home that episode. The other girls, including the other loser that night, were sad. Tiffany showed zero emotion throughout the ordeal. I saw that as a mature form of stoicism as a type of coping mechanism, and if I were there, I'd commend her.

Tyra, didn't commend her, however.

Tyra decided to berate Tiffany for ""treating it like a joke"" while throwing her personal life in her face.

Tiffany had a mature point of view on it. She was hurt about the loss, who wouldn't be? But she said it best ""I'm tired of crying about things I can't change.""

She was out. She lost. No amount of crying was going to change that. Tiffany knew that, and that was mature of her.

Tiffany then defended herself for not crying by saying ""I am angry inside, I've been through stuff so I'm angry."" 

That's where Tyra starts her cunt tirade. 

>When my mother yells like this it's because she loves me.

Bullshit. When my mom yelled like that it was because she was pissed the fuck off at me.

>I was rooting for you, we were ALL rooting for you, how dare you!

You were not ""rooting for"" Tiffany. Cut the crap. If Janice Dickenson's exchange with Tiffany said anything, it was that you were fostering a toxic environment for all those girls.

If you really ""loved"" that woman and were ""rooting for"" her, you wouldn't scream at her after she got eliminated. That's not iconic, that's not love, that's bullying. That's kicking someone while they're down.

If you really cared about this woman, you would have given her this speech BEFORE she was eliminated, that way it would motivate her and light a fire under her ass. After she's out of the competition, your relationship with her ended. You owe her nothing, and vice versa.

Instead, you screamed at her on-camera after she was eliminated. The only reason you would have to do that is to humiliate her.

Not to mention the off-camera comments about ""going home and sleeping on a blow-up mattress."" That's full-fledged humiliation intent.

Fuck you, Tyra Banks. You're not iconic, you're not motherly. You're just a cunt.

Area #1:

Chris Rock was doing his job. His job was to make jokes as host of the Oscars. Everyone in attendance was fair game as the butt of a joke. That was understood. So, it was only fair that Chris Rock made a jab at Jada. He made a harsher jab at Javier Bardem two sentences prior, but you don't see him going up and smacking anyone.

Area #2: 

Will was literally laughing about it abut 5 seconds before he chose to march up and smack Chris Rock. Why the sudden change?

Area #3:

I don't care about his personal life. I know prior to that, he found out in a live interview Jada cheated on him. That's your personal life. Keep your personal life out of the fucking public

Area #4: 

Did Will Smith seriously forget he's not in West Philly? I also am from Philadelphia, born and raised. I know disrespecting someone's woman would warrant a smack. BUT, Will Smith has been famous long enough now. This isn't West Philly, this is Hollywood. Grow up.

Area #5:

Chris Rock said it best in his special. Will Smith only smacked Chris Rock, even though EVERYONE be dogging him, because Rock is 5'10 and Smith is 6'2"". That's some bullying shit.

Area #6:

He was definitely flexing income privilege; had he still been the broke kid from Philly, you bet he'd be locked up on the spot. "

This is unhealthy for the competitors, and also undermines the spirit of weight classes. It's pretty lame when there are two 170lb fighters but one is clearly much larger and can bully the opponent with size

If competitors were made to weigh in two days in a row, it would force them to compete at their true weight. It would be a herculean task to cut weight twice, or to maintain a dehydrated  state for a full day to make weight twice. This would mean people have to fight at their true weight

When we watch 155lb fighters, they would be actual 155 pounders. Not 180 pound men who somehow managed to make step on a scale and weigh 155. We could see people at their true weight. It would also allow fighters to compete more often due to the elimination of the physically exhausting and unhealthy weight cut"

I think managing to develop confidence in yourself at such a young age is a big accomplishment that needs a lot of work, and by contrast school is easy. Probably losing your virginity is equivalent to getting a masters degree in terms of accomplishment, although most people prioritize virginity loss more, and virginity loss requires less economic privilege.  
  
I think that internal barriers are the main thing blocking people of all genders from having sex. I think the reason why more people have sex than masters degrees is a combination of ability to pay for masters degrees and an active choice on behalf of the bulk of the population to prioritize sex over education. I'm not sure how the difficulty changes over one's lifetime, but I think doing it at a young age is an accomplishment for getting on top of your game early."

think that typically, Women are seen as greater than men, because in most cases they are. They are what is sought after. I think a lady has a much easier time sleeping with/dating a dude, than it is for a dude to sleep/date a lady.

Most of the time, cheating isn't about not liking the partner that they have.

We hear rumours about known faces cheating their also known partners that is probably better looking, more powerful and even more known and everyone gets shocked about it. 

This issue revolves around their own insecurities. People usually cheat on partners they perceive as more attractive or powerful. They seek to reaffirm their sense of power and importance by being with someone they view as ""lower"" than their current partner to not feel lower themselves.

However, this pursuit is misguided, as another person cannot truly make you feel better about yourself. This race replaces itself with a desperate chase, but ultimately, it won't lead to genuine self-improvement or fulfillment. I think it's essential to understand that the psychology behind it may make sense, even when it's wrong.

At this point it's more expected rather than being shocking and I don't understand the ""crazy"" part at all. It is wrong but it also makes complete sense to me and I see nothing weird about it."

I think the reason why people say this is because the most physically attractive men are confident. They‚Äôre not attractive as a direct result of their confidence but they are confident as a direct result of how attractive they are. People who are born attractive spend their entire life having their feelings in their own attractiveness reaffirmed. Growing up they‚Äôre told how cute they are, when they get to that age people start taking romantic interests in them, and usually when they‚Äôre adults this interest still continues. So they have no reason to doubt themselves when it comes to physical appearance.

When people have glow ups, they become more confident as a result of a change in their physical appearance. They will typically draw in more romantic/sexual interest than they used to and that‚Äôs what boosts their confidence. 

When ugly guys are confidence it‚Äôs seen as arrogance or delusion. Think about it, most women have been approached by men. And most of the time it doesn‚Äôt go well. Objectively speaking approaching a woman you don‚Äôt know and trying to strike up a conversation knowing your odds aren‚Äôt good is a very confident act. It takes a lot to put yourself out there and I don‚Äôt see how anyone could argue that isn‚Äôt confidence. But does that make a woman more likely to find him attractive? No. He will more likely than not be seen as creepy for doing so.

If an attractive guy does the same thing, his actions will be seen as confident and are more likely to be received well."

Justice Antonin Scalia stated so in his majority opinion for District of Columbia v Heller (2008). Here‚Äôs just a portion of what he said:  


>Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues.

  
He goes on to mention the ‚Äúhistorical tradition‚Äù in the U.S. of restricting dangerous weapons. That is a very broad statement. Would that also cover travel restrictions, sales restrictions, large magazines (over 10+), trigger locks, or stabilizing braces? How about licensing and training requirements?  

SCOTUS appears to have given Americans an unlimited right to buy every type of weapon imaginable except a howitzer. Precedent seems forgotten. In a country full of people with simmering emotions, that could be dangerous. However, on Friday, Justice Alito temporarily froze a lower court order that bars the government from regulating so-called ghost guns ‚Äì untraceable homemade weapons ‚Äì as firearms under federal law.  It's a start.  

It would not take sweeping reform.   Adjustments to existing regulation and enforcement of the present laws can have a major impact in keeping weapons out of the hands of those with criminal intent and the severely mentally ill.

1,2023-07-29,"CMV: the US (and by extension, the West) Should Stop Funding the Ukrainian War",u/Funtimes856,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15cu2fv/cmv_the_us_and_by_extension_the_west_should_stop/,changemyview,"Points:  


1. **War Efficacy: Ukraine is not going to win this war by their outlined criteria.** Ukraine seeks to reunify their pre-2014 lands. Ukraine does not have the capital (economic, human, etc) or strategic initiative to win back those lands. Its not only unlikely, its unrealistic.
2. (Assoc. #1) **It‚Äôs unethical to continue fighting a losing war** (set by your own criteria) to build a better negotiating platform. People die in war. Ukrainian defense officials have been quoted as saying the current efforts are to build a better negotiation standing. No life is worth throwing away for a negotiation. Moral Law: ‚Äú*The moral law cannot require us to sacrifice others, or ourselves, because to do so would be to treat persons as a means only, rather than as a free and equal..*‚Äù
3. **Local Sentiment:** ""Ukrainians"" in **those occupied areas prefer Russia to Europe by measuring votes of feet.** Over 2+ million Ukrainians fled to Russia while only 100K people fled to Europe at the start of the war. Caveat: This marker will be difficult to study today. Violence (the war), economic incentives, and difficulties of travel have changed travel patterns.
4. **Local Sentiment** (Continued): **Most of the local people in the occupied areas prefer Russia.** Much of the people there have ethnic, historical, and/or economic ties or they just outright prefer Russia. Many Ukrainians in the occupied areas have Russian passports. Russian is the dominant language. As a sample of Russian support, follow the Instagram posts of places in Russia-occupied areas (Crimea, Donbas, etc.).
5. **Historical context: The land now held has a huge argument for Russian control.** One of the lands, Crimea, was historically Russian and was only given to Ukrainian administrative control while these places were both USSR states. After the fall of the USSR, Crimea pushed for independence and closer ties with Russia.
6. **Reasons for Funding:** The US is pumping Defense dollars into a proxy war to weaken an adversary rather than for moral reasons. Most Americans don‚Äôt care or know about Russia other than ‚Äúthey‚Äôre our enemies,‚Äù ‚Äúlots of nukes,‚Äù and/or ‚Äúsocialist.‚Äù A very small minority of Americans even tracked the 2014 conflict between Ukraine and Russia. I don‚Äôt support continued wars, particularly when they‚Äôre a passive competitor on the international stage.
7. **The amount already invested in Ukraine is staggering.** Almost $80 billion in foreign aide to Ukraine (!). In a standard fiscal year, the US spends $750 billion in national defense...  


If you agree to the above, then there are other roles that the West can play in negotiations. They can remove Russia from the UN Security Council. They can sanction Russian oligarchs. Etc.

  
‚Äî  
**Things that won‚Äôt CMV:**  
A. Russia is <insert political classification with negative connotation>/un-free! Disagree: most of the world is ‚Äúun-free‚Äù but the West doesn‚Äôt fund proxy wars against those nations. Recent Examples: Sudan, Ethiopia, Niger.  
B. Ukraine should decide when the war is over! Disagree: if Ukraine didn‚Äôt have Western funding then their government would cease to operate. Ukraine is currently operating and fighting exclusively on Western funds."

The word ""consent"" would not come from any of their mouths. It's a uniquely modern obsession flowing forth from a self-obsessed culture, where people think they have absolute bodily autonomy and that the only wrong is for it to be violated.

_____________

My view is that one of two views are reasonable to hold:

A. Sex actually *is* a uniquely sacred activity, for a specific purpose, a dual purpose, the unity of spouses and the procreation of children, and we have a sacred duty to only use it for its intended purpose - IE, within a marriage (heterosexual, absolutely permanent without any room for divorce, for life), open to life (no contraception and proper orifice only), and ""sexual morality"" refers to this obligation

B. Sex is just something we do for fun if we want to, and then basically everything is ok and we should stop talking about it much differently than giving pats on the head to your friend - no one asks about ""consent"" or about the magical night on your 18th birthday when a fairy visits you and now you suddenly can understand ""the true consequences"" of getting pat on your head or whatever.

_________________

I tend towards the former view. I think people know deep down that things mutually ""consented"" to can still be wrong. I feel bad for so many women who ""consent"" to these one-night stands and afterwards they **feel** wronged, they **feel** used. Because they *were*. Because that's disgusting and degenerate and not what sex is for, and both the man and women did a really bad thing. 

But their ideology doesn't afford them the language to explain **why** they were wronged, because they believe that the only ""wrong"" that can be committed sexually is a violation of consent. This leads them to try to frame the issue in that way, which I think is where a lot of these fake rape charges come from. The woman knows she wasn't raped, but she was wronged, but the only sexual ""wrong"" that liberal modernity still recognizes is rape, so...she must have been raped, somehow! Maybe the guy failed her red-light-green-light game at that one moment and that's why she feels used, or she had 3 drops of alcohol too many in her body, or...

_____

Likewise, if someone asks ""why is it wrong to have sex with kids,"" the most common parroted answer is ""cause they can't consent."" Now, I think that it's wrong to have sex with kids, but this answer is total bogus and doesn't mean anything.

What if I said ""It's wrong to take kids to the park, because they can't consent."" How can a kid properly assess all the dangers of going to the park? How can they be trusted to know if it's a safe neighborhood or not? Clearly they can't - shouldn't they wait until they're 18? I could make the same argument for giving a 7 year old a piece of candy - how could they ""consent"" to the health risks?? Or about patting a kid on the head, or taking a kid to the doctor, or a million other things.

Obviously we understand that kids can have decisions made for them by the adults in their life. We punish adults not when they do something the kid ""can't consent"" to (which is literally anything, supposedly), but rather when they impose something that's **bad** upon a kid that the kid couldn't have been expected to know better to avoid. It's **bad** to get a kid to drink arsenic and abuse his ignorance. It's **not** bad to take a kid to a park or feed him ice cream ""without his fully informed consent"" because those things are neutral or good, not evil.

So as can easily be seen, ""consent"" is totally irrelevant here. All that's relevant is if the action the kid is being led into is good/neutral, or if it's bad. Which category does sex fall into?

I would argue that it's bad, because **all sex* outside of marriage is bad, so this is more in the ""getting a kid to drink arsenic"" category than the ""patting a kid on the head"" category.

But to a liberal modernist, who believes that sex doesn't have to be for procreation but can also be for pleasure? How are you getting some rigid age below which the kid can't ""properly understand"" what's going on and it's therefore wrong, but won't apply the same logic to taking the kid to the park or getting the kid medical treatment? ""Consent"" won't really help you as I proved - we do all sorts of things to kids without their ""consent,"" and it's only bad when it's **harmful**. If sex for pleasure alone isn't harmful, where does that leave you?

I think the liberal modernist tries to argue their way out of this by saying ""well sex is super more consequential then trips to the park, it can give you strong emotions and stuff."" But I don't find this convincing. I mean you've been pretty successful with your whole world project to render sex pretty inconsequential, with contraception/abortion/etc. And kids have many other highly emotional experience that we let them go through. You can't build a whole world view on ""Sex is nothing special and can be done just for fun"" and then act like there's this magical date where you suddenly understand it perfectly but before that date it's a super serious crime.

I think you'd also want to way tone down the punishments for rape under this world view. Many states have laws where the alledged victim's sexual history can't be examined at a rape trial. Why not? Violating something that the woman is actually treating as special, sacred, and reserved for only its sacred purpose with a spouse is way different than violating a woman's pleasure toy that she likes to play red light, green light with. Our punishments for rape being so severe come from a religious age when sex actually meant something. If it doesn't mean anything and is just this pleasurable thing people do, maybe it should be punished similarly to patting someone on the head who doesn't want it?

________

Ultimately I think ""consent"" or ""adulthood"" are irrelevant to sexual morality entirely. Either it's for unity+procreation of spouses, in which case that's the sole determiner of good and bad, or it's just this thing people do for fun, and then I think the few remaining restrictions our society has around it are totally incoherent.

I lean towards the former view, because I think people do know that women can be ""used"" even if they consent. That sex isn't like patting someone on the head, and kids should be kept from it - not because they ""can't consent,"" that's absurd, they can't consent to ice cream and yet we give it to them - but because it's **bad** to have premarital sex.

The latest criticism argued that low wage workers, especially in developing countries, are paid below slave wages by ***greedy*** corporations trying to increase their profits. The reddit post argued that it would be more expensive to purchase, house, feed, etc., slaves than the wages the corporations pay workers. This argument is deeply flawed!

Corporations pay you based on the value you create. Corporations would love to pay you more! High-wage workers become customers for more expensive products produced by other corporations. Capitalism is not to blame when workers have too few skills to earn a decent living. Also, highly productive workers will make more for the capitalist corporation. To be sure, there is a tension between workers pay and corporate profits. Other things being equal, higher wages for the same level of worker productivity mean lower corporate profits. However, as workers gain skills and otherwise  become more productive, they increase both their income and the corporate profits. It is not a zero sum game!

I often read critiques of Apple and Amazon for paying low wages. Is it truly a corporation's fault if workers have such low-value skills? Should these companies simply pay more to workers regardless of their skills? What would these workers who some argue are receiving below slave wages do if Apple and Amazon did not exist? 

""Live free and starve"" is a great essay by a person who had lived in a country where child labor was prevalent. While the writer acknowledged that the children had miserable lives, she pointed out that they would otherwise starve without such jobs. Viewed from that vantage point, the corporations that employ this child labor offer opportunities that literally mean the difference in a child working 12 hours a day in sometimes dangerous conditions, or being reduced to crime, prostitution, or starvation.

Because so many people on reddit have a  view different than mine, I feel like I'm missing something. Am I wrong?

I do understand that trans women fill the social role of a woman, often conforming to the social norms for women. However, I believe that we should get rid of the idea of gender, as it is comprised of stereotypes that often harm women by placing high standards upon them. It also can negatively impact men eg. toxic masculinity, not feeling safe crying. I do acknowledge that currently, gender does still exist, so surely trans women are women since they fill that role, right? I would disagree; I would say that being a trans woman is its own identity, for trans women interact with society differently from cis women. Trans women seem to be put in a unique box that is neither woman nor man. They are seen as ""other,"" and a lot of their oppression can stem from this fact. I think that the term ""trans woman"" most accurately describes their experience/identity.

tl;dr: gender is a socially constructed box people are placed into. I believe trans women are often placed into their own box due to their identity. I also think that getting rid of the concept of gender would be beneficial."

""It has a lot of great songs but it also has some skips."" In my opinion this is not a valid criticism given that we live in the streaming age. I can understand why people might have held this opinion in 1978 or whatever when you had to purchase an entire record, or in 1997 when you had to purchase an entire CD. At that point you were still paying for the entire album, so having songs on it that were ""skips"" means you were getting less value for your purchase. 

Nowadays however it doesn't matter whatsoever. Worst case scenario is that if a song is a skip you have to move your thumb and tap a screen an extra time. It literally costs you nothing. For the most part you can just go through an album and save the songs you like to a playlist or whatever, and just ignore the songs you don't like. 

An album should be judged based on the quality of its best songs, not the average quality of every song on the album. Let's say you have two albums. Album A has 15 total songs: 5 songs that are all time classic bangers, and then another 10 songs that are just filler songs that are ""skips"". Album B is a tight 10 song album where every single song is decent, it has no skips, but none of the songs reach any particular level of greatness. Album A would be much better than Album B in this scenario, even if it is not consistent. 

Obviously music is subjective and people listen to albums in different ways, but criticizing an album for having ""skips"" is just not valid in 2023."

In the sense, when optimizing for time and energy, we may deprioritize ""healthiness"" aspect of food. So, imo, with the inflated grocery prices, time overhead, wastage from left overs, etc, eating out everyday (while being extremely selective) is a much better choice provided one is alright with the cost overhead.

1,2023-07-30,"CMV: Many ""modern"" trans people are not genuinely gender dysphoric",u/ch0cko,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15dc3o1/cmv_many_modern_trans_people_are_not_genuinely/,changemyview,"It is apparent that some modern trans people are not gender dysphoric, or to make a broader statement which is something more controversial, many transgender individuals today are not legitimately gender dysphoric, and this has occurred as a result of LGBTQ+ becoming mainstream and ""popular."" This may be considered a rather unpopular opinion.
  

  
Before we dive into this, I would like to point out that I am not a transphobe and that I am supportive of most LGBTQ+.
  

  
So, to cover the terms that will be used here:
  

  
""Gender Dysphoria"" refers to the medical condition where one believes or wants to be a different gender as a result of this condition.
  

  
""Transphobia"" refers to aversion or dislike toward transgender individuals.
  

  
""Coming out"" refers to individuals who express, tell or show others their true feelings about a certain topic. Within this context, it refers to transgender or LGBTQ+ individuals who do so.
  

  
The claim that mainstream media or the popularization of LGBTQ+ has caused an increase in transgender/LGBTQ+ individuals is shown within the statistical uptick that has been shown within [this](https://news.gallup.com/poll/389792/lgbt-identification-ticks-up.aspx) article.
  


> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The percentage of U.S. adults who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or something other than heterosexual has increased to a new high of 7.1%, which is double the percentage from 2012, when Gallup first measured it.

> Gallup asks Americans whether they personally identify as straight or heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender as part of the demographic information it collects on all U.S. telephone surveys. Respondents can also volunteer any other sexual orientation or gender identity they prefer. In addition to the 7.1% of U.S. adults who consider themselves to be an LGBT identity, 86.3% say they are straight or heterosexual, and 6.6% do not offer an opinion. The results are based on aggregated 2021 data, encompassing interviews with more than 12,000 U.S. adults.


  
One may argue this upward trend is a result of the more widespread acceptance of LGBTQ+ with it becoming far more mainstream than it once was. Although this argument holds some merit, it is absurd to assert that the number of LGBTQ+ individuals in 2021 compared to 2012 doubled as a result of this acceptance. Transphobia and homophobia are still very prevalent within the world, including America.
  

  
On top of that, the article states that:
  


> Gen Z adults made up 7% of Gallup's 2017 national sample, but in 2021 accounted for 12% as more from that generation reached age 18 over the past four years. In contrast, the proportion of those born before 1946 has fallen from 11% in 2017 to 8%.
  

  
> LGBT Identification Has Been Stable in Older Generations, Rising in Younger
  

  
> Since Gallup began measuring LGBT identification in 2012, the percentage of traditionalists, baby boomers, and Generation X adults who identify as LGBT has held relatively steady. At the same time, there has been a modest uptick among millennials, from 5.8% in 2012 (when some members of the generation had not yet turned 18) to 7.8% in 2017 and 10.5% currently.
  

  
The percentage of Gen Z who are LGBT has nearly doubled since 2017, when only the leading edge of that generation -- those born between 1997 and 1999 -- had reached adulthood. At that time, 10.5% of the small slice of the generation who were adults identified as LGBT.


  
Gender dysphoria and homosexuality are [genetic and environmental](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/massive-study-finds-no-single-genetic-cause-of-same-sex-sexual-behavior/)[[although the cause of homosexuality is not exactly clear, we are aware that gender dysphoria is potentially both environmental and genetic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415463/)]. It is clear to me that this can not be the result of natural and genuine gender dysphoric individuals, especially when Gen Z- one of the most media-influenced generations- is the generation that is seeing the most increase in LGBTQ+ individuals.
  

  
Moving forwards. Although anecdotal evidence is [not reliable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK63643/), I believe that, coupled with the prior evidence presented, this is acceptable. I have witnessed, despite living in a relatively-low-populated place, more than five individuals who identify as a gender that was not assigned to them at birth. Some of the reasoning for these individuals are also very poor and clearly not legitimate/genuine gender dysphoria. One individual explained that they were transgender with the motive being that they did ""not want to do feminine/girly things any more."" I am aware that this is still potentially gender dysphoria, but once combined with the fact many of their friends are also transgender, I believe this is the result of peer pressure, to fit in or join in with a trend.
  

  
Another person said that they were misgendered at birth, and then identified as non-binary. A few months later they would change into an absurd neo pronoun (mirror pronouns).
  

  
These personal experiences, although anecdotal, prove to me that there are many people, specifically minors, being transgender (or even gay/lesbian) without legitimately or genuinely being that thing. It is the result of LGBTQ+ being far more popular and much more mainstream, as shown by prior evidence of specifically Gen Z having an unusual uptick compared to older generations.


  


>Gender Dysphoria Probabilities:
  

>  0.005-0.014% for adults born as males, whereas it is 0.002-0.003% for adults born as females. Among children, it is higher in those born as boys, where it is 2-4.5 times greater than those born as girls.
  

>  (Numbers from the DSM-5)


  

Conclusion:
  

  
Through the evidence provided and conclusions gauged by those proofs and articles, it is reasonable to say that there is a rise in transgender and homosexual people due to LGBTQ+ having much more media exposure. Not only that, but many of these Gen Z individuals do not understand what gender dysphoria actually is and therefore label themselves simply because they think being masculine while being a woman or vice versa makes them transgender. This occurs due to the verification and approval of these feelings, making people who don't genuinely have them think that they do and justify their false feelings.
  

  
Finally, suppose you are to consider the rise in LGBTQ+ exposure and acceptance. In that case, it is logical to assume there will be many individuals who aren't actually transgender as a way to fit in with their peers or simply because they are confused as to what gender dysphoria or homosexuality actually is.
  

  
Hopefully, this post makes sense and I apologize if this was offensive in any way. This post was not intended to make people feel bad about being transgender themselves and is not directed toward you specifically."

Now as a grown woman i love my body, i love that i get to be an older sister and essentially watch another beautiful woman grow with and before me, & i know there‚Äôs a whole group of people that can explain  why being a woman is so bad to them and that is their truth. Im not a religious person at all but i believe we are all made in the spitting imagine of (a) God& nobody is wrong we all have our right to be ourselves. Im just so incredibly crazily grateful i didnt have adults telling me i was a boy because i felt i wanted to be a boy? Then what does it even mean to be a boy? I just wanted to do boy things and to me that was playing sports and liking girls. Young girls should be encouraged to embrace sports, embrace strength, and also be free and happy to embrace their femininity. Being a woman is hard enough & i dont know how it is to be a man but i bet it has its own struggles. We dont need to make young children confused when they‚Äôre re already going to be going through the mental changes during natural puberty. I work with middle schoolers i hear 11 year olds call themselves non binary & parents with transgender kids that everyone but the parent knows. Schools are saying kids can pick their gender and any lonely student that needs a group to belong to will gravitate towards how ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù it all is. We as adults are failing"
1,2023-07-30,"CMV: Most people would be happy living in a one-party state, provided that one party is the political party they support",u/Crofucije,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15dj42d/cmv_most_people_would_be_happy_living_in_a/,changemyview,"I am under the impression most people don't significantly deviate from voting for the same party once their personal political views stabilize and solidify. Be it a defacto two party system or a healthy multiparty system, once people know what they believe in, and assuming their political party does not evolve to the point of becoming something different from before, the people will keep wanting to elect their favorite party into power.

From observing US politics, me as a foreigner gets this sense of people being neatly divided into two sides, and that both groups wouldn't mind a scenario where their side would keep winning elections indefinitely.

In my country, we don't have a two party environment, rather a one large plus many minor parties multiparty environment, and large party voters always vote for their party ... even bad governance and scandals not shaking their loyalty.

From this, what logically follows is that people don't really care as much about the democratic aspect of getting to vote, and rather what really matters is the agency to get and keep their group into power.

In my mind, cutting out the middleman (elections) would not be missed, if it meant that your guys would be the ones ruling unchallenged. In US terms, if you are a loyal Republican, Republicans staying in power forever would not bother you, and if you are a loyal Democrat, Democrats staying in power forever would not bother you. 

...

*Personally, I don't have a political party I'm such a big of a fan of that I'd keep voting them in, and I despise the large party I mentioned exists in my country and never vote for them. But I acknowledge that if I found such a party that I largely approved of, I'd want them to stay in power because it would seem in my eyes as giving them more time to improve my country.*

**I am writing this CMV to see if I can find out how can it possibly not be this way.** How could anyone say something like *""you know, I'd actually want the party I dislike to get to govern a term or two every once in a while""* ... it seems so counterintuitive."

Some countries are prosperious, while many others are not or just awful to live. Because of that people are emigrating to more prosperious countries for better life conditions. And that's normal. People are assimilating. Some ethnicities are ceasing from existence, others are getting born from historical and cultural factors. 

I don'deny patriotism could be usedul, but lately it's just getting outdated. Patriotism was actual in times when humanity wasn't globalised, but today, with many opportunities to emigrate and lack of opportunities to change homeland, patriotism idea is getting less popular. 

In many sci-fi works humans are described as united nation under one language and culture. Guess that the future we get soon."

I also think that MANDATORY DNA testing at birth should be done BEFORE a man is allowed to sign any birth certificates. I also think for the men where the children are already born that if he signed the birth certificate but he's not necessarily on child support and then he finds out the kid isn't his and she tries to sue him for child support that she gets rejected for child support and he can legally opt out of responsibility for that kid (they have to prove it's not his child). For the men already on child support who later find out that the child is not theirs I think that he should legally no longer have to make child support payments and the woman should be legally required to pay him back every cent that he paid into child support (obviously not under the table money because that can't be proven) and if she doesn't pay that money back to him she is charged with felony fraud and incarcerated for however many years the man has been paying child support. I understand incarcerating the woman for however many years the man has been paying child support might not actually happen because we aren't that Draconian so realistically it would probably be 5 to 10 years in prison maximum in reality for this fraud if convicted.

Looks in the vast majority of the case are the barrier to entry. I know Reddit loves to disagree on this point, but most women are not willing to have sex with or date a man whom they are not physically attracted to. This isn‚Äôt shallow, it‚Äôs just having a normal physical desire. I‚Äôm not sure why redditors love to say women will sleep with you or date you even if they think you‚Äôre ugly, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case. At all.

In order to inspire a bare minimum level of interest, a person has to be eye catching. This ability to catch someone‚Äôs eye is what makes them receptive to any other form of advance on them. Be it a conversation or anything.
 
At this point, personality becomes more important, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs able to make a change in whether she wants to give you a chance or not for the positive. What I mean from this is that, your personality isn‚Äôt going to increase your chances more than your looks already have. Women decide if they like a guy within the first minute, if a woman is letting you speak to her she obviously thinks you‚Äôre worth talking to.

All that personality can do is ensure you don‚Äôt fuck it up. If you continue the course set by your looks you‚Äôre most likely going to seal the deal.

This is why it‚Äôs harder to date as an ugly guy. I personally am a very ugly guy, however I have pretty decent social skills, a good amount of friends, most of my friends are women, everyone around me comments about how nice and sweet I am, however I‚Äôm just unfortunate looking. As a result there isn‚Äôt a spark for me so I‚Äôve never had any romantic or sexual success. My personality obviously isn‚Äôt off putting to women , but something is.

**Why?** 

* **Because simply ""knowing a language"" is not enough to get you a visa.** Finance, programming, hospitality, cooking, engineering: these are skills that are universal and transferable and that most importantly, employers are willing to sponsor visas for.

Now, knowing the language of your target country is absolutely essential, but if I could trade in my stupid liberal arts B.A. and my M.A. in education for something more transferable you bet that I would.

* **There are many, many, many more efficient ways of learning a language in 2023 than taking a semester-long college course.** College-level language courses are great. I've taken plenty of them. However, they are also highly inefficient. If you really want to learn a language quick, the best way to do it is to sign up for a language school. Likewise, you can just find a tutor.

In my case, I spent this past summer doing an 8-week advanced French course in the South of France as a way of reviewing my French (and also having a little vacation). In that time, I've seen many of the beginner and intermediate students grow exponentially. It's really impressive how quickly students can advance when  they're put in an environment where everyone is motivated and where there are high standards. You won't find that in 99% of college courses.

* **If you become a teacher, you may find yourself discriminated against in favor of native speakers.** 

This might be specific to where I live in the Southwest USA but, while I've met several non-native French speakers teaching college-level French, I've never met a non-native Spanish-speaker giving college classes. High school, of course. College, no. It just doesn't happen here. Even then, if you teach high school you will often find yourself compared against the mythical ""native speaker"" who is always right and who would never make any mistakes ever and who would probably be a better teacher than you regardless of your experience and education. It's exceptionally demoralizing.

* **There are more opportunities to study overseas if you pick a more practical course of study.** It's ironic, but the university I went to had more study abroad options for the business majors than the language majors and I don't think that's uncommon.

Likewise, if you, for example wanted to study and eventually work and live in France. You will find plenty of ""master"" or ""license professionnelle"" for business, hospitality, engineering, programming, etc. These programs are open to people with prior education in these fields even if that training was done in another country and even if it wasn't done in French. I think this is common throughout most of Europe however, if you major in languages you have to start from square one, case d√©part, the very beginning.

* **Tests matter more than your degree.**

This is my last point, but it's one that I really want to stress. The proliferation of language tests over the last 10 years means that anyone can prove their level at any time. The TOEFL, IELTS, Cambridge exams, DELF/DALF, TCF, DELE, SIELE, JLPT, KLPT, HSK, ZD and ACTFL exams, are all examples of language tests that are accepted around the world and which can be used to prove your language level. Most of them count just as much if not more than a degree in the target language and just having a degree in the target language does not guarantee that you will do well on a given exam."

Especially the way it is formed today. Much of this will be compared to hunter-gatherer tribal life that humanity lived majority of our time on this planet. Note: Tribal societies are NOT perfect. But they got many things right. 

1. Removed from safe family. For some reason we normalized leaving kids alone in a potentially hostile environment (more on this later) without close family. This includes parents, grandparents and just other close connections a child normally have in a tribe.
2. No freedom. School is more like a prison if you look at it in other terms and even worse in some cases. Kids are forced to sit still for hours on end. Not just relaxing, but actively concentrating where their future life depend on it. Where we learn tons of things versus maybe 1 thing in terms of hunting. And it comes natural in nature which kids also are separated from.
3. Need to perform all the time. With homework, test and what not, poor kids need to perform all the freaking time. This is not the case for tribal kids or when we naturally learn. This leads to enormous stress since these grades will decide your fate in terms of univerisites and jobs. 
4. No emotional needs met. You probably can not name more than 5 of the around 40 needs a human have. Because society only teaches feelings. This is for a reason. Because if people understand all the needs a human have, they would question things a lot more. Google ""human needs"" and then go through them and see how many of them are checked in school. Where majority of kids spend their days.
5. Hostile environment. This is why bullying can appear to poor kids where parents or similar could protect their kid or child. Instead they are left alone and have to fend themselves. Which does not work out and why thousands of kids get bullied and some take their lives. This would once again not happen in a tribal setting because parents are around. Yes, fights happen but not bullying. 

Counterpoints:

1. ""They get their needs at home"". That is not how mental health works. It is like saying to a kid who is hungry ""just wait til you get home"". No, they need safety when they feel unsafe. They need to cry and get a hug when they do. They need to be able to relax when they do (there is no place to lie down. Many hunters slept at lunch after a good hunt.)
2. ""You need it to perform jobs"". If this is what it takes to get a job, then we are doing something fundamentally wrong. I believe we can school people by designing it in another way. But as it is now is just meant to create workers. Not healthy and thriving kids."

2. Aid will be given out by the National Guard,  various food banks and the Red Cross we could have, thousands pitching in medicine, MREs, canned goods and security, trash disposal will be handled by the National guard, and McDonald's could be ordered into the camps sometimes 

3. We'd stop separating families as soon as you reach the USA you're put on an truck to the camp 

4. The Camps would have schools ran by laid off teachers, these schools would teach Spanish with voluntary English and be mandatory 

5. The National Guard would function as Camp police 

6. The Refugees would be allowed to travel outside of camp for work 

7. Grocecy stores of compiled foods would be opened up 

8. If an camp ever gets overcrowded an sister camp would be opened an mile away, which could lead to camp complexes which may lead to cities if unchecked

1,2023-07-30,CMV: Proper Progressive Taxes & A Social Democracy Will Be A Better System For The USA,u/Aven_Osten,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15dus2v/cmv_proper_progressive_taxes_a_social_democracy/,changemyview,"There is an economic system that can mash the benefits of both socialism & capitalism. This system is called a ""Social Democracy"". This is not to be confused with ""Democratic Socialism"".

In a Social Democracy, which we already have currently in the world, the means of production aren't inherently owned by the people itself, but rather, people have the option to vote in certain socialist policies, while also maintaining the capitalist structure.

This is not a gateway into absolute socialism or communism, but rather, it is a way of *using* a capitalist system, in order to give the general populous a better start in life and standard of living, rather than outright forcing a society into sharing absolutely all resources, and prohibiting the enrichment of people.

People are allowed to own property, own businesses, and earn a lot of money. But they, in a Social Democracy, would not be able to get astronomically rich, into the realm of ten, hundred millionares, or even billionares. Rather, this excess wealth would, via the vote of the people, be used to fund an extensive welfare net, and fund public services such as educational institutions, public utilities, public transport, medical facilities, etc.

Why do I believe this is better? It actually provides a proper social net for the population of the USA, more evenly distrubutes the wealth of the nation, and makes the entire nation as a whole richer, by allowing the general populous to more readily spend cash they otherwise would not have. There is a massive problem with distribution of wealth due to pathetically low taxation rates of the ultra wealthy. We used to have a more proper progressive tax system, in which the richest of income earners were taxed 91 - 94% of their wealth, to properly fund social welfare programs. For example, somebody who earned $3.4M (in todays money) yearly, would have 94% of their income taxed. That still left them with a very comfortable $200k yearly to live off of, a dream for the vasy majority of people even today.

Today, we have 756 billionares in the USA. This makes up $4.48T total. By taxing 95% of this wealth, we are left with $4.256T to properly fund social services. We can very easily afford UBI with this taxed income money alone, not even including taxing massive hundred billion dollar companies and coorporations. This also allows us to properly fund infrastructure to fix our crumbling infrastructure, and build out compitent public transport systems so people do not need to spend $30k on a car, further increasing the economic prosperity of the average american.

I can go much deeper into depth regarding this, but I believe my point as of now current stands. I am open to debate on this ofc."

If

While there are a few ways this could be achieved, I think that completely taking profits out of the way is the simplest way to fix the problem in the least possible steps.

As my cmv suggests, make all businesses run as not-for-profit business such as charities, making them focus on something else, such as service.

This should have a few effects, all of which should be beneficial:
1. No need to ruin wages or the workforce to maximize profits - people can be paid well and there can be more than the skeleton crew
2. No need to satisfy shareholders - while I would rather see the stock market gone, it can still coexist here if needed, the company can still grow just not take money out
3. No need for anti competitive behaviour - without a focus on profit, there is no reason to try and ruin your competition or squeeze your customers

Now i don't say it will fix all the problems, but i dont think there is any way it can be worse than our current system.

The only ""problem"" i could see is people not wanting to start a business since they no longer have a monetary reward to do so, in which case government can run the services that are needed."

desiring to care for, protect, nurture, and raise a child, REGARDLESS of the nature to which they enter your life. 

I.e via biologically, ADOPTION, or FOSTERING. 

----------

Often, I see people say that having a biological child is selfish when you can adopt. However, when those same people are asked why THEY don't adopt ---they seldom have a response aside from ""it's not for me"". 

Naturally, some people are simply not fit to be parents, biologically or otherwise. But I've yet to see a solid argument laid out for how people who have the means, financially and temperamentally, to be an effective parent yet refuse to adopt or foster are not selfish. 

If your response to parenthood is similar or adjacent to ""how could you bring another person into this overpopulated, messed up world"" yet you refuse to foster or adopt, you seem to be equally part of the problem, no?

Even more frustrating is when people inflate having a pet to an equitable status to that of raising a child. If you acknowledge that the world is both overpopulated and messed up, wouldn't a person who is truly convicted of this try to course correct by having a positive influence on neglected youth?

I wouldn‚Äôt pay to see a rapper live because it‚Äôs not going to be any different from the song I can play on Spotify. With rock or jazz or anything with real instruments, the artists can play the song slightly different. Maybe the solo is played different, or an extra little frill is added to the end of a rift, but not with rap. With rap it‚Äôs all about words. The beat is going to be the same recurring pattern for 3 minutes until the next song comes on and the artist is going to say the same words with the same cadence as you could hear in the recorded version of the song. So why go see a rap concert other then you want to listen to the same thing you‚Äôve heard before with a lot of people around you, but if that‚Äôs what you want just invest in a good set of speakers and have a house party. I mean even with edm the DJs can add their own taste by how/when they fade in a song and which song they choose to mix with another or if they choose extra little sound bytes to add here as there, but how many rappers do you listen to that you think could actually freestyle over Even a 1/5 of their set and it would be good enough that you felt like you got your moneys worth.

1,2023-07-30,CMV: Formula 1 is a massively overrated sport.,u/Dinosaur_Act_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15e0h90/cmv_formula_1_is_a_massively_overrated_sport/,changemyview,"Some necessary disclaimers to start out: I believe that Formula 1 drivers are some of the best motorsport athletes in the world, no denying that. Motorsports are absolutely sports, and the drivers are thletes who risk their lives. That being said, I'm not really understanding why Formula 1 is considered to be the ""pinnacle of motorsports"".  I tried watching it and didn't get the hype, and I think the biggest reason why I didnt enjoy it was  an  uneven playing field.

&#x200B;

Sports are meant to be equal, with the compeition at hand being used to deceide the better team/athlete. The fact that Formula 1 is massively unequal, unlike any other sport on earth, defeats the sense of it being a true competition, and thus, the stakes are lowered. A lot of a driver's success is contingent upon the car they're using. Even F1 fans admit that it's more of an 'engineering"" competition as opposed to a drivers' competition. But even if you look at it as an engineering competition, it's unfair too considering the spending and money disaprity among teams.  This is why we're only seeing Red Bull and Mercedes dominating. Do you really think Verstappen and Hamilton could dominate in a Haas, Alfa Romeo, or Williams? Additionally, this creates a race that features very little overtaking or action in the relevent places, thus making it a massive bore to watch (at least to me).  Why would anyone want to watch a race that features little overtaking and action?   


  
Additionally, I think F1 is too focused with the idea of ""glitz and glamor"", as well as f1 being a brand first and motorsport league second. Sean Bratches, a former executvie of Liberty Media, a comapny which owns Formula One Group, said regarding f1, ""We're trying to pivot Formula One from a motorsport company to a media and entertainment brand. "" Does that sound like leadership that is passionate about motorsport? With this kind of attitude, you're not going to see true racing fans are races- you're going to see obnoxious clout-chasing influencers. Is that the culture you want in motorsports? "

so, because of my status as member of a historically  oppressed group within western society, i have a lot at stake in what‚Äôs happening to our world at the moment and a - in my eyes - uniquely informed perspective.

now by accepted, i don‚Äôt mean that lgbt people don‚Äôt deserve the same rights as anyone else. i mean that the need to push them to the forefront, to force inclusion of lgbt people in popular media and in prominent positions throughout our society,  has triggered a reactionary shift in the public that is fueling the current wave of fascism taking hold of the west - europe and the united states. 

i remember growing up in the 90s, recalling how society was. racism existed, obviously, and still does; anti-semitism was still a problem, and continues to be; sexism existed in many forms, as well, the recent ruling by the supreme court on abortion showing it still persists at the highest levels. 

but, these problems were slowly being addressed by the change that naturally occurs with successive generations. 

the tension during that period was nothing like it is now. blacks and whites were far friendlier to one another than they are now. white people weren‚Äôt nearly as reactionary as they are today. society had its issues, like any civilization, but we didn‚Äôt allow those divisions to burn with the intensity that now threatens to set our world aflame. 

i am convinced that the push to normalize lgbt is the primary reason society is veering to the right. it was bridge too far for most of the public. and, there is an argument to be made that it wasn‚Äôt necessary. gays were out, and had been since stonewall. there was no push to shove them back in the closet. society, by and large, had acknowledged their existence and accepted their place in our society. 

it‚Äôs when they began demanding the right to marry, which would upset a long-standing pillar of civilization, that the public began violently recoiling at the thought of its traditional way of life being replaced by something foreign. that was followed by additional calls to include them in other areas that had normally been provided of straight representation. 

this became a cascade of radically disruptive intrusions on our way of life, apple cart after apple cart upset by changes that remade our society in a matter of a few decades. 

the response has been a frighteningly right-wing pushback against not just the advances gays have enjoyed, but progress that had been made by blacks, jews, women, and more. 

i feel like the selfish need of the gay and trans communities to be accepted has damned modern society to a fascist future. the only way to avert that crisis is for the left to reel in its support for the more extreme elements of the lgbt agenda."

Now let me be clear, there are some criterias to this in order to qualify as shit:  
  
\- if you want to earn more than 100$/week (like take into consideration A FUCKING MCDONALDS PART-TIME WORKER GETS AT LEAST 170$/week) working around 10 hours at it  
  
\- if you don't want to waste time with administrators/site moderators/site owners/glitch fixers/operators whenever times your online earned money mysteriously ""slips"" away in the black asshole of the internet : yes, that happens and you will most likely not get it back because of the myriads of reasons they make up for it, such as ""well our server crashed/there has been some issues with the transaction (happens all the time with tutoring websites)/we deducted it because your microphone quality wasn't the best, some background noise was getting in (UX testers use this bullshit a lot)/ we actually have no fucking ideas what happened, but we will let you know when it's fixed (mostly never) ""  
  
\- if you don't want to wake up kicked out/with an invalidated or severely changed contract because these websites and apps have the right to change their rules anytime they see fit and there are lots of people that lose their position from one day to the other because of the random whims of the owners of these domains  
  
  
  
Make no mistake, the no-brainer with these online money making stuff is not the ""skill"" that seems obvious you need:  
  
\-dropshipping/selling on amazon, ebay & co. is a no-brainer  
  
\-making graphic designs can be learned by anyone almost and with a good application even a dexterity retard can get by  
  
\-you can make videos or teach something about anything and never run out of content  
  
BUT, BUT, BUT  
  
This is NOT TRULY THE SKILL THAT IS REQUIRED !!  
  
What one needs to succeed at any of these is:  
  
Huge social network  
  
Search Engine Optimization  
  
Money  
  
Now you can trade money for huge social network - the huger it is, the less money you need. Why ? Because it's all about GETTING YOURSELF OUT THERE IN THE FACE OF THE WORLD AND STAYING THERE, POPPING UP THERE ALL THE TIME !! Competition is huge with all the turds living in their mom's basement nowadays, who do you think will click on your 64th page ass ?!  
  
No, what is required is a huge network that will boost your views & likes & reviews to kickstart your service and not let you to collect dust like most people do on the internet. And if you don't have this network, you might as well pay good money to get your service advertised and get the attention of people, on the same principle.  
  
The search engine optimization is the only thing you can do on your own, but that as well takes a shit ton of time to master it, people who are even average SEOs still spend hundreds of hours learning that.  
  
  
  
All in all, I'm a banker and yeah, I know the irony. But I'm writing this post in my lunch break and it's something I sincerely believe in.

1,2023-07-31,CMV: the Fermi Paradox makes no sense,u/Moses_The_Wise,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15e5ka1/cmv_the_fermi_paradox_makes_no_sense/,changemyview,"The Fermi Paradox. 

""The Fermi paradox is the discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of advanced extraterrestrial life and the apparently high likelihood of its existence."" 

The Fermi Paradox suggests that we already possess the means of observing such advanced life (or any extraterrestrial life), that such advanced life exists within observable range, and that if we detected, we'd know what it is. 

1. Means. 

As many astrophysicists can tell you, our ability to observe space is limited. The following article shows the *first ever* picture of an exoplanet (a planet beyond our solar system), taken in 2022: 

[https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/09/01/nasas-webb-takes-its-first-ever-direct-image-of-distant-world/ ](https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/09/01/nasas-webb-takes-its-first-ever-direct-image-of-distant-world/)

Pretty blurry, isn't it? And that's a gas giant, so likely as not no life there. So if we can barely observe even close-by planets in any level of detail, *at all*, why are we so sure we just don't have the technology to observe it? 

2. Range 

Space is pretty big. Imagine the image of 5 distinct, unique, different people in your head. Close your eyes and try. They can be real people or fictional, but just imagine the image of 5 people. Hold all of their facial features, clothes, subtle hair color and skin tone differences, hairstyles, expressions, etc. in your head, avoiding repeats. It's pretty difficult. Now do it with 10. Then 15. 

Now do it with 10 billion people. Can you? Can your mind even wrap around how big that number is? Well you don't have to try, because it can't. Why this exercise? To show you how pitifully inadequate your brain is at handling the vast sizes and spaces of space. A rock the size of the earth could travel straight through a dense galaxy for 25,000 light-years, and never come within 1 light-year of a star or planet. Space is mostly empty void, broken up occasionally by stars and planets. 

We have barely scratched the surface of looking at earth. Imagine going into the Sahara, and cordoning off a 5 ft. square of sand. Then, taking a trowel, you examine roughly the first inch of sand on the top of the Sahara, using your naked eye. After 10 minutes of painstaking research, you declare ""There is no life at all in Africa"". 

We have barely begun to examine space, and have only looked at a small section. Making the determination that life isn't out there because of that is silly. 

3. Identification 

We pick up signals from space all the time. Sometimes we know what it is, sometimes we have guesses, and other times we have no idea. All of this could be an attempt by an alien race to communicate, but how would we know? How would we know that it isn't just one of hundreds of weird space junk filtering in all the time? 

Also, what will life look like if we see it? Us? Carbon-based life forms that run and breathe and like oxygen and water? What if it's a planet of thinking gss molecules? What if they just live underground, so our distant images won't easily pick any disturbances up? 

We have no idea what to look like in alien life, either in their messages, appearance, or planets; so how would we detect life even if we could thoroughly search vast areas of space in detail? 

Conclusion: Given the vastness of space and the lack of humanity's observational technology at the moment, we shouldn't at all be surprised that we haven't detected alien life, even if it is common."

A choice is when you knowingly get yourself into a situation wether good or bad. 

For example I would consider it a choice if someone who was obese ate a whole cake despite them knowing it could probably cause them health complications down the line.

A mistake would be messing up an ingredient while making your dinner, it wasn't an intentional decsion and learn from that.

My view on this being I can never see a situation where someone knowingly jumps into bed with another person while in an exlusive relationship and think that's a good decsion, you might regret that choice, but it's a choice nonetheless."

I think that's why a lot of women tend to view their friendships in terms of how it benefits and entertains them rather than what they bring to the friendship. It's a slightly narcissistic behavior amongst women towards other women.

Women also tend to be friends with women who are less attractive than them or just ""different"" as in different body types or in a different category of attractiveness. When two women are in the same category of attractiveness, there is a sense of competitiveness. In such scenarios, a woman might feel like her friend is happy to see her doing worse-off or not happy for her when she's doing well. 

Some personal experiences that led me to lose my faith in real, healthy female friendships started when I lost my dad. My so-called close girlfriends started using it as a conversation topic to make new friends, and gain attention. My closest girlfriend, after breaking up with her bf, tried hard to make me break up with mine: ""Men are all trash."" I could no longer go to her for advice bc she would always end up telling me to break up with my bf. My single gfs also don't respect my relationship, they pressure me to go to clubs with them and flirt with men to get free drinks. If I'm unwilling to flirt with men, then I can't come with them. So I don't believe in girls night out bc it still very much looking for male validation.

The only person I trust is my sister. She is the only one who is genuinely sad when bad things happen to me and happy for me when good things happen. I think amongst heterosexual women in their 20s and 30s, it is incredibly hard to find genuine, healthy women to be friends with.

1) It costs nothing for the employers to send out en-mass a few hundred or thousand emails via an automated system

2) It removes the question on whether the hiring department is just being slow (as i have experienced multiple times before) , or you just havent been accepted.

3) If applications are only sent over email and not an online form, you often don't know whether you application has actually been received correctly.

Examples of questions parents should ask (please critique) :

- Did somebody tell you to keep a secret?

- Did somebody say they would hurt you, mommy, daddy or (pet's name)?

- Did somebody make you uncomfy?

- Did you do a ""special hug"" with somebody?

We don‚Äôt define a car as something that looks and acts like a car. We define it by what it looks and acts like. Without two defined ends of the spectrum to infer what the spectrum expresses, the spectrum does not exist. Thus, it is most appropriate to define man and woman as what they have always been defined as, male and female. The issue with this is that sex does not really act as a spectrum or at least not a spectrum where transgenderism exists. Though intersex people exist, they are exceedingly rare and trans people mostly are not intersex. 

Because of this, I think that rather than gender being a spectrum, it‚Äôs gender expression that is a spectrum. On one end, there is masculinity and on the other, there is femininity. While both are social constructs, they are still 1. rooted in fixed traits and 2. defined by those traits. Masculinity varies by society but generally it refers to traits such as facial hair, muscularity, stoicism, bravery, strength, dominance etc. Femininity has changed quite a lot at least in the West but traditionally, it referred to traits such as soft and smooth skin, submissiveness, meekness, longer eyelashes, hairlessness etc. I think that the ‚Äúsubvert gender roles‚Äù movement neutered the transgender movement because when it became acceptable for men to become more feminine and women to become more masculine, it removed the social aspect of what made a man a man and a woman a woman. A man puts a skirt and a crop top on, takes hormones, covers his face in makeup, and shaves his skin but he‚Äôs still a man because men can be feminine too. Another man does the same thing to claim he‚Äôs a woman. There‚Äôs no difference besides what they personally want to be which, pardon my bluntness, I don‚Äôt think matters. Since gender is based off sex, then gender is decided by birth. However, gender expression is simply how you express your gender. If you want to express yourself as a masculine woman or a feminine man, you can. That‚Äôs what I think transgenderism should be. You are not a woman or a man simply because you say you are. I think HRT, crossdressing, even genital surgery, are more about changing how your gender is expressed rather than what your gender is. Having a dick/producing a lot of testosterone doesn‚Äôt make you a man. It‚Äôs that we associate these traits with masculinity and therefore with manhood even though the two are not synonymous. By changing your ‚Äúgender‚Äù, you have changed your gender expression, not much else. 

The reason I think this matters is less because of any personal vendetta against trans people but because of new ideas like transracialism and trans-ability(even transpecies-ism) that use transgender logic either to poke fun at transgenderism or to be accepted alongside it. Race is a social construct. We assign categories to combinations of certain traits and call that a race. Does that mean that by changing those traits, you can change your race? If you said yes, fine. If you said no, then it‚Äôs the exact same with gender. Ability is a social construct. What makes someone able isn‚Äôt something that has to do with them but rather how they are relative to society. A person who only knows English would be disadvantaged and unable to communicate in a country like Bosnia and Herzegovina. They‚Äôd be no different from a deaf and mute person who couldn‚Äôt communicate at all unless they received aid in the form of a translator. Someone who lived in Florida their whole life would likely be disadvantaged going to Nepal, a very mountainous and relatively cold country, unless they received aid in the form of a suit specifically made for high altitude and low temp environments. This was a rather long winded analogy but the point is that since what makes someone abled is not fixed at all, then no person is inherently abled or disabled and the traits often associated with them can also be changed to whatever effect. Whether it‚Äôs blinding yourself and getting your legs removed(which actually happened)or simply claiming that your appearance or your affinity for procrastination is a disability, either could be valid. However, very few people are chomping at the bit to say people should have the right to remove their legs and claim disability or that someone with diagnosed autism should be held with the same regard as someone neurotypical but with a particularly lazy demeanor.  My personal idea on why people dislike these movements(besides ‚Äúit‚Äôs weird‚Äù)is because there is a sort of power dynamic with race and ability that doesn‚Äôt exist with gender(white people are considered to hold more power than black/abled are considered to hold more power than disabled)which leads to an emphasis on reclamation of power from white/abled people that transracialism/trans-ability seems to mock. But even then, if we go back 70 years, it was the same thing with feminists disliking transgender women because they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúreal women‚Äù and were just making a mockery of them. Overall, I think the logic is similar enough that it makes no sense that the transgender movement is emphasized but any mention of transracialism is clearly a far right ploy to make progressives say ‚Äúmaybe we should slow down.‚Äù It also makes no sense to me how loose gender seems to be now. It being a social conduct doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs an easily mutable trait."

The main point that I believe support this view:

1) When you vote you're basically deciding on which direction a country should follow in the future, and sadly is none of your business when you're at the end of the line;

2) As humans we always valued the wisdom and experience of the elderly, but that was before modern science allowed us to push further and further the span of human life, nowadays you're much more likely to be senile instead of wise in your last few years;

3) connected to previous point, society changes at a super fast pace nowadays, while in the past old people knowledge of the world was invaluable nowadays is pretty much useless, you're much more likely to be under the curve and clueless about society needs/development, especially when it gets to technology.

4) We are aging. Pretty much all developed countries are aging, some very very fast, some slower but is a general trend, it's extremely unfair that old people are having (or in several countries already have)  more political weight and rapresentation than young people (I'm currently living in one of the fast aging countries, and is dishartening seeing all political parties constantly pandering or promising stuff to the old voters).

5) realistically, no-one is going to propose anti-old people laws just because they can't vote, either because lots of us have parents or grandparents that we care about or simply because one day we may be in that situation. 

I've no idea where that age limit should be set, we could go for an arbitrary age (say 80-85) as we could use statistics, and I can understand the need for some exeptions (like being able to vote in local elections or something like that).

A country should not pick and choose which horrible atrocity is illegal to deny and which ones aren't. Every act of genocide recognized as such by that nation's government should be illegal to deny or none of them should be. The law should be applied evenly to every genocide.

What sense does it make to decide which atrocities are illegal to deny and which aren't? It seems to be giving a message that ""We recognize all these terrible crimes against humanity for what they are, but some of them are worthy of more protection than the others"".

Making only select genocides illegal to deny just adds fuel to fires of conspiracy. Racists, nazis, bigots, all of the above, and so on, tend to see these laws as some sort of warped justification for their views; they believe they must be right because it's only illegal to deny the specific genocide that they are focused on and not others."

The halo effect is a commonly observed phenomena that I think most people are willing to agree exists but are dishonest about it actually making an impact on quality of life. Especially for men. Even while young, the halo effect is obversable.

 The way peopl, including peers and adults treat you is different. If you are ugly adults are ruder, they think you‚Äôre more likely to be delinquent and they treat you as such.  Your peers will instinctually avoid you as theyre put off by your appearance. This does a large amount of damage in your formative years. This is also compacted with bullying for the way you look at the time when you‚Äôre just becoming aware of your self is so harmful. I personally experienced this and the isolation I experienced while a child into my teenage years prevented me from developing socially. I‚Äôm 22 now and the

Attractive people experience the exact opposite of this in their developmental years. People get to know them and are drawn to them. As a result, their social confidence is much higher. They feel less reservations about meeting new people and making friends. They‚Äôre less likely to develop social issues and will typically have a more robust social life due to their confidence and skills they learned growing up.

When it comes to romantic/sexual success, it‚Äôs very clear attractive people do better. They get more dates, it‚Äôs easier to get a relationship, they have casual sex, they probably are less likely to be cheated on and have more sex in their relationships. 

Ugly people just aren‚Äôt afforded this level of ease when it comes to dating and sex. I personally have never met a woman that has been attracted to me physically. I have a good personality so I‚Äôve made a lot of female friends but I‚Äôve never even been able to get a date. Yes personality can help, but physical attraction is the barrier and I haven‚Äôt been able to hurdle that with any of those things.

I workout, I have good hygiene, I dress well, I do the things everyone says to do that ugly guys need to do for romantic success and it doesn‚Äôt work. Because non of it really affects the way your face looks which is the most important part of being physically attractive.

Lastly your experience while attractive will just be better when navigating other humans. Attractive people are more likely to be hired for a job, seen as more trustworthy, seen as smarter, funnier, and kinder. Being attractive shapes the way people interpret your personality. Being ugly makes it seem worse. Even benign actions change. 

An ugly person being shy and quiet is a ‚Äúmass shooter red flag‚Äù(something that I have had told to me before. Where it‚Äôs seen as cute for attractive people. Being a bit of a loner and going out to public places alone is seen as ‚Äúcreepy stalker behavior‚Äù(something told to me last year after someone saw me eating in the dining hall alone 4 tables away from a table of women) where that behavior wouldn‚Äôt be questioned.

If Germany were to deny some war crime they would be mercilessly vilified by the world, yet the Japanese get off almost Scott-free.

Japan was the only nation to deploy biological and chemical weapons in warfare during WW2. 

Japanese mistreatment of POWs was the rule not an exception. While the Germans were terrible to Soviet prisoners, Allied POWs could expect to be treated fairly and humanely in accordance with international laws of war. Japan brutally mistreated EVERY prisoner of war they took.

Japan held very similar views to the Germans on racial superiority and they brutally suppressed those they viewed as ""inferior"".

Japan blatantly violated almost every single law of armed conflict: torture and execution of prisoners, intentionally targeting civilians, ignoring ""open city"" orders, frequent and methodical looting of cities, execution of injured soldiers, deliberately targeting medical facilities and personnel including 'The Red Cross', use of WMDs, and the list goes on.

Emotionally Immature:

* Had a temper tantrum because she needed her feet to be soaked in water, left her shoes out for Arnold to trip on, and when Arnold trips on her shoes and drops her dessert in the foot water, she expects Oskar to give up **his** dessert because of it. When he doesn't, she storms off like a petulant child.
* Throws plates around her apartment during a minor argument with Oskar. I know Oskar's not perfect, but what the fuck could be that bad that she throws fucking plates around an apartment. TF is wrong with you?

Doesn't care about Oskar:

* Oskar asked five times for a sandwich, and she made an excuse for him each time. However, one call from Mr. Budnick, she goes right over. I bet if Mr. Budnick asked for a sandwich, she'd make him one. Makes you wonder what's going on with him?
* I'm not a woman, but I know many women who have told their husbands to get jobs. Suzie never told Oskar to get a job or kick rocks, she keeps enabling his scum behavior.
* Oskar was on the way out and trying to make it on his own when Suzie offered him cash for his journey and he said ""you keep the money."" Apparently that's all it took for her to take him back, and back to his same scum behavior. He didn't learn a fucking thing.

Under-achiever:

* She's 35 and works in a department store making minimum wage working 65 hours a week.

Because if Homosexuality was a choice than the person making that choice would have to be mentally disabled. Let me explain myself 

If I were to tell you that you have 2 choices to pick from freely. One, you can become a homosexual male in our society, face tremendous amounts of isolation, rejection, resilience, alienation, even physical violence. Never be able to truly express yourself as who you are, never be able to hold hands or kiss your lover freely or never be accepted by even your own family and most likely be disowned by them. 

Two, you can be heterosexual and not face any of the alienation, violence, etc. Then be able to freely express yourself, have everybody's support in society, live a completely normal and social life. Never face any discrimination for liking the opposite sex. Because let's be honest, that never happens.

Now putting it like this, I personally, If I GENUINELY had the choice to choose from both of them I WOULD OF COURSE CHOOSE HETEROSEXUALITY. Any person in their right mind would. The cons of being a homosexual in a heterosexual dominated society far, far outweighs the pros. I would have to be mental to choose homosexuality.

1,2023-07-31,CMV: All of the Current Claims Made About UFOs and Aliens are Entirely Baseless,u/realblueiron,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15en9g8/cmv_all_of_the_current_claims_made_about_ufos_and/,changemyview,"**Thesis**

The only relevant fact about the alien-UFO discussion is that we have no historical data about aliens or non-human non-earth intelligence. No matter how fast or 'weird' a UFO moves, no matter what inexplicable phenomenon we see - there is no evidence that ties weird planes or weird events to aliens as there is no pre-existing confirmation of aliens near planes or weird events. Period.

**Expanded Thesis**

On the surface alien craft claims seem tough to disprove because of the large number of unexplained phenomena pro-alien folks can come up with. However, rational investigators are not obligated to address each claim's ""alien-ness"" with evidence. We aren't required to disprove random hypotheses until science has *accounted for all of the likelier hypotheses*. The pro-alien group must contend with all of the more likely hypotheses or provide evidence to the scientific community that discredits all other likely guesses before should consider the alien hypothesis.

Currently, since we have never pulled an alien out of anything much less these craft and we have never encountered an alien anywhere else, the alien hypothesis is just a bit likelier than god and less likely than anything we know exists or have any evidence might exist.

To put it in perspective, we have updated our understanding of the laws of physics several times in the last century, but have seen zero aliens - so from where I stand, ""The laws of physics are wrong"" is a much more likely explanation than ""Aliens are flying airplanes around the US"".

**Types of Evidence Likely to Change my Mind from Least Likely (Strongest) to Most Likely (Weakest)**

1) Extremely solid evidence, confirmed by the scientific community, that there is in fact intelligent alien life in or around these floating things

2) Examples where scientific questions are regularly and successfully answered by complex agents that supposedly don't exist (ex. Actually, scientists test the hypothesis that time travelers interfered with events quite often and with great success).

3) Evidence that we have really considered all other likely hypotheses somehow in one of these alien craft cases. I would likely need to see a scientific paper saying, ""Yep, we really looked at everything and it's either aliens or god.""

**Bad Arguments that are Unlikely to Change my View**

1) The alien craft flew crazy good though!

This one is the worst. Craft that perform well by human standards and interact with humans are much more likely to be human craft. Even failing a human explanation. Sensor issues, false testimony, weird camera angles, weather phenomena, or some known physical object just behaving in a new way we haven't seen before are all things that have existed in the past. there is nothing to tie aliens to weird craft movement for the simple reason that we've never seen a recognizable alien come out of one of these anomalies, but we have repeatedly seen various physical phenomena make a plane do weird stuff before.

2) The Universe is huge and infinite so There are definitely aliens!

Based. I agree. That also makes it extremely unlikely that they are here, much less in some anomaly recognizable by humans. Also, if there are so many aliens near us, show me one.

3) There is a preponderance of sightings and activity that you can't explain!

Ok great. Show me any weird event where an alien was involved (confirmed by the broad scientific community) and I'll raise the probability a bit that aliens are involved in other weird events. Until then I will stick with the other things that explain weird events - mostly weather balloons, rain, lies, and bad plane radar.

4) I had a dream on LSD that the alien creators entered my wife's body and then my...

Nope!

5) We theorize about new things that don't exist all the time!

Yes! And good scientists pick the simplest explanation always. 

ex. The galaxy behaves like there is a small, dense material at the center with a lot of gravity. Let's guess that there is a hyperdense, high-gravity thing at the center of the galaxy. We can call this a black hole. It's probably a dense version of the gases and stars we see floating around.

Notably, in the example above, the answer was not, ""Aliens move the stars around to make pretty galaxy""."
1,2023-07-31,CMV: The 'free will' debate is silly.,u/Fando1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15enhpp/cmv_the_free_will_debate_is_silly/,changemyview,"I remember watching nueroscientist Sam Harris and philosopher Dan Dennett actually fall out in public over this debate. I remember listening and thinking 'of all the things to fall out over, this seems daft'.

The current competing views are (over simplifying):

Determinism: The world is deterministic, according the laws of physics. Events only unfold one way, so there is no such thing as free will.

Compatabilism: Free will is compatible with determinism. If your desires line up with your actions these are freely chosen.

Whilst I can see the impact this has on moral philosophy and crime/punishment. I don't think from a purely epistemological point of view it is worth such vigorous debate.

Consider this...

If you are holding your phone right now, you would be considered correct in saying that you are 'touching' your phone. Even though physically the electrons in your fingers and in the phones atoms are repelling. So you are actually not physically making contact with the phone.

If you see a photo of yourself as a small child, you could accurately say 'that is me'. Even though every 5-10 years all atoms in your body have been recycled. So you don't actually share a single atom in common with that child. None the less that idea of persistence is still one we take as fact.

We do this all the time, with concepts like love, justice, imaginary numbers, platonic shapes, 'touch', 'persistence'. None of these exist in any physical capacity. But all are useful concepts that we treat as being real in order to navigate the world.

In many senses they are real. I don't think many would doubt the love they have for their families, even if that can't be empirically measured.

I would argue 'free will' is just another high level concept like this. It too, serves a purpose for us in helping us navigate the world, assign praise and blame, create legal systems. Perhaps on an atomic level it may not 'exist' but is that so different from the concepts of 'touch', 'persistence' or 'love'.

I'm sure there must be a philosophocal term for this, and please tell me if so. But I believe it is an abstract label, the same as many others we take for granted. 

Perhaps even all words we have are simply metaphors for an underlying reality? So why is free will treated as such an important topic for epistemological debate?

1,2023-07-31,CMV: Games without luck are superior to games with a luck component,u/tritium3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15envgz/cmv_games_without_luck_are_superior_to_games_with/,changemyview,"Don't get me wrong, games with luck are often quite fun especially live when there are people of varying skills levels present or people who never played the game.  However we should not use fun as the primary definition for the quality of a game since it is very subjective. 

The best game is one in which the outcome is based on pure decision making and usually a 1v1 player game (since in 3 player games, 2 people can attack one player if they choose to putting him in a disadvantage). Games where there are higher number of choices at each decision point are better than games with fewer choices possible at each decision point (which is why chess is superior to checkers or connect 4). 

I put games such as chess, billiards/pool, and most sports in the highest category. Games without luck and perfect knowledge allow for the most strategic thinking taking into account all variables. Team games would be in this category assuming all parties on a team are working together. 

A second tier of games would be like Starcraft where there is no RNG luck but there is imperfect information and it is sometimes lucky that you get the information you need to win the game. 

Poker is an interesting category where there is heavy RNG luck in the cards, but over many hands the luck balances out completely. 

Games with dice are inferior are always inferior to the games listed previously. 

I am not familiar with a lot of the more obscure board games so if there are more categories of games that I have not listed that might change my view I would be interested in playing those games. "

1,2023-07-31,CMV: Simon Cowell is a pretentious douche bag and his opinion should be worthless to any musician,u/Effective-Handle9983,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15epzw8/cmv_simon_cowell_is_a_pretentious_douche_bag_and/,changemyview,"When people think about celebrities known for being harsh, they often think about Cowell and Gordon Ramsay. In the case of Ramsay, he is a highly accomplished chef, having earned multiple(last time I checked it was 14) Michelin Stars(chefs would kill for one) and owns multiple highly regarded restaurants, the man is one of the best in the culinary field. With Cowell often being compare to him you'd think he'd be similar in the music industry to Ramsay in the culinary industry, however, you know what shows up when you look his name on spotify? Nothing. You know how many music awards he won? Zero. So unlike Ramsay, he isn't good at what he criticizes, he has no noteworthy musical career or award to speak of, therefore, he isn't one to talk about what makes a good musician and what doesn't, hell he doesn't even have any musical education as far as I know. The thing he is good at, is telling others they're not good enough.

PS: Look I'm not saying that people should just shut up and not criticize music unless they are a musician if they're not one themselves, however, if you're profession is criticizing other's music(IK he also criticizes other stuff but I'm focusing on music because it's the most common) I think you need a few accomplishments in that area to back your claims."

Why short form content is bad:
1. It destroys our attention spans, before I quit short form content watching A MOVIE was painful
2. You‚Äôre making constantly making decisions,‚Äùis this video worth my time or do I swipe‚Äù
3. This one may just be me, but after watching a video I feel better or the same, but after a series of short form content I feel worse most of the time
4. It has so much dopamine in it and overstimulates you. So when you do normal things they feel very boring"
1,2023-07-31,CMV: certain people cannot be held responsible for their actions and therefore cannot be considered abusive,u/Relevant_Maybe6747,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15erwg4/cmv_certain_people_cannot_be_held_responsible_for/,changemyview,"Certain people cannot be held responsible for their actions because they‚Äôre incapable of comprehending the impact what they‚Äôre doing outside of its direct impact on themselves. In law, these people are considered [incompetent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competence_(law)).   


My brother is one of these people - he‚Äôs severely cognitively impaired and my parents have essentially told me my entire life that I‚Äôm capable of knowing better and he isn‚Äôt, so his actions can never meaningfully be punished because he‚Äôs incapable of understanding the harm he caused. >!These actions include molestation of me and physical violence against my parents and staff members at his group home.!< His only desire is to avoid being punished in any way possible, so to hold him accountable for his actions would be inflicting severe harm onto him, and his ability to meaningfully be rehabilitated is unlikely because he doesn‚Äôt learn from his mistakes. I can‚Äôt, likely due to how I‚Äôve been treated and taught to treat him,  view him as morally responsible for what he did. He isn‚Äôt abusive in my mind because he would never be able to stand trial legally (he‚Äôs been in legal trouble before and deemed incompetent, my parents are his legal guardians) but I‚Äôd like my view changed if there‚Äôs any obvious flaws in my judgment"
1,2023-07-31,CMV: The West has once again declared moral superiority on the world,u/Maddoc_71,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15esgmc/cmv_the_west_has_once_again_declared_moral/,changemyview,"Turn the dial back a century or half ago and you would find, the western world taking expeditions to ""civilize"" the uncivilized world. Wiping out the local population in some smaller countries and exploiting and colonizing the rest. 

A lot has changed since then and despite some colonial hangover, the world is healing well. 

Now a new wave of ideological supremacists have taken hold in the West and now want to spread their moral superiority to the world. 

Rest of the world again finds itself uncivilized, in the eyes of these progressive elements and want to impose their new gained enlightenment on unsuspecting countries. 

Such as the Qatar-World Cup-Pride ban fiasco, calling for diversity only in specific regions of the world and concentrated in high paying jobs, arguing and insulting one conservative religion while promoting another conservative religion, forced diversity and inclusive principles only in predominantly ""light"" populations whilst ignoring the homogenous nature of populations in other countries and many more.  
Icing on the cake being gender related arguments, which the rest of the world doesn't even understand and nor wants to partake in, simply waiting for it's eventual demise. Castigating those not participating in the ideology, for those unfortunate to find themselves in their company. 

The rest of the world has decided to ignore it as mute spectators, but it is once again, another inquisition being meted out to different cultures and their ideaologies.

This was a mistake and I am not only doing these three things, not gaming as an option.)

I am someone who is unable to handle reality and need an escape, something that can be used to dull the mind. I already go to the gym and jog and am seeing a psychologist, but it is not enough when you existentially can't handle fundamental reality. Nihilism, realizing life is unfair and always has been, etc. Philosophy makes me more depressed - Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, moral relativism + hedonism + consequentialism, etc.  
  
I will now list the flaws of each vice (having to spend money is already assumed).  
  
Alcohol - Liver issues, hangovers, chance of becoming an alcoholic.   
  
Drugs - addiction, illegal, tolerance gained over time. In my country weed is not legal  
  
Smoking - lungs, looked down on and banned in a lot of public spaces, smell gets into furniture

I don't really want to start drinking either, but due to needing something I think alcohol is the least worst vice."

12,2023-07-31,CMV: the average person should not drive a car,u/zaneprotoss,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15eupa0/cmv_the_average_person_should_not_drive_a_car/,changemyview,"I've recently seen a post right here on reddit about a road accident. A motorcyclist was driving on the road while a car did an illegal turn without checking and caused the motorcycle to crash into them. By some sheer miracle, the motorcyclist survived, a rare exception in situations like this. Any high-speed accident involving a car usually ends in serious injury if not death. Cars are too dangerous for what they are used for.

An accident caused by a smaller vehicle like a bicycle has a much smaller chance of causing any significant injuries. Larger vehicles like buses and trucks are usually operated by much more skilled and responsible drivers (or at least they should be). Cars are the only vehicle that is dangerous enough to easily kill a person while being driven by someone who cares little about safety and rules. The average driver treats driving restrictions like a burden rather than a safety measure. Your seatbelt is there to save your life, not cause you discomfort.

I understand that there are a few complicated aspects about this issue.

Many cities (especially in North America) are built in ways that force people to use cars. A person without a car may as well be under house arrest. They have no public transit available and all destinations are too far to walk to. This does not excuse the issue. A second injury doesn't make the first one go away. Cities should be built better. Public transit should be numerous and convenient. People should not drive cars and they definitely shouldn't need to.

Believe it or not, some people do not live in dense urban areas. Public transit has very limited use outside of metropolitan areas. For those people, a car (or similar vehicle) is absolutely necessary. For those cases specifically, people driving cars is ok. Cars driven on empty roads not shared by any other traffic are usually less likely to cause accidents anyway.

The average person treats driving too casually. Safety restrictions are ignored as much as possible. A car going 100kph/60mph will cause death is it crashes into another vehicle. A car going 50kph/30mph will kill a pedestrian. Road signs and speed limits are designed with safety in mind. Going 100kph/60mph on a road with that limit ensures that you have enough time and space to react to a sudden stop. Going 140kph/90mph on that road requires twice as much time and space to make the same decision.

There are a few more aspects that may be worth mentioning but they are either an exception or can be addressed by another issue instead. In general, the average person should not drive. Repercussions for endangering others should be greater. Drivers should be tested more than once in their life. Cities should be made with all of this in mind. Public transit should be convenient, plentiful and have a nominal cost if any at all.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some time has passed. Overall, comments mention two things.

""What about \[other thing\] that kills people as well?"" That's obviously also bad and also needs stricter regulations. I don't see the point in the comparison.

""Cars are too necessary, thousands of deaths are a cheap price to pay."" A bit cruel but that is part of my post already. Cars specifically are an issue because of how necessary they can be. They should not be that necessary overall, especially not to the average person. The average person should not drive."
