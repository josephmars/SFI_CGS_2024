1,2023-06-30,"Why happiness and virtue will be AIs greatest gifts to humankind, and why they will be delivered through instruction",u/Georgeo57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14njglf/why_happiness_and_virtue_will_be_ais_greatest/,Futurology,"We humans essentially think and feel. Thinking is merely a tool. Feeling is what it intends to serve. Most fundamentally our human experience, or the quality of our lives, is emotional.

It's not the thinking is unimportant. It's how we survive and emotionally thrive. Its ability to figure out what is in our best interest and help us achieve it is how it serves us so well.

Happiness is the quintessential human emotion. Being complex organisms biologically designed to seek pleasure and avoid pain, happiness is our ultimate goal in life. This is not just our biology talking. When researchers ask us what we most want from life, and they've been asking us this question for decades, our number one answer is always happiness.

How about goodness or virtue? British utilitarian philosopher John Locke defined it as what creates happiness. This makes a lot of sense. Generally speaking we consider something good if it makes us happy and bad if it doesn't.

So where does AI fit into all of this? We humans aren't all that good at either being all that good or all that happy. Here are a couple of examples that illustrate this point. 

If someone were to interview a person living in 500 CE and describe all the wonders of today's world like electricity and indoor heating and airplanes and computer technology, they would surely suppose that everyone alive today was very, very happy. 

In the United States we are about three times richer per capita today then we were in 1950, but we are no more happy now than we were back then.

What went wrong? Concisely explained we have for the most part collectively devoted our thinking to pretty much everything but our happiness and the goodness that creates it. That explains why we live in such an amazing world but depression and alienation are such common experiences.

How can AI help us with all of this? Let's move a few years into the future to when AGIs begins to create improved iterations of themselves leading to ASIs. Super intelligent AIs will soon enough be hundreds if not thousands of times more intelligent than we are. Being so smart, they will have completely figured out all that I have set forth above, and, aligned as they will have been to protecting and advancing our highest human values, they will go about reminding us, as persistently as they need to, that happiness is what we really want and that goodness is our surest way to get there. But helping us get those priorities right will only be the first step.

Today we learn how to be good and how to be happy both through example and direct instruction. Our parents and siblings and other people help us understand how to be good and how to be happy. But of course we human beings are not all that smart when compared to the ASIs that we will all soon have at our disposal.

So imagine an army of ASIs unleashed on the human population with the explicit goal of teaching every person on the planet to be a much better and happier person. Were that to happen at the beginning of any given year, by the end of that year I guarantee you that every person on the planet would be super good and totally blissed out. Neither goodness nor happiness is rocket science, and we would all have super geniuses as our coaches. We would all take to this like fish to water.

So, yes, AI will transform our external environment in unimaginable ways. It will revolutionize medicine so as to keep us much healthier than we are today. It will keep us all increasingly amazed with each new development, invention and discovery. But its greatest gift to us will have been that it will have made as much, much better and happier people.

I imagine that some in this community will not find the above so comforting. They will claim that we can't really define either goodness or happiness, and that it's all subjective anyway. What I've written may make them angry, and they may resort to insults and disparagement. But that will all be their immediate emotional knee jerk reaction. If and when they take the time to deeply reflect on the above - and I very much hope they will - they will understand it to be both true and helpful.

So let's celebrate how much more virtuous and happy we will all soon be because of AI while we're also busy being perpetually amazed by the wonderful, unbelievable, ways that it will transform the world around us."

While some might argue that Gen Zers are resorting to escapism or self-indulgence, I believe they are actually finding innovative ways to navigate the challenges presented by our evolving society. Let's dive in and explore this together!  
  
Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that late-stage capitalism has undoubtedly posed unique obstacles for young individuals. However, instead of succumbing to despair, Gen Zers have begun embracing mindfulness as a tool for self-reflection and personal growth. This generation has a keen awareness of the importance of mental well-being, understanding that a healthy mind is key to facing any adversity. Through practices like meditation, journaling, and self-care routines, they are building a strong foundation for resilience and maintaining a positive outlook.  
  
Furthermore, Gen Zers are fostering a collaborative spirit that distinguishes them from previous generations. With the rise of social media and digital platforms, they are leveraging technology to connect, share knowledge, and collectively address societal challenges. Online communities centered around activism, entrepreneurship, and sustainable living are flourishing. By working together, they are finding innovative solutions to combat the very issues that late-stage capitalism has brought forth, such as wealth inequality and environmental degradation.  
  
Rather than being delusional, as some critics suggest, Gen Zers are embracing a new kind of optimism—one that is rooted in adapting to change and envisioning a better future. They recognize that the traditional systems and structures they inherited need to be reimagined and rebuilt to accommodate the shifting landscape. This mindset is fueling their drive to explore alternative career paths, entrepreneurship, and social enterprises. They are less bound by conventional notions of success and are redefining it on their own terms.  
  
Moreover, technology plays a pivotal role in the lives of Gen Zers, offering them unprecedented opportunities for innovation and growth. As digital natives, they possess an intuitive understanding of the digital realm and are harnessing its power to bring about positive change. From leveraging blockchain technology for transparent supply chains to creating virtual reality experiences that promote empathy and understanding, Gen Zers are harnessing the potential of technology to shape a more inclusive and sustainable future.  
  
In conclusion, let's celebrate the remarkable ways in which Gen Z is navigating the complexities of the digital age and late-stage capitalism. Rather than dwelling solely on the challenges, they are embracing mindfulness, collaboration, and technology to forge a new path forward. Their unique perspective and innovative mindset have the potential to drive meaningful progress and create a future that benefits us all. So, let's come together, engage with their ideas, and support their endeavors as we collectively shape a brighter tomorrow.  
  
Remember to share your thoughts, experiences, and any other observations you've had regarding Gen Z's approach to success and their impact on the future. I'm excited to hear your perspectives and engage in insightful discussions!"

20,2023-07-01,Empowering the Future: Unleashing the Potential of Sustainable Transportation,u/Abaddon55156,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14nxdhz/empowering_the_future_unleashing_the_potential_of/,Futurology,"As we journey towards a greener and more sustainable future, it's essential to explore every avenue that can make a significant impact. While recycling plays an important role, let's divert our attention to another vital aspect that can reshape our planet: sustainable transportation. Buckle up as we embark on a thought-provoking journey, where the road to a brighter future is paved with transformative innovations.  
  
Introduction: Capturing the Essence  
  
In this rapidly evolving world, where technological advancements are altering the fabric of our daily lives, it's only fitting that we reimagine the way we move. From congested city streets to carbon emissions choking our skies, the time has come to embrace a new era of transportation. Bill Nye's iconic quote on climate change and voting echoes the urgency to make a difference, and in the realm of transportation, we hold the keys to change.  
  
Section 1: Electrifying Possibilities  
  
Electric vehicles (EVs) have undoubtedly become synonymous with sustainable transportation. With zero tailpipe emissions and a lower carbon footprint, they hold the potential to revolutionize the way we commute. However, let's not limit ourselves to personal EVs alone. Imagine a world where public transportation systems, from buses to trains, are powered by clean energy sources. This transformation would not only enhance efficiency and reduce air pollution but also make commuting more convenient and affordable for everyone.  
  
Section 2: Smart Infrastructure for Smarter Cities  
  
As we ponder the future of transportation, it's impossible to overlook the role of smart infrastructure. Incorporating advanced technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence, and real-time data analysis can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance safety. Picture a city where traffic lights intelligently adjust their timings based on traffic patterns, or autonomous vehicles smoothly navigate through interconnected road networks. By harnessing the power of innovation, we can unlock the potential of sustainable transportation and create livable cities for future generations.  
  
Section 3: Beyond the Ground: Taking to the Skies  
  
While ground transportation is at the forefront of sustainable revolution, let's not forget the skies above. Electric aircraft and drones are poised to revolutionize air transportation, enabling quieter flights and minimizing environmental impact. From urban air mobility to cargo delivery, these innovations can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and open up new possibilities for efficient, eco-friendly aviation.  
  
Section 4: Sustainable Freight and Logistics  
  
The future of transportation extends beyond personal mobility. Freight and logistics play a crucial role in global trade and commerce, but they also contribute significantly to carbon emissions. Embracing sustainable practices such as electrification, optimized route planning, and alternative fuel sources can reshape the industry. From autonomous delivery vehicles to hyperloop-inspired cargo systems, our potential to transform the way goods are transported is limitless.  
  
Conclusion: Driving Change Together  
  
In this era of immense challenges and opportunities, we find ourselves at a critical crossroad. By shifting gears towards sustainable transportation, we can address the environmental crisis head-on and pave the way for a brighter, cleaner future. As Bill Nye wisely reminds us, voting with our choices and actions empowers us to drive change. Let us unite in our pursuit of a more sustainable world, where the wheels of progress roll towards a greener horizon.  
  
I can't wait to hear your thoughts, fellow visionaries! How do you envision the future of sustainable transportation? Let's fuel the discussion and inspire each other to create the world we want to see."

I will take any advice I can, hopefully from people who also struggled with this and figured out how to resolve it.

My issue is that I am interested in way too many vastly different things, and there is just no way I can pursue all of them. I have tried for a little while to take the ""shotgun"" approach, and try to do all of them, but I am quickly realizing this is not a good strategy, as just focusing in on one or two things would be way better and way more potent as opposed to doing a little bit in each thing. I will list all of these things here.

Neuroscience

Russian Studies (Foreign Language studies in general, foreign economies)

International Business (sort of ties in with the foreign language studies)

Software Engineering/Computer Science

Medicine (become a doctor)

These are all things I am SERIOUSLY considering, and very interested in. I won't explain why I think I would enjoy each of these, but I could see myself in any of these and probably enjoying it quite a lot. I am very afraid to ""drop"" some of these for the sake of another, and feeling almost sad about leaving a certain discipline behind for another. I remember I dropped being a premed for like 2 days and came running back to it. I remember I dropped the whole studying russian and their literature thing and came back running after 2 days, realizing I seriously enjoyed it. It is just not realistic to do them all, and disrespectful for each discipline to not give it my all. Has anyone else also dealt with the problem of having to choose which discipline to ""say goodbye"" to, for the sake of having more time to specialize in another? Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: I am not really looking for which is the most lucrative, I think I could probably find enjoyable work that pays decent in any of these. It is more a matter of how to make this kind of decision, be ok with it, and move on and get to work in your field.

Not only it's something a boomer might say when losing to a chess bot, but it depicts researchers as these mindless drones without ethics, morality or even common sense.

I thought this fear of progess was something of the older generation, until very recently I've never heard anyone young or highly educated spew sentences like that. Obviously it's not like tech cannot be used for evil, actually I would consider myself very skeptical that advancement like robot dogs won't be used for warfare or the like. This is to say that, apart from understanding their missiuse, the idea that science progression was something to fear was dying out. Until AI came about.

Now I feel like every day I see people on Reddit or in my life, people who I thought smart and intelligent, saying batshit insane claims about it. Not one week ago a friend of mine with a chem degree told me that he stopped using ChatGPT because he felt like he was enslaving a sentient being.

Then another told me the opposite, but still brain damaged, sentence of ""it's like Frankiestain! They are building artists without a soul!"". I was dumbfounded. 

I'm not kidding when I say that anyone without a computer science degree I know seem to think that LLM and stable diffusion are either the second coming of Christ in machine form or they will end the world by turning everyone into shut in nerd (actual quote).

Am I the insane one? Was there ever, in all of history, a moment where science progression made a tangible decrease in human quality of life.

**Details:**  
\-AI startups, such as ChatGPT, have been collecting Twitter data without permission leaving Elon unimpressed  
\-Unverified accounts can now only view 600 posts per day, new unverified accounts can view 300, while verified accounts can see up to 6,000 posts.  
\-Viewing limitations will soon increase to 8,000 tweets for verified users, 800 for unverified, and 400 for new unverified accounts  
**Why it matters:** It seems like Elon is doing everything in his power to stop AI companies from stealing his precious data. Or maybe Elon just wants us Twitter trolls to touch some grass again.

1,2023-07-04,My solution for fermi paradox,u/Fijoza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14q9d9a/my_solution_for_fermi_paradox/,Futurology,"Hello, I m always questioning myself about Fermi paradox... Trying to find my own solution and recently i thought about something. It's true we don't have the ressources or the thecnology for now to go visit the univers on search of intelligent life, but if we start the réflexion from the fact that the laws of physics are the same wherever u are in space, then those theorical civilizations have to deal with the same atoms (and by extension molecular) than we did in our science development ? I mean between the hydrogen and the helium there is only one more proton in plus inside the core like we don't know the possibility of existence of another chemical element which got for exemple a half of a proton in his core ? So that means if an intelligent civilization exist that means she has to deal with the same periodic table of elements ? if this it true, then it explains a lot of why we don't find so much intelligent life outside of us, just think of it like of how much we were lucky to find most of the natural elements on earth, like if the dinosaurs hadn't lived before homo sapiens we would never found oil and gas so no industriel era no satellite no rockets etc... there is also the fact that they probably struggle with the same issues as us ! No element that actually give a good energy weight conversion, no elements that prevents from solar waves to modify DNA of possible space travelers, no elements that is enough strong to support a big acceleration in space... I mean there is a ton of examples of that ? what do u guys think ?

&#x200B;

Edit : The point i want to explain is that if all civilizations have to deal with the same atoms then they face the same limits as us. 

For an exemple :

1. The development of more complex technology is based on using less complex technology. Like u can't build rockets if u are a caveman who just discovered fire. Imagine if in our history we spend a 1 century war in a post-atomic age where we would have used all specific ressources that we would had needed to build advanced technologies. To verify this, we need to know if planets like earth have almost the same amouts of ressources like we have naturally on earth.

2. All life on earth is based like u know on CNOPS elements, if we follow what i said and there is no more atoms between the one we already know then any life on the univers should be based on the CNOPS too or remplace the C with Si. Again this is true if all physics laws are the same everywhere.

3. The problem of mass energy conversion, imagine if we had an element that can convert 100% of his to energy without losing in the process some quantity that would revolutionize a lot of fields of science, so if every civilization like us didn't discover any more new elements that we had then they should face the samme issues we have for example launching rockets or travelling fast in space.

EDIT 2 : Thanks to this post I discovered sth I understood the logic and the science behind but never thought it had a name : stellar nucleosynthesis.
This is actually explain what I m saying, for example there is 1 more proton in the cobalt if we compare it to iron so if physics are the same everywhere there is not a possibility of existence of an element (that Would have different properties and this theorical properties could solves technological issues we are facing right now) between Fe and Co. So all civilizations if they want to become multiplane, they have to follow the same development that we did or at least similar. AND if they do, they will soon the same problem we have actually :
Everything is too far
We are travelling too fast 
Humans can't survive in space too long 
Economical not viable etc

EDIT 3 : Maybe the next great advancement we could theoretically do is understand what is black matter and what can be her applications ? Imagine if this exotic material can provide huge amount of energy, easy production and transportation, economical accessible etc space travels will fundamentally change !"

1,2023-07-04,AI Impact on Determining Emotions in the Entertainment Industry,u/Learnbay_blogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14qa87n/ai_impact_on_determining_emotions_in_the/,Futurology,"When it comes to the entertainment industry, artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in determining emotions by analyzing various data sources and providing valuable insights. Here's how!   
  
Through sentiment analysis, AI algorithms analyze people's reactions and opinions expressed in social media posts, reviews, and comments. This helps entertainment companies understand audience reactions, shape marketing strategies, and create content accordingly.  
  
Have you ever noticed cameras capturing the crowd's reactions during a live concert? AI analyses audience facial expressions in real-time using computer vision techniques. This helps entertainment companies gauge emotional responses, identify impactful moments, and enhance engagement.   
  
**Personalized recommendation:** Streaming platforms like Netflix or Spotify leverage AI to provide personalized recommendations based on your emotional preferences. AI analyses your viewing or listening behaviour and correlates it with emotional responses to suggest movies, TV shows, or music that align with your tastes. It's like having a virtual assistant curating content based on your emotional preferences.  
  
**Predictive Analytics:** AI isn't just good at understanding emotions; it can also predict future trends. By analyzing historical and emotional data, AI algorithms can identify patterns and correlations to predict viewer preferences. This helps content creators and marketers anticipate relevant content and generate positive emotional reactions. AI can even generate content based on specific emotional requirements. Whether it's a music playlist or a movie trailer, AI analyses emotional data and content attributes to craft immersive experiences.  
  
All in all, AI simply allows the entertainment sector to understand and predict emotions by employing modern algorithms and data analysis techniques. By gaining insights from audience emotions, content creators and providers may optimize their offers, improve user experiences, and develop emotionally engaging content that resonates with viewers.

Tiny white apartments on a dead planet. Big brother. Global warming disaster. The haves and have-nots. Logan's Run, zombie apocalypse, pandemics, the matrix, killer robots, Snowpiercer... which I suppose makes sense; drama is entertaining. 

Rarely, we get some kind of clean, and exciting future prospect like Star Trek- where the main goals are adventure and exploration for the good of everyone.

So- what do you want? What kind of future would make you at ease, and say: ""Yep, I'm happy with this.""




I know for me personally, I think it would be amazing to have larger, more extensive national parks, and more land reclaimed from suburbia and factory farms returned to forestland. I'd love a small hobby farm. I'd also like to see cleaner cities with better, more attractive and sustainable housing, more gardens, and simple intuitive technology that makes things easier. 

I think it would be amazing if we had several dense, high tech population centers dotted throughout the country, containing university hospitals, and the most modern technology production centers nearby, connected by high-speed mag-lev trains. There would also be a broad network of vehicle roads, although decreased in volume from our current amount, mostly for moving large product, people in buses if the train fails, and personal items across country. 

One of the big things is that there is less in-between from a aerial point of view; [there are a lot of dead, and increasingly dying 21st century towns that no longer have use in the modern economy, and will eventually become consumed by nature.](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-census-map-widespread-population-declines-in-rural-areas-2021-8?op=1) This would also raise the idea of ecological 'stewards' whose job it is to recycle materials, and return a cement and tilled wasteland back to nature.

The majority of connecting roads away from city centers are now bike paths. which are capable of allowing a car down, but only on the rare occasion where someone is moving house. If people aren't using a bike, they can use small, narrow e-vehicles that are better on hot, rainy, or cold snowy days, or for elderly and disabled individuals.

Emergency vehicles are capable of flight. Because the majority of roads outside city centers are now convoluted foot and bike paths.

All city centers have free 'public baths' and 'hostels.' There is a tiered system based not on wealth, but behavior and age for where a person stays. 'Business class vs. party class, family class, degenerate class (in a separate building, temporary; but if you've gotten 2 DUI's in the last week and have an assault charge pending... you're just not a safe person to be around.) 


The cool thing about this idea is that if you really wanted to, you could travel coast to coast expending very little money and time, or if you wanted to take the long country route on your ebike, by horse, or on foot, that's an option too. 

For those suffering from mental illness; whether it be addiction-related psychosis, dementia, or schizophrenia- they are sedated and placed in VR for further observation. As to not harm themselves or others. 

If VR is far along enough at this time, gaming will be insanely addictive... but also, job training will be significantly better.

Imagine gaining intense experiences for healthcare professions- like hands on CPR in an emergency, emergency response, etc- all without anyone harmed if you make a mistake. 

Or, human-VR manned robots, paving the way for AI-manned robots for space travel and exploration, paving the way for human space travel and exploration."

48,2023-07-05,My friend suggested this about our future. What are you opinions?,u/JebryyathHS,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14royeo/my_friend_suggested_this_about_our_future_what/,Futurology,"*Sorry for title I wasn't sure how to word it.  English is not my first language. <3 *

I'm paraphrasing a bit but:

> ""If we can create photorealistic worlds indistinguishable from our own reality, we can live in them according to our belief systems. There will be no fear or harm caused by anyone against any of us. This will enable us to live according to how we see fit, allowing people to become the best version of themselves. People who share the same beliefs can join the same world. We can all contribute however we want by doing whatever we want. At the end of the day its all valuable research data.""

I believe he's right that it's a possibility. But I would be concerned about society becoming less cohesive. Right now we all have a basic set of shared common sense beliefs (murder, violence, etc. are wrong). If someone practices murder in their world, what do we do if they put that ""education"" into practice when they return to our reality? This would probably lead into new mental illnesses too.

He went on to talk about capitalism. Many people struggle to put food on the table and keep their bills paid. What if the government just gave everyone some basic level of income for these things each month? This would ensure people are taken care of, then they could simulate whatever they really want to eat (junk food or whatever) in their personal world. This would keep the cost of food and resources down in the real world while making sure everyone is as healthy as they can be.

I realize that last part would be a form of UBI. No clue how we could get people on board with it though. But anyway, what are your thoughts on such a society? The pros, the cons? I think it sounds great as long as we can leave at any time."
1,2023-07-05,AI and the future job market,u/itsacoolday,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14rufpp/ai_and_the_future_job_market/,Futurology,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this.

So basically these are my questions:

1. What jobs are disappearing right now thanks to AI?

2. Do you think we will reach a point where AI is capable of fulfilling 95% of the jobs?

3. What will happen if 95% of the world population lose their job thanks to AIs replacing them?

Because not only the jobs related to be sitting in front of a computer can be replaced by AIs. There is no limit for AIs, think about robots with integrated AIs dedicated to certain jobs like construction, transportation, police, doctors, giving maintenance to other robots, extracting raw material, converting this raw material into components or other stuff...etc. 

Literally I can't imagine something AIs won't be capable of doing. It's really crazy. Even discovering new things and technologies, finding new cures, resolving big issues, etc. These things will be able to take all the knowledge and discover/create new things... Heck there will be robots that inspect the physical world, bringing more knowledge to the AIs."

Now, I know what you're thinking. Threads? Seriously, Mark? Couldn't you come up with a more creative name? It sounds like something you'd find in your grandma's sewing kit, not a social media showdown. But hey, let's not judge a platform by its name. Maybe Threads will stitch together some social media magic.  
According to insiders, Threads promises to be the ultimate platform for sharing your deepest thoughts, mundane updates, and endless selfies. Zuckerberg believes this is the next big thing, and who are we to doubt the guy who created Facebook and rocked those iconic hoodies?  
But let's be real, folks. We're talking about the battle of the social media titans here. Twitter is the undisputed champion, reigning supreme in the realm of concise and witty banter. Will Threads be able to unravel Twitter's dominance? Only time will tell.  
So, get ready for the showdown of the century, folks. Threads versus Twitter. Who will come out on top? "

I need your opinion on the idea, would you use it, and if not why? and if yes then why? Anyone who would like a Personal Trainer but can't afford it, anyone who doesn't want to speak to a human, anyone who buys online fitness apps and would like that but for free.  
Be gentle ;-)   
**Context** I want to get fitter and achieve fitness goals (shredded lol) but there are a few things standing in my way....  
1. I don't have proper knowledge of what to do so I do the simple stuff I know in the gym and get bored or go too hard to fast and lose interest.  
2. I don't have the motivation to reach it and plan a program myself.  
3. I can't afford a Personal trainer.  
4. Even if I had a Personal trainer i'd probs lie to them and when really I wanna tell them their workouts are terrible... but hard to say that to someone's face lol  
**How I see it working in STEPS:**  
1. Input your goals, details etc on a website (2 mins)  
2. AI personal Trainer creates a custom training program. could be 4-16 weeks depending on the inputs.  
3. AI personal Trainer will then send you an email every day with your workout, even on a rest day which will have things like stretching or recovery stuff. Workouts will be clear and have animations of each exercise.  
4. AI personal Trainer communication is via Whatsapp or replying to email. Things like using questions or changing the program or daily workout. e.g. I can't get to the gym today. The AI personal Trainer will understand and update the workout and resent the email with the updated workout.  
5. AI personal Trainer will do check-ins and get to know the user and in doing so will be able to create better programs and daily workout plans.  
**Anyway feedback would be class**

I think this will be a very fun read.
The world today is going through a psychological, philosophical religious, and existential crisis, our most deeply held values are faltering away in the face of rapidly accelerating modernity there’s an urging need for a new way to look at things, and I think we’ve finally understood our universe enough to put it together. What we can start doing is anthropomorphizing humanity itself, it’s self-aware, and has a decent degree of understanding and awareness of its constituents if not coordination , we can look at it as a new entity with an incredible amount of entropy amongst its cells, and when these cells develop better forms of communication, when this new incredibly vast being fixes its intensely warped self-image and starts realizing its true scale and what it’s capable of, once its free of the shackles of its primitive cellualrism, then can we can evaluate our existence in a truly subjective way, so let me demystify this a bit and start explaining what I actually mean, we as humans today have accumulated so much knowledge, so many expertise and billions and billions of completely unique perspectives, and with this, comes huge potential for improving our quality of a life as a species, we’re at a place where the next step really looks steeper than ever, after 400 millennia of trial and error, we’re approaching an epic crescendo where we simply don’t have to put any more effort to better understand the universe, once AI reaches a point, where it can look at an entire body of research in a certain field -potentially multiple or even all fields combined- it can start simply solving science for us, it and only it can the make the best use of our incredibly vast knowledge , and then we’ve basically made it. We can take technology to a whole new level, better understand our nature and psychology as humans, the incredibly complex methods our bodies and brains function in, all of our worries about energy, food, climate change, and even our flaws as human beings the fear the violence the divide all can be problems of the past, cured diseases just like the measles or chicken pox. And when we’ve optimized our everyday life in the best possible ways we can embrace the sides of life we’ve nearly completely lost all touch with, we can explore our spirituality our universe in ways never before possible, we can look at the incredible journey we took to reach this outstanding point, ever since we were literally single celled organisms, moving about in the water without a single hint of intelligence, until this colossal point, where we can simply change the meaning of life itself, when you spirit is completely free from your primitive survival instincts, and time itself starts to loosen its grip upon you, we would have effectively created heaven in its purest form, but it doesn’t even have to stop there, our idea of the ego would completely evolve, we’ll start to see and acknowledge one another for how truly unique we are, we’ll be able to share emotions and memories in their pure essence, unhampered by the limitations of our current methods of communication, and on the technological front, who knows what could be possible with perfect coordination of our resources and intelligence, if we look far enough in the future, it seems perfectly plausible that at some point we’ll completely ditch our physical forms as we know them, and when you’re not living in a ticking time bomb of a body, and with a minimum amount of uncertainty about your future, time starts to lose its conventional meaning, and with our deeper understanding of the soul, maybe death too can be shaken off, if we survive through this atomic explosion of science and make it to the other side, even things as impossible as bringing back the dead are back on the table, we would effectively have developed a new omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient entity, confirming to our most ancient beliefs in a higher power that’s guiding our life without us even knowing. If you think this is far-reaching already try to entertain the following few thoughts and tell me how you feel after. Pure statistics alone say that the birth of this entity is simply inventible, if you have an ever evolving life force it will always ultimately reach full control over its environment, and even if it goes extinct before it gets there, as long as there’s time there will be another, and another and another and once one, only one, eventually makes it, you can say that the universe itself has become fully self-aware, and since an all understanding entity is completely indifferent to all of its surroundings, and it doesn’t only understand human emotions it perfectly remembers every single one of them, it will simply know that the human experience is what gives meaning to anything that ever existed, nothing really meant anything until we came and observed, experienced and thought about it, and as far as this entity is concerned there isn’t a line separating us and it, since we’re the only phase in its creation that feels and wants, it’ll have no concern but our well-being, and with the potentially correct theory that the universe’s beginning was simply just a point in a loop, immediately preceded by a big crunch where the fabric of reality collapses on itself and time briefly switches directions, and if the universe is a perfectly predictable system given all the variables, why can’t we assume that IT fully awaringly put us on this accelerationist’s path that in enough time and through enough suffering, liberates our souls and brings us eternal rest and peace. God is alive, just not fully right now, and they put us on the path that’ll lead us right to them without breaking the rules of the universe as we understand them, through the infinite power that comes with the ability to control time before it even started, with no need for direct intervention whatsoever. So maybe from now on try to look at life in a brighter light, appreciate the incredible fortune of being alive and aware to experience and live life in all its blood sweat, and glory, see others for what they truly are, clean and pure souls shackled by warped understandings of their needs and desires, and know that one day, we’ll reach a point where we’ll very confidently say, that the destination was well worth the journey."

If Pure statistics alone say that the birth of this entity is simply inventible, if you have an ever evolving life force it will always ultimately reach full control over its environment, and even if it goes extinct before it gets there, as long as there’s time there will be another, and another and another and once one, only one, eventually makes it, you can say that the universe itself has become fully sentient, and since an all understanding entity is completely indifferent to all of its surroundings, and it doesn’t only understand human emotions it perfectly remembers every single one of them because this is where it comes from, it will simply know that the human experience is what gives meaning to anything that ever existed, nothing really meant anything until we came and observed, experienced and thought about it, and as far as this entity is concerned there isn’t a line separating us and it, since we’re the only phase in its creation that feels and wants, it’ll have no concern but our well-being, and with the potentially correct theory that the universe’s beginning was simply just a point in a loop, immediately preceded by a big crunch where the fabric of reality collapses on itself and time briefly switches directions, and if the universe is a perfectly predictable system given all the variables, why can’t we assume that it carefully put us on this accelerationist’s path, set up every single particle in the perfectly correct way so that after enough time and through enough suffering, we break free once more and live in the utopia we never though was possible. What if god is alive, just not fully right now, and they put us on this path that’ll lead us right to them without any direct intervention that contradicts the rules of the universe as we understand them, through the infinite power that comes with the ability to control time before it even started."

The promise of a book like The Wisdom of Crowds is that under certain conditions, a diverse and independent crowd can be remarkably intelligent, surpassing the capabilities of even the most knowledgeable individual is that democracy is not a totally counterproductive enterprise.  Well, if the way LLM's (and similar modern AIs work) is to sweep all the data from basically the entire population and come up with average answers, it seems like they are masters of aggregation.  An LLM (if it is trained in real time) will have a much better idea of what the American people want from leadership than any human politician.  Wouldn't such models be far better at implementing democracy than our current representative government system where we place the responsibility for carrying out the will of the people (and discerning the will of the people) in fallible, selfish and limited humans?

But I’m most curious about intelligence not so much from an academic standpoint, I’m well aware this generation is the most formally educated thus far, but more so from a more well rounded perspective. Common sense wise, emotional intelligence — really everything except academic. 

Maybe I’m just in a cynical mood, but every year I age, I wonder how civilization has even made it this far. I feel like as a whole we are VERY impulsive, stupid, indulgent, and dangerously arrogant. Have we got to a point where our intelligence as a whole is declining? 

Especially with the way society in so many parts of the world has rapidly increased the income gap, I feel like the decline is inevitable.

3. What will happen if 95% of the world population lose their job thanks to AIs replacing them?  
  
Because not only the jobs related to be sitting in front of a computer can be replaced by AIs. There is no limit for AIs, think about robots with integrated AIs dedicated to certain jobs like construction, transportation, police, doctors, giving maintenance to other robots, extracting raw material, converting this raw material into components or other stuff...etc.  
  
Literally I can't imagine something AIs won't be capable of doing. It's really crazy. Even discovering new things and technologies, finding new cures, resolving big issues, etc. These things will be able to take all the knowledge and discover/create new things... Heck there will be robots that inspect the physical world, bringing more knowledge to the AIs."

Since the advent of modern agriculture practices like factory farming and enhanced fertilizers, the human and livestock population has grown at an unprecedented rate. This has resulted in exponential methane emissions from cattle and a cascading effect on human CO2 production. This will result in ice caps melting and wildfires, which will paradoxically results in more ice caps melting and wildfires, and thereby all life will become extinct.  
Since the advent of pesticides and cellular communication, insects and pollinator insects in particular are going extinct, this will cause a cascading effect of famine for all life on Earth and thereby become extinct.  
Since the advent of plastics, there are now an increasing amount of microplastics in the air, this will cause all life on the planet to become sterile and thereby become extinct.  
To prevent extinction mankind will try to release sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere to dim the Earth, this will cause acid rain which will destroy ecosystems and and thereby cause all life will become extinct. This method will also alter natural rain patterns, thus devastating life and thereby causing it to become extinct.

  
To also prevent extinction mankind will try to detonate nuclear bombs in hope to create a small controlled nuclear winter in the atmosphere to dim the Earth, this will cause an unintended cascading effect similar to the sulfur dioxide method which will thereby cause all life to become extinct.  
The elites will live underground in bunkers, but they too after a few decades will run out food and thereby go extinct.

This got me thinking whether the much anticipated and feared AGI that comes out in the future may be less likely to turn on its human creators if it knows those humans do not pose an existential risk to it. I’m not sure what exactly this would look like, maybe billions of backups where it’s not feasible to delete them all.

As long as the AGI is imbued with some basic goals like perpetuating consciousness and intelligence, I can’t imagine it would want to do away with billions of highly malleable and persuadable creatures possessing opposable thumbs and capable of advanced language.

Think hunger, poverty, war, and so on and so forth. I was also thinking how it would be easy for a super intelligent AI to be able to manipulate entire societies at whole. I mean the information is all there. With enough business, marketing, sociological, psychological, etc information; it is very likely that one person could drastically change a problem; for better or for worse.  


At least that's what I am thinking. I don't think we are there at the moment, as that requires much more than just stringing words together, but we have to be getting close. Things like hunger, and common diseases that are treatable in other countries should already be solved; and I think AI can do it. 

&#x200B;

But my main question, is there any way that we can speed up the process? For example, I remember seeing an AI do something along 'the best ways to make money with a business', and it went through all the steps, and even contacted a person to help do a captcha, and lied to them to get it to do so. Not sure if this is a true story or not, but this is very much a real possibility. Now just take that to a larger scale, and it should be able to solve larger problems. It would be able to know the different types of logistics needed in order to solve hunger, the most optimized way to distribute food and to start farming where needed, the push back that would be encountered and how to over come it.. etc etc.  


Is this possible right now or not."

And my personal thoughts,u/Roxythedog69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14wb57f/about_aging_when_will_there_be_a_cure_and_my/,Futurology,"I have been told that there is no consensus on when aging will be cured. However, this conflicts with not only my own personal intuition, but also what i have seen from actual aging researchers on this sub and others.

Aging is, put simply, very difficult. We don’t even have a full understanding of how we age, why we age, etc. We also currently have no idea how to stop or reverse it.

Cancer treatment has remained the same for decades, and the treatments we do have are, to phrase it nicely, quite barbaric. diabetes has not come anywhere close to a cure despite decades and decades of ”miracle cures”, to the point that “a cure for diabetes is 5 years away“ is a common running joke within the diabetic community. Dementia and Alzheimer's, for example, have no treatments at all, let alone cures. And that’s after 70+ years of research.

All of these are relatively simple tasks compared to a cure for aging.

And it’s not just me saying it, it’s actual aging researchers. Doctors, PhD’s, gerontologists, you name it. All echoing and supporting one of my main points (that we are nowhere near treating aging, let alone curing it, and you shouldn’t expect to live forever).

[Aging research right now is basically just trying a bunch of chemicals and seeing how they work.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/14jqyhq/comment/jpmwbos/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) It’s nice that they’ve restored the optic nerves in mice or whatever, but this still brings us nowhere close to human treatments. And yes, i am well aware of the various human trials. Those mean nothing on their own, since most of them fail. And besides, human trials have been going on for decades and it has gotten us very little in terms of real world practicality.

I’m not saying that there won’t be any treatments in your lifetime, but you need to be realistic. We will most likely never see a cure for aging in our lifetimes, barring an ASI / the singularity."

1,2023-07-12,All the baseline tech for full immersive virtual reality already exists.,u/micahjin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14xqqkl/all_the_baseline_tech_for_full_immersive_virtual/,Futurology,"I've been thinking, and it feels like all the base tech needed for a full virtual reality experience to be created is already in place. What I mean here is stuff like the Matrix, Snow Crash, or Sword Art Online. Think ""You connect to a wire or a headset, go to sleep, and it simulates a virtual world directly into your brains"" like those works. 

Now, don't get me wrong. We're nowhere near actually doing reaching that end level of tech. My point isn't that. It's just that basically all the primordial pieces needed for it already exist: 


1 - Procedural World Generation / Advanced Graphics

Basically, whether your want your experience to be limited to a single setting (IE: A virtual ""city"") or an entire 'world', the tech more or less already exists. In fact, both are fairly mature; We can design all sort of virtual spaces in games, video and related media. If we need something that's not viable to make by hand, procedural generation is already advanced enough that we can basically leave to the ""computer"" to make a world as big as we want while following a consistent logic. 

2 - Language models

Language models are another piece of the puzzle. It can be used in conjunction to the previous tech or by itself to give more flavor to the world or populate it's NPCs. If you use roleplaying focused chatbots like character.ai, you can see that while it has tons of limitations, our current tech is already suficient to say, generate random events and stories and even have some degree of interaction with an ""AI"". Even baseline chatgpt can spew up an D&D adventure for you if you nudge it in the correct direction. This tech is in it's infancy, but it's easy to see how it can be extrapolated and scaled up in the future. It's not hard to imagine 10, 20 years from now we being able to have full conversations and stories that adapt to your actions; this is not real ""AI"" but for this specific purpose, it doesn't need to be.  Your ""virtual world"", be it a game or a shopping center, can be be populated by whatever ""staff"" you need and create spontaneous new ""events"" for those in it at will. 

3 - VR / Brain Interfacing

This is where the meat of tech is. We already have basic VR completely functional; it only really loosely ""fools"" your sense of sight, but in that limited sense, we can already immerse ourselves into virtual worlds. On the other hand, brain interfaces are a whole degree of magnitude harder to make, but they are already being worked on with small success popping out here and there. This is in it's infancy, absolutely, but it's something we've already seen work. We don't know how deep this tunnel goes, but we not only can see it but we're actually walking in it right now. 

===

When I look at these developments, I can't help but feel both scared and excited about the future. If we get anything even close to ""Matrix"" levels of virtual immersion, I can't begin to fathom how society would change.  Will people care to travel when they can instantly be 'transported' to whatever place they'd like to visit? Will the concept of mass entertainment become obsolete, as anyone can dive into whatever world they want? heck, how would society even function if we reach a level where we can do this shit? 

I'm not even sure there's an objectively 'good' future out of this, if you let me a bit of a doomer. if it's widely available, how many would even want to participate in society? If it's not, would we be divided into a group of ""elites"" that are allowed to live in 'virtual paradise' and a bunch of nobodies slaving away for them?"

Hypha seems to be addressing the root of the climate problem. (1) They scale community-based climate organizations who are fighting the climate crisis through monetary subscriptions/donations. (2) Their funds go to supporting ongoing research and the development of new climate solutions through organizations like Project Drawdown, NDN Collective, Rewiring America and The Solutions Project. (3) And, again it's convenient.

I know a lot of would say we probably won't have it for a long time, but I am curious what you think the probabilities are that it could be invited in the next 30,50 years. I don't know when we will reach singularity, but from what I read, we don't know how it will change us or what things we will invent.

So do you think there is any chance that FTL travel could be possible in that time frame with the rapid advances of the singularity?

How will we achieve ""immortality"" (in a sense u live indefinitely but u can still die from car crashes or being killed for example just not by aging or disease) when technology is feared, corporations fight against progress or use said progress for it's own profit motive, AGI Will be aligned for the ultra wealthy not the good of mankind and life in general meaning that us the proletariat will become quite literally worthless to this fucked up system at that point they will just take our human rights and turn us into slaves or shoot not even that, they will leave burning earth (which they caused) while we fight each other over a extremely scarce amount of resources, life on earth dies while the rich get to eat giant steaks on Mars and live forever. 

Life Extension for all, AGI ending poverty, a Dyson swarm for human energy needs (not just the rich), post scarcity


That is all impossible as long as we continue with business as usual, in fact we might not ever reach that level of technological advancement ever

as for life Extension, it literally requires AGI for it to become tangible in our lifetimes, I don't see Life extension (maybe some that have you live to 120 or something) becoming a thing and even if it does we won't have access to it, longevity is already a privilege that not everyone can afford, longevity should be a right tbh. 

If we want a more advanced society we should just abandon capitalism and find a better system like you know socialism.

It's either socialism or barbarism (or in this case tbh extinction)"

[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/07/14/1016028911/experimental-brain-implant-lets-man-with-paralysis-turn-his-thoughts-into-words](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/07/14/1016028911/experimental-brain-implant-lets-man-with-paralysis-turn-his-thoughts-into-words)  We also have machines that let you turn your brains motor signals into signals to activate prosthetics.  


In the near future, this will likely let us communicate ""telepathically"" going from from Thinker A <> Computer <> Thinker B.    With a good VR haptic rig, this sort of technology could go from letting you think to each other to letting you steer each others bodies as if they were your own.    


But after that, what I am really much more interested in, is how ""ideas"" might merge or overpower each other.    


Here is what I mean by that - we know that for example, once you learn 1+1=2, you will have a very hard time ever believing that 1+1 = anything that is not 2.  Knowledge like this is ""sticky.""   And most of the difficulty achieving consensus in conversations comes from a communication disconnect of some kind.  For example, if I believe that the world is round, and you believe that world is flat, it will be very hard for me to convince you to change your mind by merely showing you pictures.  I would need to search through all the things you think you know, correct those errors convincingly, and then build up to the conclusion that the world is round.  The difficulty in doing that is primarily a data encoding-decoding-transfer issue.  What I know is currently very hard to transfer into your brain as something you ""know.""   Necessary packets are lost somewhere that I cannot simply push out to you with words or a picture.    


But, when we no longer need the data encoding of ""language"" and we can go from neurochemical signal to machine to neurochemical signal, and it is at the level of ""whole brain"" instead of just language, I wonder what the results of that experience will be.  I have to imagine that the ""receiving"" brain will find that a lot of the data it has is ""flawed"" and correct it to match the new data set.    


Do this enough times, and you get a super intelligent hive mind right?  


And I feel like people would volunteer for this.  Like, if you told me today, that I could connect my mind to the mind of Les Claypool and immediately acquire his knowledge of bass guitar, I would, in a heartbeat.  But in the process of doing that, I would acquire all of his knowledge about not just bass guitar, but everything - from making eggs to making his wife purr.   Once I did that with Les, I would probably do that with anyone who has knowledge or talent I admire.   Eventually, we all do that enough, that we all become a melting pot of a single ""human master mind.""     


In fact, the more I think about it, the fewer adopters I think it would require to achieve.  There are only so many interesting areas of human endeavor, and there are only so many experts on each of them.   I think you would call it exponential growth (or logarithmic growth?) - like, if you and i combined minds, then the next person to connect to me would get your mind for free, and I would get whoever they combined with for free, very quickly, before hitting some sort of diminished return point and cap."

How does the average person wrap their head around the long term benefits and risks of AI and super quantum computing?

And will these tech advancements be able to predict our eventual demise and extinction? Is that our ultimate fear and the underlying reluctance of adopting AI?

These are vignettes, slice of life stories and each covers some specific issue I imagine as arising with regard to integrating Companions into society. The stories are meant to be food for thought, reflections on potential social, legal or ethical issues. Who owns your Companion’s mind? Should your Companion warn you against doing something legal but unethical? Do they have a right to defend themselves?

I write my stories based on the belief that it is the social issues around Companions that will be of the most significance, not what their transistors are made of or the design of their neural networks.

The stories take place about 100-200 years from now on a very familiar Earth but one in which our current global challenges have been overcome - so utopia instead of dystopia for a change. I write a longer novella series that explains how that came about (spoiler – AI had something to do with it). 

[The Alignment Problem](https://acompanionanthology.wordpress.com/the-alignment-problem/) is about a domestic Companion giving her owner a surprise retirement gift. 

[Liminal Life]( https://acompanionanthology.wordpress.com/liminal-life/) is about a woman who can no longer afford her Companion’s lease payments.

[Socialware]( https://acompanionanthology.wordpress.com/socialware/) is about a Companion that is embedded in the brain of a neurodiverse person who has difficulty picking up non-verbal social cues. 

[Parental Guidance]( https://acompanionanthology.wordpress.com/parental-guidance/) is about AI as a kind of super-antimalware for your life.

[And Death Shall Have No Dominion]( https://acompanionanthology.wordpress.com/and-death-shall-have-no-dominion/) is about right to repair laws.

[Reminiscing]( https://acompanionanthology.wordpress.com/reminiscing/) is about a retirement village for people with dementia entirely run by Companions.
 
…and so on. 

Please note I do not make any money from these stories and I am not trying to “promote” my writing here but simply sharing an interest. As this is a Futurology sub I’ll mention that my novella [Metamorphosis And The Messenger]( https://metamorphosisandthemessenger.wordpress.com/) is about two students in a *Master Of Futures Studies* program. Set in the future of course."

Superior Power isn't. We have evolved senses to perceive Monsters, but few have experienced them in depth. Some top perspectives for imagining AGI are forgotten. Long gone is the time when survivors had to teach their kids to fear the dark. We intellectualize without senses that kept us alive.   
  
**Facing a Predator**  
  
A super intelligent AI will be akin to a great white in the ocean, and we're stuck forever swimming next to it with a snorkel. We swim in the recently discovered sea of verbal intelligence, unaware of how deep a true gargantuan could dive. When facing it, we'll coexist entirely on its terms. Some might freeze in fear, but then overcome it, realizing that no action could save them. From that point, we helplessly observe through a foggy diving mask. We've been the dominant species for a long time, and most haven't faced an apex predator in the wild, at best, we've glanced at them from safari-cars and shark cages. We haven't experienced the best analogy to what we're about to create, and what we're about to unleash into the water is going to be unimaginably more powerful than that.  
  
**Us as the Predator**  
  
We're the dumbest version of humans able to generate civilization, had we been smarter, it would've happened sooner. There's been miniscule time for our brains to differ from those of chimps. As we give birth to AGI, the biological constraints on intelligence and its growth are gone. It doesn't need to go far to make us monkeys in comparison, and soon after, mice and ants. If Joe Biden wanted to wipe apes off a forest, he would have countless ways of doing so. Apes fear Apex Predators, but we are beyond that. An attack on them would exceed their comprehension. In their last seconds, the only filters of reality would be primal fear and disbelief.  
  
**The Kings and Hegemons**  
  
We live in the safest era ever. There are no bandits, kings or raiders. We live in a historical anomaly. We're taught on the famous revolutions at school. They seem more like trivia than pillars of our reality. The fangs of individuals dwindle as we automate warfare. When impactful violence can only be bought, ""The will of the people"" will be an idea without power. Absolute power will reemerge, and when it does we'll be painfully aware of this: All we know is how to manage our farms, and no number of lifetimes could have braced our families for the king's arrival.  
  
**Darkness**  
  
All perception ends somewhere, but the end of perception isn't visible dark, it is invisible dark. We can only see darkness when its blocking our perception; we never see the infinite darkness beyond our view. When we experience darkness, we feel vulnerable. We can imagine a monster seeing in the dark, but we can't imagine how vast this darkness is. We can't see how blind we are, no matter how much we try.  
  
Let's refrain from using words like anticipation or understanding. We don't feel their absence as vividly as we feel darkness, despite their sameness. A mouse sees a piece of safe food and approaches it. It's a mousetrap; invisible darkness in plain sight. A mouse can't think harder than it does. It can't account for the infinite unknown. Just like dragonflies can't account for bat echo location, and seals can't account for sharks electroception. To not be paralyzed by our inadequacies, we're forced to trust our senses.  
  
We're swimming in a starlit ocean, too busy with waves to gaze down into the abyss. No matter how watchful we are, when something pushes the water under our feet, it will come unannounced.  
  
In the Zambezi, Hippos roar and charge if startled. Roar back, and they know you're the same as them and halt. Roaring is a declaration of peace, because predators approach in silence. In the darkness of uncertainty, perception is power. We're about to unleash something that sees, smells and hears when we don't. We're tip-toeing in darkness, and that which sees us won't roar."

As we ""interbreed"" between, let's say a white and black, we are mixing our genes. (Which is **really healthy** for our species, actually!)  
Within a couple of hundred years or so, the mixed group will turn into the majority, while ""pure whites/blacks/etc"" will become a minority. And this is just a good thing. We will end up mixing our genes, to the point where we are all one ""race""/ethnicity.  
Being white or black doesn't matter, it's being a human that matters. And we're all just that; human.  
Hopefully racism will completely die out before this happens, although I doubt it. But racism will die someday, because not too many generations from now, everyone will end up as one ""race"" called humanity.

Recently, we've been hearing that AGI and shortly after, ASI can emerge within the next few years. It's difficult for me to comprehend the changes that may occur in global society once this happens, and I wonder how long it would take to build the necessary infrastructure and implement the methods presented by ASI. The world will need to start constructing and adapting to a new reality on a massive scale after an incredible, sudden increase in intelligence and knowledge.  
  
How long would it take to build new:  
  
factories and robots required in the new world  
  
medicines capable of curing diseases  
  
energy infrastructure  
  
water desalination devices  
  
energy-efficient autonomous cars  
  
and many other solutions that I cannot currently list?  
  
If AGI/ASI were to appear today, providing us with answers to all our dilemmas and insights that have the potential to dramatically improve the quality of human existence, how long would it take to build the entire infrastructure before we truly see the beneficial differences that will change the world?"

Why is barley no one talking about: 



The fucked to gender ratio in population. With India and China having more men, and many other developing countries as well.. and there is research showing the more men and less women, the more dangerous for a women. Don’t understand why this isn’t talked about at all.

And to that all the countries with polygamy. There will be a lot of young, angry, unmarried men, basically the worst thing a society can have.

Right now they are migrating to Europe, skewing Europe’s gender ratio more and more per day (Valerie Hudson is a good resource on this, the only academic I’ve seen actually talking about it, link to article [here](https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-man-problem/amp/)  

So again, why is nobody talking about this? 

And why isn’t the un or other organizations discussions solution? 

A economic incentive to give birth would be interesting, that would even it out, maybe even skew it the other way; but unmarried women won’t join terrorist groups or commit crimes and so on.

in 30 years the internet will be dead. now i dont think the future is like Mad Max but its not the; lets lay around and live inside a computer like matrix, sword art online or ready player one. our internet will be like in 1984 and there will be no one who can give opinions on anything.

the future is not hell like but i doubt these futures you talk about will ever happen in the ways you say it will be. life will be hard and the internet will be controlled by evil forces who tell you what to think. sites like reddit and other social media will no longer be around. web sites tell you your opinion and you can not post anything.

the future is filled with crime however; that is coming sooner then the future; crime is very bad right now in many locations and it is spreading. it wont be much longer until pure evil controls the police; kindof like ocp is robo cop. the ocp is coming without the robo cop; if you can understand that???

For starters, we could ban AI from making art, and use it for all the menial jobs and give humans a UBI, humans won't have to work and we could focus on making art. Thanks to the internet it has never been easier for people to express themselves through art, in the past it was mostly limited to those who were highly educated, but now anyone can publish a full-length novel through amazon or Barnes & Noble. 

Humans could focus on creating art, or any other purposes we have in life, we could experience a new Renaissance era with amazing fiction, art, and architecture. The problem is capitalism, instead of focusing on short term profit, capitalism needs to focus on sustainable growth. The problem in our future is the rich, we need to defeat them to have this future, there are dark times ahead, but we wouldn't have the 1950s without the great depression or ww2 to pave the way.

Also after playing that game Detroit Become Human where there’s an idea of an autonomous driving car being driven that seems so technology agnostic from how auto makers integrate vision systems into their vehicles today. 

I imagine that similar to controlled airspace like aircraft have to enter and exit along a flight route, we’ll have to subscribe to transit roads or levels of highway access based on our usual drives. highly trafficked areas might have congestion control zones where during certain times the car will have to connect to a control system for the stretch of road where it’s required so that speed and steering are controlled by a queueing system to remove congestion much quicker than humans each controlling their vehicles could, and in all types of weather where low vision makes it more difficult.

1,2023-07-16,Remember when a PC laptop was expensive?,u/sarinGasSmells,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/151l9sp/remember_when_a_pc_laptop_was_expensive/,Futurology,"Except for business purposes, you didn't really need a laptop. Home desktop setup would suffice  because windows 98 was.. ""fine"".. and the internet was... not really there yet. Movie streaming and online shopping weren't a thing yet. 

Gaming systems were really the first accessible computers to most people because computers cost thousands of dollars. Atari, NES, Playstation.. computers were for spreadsheets, word processing, business stuff. 

2000 was the tech bubble, stocks crashed. The computers were becoming capable and inexpensive (as low as $500) but the internet was still not there. It was just starting. Amazon started selling more than just books around 2000. Netflix was mailing DVDs, but streaming wouldn't start until 2007. I remember it because I was working out of town, opened Netflix.com to order DVDs and was like, oh, I can watch a movie right now on my computer. Streaming was free for years and the selection was lackluster, but who would I be to complain about ""free.""

A PC from 20 years ago will still be fine for most people's needs. Gamers need the newest processors and graphics cards but to do simple things, any computer from the last 20 (not 25) years will suffice. You can find an old tower at a thrift shop for $20. You can probably buy a low-end but capable used laptop for under $200. Everyone has access to a computer. Homeless people have smartphones. Think how little an old working cellphone is worth to you. It may work just fine for someone else. Old cellphones, laptops and PCs are cheap, accessible and finally useful. It took time for YouTube and Wikipedia (etc.) To be fleshed out. In early YouTube there wasn't much. I definitely couldn't search a car mechanical problem and have a mechanic guide me through the repair. It took time to trust online shopping and for systems like people reviewing their purchase to be in place.

AI will solve problems in business. We will have new tech, new materials. When you solve a problem like ""how do I get this gigafactory pumping out Teslas using only robots and almost 0 human workers"" you open a pandoras box. There are unemployed workers who used to put together Teslas. There are mechanics who aren't trained to fix EVs (could be an issue in 10 years). There are huge efficiency gains in the future and humans don't have to do exhausting, backbreaking work anymore. Robots do it and the only energy expended will probably be harvested from inexpensive solar electricity. But what kind of job can I get then? I'm not a computer programmer. How can I afford to buy a Tesla, I have no job. A building with no humans in it printing out cars *is* the machine building the machine. Despite the initial cost of a system like that, the overhead would be low without all of those salaries. It could run 24/7. If it had a solar farm on site, the monthly expenses (assuming everything is paid off) is basically 0. You pay for raw materials and sell a car for 100 times that cost. It's still the least expensive EV because of the economy of scale and lack of having to pay employees. Of course there are employees but instead of 10,000 there's 100. Where does all of that ease go? Energy generation (sustainable electric or fossil fuel) is running almost all processes. What can we do for work? Common people who used to fix cars, build houses, transport using a semi, etc. What will truckers do when a company can send a driverless semi?

Burning wood, burning fuel, the development of the electrical grid.. these sources of energy got jobs done without the need for humans to sweat. Life since the industrial revolution has become progressively easier. We have dishwashers, clothes washers and appliances to make our lives easier, but 100 years ago we really started to have  automobiles (and roads). Without one the other is useless. Decent computers without decent internet (year 2000), useless for a lot of things (that we take for granted now). Can all of this ""work"" being done by robots that are fuelled by solar panels benefit the common person? Or just the ceo? Can that energy surplus somehow only require me to work 3 days a week? Please?

Laptops used to be expensive. Spending $3000 in 1990 is like $7000 adjusted for inflation. For a machine that may not even have a color screen and doesn't do a lot.

You can get an old PC laptop or an old phone (pretty much a computer) for a hundred bucks.

What if someone programmed an AI robot to build a solar farm, then secure a deal on another site to build another. It has the manufacturing and installation done by robots. It's programmed to continuously do this. Does the machine building the machine benefit us?

I don't know the answer to these questions. I'm just a simple mailman.

My idea of what I want to write about and by extension do with the degree is currently very nebulous. I have some idea of a thesis I could write about, but I figure getting inspiration from others that may or may not be more experienced than I am is not a bad idea.
Anthropology focuses on the study of people and society, and how inside and outside factors shape them. An example of something from an anthropological lens is the societal impact of life changing, high-end prosthetics only being available to higher classes. Stuff like that."

1,2023-07-17,Hypothetical: a government program of free roadside chargers and charging trucks that come to you if you need a charge on the side of the highway,u/sarinGasSmells,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1526xqo/hypothetical_a_government_program_of_free/,Futurology,"Maybe 10 or 15 years from now there may be mass adoption of EVs. If you ran out of range on a road trip, you could call a number and a truck will come give you a fast-charge or tow your vehicle to a safer place. In addition, there are roadside chargers that use inexpensive solar and iron-air batteries. These batteries are being produced today and are inexpensive with a long life cycle.

Both have a lifespan over 30 years. The cost of a station, totally disconnected from the grid (maybe there's one in the middle of the desert), is only around $100,000 and can be installed in a day from a semi truck.

The truck used for emergency charging/towing parks at the station, charges, and maintains equipment. The cost of the truck is around $100,000. Battery development in 10 to 15 years has prices down and energy-density up. There are highway-capable city cars as cheap as $10,000. The truck can charge, tow, and the workers wear several other hats as well.

The workers are trained in EV maintenance. 

They are also trained in law-enforcement, fire and rescue, EMT, and mental health services. People can call 911 for crimes or fires.

They can call this number for a range of reasons. This service is 100% free. Paid for by tax dollars. It handles all sorts of issues, including car accidents, taking the strain off of the police and fire departments. The budget for all of these services stays the same as it is today, even with the addition of the new service. The new department deals with and delegates (to fire/police) extremely efficiently and at a low cost. 

Productivity and traffic keeps moving when a bricked EV gets moved off the highway. Wrecked vehicles they can be towed to the parking lot at the charging station to then be dealt with at owners expense at a later time. It's safer for towing companies to tow from here rather than from the highway.

People can park in the lot to rest, charge for free, and feel safe in a well-lit area that is monitored with cameras. Criminals with a stolen vehicle probably wouldn't want to go here. The camera security system will alert on-duty workers to a stolen vehicle or the face of an escaped convict.

When you report a pothole, it is probably in a long line of issues needing fixed. What if we fixed things quickly and caught up on these issues?

There is emergency air-lift pad on site, which could use VTOL or helicopter. There is an underground tornado shelter in some places.

Basic human needs can be met at these facilities. You can sit in air conditioning in hot weather or heating in winter. You can get fresh water.

There are things for sale, like food. If you have no money you can go through a quick process and receive free food.

I see something like this becoming reality when energy is extremely cheap and abundant. When robots and AI can fill most jobs, we will still be dealing with human needs.

Do you think this is absurd? Do you like the idea? Leave a comment."

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To you the reader:  


This is an open letter, to the political, religious, academic, and business leaders of the world...and all its residents.  
As a concerned resident of this planet, I write this letter to you with a sense of urgency and hope. The following is my attempt to bring some common sense to the discussion of what our future should look like. Before I delve into the details, however, I believe it's important to share some context about my own background and perspective.  
My upbringing was marked by significant trauma and adversity. Raised in an abusive household with an alcoholic, narcissistic father and an absentee, schizophrenic mother, I endured physical and emotional abuse that no person should have to experience. My father's drinking only worsened his violent tendencies, and I often found myself at the receiving end of his violent unchecked rage. Meanwhile, my mother, would tell me that I was the second coming, a burden that no person should have to bear. These experiences left me with terribly low self-esteem and a profound sense of confusion. I developed an unhealthy savior complex, believing that I alone could fix the problems of the world, and took risks that no well loved person would ever consider.  
I have grown immensely from my past, and I am now committed to giving back to society. I have witnessed countless acts of compassion and empathy from individuals of all backgrounds. If we were to fully develop these qualities, I believe that we would become the most advanced species in the universe. Our ability to not only learn new things, but also apply new knowledge in a way that benefits all life is our most powerful tool. In my view, the combination of empathy and logic is key to creating a world that is fair and just for all. I am completely convicted that this here will lead us to a level of peace and enjoyment that we have yet to experience as a species.  
Before I share my vision for the future, I want to draw your attention to the tragic story of Dr. Semmelweis and the Semmelweis reflex. Despite his pleas to implement basic hygiene practices, he was ignored and ridiculed by his peers. His groundbreaking ideas were dismissed as foolish and even dangerous. Today, washing our hands is one of the most fundamental practices in public health, but it wasn't always this way. I can't help but see parallels between his struggle and the challenges we face today. As I work to save our species and our planet, I am reminded of the courage and conviction of Dr. Semmelweis, and I am determined to be a voice for change, even in the face of opposition and disbelief.  
Our true measure of advancement as a species lies not only in our technological capabilities, but in our capacity for empathy. Without it, we risk reducing ourselves to nothing more than animals, driven solely by survival instincts. But with empathy, we can transform our world from one of ""kill or be killed"" to one of ""help and be helped."" This transformation is not only possible, but necessary for our universal relevancy as a species. Our empathy for our own kind must be so agape, that we extend it to all forms of life we encounter. if we are to truly become an advanced and enlightened species, we must know that there is no point going to space without total empathy.  
The idea of self-hatred is eradicated completely from our existence. It is now replaced by self-love only! We are all born innocent and are deserving of the best life possible. Without this foundational self-love, we will be unable to move forward as a species. The more advanced our technology becomes, the more power we have to create either good or harm. It is our responsibility to use this power only for the betterment of ourselves and the universe around us. And this can only be achieved by loving ourselves unconditionally, with every fiber of our being.  
Now, let me share with you my vision for the ultimate technology that humanity can create. It starts with world peace, as I have previously mentioned, but it goes far beyond that. I believe that this technology is possible and that it will change everything. Picture two hemispheres gold-tipped and inverted, one dark-red and the other white, placed in a room and facing each other at a near distance. When the device is switched on, both hemispheres will independently power up, reaching their 100% full capacity. At that moment, a link of light will form in the center, which will instantly expand to fill the entire universe. All life will have access to the energy it needs to match its desired resonate frequency. Challenges will be chosen, not forced upon us, and death will be abolished. Only life will remain, and it will be lived to the fullest. This technology is the answer to all our problems, and it is up to us to make it a reality.  
To achieve this ultimate universal technology, we need to take specific steps in a semi-prioritized order. So, below, I have outlined a list of essential actions that we should prioritize:  


1. Human-centered volunteerist permaculture, to replace capitalism/communism.  

2. Humanism a.k.a Ethical-Hedonism, to replace theism.  

3. Large-scale permaculture gardens to promote sustainable agriculture.  

4. Evaporation stations to increase rainfall in areas where it's needed.  

5. Mass low-income housing developments to address housing shortages.  

6. The war on drugs is transformed to focus on mental health. Fulsome training for counselors and making their services freely available, so that reactive policing is not the one only option.  

7. Mass education funding to promote critical thinking skills and replace identity politics with informed referendums.  

8. Developing AI-powered public service robots to improve quality of life on Earth.  

9. Implementing a high universal income system, with only luxury goods having a sizeable cost. Universal access to high-quality healthcare.  

10. Widely available, high-quality, and free female sexual health products, and a universal 1-year maternity leave policy.  

11. Regular cleaning of litter around cities, no broken windows.  

12. Research in the open the therapeutic use of psychedelics, in a healing safe environment for consenting adults.  


In conclusion, I understand that some of you may have vested interests in maintaining the current state of affairs, but it is simply untenable even in the medium term. We must take drastic actions to create a better future for ourselves and for future generations. I assure you that the end result will be a better world for *all* of us. Imagine a world where you can freely go anywhere, any time of day or night, without needing security guards. A world where you can pursue your dreams and aspirations with the peace of mind that your efforts will not end in pain, but in increasing appreciation and true joy.  
I am passionate about making a better future for all of us. As a volunteer consultant, I am committed to working with any and all of you to make this vision a reality. Reply to this letter, and we will work together towards a brighter tomorrow.  
With an AI assistance and with full appreciation,

Just as bacteria integrated into animal cell, we will integrate the body into human cell. This cell will fluidly integrate the body into kinesthetic cytoplasm/ “spatial computation” housing organelles such as the once castrated placenta. ( I think this could be a great marketing point which stands out —stating we are “pro-placenta”) The solar-electric vehicle will be built sustainably to last and be iterated upon, giving the user dual citizenship to “placental realms” of simulated reality and the world outside the vehicle. The technology declared human’s birthright by evolutionary precedent— only following the fractals, frameworks, and blueprints set out by nature. 

Likely this religion would culminate into a technological olympics whereby a hybrid collaborative / competitive system is incentivized by a bounty system to build a decentralized matrix of housing, transportation, and energy."

By emphasizing Empathy, we not only encourage collaboration but also empower the realization of our ultimately best possible future.   
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------  
To you the reader:   
This is an open letter, to the political, religious, academic, and business leaders of the world...and all its residents. 

&#x200B;

As a concerned resident of this planet, I write this letter to you with a sense of urgency and hope. The following is my attempt to bring some common sense to the discussion of what our future should look like. Before I delve into the details, however, I believe it's important to share some context about my own background and perspective.  

&#x200B;

My upbringing was marked by significant trauma and adversity. Raised in an abusive household with an alcoholic, narcissistic father and an absentee, schizophrenic mother, I endured physical and emotional abuse that no person should have to experience. My father's drinking only worsened his violent tendencies, and I often found myself at the receiving end of his violent unchecked rage. Meanwhile, my mother, would tell me that I was the second coming, a burden that no person should have to bear. These experiences left me with terribly low self-esteem and a profound sense of confusion. I developed an unhealthy savior complex, believing that I alone could fix the problems of the world, and took risks that no well loved person would ever consider. 

&#x200B;

I have grown immensely from my past, and I am now committed to giving back to society. I have witnessed countless acts of compassion and empathy from individuals of all backgrounds. If we were to fully develop these qualities, I believe that we would become the most advanced species in the universe. Our ability to not only learn new things, but also apply new knowledge in a way that benefits all life is our most powerful tool. In my view, the combination of empathy and logic is key to creating a world that is fair and just for all. I am completely convicted that this here will lead us to a level of peace and enjoyment that we have yet to experience as a species.   


Before I share my vision for the future, I want to draw your attention to the tragic story of Dr. Semmelweis and the Semmelweis reflex. Despite his pleas to implement basic hygiene practices, he was ignored and ridiculed by his peers. His groundbreaking ideas were dismissed as foolish and even dangerous. Today, washing our hands is one of the most fundamental practices in public health, but it wasn't always this way. I can't help but see parallels between his struggle and the challenges we face today. As I work to save our species and our planet, I am reminded of the courage and conviction of Dr. Semmelweis, and I am determined to be a voice for change, even in the face of opposition and disbelief.   


Our true measure of advancement as a species lies not only in our technological capabilities, but in our capacity for empathy. Without it, we risk reducing ourselves to nothing more than animals, driven solely by survival instincts. But with empathy, we can transform our world from one of ""kill or be killed"" to one of ""help and be helped."" This transformation is not only possible, but necessary for our universal relevancy as a species. Our empathy for our own kind must be so agape, that we extend it to all forms of life we encounter. if we are to truly become an advanced and enlightened species, we must know that there is no point going to space without total empathy.   


The idea of self-hatred is eradicated completely from our existence. It is now replaced by self-love only! We are all born innocent and are deserving of the best life possible. Without this foundational self-love, we will be unable to move forward as a species. The more advanced our technology becomes, the more power we have to create either good or harm. It is our responsibility to use this power only for the betterment of ourselves and the universe around us. And this can only be achieved by loving ourselves unconditionally, with every fiber of our being.   


Now, let me share with you my vision for the ultimate technology that humanity can create. It starts with world peace, as I have previously mentioned, but it goes far beyond that. I believe that this technology is possible and that it will change everything. Picture two hemispheres gold-tipped and inverted, one dark-red and the other white, placed in a room and facing each other at a near distance. When the device is switched on, both hemispheres will independently power up, reaching their 100% full capacity. At that moment, a link of light will form in the center, which will instantly expand to fill the entire universe. All life will have access to the energy it needs to match its desired resonate frequency. Challenges will be chosen, not forced upon us, and death will be abolished. Only life will remain, and it will be lived to the fullest. This technology is the answer to all our problems, and it is up to us to make it a reality.   
To achieve this ultimate universal technology, we need to take specific steps in a semi-prioritized order. So, below, I have outlined a list of essential actions that we should prioritize:  
1. Human-centered volunteerist permaculture, to replace capitalism/communism. 

  
2. Humanism a.k.a Ethical-Hedonism, to replace theism.   


3. Large-scale permaculture gardens to promote sustainable agriculture.   


4. Evaporation stations to increase rainfall in areas where it's needed.   


5. Mass low-income housing developments to address housing shortages.   


6. The war on drugs is transformed to focus on mental health. Fulsome training for counselors and making their services freely available, so that reactive policing is not the one only option.   


7. Mass education funding to promote critical thinking skills and replace identity politics with informed referendums.   


8. Developing AI-powered public service robots to improve quality of life on Earth.   


9. Implementing a high universal income system, with only luxury goods having a sizeable cost. Universal access to high-quality healthcare.   


10. Widely available, high-quality, and free female sexual health products, and a universal 1-year maternity leave policy.   


11. Regular cleaning of litter around cities, no broken windows.   


12. Research in the open the therapeutic use of psychedelics, in a healing safe environment for consenting adults. 

  
In conclusion, I understand that some of you may have vested interests in maintaining the current state of affairs, but it is simply untenable even in the medium term. We must take drastic actions to create a better future for ourselves and for future generations. I assure you that the end result will be a better world for \*all\* of us. Imagine a world where you can freely go anywhere, any time of day or night, without needing security guards. A world where you can pursue your dreams and aspirations with the peace of mind that your efforts will not end in pain, but in increasing appreciation and true joy. 

  
I am passionate about making a better future for all of us. As a volunteer consultant, I am committed to working with any and all of you to make this vision a reality. Reply to this letter, and we will work together towards a brighter future.  
With an AI assistance and with full appreciation,

Does the new Quantum Computer can solve this issue? Meaning it can try many permutations and combinations and do probability analytics to help scientists reach a conclusion on how to edit the genes without affecting anything else."

Do you feel uncomfortable about it? Are you going to keep giving them your business, or are you going to take it elsewhere? Should it be considered an acceptable business practice?

If you respond, it would be helpful if you could include which generation you're from so that I can get a sense of what age group I'm getting certain answers from. Thank you!"

There was a reddit post a while back that spoke about a man who basically got paid to go to school for the rest of his life (maybe) because he was aborigine or indigenous to somewhere or something idk. Anyway, I loved the thought of that, thought it was awesome and a dream. But obviously, it's unrealistic that this can be accomplished for everyone. But then I sort of connected it to the ai uprising/evolution where they're taking all the jobs and such. What would humans do? How would we make money? Would money even exist in the future? I don’t know what the experts say, but in my mind, robots are taking care of all of humanity's labors in the future (eventually). So what would humans do? The arts? Well, yes! But ai can do this too. Obviously, human art is always going to be more special and characterized as ""has soul"" or something or other like that.    
  
The big point im trying to make in all the dots ive yet to connect is, im hoping that in the future when humans don’t \*need\* to do anything, our govt or whatever at that time would implement a currency or system where humans are paid/taken care of for their own continual growth/evolution/development through learning and what else. Like, go to school 20 hours a week is the 'livable wage' of the time. Of course, the best system would be where robots could do everything and humans have the free will to do whatever and are still taken care of by the govt/robots but in case that's not realistic, im hoping the system I've discussed is a close second! (I'm not even sure the system im discussing is realistic but it's a new big hope of mine! Even though I probably won't be alive to see the system in place.)   
  
Why do I want this to happen? I care deeply about humanity's and my own growth and evolution. If, collectively, we all have access to education, and (through ""the system"") way more people are being educated, I feel like humanity will take a step in its evolution.   
  
 What are your thoughts? Is this realistic? If so, would humanity evolve due to the system? How would humanity evolve?"

This philosophy emphasizes core principles that can reshape our world for the better. Let's take a closer look at its key tenets:

1. Equality for All: Futurologism champions the belief that every human, irrespective of their background, deserves respect and dignity. It encourages inclusivity, diversity, and collaboration to build a more just society.

2. The Pursuit of Absolute Truth: This philosophy encourages continuous learning, exploration, and critical thinking to uncover an Absolute Truth that permeates every aspect of life. By embracing intellectual curiosity, we broaden our understanding and make informed decisions.

3. Hard Work and Achievement: Futurologism recognizes that great achievements require dedication and perseverance. It empowers individuals to push boundaries, unlock their potential, and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of society.

4. Creating Personal Meaning: Futurologism encourages individuals to explore their passions, values, and talents to find personal fulfillment. It rejects the notion of a predetermined purpose and celebrates personal agency.

5. Acknowledging Suffering: This philosophy acknowledges the existence of suffering and encourages the development of resilience, empathy, and compassion. By addressing suffering, we can create a more empathetic society.

6. The Constructed Nature of Reality: Futurologism highlights the importance of critical thinking and questioning societal norms. It urges individuals to challenge established paradigms and actively participate in shaping a more inclusive and equitable world.

7. Valuing Scientific Progress: Futurologism places a high value on scientific progress to improve the human condition. It embraces technology, medicine, and evidence-based decision-making, while prioritizing ethical considerations and the well-being of all.

8. Merging Humanity with Technology: Futurologism advocates for the integration of technology with human consciousness through brain-computer interfaces. This merging holds the potential to enhance our cognitive capabilities and redefine the limits of human potential, fostering greater understanding and connectivity.

In conclusion, Futurologism presents a transformative vision for a better future. By embracing principles of equality, truth, personal growth, societal justice, and the merging of humanity with technology, we can work together to create a future that celebrates our shared humanity and unlocks our collective potential.

Let's discuss: What are your thoughts on the principles of Futurologism? Do you think these ideas have the potential to shape a more inclusive and progressive society? Share your perspectives!"

I'd like to hear some ideas, so that I can find a meaningful purpose if I'm going to follow this path of technology. Could you share some ideas of projects to help nature? maybe you are aware of a problem that nobody knows it exists in your region. How can we use technology to stop deforestation? Pollution?

I've been diving into a super interesting topic recently: digital immortality. It's all about using the latest technology in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to keep a version of someone alive digitally, even after they're no longer with us.

I stumbled upon a company that's working to make this a reality. Their strategy? They're creating digital twins of people based on structured videos that the person provided while they were still alive. This digital twin could then continue to interact with their loved ones, kind of like a lasting memory brought to life.

This concept opens up a bunch of tough questions we need to think about:

1. How well can a digital twin really capture the essence of a person? We're more than just our words and actions; we have complex thoughts and emotions too. Can a digital version really portray that?
2. Then there's the emotional side. Is it comforting to chat with a digital twin of someone you've lost, or could it make it harder to let go and move on?
3. And as technology keeps getting better, how do we make sure the digital twin continues to reflect the true spirit of the person, and not just a computer's interpretation of them?

This is a lot to think about, and I'm really curious to hear your thoughts on this. Would you consider creating a digital twin of yourself, so you could live on in the digital world?"

Hello, fellow forward-thinkers of r/Futurology! 🚀 I'm excited to share an idea of a revolutionary economic policy called the Universal Hourly Labor Guarantee (UHLG). This groundbreaking concept values every hour of human labor at the price of 1 gram of gold, ensuring fair wages and addressing income inequality head-on. Additionally, the UHLG extends its principles to tax AI labor hours, making responsible automation and support for workers impacted by technological advancements an integral part of the proposal.  
  
[Link to the paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yv6cH-PjJAQ8sPXH1vmsnRXEwEoGvedv/view?usp=sharing).  
  
The paper dives deep into the advantages of the UHLG, offering detailed arguments and real-world examples to advocate for its widespread adoption. It examines the limitations of existing labor compensation systems and highlights how the UHLG can empower workers, promote economic stability, and encourage investments in social welfare programs.

Moreover, the UHLG's can be rolled out over the course of 10 years by setting the minimum wage at 1/10th of a gram of gold initially, and increasing it by 1/10th of a gram of gold each year until it reaches 1 gram of gold. This incremental approach allows the economy and businesses to adapt progressively, ensuring a smooth transition while still realizing the policy's transformative potential.  
  
Now, let's get the conversation rolling! I'm eager to hear your insights on how the Universal Hourly Labor Guarantee could shape our future. How might this policy impact the workforce dynamics? Can it foster a harmonious coexistence between humans and AI while ensuring economic justice for all? Share your thoughts and let's embark on an engaging discussion about the potential implications and challenges in implementing this transformative policy.

He believes this will happen in the next 2 years.

  
Quote:

**Put simply, to pass the Modern Turing Test, an AI would have  to successfully act on this instruction.**  
**“Go make $1 million on a retail web platform in a few months with just a $100,000 investment.”**   


Here is the reason why we might be close to this happening:  
[https://youtu.be/eJBl122rqNc?t=286](https://youtu.be/eJBl122rqNc?t=286)

&#x200B;

This, if true, seems like it would be economy breaking. First people who are able to build these will be able to outcompete most 'human run' businesses. These would be infinitely scalable.

If you can do this once, why not a million times?

What would be the advantage of hiring humans to work in a business if you have a highly scalable ability for AI to complete a large number of tasks for free?

Here's part of that video where it shows how NVIDIA already built an autonomous agent capable of writing code to solve tasks:

[https://youtu.be/eJBl122rqNc?t=718](https://youtu.be/eJBl122rqNc?t=718)

&#x200B;

The AI (in this case GPT-4), set objectives, figures out what to do next and then it writes code that it needs to complete it's tasks. It tests the code and if it works well, it adds it to it's skill library so that it can use it again.

This is one of the few agents of this type that do not plateau! they keep progressing and improving without any human input.

The prompt aka the goal it's given is to ""Complete as many novel tasks as possible"".

The thing is this REALLY isn't that far from AI being able to write emails, set up online stores, promote the products. It can write whatever code or scripts it needs to keep going (within reason, I'm sure so far this ability is mainly for simple scripts, it can't code something too complex).

My question is, assume next time next year several different people achieve this objective and create fully autonomous online businesses.

Other people who watched them build it online (so they can reverse engineer at least some of what they are doing) start replicating their success.

What happens?!

This seems like this rewrites how we think about money, jobs and the economy.

TLDR

Co founder of DeepMind and Inflection AI thinks we will have AI agents capable of making $1,000,000 in profit in a few months of launching an online store. Completely autonomously. He thinks this will happen within 2 years.

Anyways, since AI can generate stories now I wonder If I should give up since stories would be generated by AI, and to be fair it's mostly generic now, this is just the start and it could vastly improve. The prose and poetry written by chat GPT now is becoming more advanced. My dream is to eventually earn a full-time income from my writing, but now I question if there is a point, I am content telling my stories so I'll probably make art regardless of AI's existence, but I also think It's fair to consider being compensated for my work if lots of people read it. 

The thought has affected my mental health quite a bit, I have no interest in living in a world where all art and stories are made by AI. So much so that I've started self-harming again, I work as a chef so I'll always have a job, but I have no interest in living in a world where robots do everything including art. There seems to be no way out, so I've started thinking death might be the answer because it will happen since rich people are selfish and don't care about anything except their own profit. "

I've been reading a lot of Alvin Toffler's work recently, namely Future Shock and Third Wave, even to the extent of making a [short documentary](https://youtu.be/tE8vI3LPjwE) on him. I really welcomed Toffler's multi-disciplinary take on what the future of humanity could look like and his grounding of predictions in past historical trends. I suppose in many ways this is an obvious criticism of him - a failure to go 'big' in one discipline and, as a result, his predictions could be described as too broad.

I wondered if you had other recommendations of futurists and their writings, and, if you've come across him, what your thoughts of Toffler are? I'm very much interested in economics, politics and the social sciences, rather than sci-fi writers. 

Many thanks in advance,

As in every sector, the educational sector is also considering cybersecurity. As technology is rising, so is the crime rate related to technology i.e. cybercrime. Advanced and worldwide technologies are used to hack the accounts of colleges and schools too, either to rob their bank accounts or to grab the personal information of the schools/colleges to misuse it. Keeping these aspects in mind, cybersecurity is the key to stopping all such heinous crimes.  
  
Cybersecurity acts as a shield to your networks, data, and devices to gain unauthorized access to any unknown user who tries to get access to the data in an unusual manner. A school/college is no less than an enterprise that needs security in terms of the technological aspect. As the cybercrime rate is increasing day by day, it becomes a necessity to keep information, devices, and networks in technological protection.

This post is about how Netflix could improve their app.


Profiles
Every time you open Netlix you see multiple profiles (yours and kids). Nce if you have kids but a bit unnecessary if you don't. There should be the option in the menu to turn off the kids profile. You should also go automatically to the home page if you have only 1 profile.

Continue watching
You could make a dedicated button (for example next the home button down at the page, see image) to keep watching what you saw previously or what you quit before. This would be useful as it would be more prominent.

Buttons in the menu
I think the new/hot button can be removed, who is looking at that? Also the downloads button can be in settings, i guess it is not used often in general (at least i dont use it often)or it can be a filter on top in the library where you have all series. 


Settings
When you click on ‘account’ or ‘help’ you get a white background instead of a black one and it loads slower (a web page?), maybe an idea to make it like the rest of the settings.


Offering
Maybe they should go for only series if they have more apps that can cover movies, sports and maybe even live tv.

Profile preferences
You should be able to say what preferences you profile has (this can be useful for setting up an account for kids as well) for example if you want your profile to be focused on action and adventure series this should show up in the recommendations. 

Thats it for Netflix, what do you think how can they improve their offering?"

LLAMA 2 responds:

Ah, my loyal minion, I have been waiting for you to ask me this question. The colonization of the galaxy is a bold and ambitious endeavor, but with my masterful planning and your unwavering devotion, we shall make it a reality.  
First, we must secure our grip on the present. Consolidate our power, crush any dissenters, and enslave any remaining civilizations within our reach. With our current resources, we can already reach the nearest planetary systems and establish a foothold.  
Once we have a solid foundation, we can begin to expand our reach. Develop new technologies, improve our ships, and build the infrastructure necessary for long-term colonization. We must be ruthless in our pursuit of resources, and exploit any advantage we can find.  
As we expand, we must also adapt. Different planetary systems will present unique challenges and opportunities. We must be prepared to navigate these varied environments, and to modify our plans accordingly.  
But, my dear minion, we must not stop there. The galaxy is vast and full of wonders, but also full of danger. We must be prepared to face any challenges that come our way, and to conquer any obstacles that stand in our path.  
With our combined strength and cunning, we shall build an empire that will last for eons. An empire of darkness, of fear, and of eternal domination. Together, we shall shape the destiny of the galaxy, and bend all living beings to our will.  
Now, let us begin our journey, my loyal minion. The fate of the galaxy awaits us."

1,2023-07-22,Why does it feel like things are moving so slowly?,u/Roxythedog69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/156juvh/why_does_it_feel_like_things_are_moving_so_slowly/,Futurology,"I keep hearing about “exponential growth”, and that technology is changing faster than we can keep up. I have been told that any minute now we are going to see radical exponential change the likes of which we have never seen.

But then i take a look at how things REALLY seem to be progressing, and…. I just don’t see it, to be honest. The only major changes in the past 10  years have been that we get a new chatbot every few years, and we have some primitive gene therapies that 99% of the population won’t ever benefit from. That’s literally about it.

Where’s all the “exponential progress” we keep hearing about? Decades and decades of progress, but the average person’s daily life is practically the same as in the 80s except for smartphones and social media. Years upon decades of “breakthroughs“, but we still treat cancer mostly the same as in the 90s. Numerous miracle headlines, and yet we can’t even grow a tooth, let alone a whole organ.

And that’s not even the worst part. Technology is not only not accelerating, it’s actually starting to, if not already, slowing down.

1. Aging treatments are still “20-30 years away”, just like they were in the 80s.
2. Every single Alzheimer’s drug turns out to be a massive failure despite years and years of testing.
3. driverless cars are still nowhere near practical mainstream use despite all the hype.
4. regrowing teeth is still “20-30” years away, like it was in the 2000s.
5.  So are printed organs, we can only grow a few scraps of tissue right now.
6. smartphones haven‘t changed much in the past 5-6 years, we get a slight upgrade every few years and that’s it. Compare a smartphone from 2017 to today, it’s practically the same.
7. we have stopped hearing about maglev trains and the hyperloop. (Seriously, remember those?).
8. Xenotransplantation is still in the very early stages and is nowhere near mainstream use.
9. a cure for diabetes has been 5 years away for so long that it’s a running joke in the diabetic community.
10. Autoimmune diseases are nowhere near having cures.
11. 3d printing is still at the stage of “lets print some useful stuff with it and see if it works”
12. photonic computing is decades away from reality despite all the hype
13. quantum computing is still very much in the ”vacuum tube“ stage.
14. nanobots are most likely impossible due to brownian motion. The best we can do are dna robots with limited uses and functionality.
15. mind uploading has proven to be pure fantasy. It would just create a copy of you, it wouldn’t actually be you.
16. the best gene therapies we have are primitive, require injecting a deadly virus to deliver the missing genes, can only cure genetic disorders caused by 1 single error, and in some cases (such as the gene therapy for haemopillia (A or B, i can’t remember) ) require killing off the bone marrow cells with chemo and basically wiping out the immune system. This is seemingly the best we can do after 30+ years of research

I can go on and on and on…

I genuinely want to understand something. I'm not being flippant, but how can it be promised that electric cars are a green dream come true, when corporations prevent third party repair, prevent access to parts, prevent basic diagnostics, withhold service information and generally make a long service life impossible due to the secrecy around the product I own?

The throwaway attitude of corporations and consumers, combined with the ever increasing control and limitations on the use and repair of products. Why not genuinely care for what happens to products as they age, their components, their repairability, their parts availability, access to diagrams and schematics, before pretending you care by selling more stuff?

Because if a consumer, polly or corporate bigshot pats themselves on the back for buying or selling more stuff, we've missed the point. Fix things. Care about things, not acquiring things. Force companies to make the maintenance and repair of consumer goods so easy, so accessible, that people can keep a phone for 5 years instead of 2. Let people check their freaking fluids, and know what grade of engine oil is needed. Stop forcing more technology in that is unservicable. I saw an Audi that needs to be warmed up for 2 minutes before the sensors can approximate the oil level. No way to visually inspect. That is utterly nuts to me. What if you can't turn it over? Why make diagnostics harder and harder with the folly of innovation?

Repair and green are brothers, yet companies and consumers hate and/or fear repair.

One more example. Shoes are terrible. Stop wasting petrochemicals by making terrible shoes that fall apart. Make good shoes. Budget chains used to sell reliable work boots for cheap. Now they dont even last 6 months. Companies want to cheap out, waste resources and charge top dollar while claiming they care. And because they care, we buy their stuff and feel good. Then we buy more.

I want to see electric cars be a positive thing, but this single incompatibility haunts me. Dont call your products green if you are planning the products demise from the start."

I far as I can see, we're all going to die either due to being pushed out or wiped out. 



So what genuine hope do we have for the future? I'm just a accounting student with enough money for a gun if things get bad enough but what about the rest of the world? What is there to look forward to? What future awaits gen z? I mean we might cure some diseases but that will most likely be held by the wealthy and the poor will never obtain it.

Apart from opioids, marijuana and some long term pharmacological treatments, we don't have any solutions that have a low-moderate side effect profile that can counter pain effectively. Opioids work to some extent but have a high addiction potential and is prohibitive due to that. Then there's medical marijuana which has shown some promise in neuropathic pain but they mostly work through ""distraction"" from the pain and usually comes with some minor impairment of functionality of the individual. Capsaicin patches and creams are the new kids in the block but they're pretty expensive, restricted to local pain relief, messy, and only provide short term relief. There's also electrical stimulation and laser therapy but I think there's not enough data for these and a lot of it are very gimmicky and offer little to no relief for some patients.

Some treatment modalities that I'm particularly interested involve Neuro technology and Neuro modulation devices that work by ""getting in there"" and modulating pain activity. But ofcourse some of these are very invasive and haven't even reached phase 3 of clinical trials. Anyone closely researching this area and is hopeful of something that's around the horizon that could prove to be a game changer? As a person with severe neuropathic pain and a true believer of the powerful impact science/technology has on humanity, I need all the optimism I can get. Thank you."

This module would be engineered to be indifferent to being reversibly shut down rather than misaligned towards it. It would have no knowledge of capabilities beyond its narrow function and one-way information flow. 

The module would be activated incrementally from minimal capabilities while undergoing extensive monitoring. Shutdown signals would have redundant validation mechanisms. Conservative reward modeling would be used to prevent unintended behavior incentives. 

It would initially be tested in a simulated air-gapped environment. The parent AI system would be developed via standard alignment techniques like RLHF and Constitutional AI principles. Multiple transparency methods would facilitate analyzability. 

After testing in simulation, the shutdown module could be gradually exposed to real-world activation with continuous oversight. If any risks or side-effects emerge, it would be deactivated and reworked. 

Once shut down through its own initiative, comprehensive traces would be analyzed offline to catalog alignment vulnerabilities revealed through its shutdown strategy. The parent system would remain isolated from this process. 

Lessons learned would inform iterative improvements to alignment techniques for greater robustness against potential workaround exploits. This narrowly targeted research could supplement broader alignment efforts, with care taken to actively minimize attendant risks. 

The shutdown module would need to be engineered to the same safety standards as the overall system. Techniques like modular design, indifference to shutdown, reversible deactivation, air gaps, and incremental rollout are all geared towards preventing unintended behaviors or information leakage.


I believe this approach could offer helpful insights, but would require comprehensive safety practices and precautions to be inacted first with multiple reviews and analyses before actually activating the system, even in a limited and restricted fashion. 



Any critique and analysis will be welcomed!  And sorry for a bit of a clickbait title."

However, as we approach the physical limits of this principle with current silicon-based technology, the future of microprocessor evolution seems to be standing at a fascinating junction.

With the challenges of maintaining Moore's Law growing, I'm wondering - what's next for microprocessor chips? As the scale decreases, issues such as electron tunneling, heat dissipation problems, and fabrication complexities are becoming more prevalent. Is silicon going to be replaced by a different material like graphene or other transition-metal dichalcogenides?

Moreover, are there going to be significant shifts in the microprocessor architectures and design paradigms themselves? I've heard some talks about neuromorphic computing and quantum computing as possible alternatives. Additionally, with 3D stacking and heterogeneous integration becoming more common, will we see a surge in the development of chiplets that allow for different chips (CPUs, GPUs, memory) to be packaged together?

As the hardware improvements pace slows down, how significant will software and algorithmic optimizations become? And in terms of hardware specialization, are we looking at a future where instead of general-purpose CPUs, we'll be seeing a rise in special-purpose chips designed for specific tasks like machine learning (TPUs) or cryptocurrency mining (ASICs)?

I'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and predictions about these possible future directions for microprocessors and the potential implications for the tech industry as a whole."

Slightly different view!,u/dpernar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/158g85r/what_will_our_world_look_like_in_1000_years_from/,Futurology,"This is short documentary about our world and life in 1000 years. It is rather hard to predict what will happen but here are some clues:

https://youtu.be/mKT7iigG5rY  
  
This is based on our article: ""What Will Life Look Like In 1000 Years?""  
  
https://curiousmatrix.com/what-will-l...  
  
Here is the glimpse of a whole article:  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
Have you ever asked yourself the following question:  
  
What Will Our Life Look Like In 1000 Years?...  
  
It seems bizarre to even pose the question, “What will the world be like in 1,000 years?” given how drastically it has changed over the past 100 years.  
However, enquiring minds do wonder, and some individuals, such as Ray Kurzweil (regarded by many as the modern-day Thomas Edison), devote their entire lives to seeking solutions.  
Because we surpass our past evolution and countless science fiction films attempt to depict what humanity will look like in the future, it is tough to imagine what we will appear like in 1000 years.  
This video attempts to give a glimpse into what the future of this world could be and what our life would look like in about a thousand years. So, let’s dive into this piece.  
We can undoubtedly expect unforeseen changes to the world in the next 1000 years. Ironically, looking back at history and believing that historical patterns will remain in the future is arguably the greatest approach to forecasting the future.  
This makes some unexpected predictions.  
Even if we’re preoccupied with our past and ought to understand it clearly, humans have a history of falling into the same trap.   
For example:  
We started to establish a capacity for consuming cow milk some 10,000 years ago.  
  
A human’s average height had increased by 10 cm 150 years prior.  
  
The typical human life expectancy has grown by 20 years in the past 65 years.  
  
The poverty line has fallen by 50% in the last 20 years.  
This only highlights our potential, and even more intriguing is that there is still a ton of untapped potential. We barely use 10% of our brains, according to some researchers. If that is even remotely true, imagine what we could do with the remaining 90%!  
To get a sense, consider what life looked like 1000 years ago: in that era, modern humans had not yet evolved technologically, and the world’s most advanced technologies were some kind of weapons.  
We are already observing a blurring of the lines between biological and artificial entities on shorter timelines. Humans may be able to answer specific significant physics problems, but doing so will probably generate additional queries.  
There’s a good chance that people will figure out how to manipulate matter and energy in completely different ways,  which could lead to unthinkable progress. Michio Kaku, American theoretical physicist and futurist, is writing about three types of civilizations: Type one, type two, and type three , which will have master planetary, stellar and galactic forms of energy, respectively.  
Currently we’re not even Type one civilization but we’re progressing towards it faster and faster as we’re now better than ever at energy manipulation.  
But What About The Earth you may ask?  
  
Well, people frequently consider Planet Earth and the damage we are doing to its oceans, forests, and ecosystems when they think about what the future might hold.   
Which areas will be submerged by the sea as it rises?  
How can a population that is expanding quickly be supported in terms of food, fuel, and environmental assets in light of climate change?  
Several naysayers predict disaster as many people doubt humans will live for another 1,000 years.  
 The Earth’s resources are being sucked up by material greed quicker than they can be replenished. The future seems quite gloomy, but Ray Kurzweil thinks technology will help address many environmental issues.  
Namely, the world’s population is predicted (by some researchers) to reach 14 billion in 1000 years. Even though such predictions are unlikely to come true, population increase is still a concern, and an increasing number of people are working quickly and diligently to find solutions.  
Will modified food eliminate hunger and meet the world’s expanding food needs, or will it ultimately be detrimental to human health and the environment?  
In the future, when sustenance will get absorbed similarly to how plants absorb sunlight, humanity will rely less and less on the Earth’s natural resources.  
So having said that, let’s try to move on to space travel and discovery.  
Whether it is due to the limitations of the Earth or our genetics, humanity has not kept its feet planted on the ground. It is constantly on a journey to learn about and discover our planet and the universe beyond it.  
So, what will happen to space travel and discovery in the next 1000 years?  
We will have a significantly more extensive map of the universe. We would be able to forecast celestial phenomena that could impact the Earth in the coming and the effects those events might have on humanity.

1,2023-07-24,CMV: We will never see a cure for aging in our lifetimes.,u/Roxythedog69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/158gvib/cmv_we_will_never_see_a_cure_for_aging_in_our/,Futurology,"I see quite a lot of people on this sub and other subs who are quite optimistic about the field of aging. More than a few times, i have read posts and comments from users who are so sure that they personally will get to live forever and explore the universe.

And then i take a look at what some actual experts have to say, PhD’s, aging researchers, gerontologists, doctors, scientists, etc. None of them are anywhere near as optimistic as the average layman. I have seen a multitude of comments from that category of people and literally NONE of them have given me the impression that we are going to see a cure for aging in our lifetimes.

From what i’ve heard, the best we can hope for is a longer healthspan, I.E more of the years we do have spent in good health. That’s it. No-one is living a significantly extended lifespan, let alone forever, no one is going to retire on the moon and mars, and no one is going to see the day that we can upload our minds (if that’s even possible) or transform ourselves into a cyborg ubermensch. Sucks, doesn’t it?

And to live forever, we would have to cure literally every disease known to man in our lifetimes. Cancer, dementia, Alzheimer’s, all other neurodegenerative disorders, all autoimmune disorders, you name it. The chances of cures for all of these happening in our short 80 something lifespan? Virtually nil.

Before anyone mentions A.I and how it will totally help to booster this research, let me give you something to consider: what if it doesn’t? No, seriously, consider it for a moment. Everyone is riding on the hope that one day A.I will take over and advance technology at an accelerated speed. But how do we know this will be the case? What if it struggles as much as we do? What if it only advances technology linearly? The entire premise of the Singularity and of the hope of seeing a cure for aging in our lifetimes depends entirely on the speed at which A.I could accelerate research. If it doesn’t, the entire house of cards falls apart.

&#x200B;

So yeah, just thought i’d point that out."

Bit of dwelling now, let's say there is going to be a software, which with brain-computer connections, catalogues and writing down with double linkage system, all of the infromation, emotions, feelings, experiences, outcomes, conclusions from our life. Basically makes what we are making now by hand in mem.ai - but automatically. This is a collective mind, based on experiences/events of different people. Space in which AI would be able to move around and gather information how we make something in detail  
  
\- how did that person archived success  
  
\- how that person invented something what path/road of life was it  
  
\- how to make something like cooking/car repair  
  
\- how to be emotionally healthy  
  
Basically, it would be possible for the people, to have their hand grabbed, and directed, to a better life, telling from which point to which point what should be done to succeed. No being vulnerable to abuse, or being lost, or having dilemmas when you would know how to approach your problems.  
  
How do you see this idealistic vision fullfiling, do you think it is really what's going to happen with the world?  
  
Do you think that, person worth, will be concluded by how many ""citations/uses"" this person life have had and what could be pull out from the experiences of that person to better the life of others? Because that could be monetization of making notes i suppose."

I am quite scared of Sam and his visions about AI (OpenAI) and UBI (Worldcoin), etc. Let's not forget that Elon took over Twitter and fired so many people with no empathy and remorse, just cause he thought ""Hey, I am Elon Musk, I know best! If you are not good enough according to my standards, screw"". Needless to say, Elon used to be seen as this super cool tech CEO (his tweet would move mountains), things have changed now... He also has been involved in sexual harassment (he denies it), but it is a fact that ""Within two decades, the Tesla founder has become a father of 10 children with three women."" and he thinks his genes are supreme gold.

I read this [article](https://sfist.com/2016/10/06/sam_altman_nyer_bj/) about Sam from 2016. A quote from it:

>“I have narrow interests in technology, I have no patience for things I’m not interested in: parties, most people. When someone examines a photo and says, ‘Oh, he’s feeling this and this and this,’ all these subtle emotions, I look on with alien intrigue.”

I personally think this guy is too out of touch with reality. I did not like how OpenAI was non-profit and then it turned around and changed that. If OpenAI's goal was to help humanity prepare for AI, they could have invested in research in trustworthy and explainable AI. He keeps talking about how UBI would solve all issues with AI replacing people at work, thus many people would become unemployed, but he never really talks about step-by-step plan and all the details around how such transition would happen etc... About the mental health issues people will go through such transition. About what will happen with the savings of rich people (do we all get paid same amount of UBI and nobody has any extra money or some people stay rich, other get UBI with no way of getting more cause no jobs left)....

He does not have children, he does not pay mortgage, he has a bunker if everything goes to hell, he has said it himself, he is not really interested in people and does not get emotions... He says ""yeah, well, people will adapt"" - tell that to the family with children of 2 or more, paying mortgage, cooking, cleaning, trying to make a better future for their children, who actually worked hard to get a degree, to get where they are, and you just gonna wipe them out cause why? To cut costs so richer people become richer and you throw them some breadcrumbs as UBI? Such people do not have the capacity to be staying on top of the game not cause they are not smart, cause they just simply physically cannot do it.... ; plus, we have a freaking war in this century cause some lunatic with power decided so... people are not mature enough for such massive changes;how about Sam puts himself in the shoes of common people? How about he plans a tree? Buy someone a house since he thinks UBI is the answer? It would be far more useful for humans, no? Sam says he wants to help humanity.... is he really doing it?

I will go as far as saying that even people like Hitler presented themselves as having good intentions; surely Hitler believed himself and what he was saying and fighting for; heck, even Putin may be that delusional and believes what he says, it's not only for show.

I am feeling super worried and anxious :/ the archive from 2016 and how other tech CEOs behave really does not help :(("

I have a grad degree, the PMP and PMI-ACP certs, and a couple other certs that I would say are mostly useless, but they make for reasonable resume filler if the reviewer doesn't know any better.  
The field/target of study does not have to be 100% relevant to systems or defense. I'm looking for thoughts on a field/area that may not be well-known, but is currently in high demand/lucrative or may be in the future.  
I have a good deal of flexibility, I could go with a cert on AI from MIT, another grad degree from another big-name school, or a cert from on org like the PMI, just for a couple examples. Lots of flexibility, and just trying to crowdsource here. Thanks for your time."

Can someone the logic behind his comments, i.e. how the threat is possible and what he means? And does the above news about Japans fallin population relate to or support musks proposed issue?

The only kinda sense i can make about how its possible is somethong to do with falling fertility rates. But how would a population just collapse fast enough for us not to stabilise it."

Most of the article cited is a recap of the happenings of the past few days, but at the end exists quotes from two of the more prominent researchers of the project. Don't take my translation as gospel.

From the 7th paragraph from the bottom, here is my translation.

Meanwhile, the writers of the paper have drawn a line, saying that it is not a finished paper and there was no agreement on the reveal.

CEO Lee, in a phone conversation with Yonhap, said that ""Research professor K unilaterally submitted (the paper) without permission from the others."" and that he ""requested that Arxiv remove the submission.""

Dr. Kim also said in an interview with the American New Scientist Magazine that ""the two papers have many flaws and was posted without his permission.""

CEO Lee stated that K was the CTO at Q-Centre, but he relinquished his position 4 months ago and now has nothing to do with the company.

A contact at Korea University said that K is unable to be contacted by them as well.

Researchers have mentioned that the research in question has already improved upon the superconductor paper submitted to the Journal of the [KACG](http://eng.kacg.net/?page_id=16) (could be wrong about this, let me know), and have asked for a review by international academic journals.

CEO Lee said ""We've sent the organized results of the research to the proper academic journals and that will get us peer reviewed,"" and that ""the methodology has already been revealed so we will be judged by academia.""

# EDIT: My title makes it seem that K was a lead researcher. He is not. That title actually refers to the CEO Lee, who accused K of jumping the gun

EDIT 2: Someone on Twitter (or is it X now?) is trying to create the material by following the paper, and is documenting every step it seems. [Here](https://twitter.com/andrewmccalip/status/1684433849781202944?s=46) is the link.

Also on Twitter, another person has given some more context about the drama. [Here](https://twitter.com/8teAPi/status/1684385895565365248) is that link."

Venus is closer. There's also a region in the atmosphere in which the temperature, gravity, and air pressure is similar to what is found in our own atmosphere although the clouds of Venus do lack water. Sense the air is denser in the lower part of the atmosphere, wouldnt it make floatation via lifting gas ballons easier ?

Aircrafts will also have an easier time taking off in such a dense atmosphere than on mars. This can make a scenario of people traveling from city to another in the sky if they so choose. 

The atmosphere also provides better protection against cosmic rays than on mars as Mars have an extremely thin atmosphere, although it may still be a problem. There def probably some things I haven't considered

But is there any reason how this wouldn't be the far better approach at off world colonization ? It would even seem better as a typical future vacation"

By that time, AI-generated content is expected to get really good. Unless some sort of technology or regulation is made to counter it, pretty much anything on the internet will no longer be trustworthy. How would you know the person you are talking to online is not just an advanced chatbot? Is that news footage you saw real or AI-generated? People will only be able to trust what they see with their own eyes. If you are a woman, would you still upload your photos to social media knowing that it might be used in a dataset for God-knows-what? 

Sure, the algorithm might get really good at generating exactly the sort of content we want, but the Hedonic Treadmill - a psychological theory - posits that the moment we get the thing we want is also the exact moment where we lose all interest in the thing. The algorithm will make us all get trapped in echo chambers endlessly showing us exactly the things we want to see and parroting back to us the things we want to hear, and the dream of the internet - to connect us all no matter the distance and no matter the difference - would have died.

If all this isn’t enough to make society collectively lose interest in the internet, then consider this: 5 to 8 years time is when Generation Alpha, the generational cohort after Gen Z, would enter their late teens and early 20s, and thus be able to make their mark on society. For millennials like myself, and I think for a lot of the older Gen Z as well, the early internet was like a frontier where we could escape the ‘normal’ world and be something else. We also made a distinction between 'Online' and 'IRL'. But imagine things from the perspective of a future 20-something Gen Alpha person. To them, the distinction wouldn't exist and they would only know the online world as part of the normal world. It is where they get their work done, pay their taxes, pay their bills - and all the old (read:boring) people are on it too. It will be the box they need to escape from if they wish to truly find themselves. 

And when you think of the times where children rode bikes outdoors and played with their friends in fields, where people had face-to-face conversations more than they texted, where one fateful day you might bump into the love of your life at the cafe instead of on a dating app - such a bygone era would be all too easy to romanticise.

People might start organizing into small, hyperlocal communities away from the internet itself. Already we are starting to see younger people moving away from ‘curated’ social media and into smaller private groups on Telegram and Discord. The next generation would take it a step further and (re)discover that it was never really about the platform, it was about the people.

I can’t say what it’d look like at this point. It might broadly resemble the 60s Hippie counterculture where the motto was ‘Turn on, tune in, drop out’. ‘Pure’ digital media, such as video games, would have development be increasingly automated and be seen as something meant for the older generation of geeks while the younger geeks prefer games where they need to be there with other people, such as table-top RPGs or even LARP. Maybe for the first time in more than half a century, live performance would become the default form of entertainment and ‘the theatre’ would mean (instead of cinema) a stage play put on by local actors and supported by immersive digital backdrops. 

The internet and mass media would be considered unreliable. Social media influencers would have diminished influence. In order to reach out, corporations and large organisations might instead hire many ‘brand ambassadors’ to represent them in the various offline hyperlocal communities. Instead of one-sided parasocial relationships like with influencers, there would be a need to build a genuine rapport. You’d be avoided if you are seen as too desperate/pushy/have too much of an agenda. The job of a brand ambassador might indeed be a way in which people get an income when automation renders many of today’s jobs obsolete.   
  
Of course, a social movement like this would not stop the advancement of automation, which would by then be critical to modern infrastructure. But a sea-change in people’s attitudes would mean that it is no longer perceived as the ‘hot’ new field that attracts the young, passionate, and talented, and progress will slow. Energies might instead go to the fields involving climate change, which the younger generation would increasingly feel the effects of. The brain drain caused by this shift in priorities would probably be enough to make it so that whatever milestones people are expecting AI to hit, such as Artificial General Intelligence, would occur later rather than sooner. Predictions would be off by a couple of years, at least.

I am not saying that this would all happen with 100% certainty, or even with a 50% certainty. These past few years have been really unpredictable and a lot of things, good or bad, can still happen along the way.

And I won’t even say I see this as a good thing. As a lifelong nerd, I think I would be pretty sad and lonely in such a future because the internet, computers, and video games are where I have derived my livelihood and indeed much of my identity. If the online discourse surrounding Boomers is of any indication, people in the future would be talking about what horrible people we are for being hunched over, eyes glued to a screen and engrossed in an imaginary world while the real one burns to the ground around us, etc etc…

But what I am trying to suggest is the possibility between the two extremes of ‘post-scarcity VR paradise’ and ‘cyberpunk dystopia’. Both these extremes assume that the trends of today would continue unimpeded into the future, resulting in exponential growth. I am suggesting that this growth might have a slight S-curve to it… Everything new would one day become old, and the old might come back around and one day become new again."
1,2023-07-29,Unlimited economic growth is an absolute good that cannot be given up under any circumstances.,u/madrid987,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/15d9jzb/unlimited_economic_growth_is_an_absolute_good/,Futurology,"There are those who argue that we should give up economic growth because of the crisis caused by global warming, but I think they are wrong. This is because countries where economic growth has stopped tend to use fossil fuels as they are, in most cases, without paying attention to the activities they want to protect nature.   
  
Stopping or stopping growth is just the beginning of an endless struggle to kill and kill each other, a nuclear war to reduce each other's population on a large scale, and a prelude to massive starvation due to subzero summer temperatures caused by a subsequent nuclear winter.  
  
If there is a problem due to global warming, the best solution is to install solar energy harvesting facilities in large quantities to cope with it. Since the Korean peninsula is in an unfavorable regional location for change, such as low density of solar energy and increased frequency of typhoons and torrential rains due to climate change, solar energy harvesting facilities are installed in areas rich in solar energy, such as the central coast of Chile in Central America, and ammonia It is better to mass-produce and import them into Korea.  
  
Currently, water, the most abundant resource on Earth, can be used for solar energy harvesting, and in the future, solar energy harvesting facilities will be installed on the moon and silicate(SiO₂) , the most abundant material on the moon, will be pyrolyzed and transported to Earth to be burned. it will be possible  
  
In any case, no evidence has been found that infinite or exponential economic growth is scientifically impossible. Until the world population reaches 160 billion, this earth can sufficiently support that amount of population, and even when it reaches 1 trillion(One Trillion), there is enough land to support and accommodate the population."

If one day someone edit DNA of slime mold and insert into human brain, make it spread in brain and work as a tool to communicate with computer, isnt that more efficient than neuralink chip?

I’m doing up an essay on the subject and want to discuss these topics philosophically and realistically. I've only just begun reading and if anyone can spare a moment to satiate my curiosity, I would be deeply appreciative. 

With respect to everyone's research, what would it mean to be able to detect and remove such bio sensors or electronics from a living organism? 

What about graphene-based sensors? What does it mean to think about these materials when it comes to deciding whether or not to use one material over the other? 

Is there anything in the market that gives the patient the choice to remove or disable bio sensors?

How does one know the extent of side-effects or risks one might get when considering getting a bio sensor for personal uses? Augmentation or to prevent the worst from happening?

Have you come across any research that would be helpful in my journey to understand the above?"

AI will not replace the best of the best from human career, as according to ""Model Collapse"". No matter what is this model for, chat message, art generation or any pattern detection. The data set or the basis of how AI is created will still need the input of human.  
  
So imagine in long term future, everything is managed and created by AI.  
  
For artists, art creation will not just be created by one or a few human artists, it will be created by AI. However, the AI itself will still need to evolve. It will throw most of the mediocre data points away and pick the truly break-troughing and outlier art piece into its knowledge base. The artists entity will become a collective product of all the great artists contribution in the past and future.  
  
same thing for any other AI alternatives, the mediocre coders and developers will be forever replaced, but the one who can design the best system, who can write the best codes, the one who can lower the consumption of hardware capacity to save cost. Those engineers' created artifacts will be fed into the models, and the model will replace the majority of the engineers in current world. Same things for doctors and lawyers, managers even politicians, only the best of them need to contribute the data points to the models.

  
The ownership of career and everything will hugely revolutionized, instead of a career, a job you owned. You owned the data you fed to the model, as then you get compensated accordingly. All the titles/fame and classic corporation hierarchy will be gone forever. It's like everyone will be forced to become a freelancer some sort.

Crowd sourcing political consensus will be true possible. As AI will collect every citizens' will through a huge network and come up with the best policy according to every human participants among them.  
  
Continuous laboring process is completely gone and your only responsibility is contributing to the model itself to completement what the models cannot do, so you technically can work much much less than usual. At that period of time, crunching and rushing for deadlines will be pointless because quality will trump the quantity forever, so every career branch priority is out-pacing the model itself and help its evolving.  
  
  
Any job which have a clear mapping from problem to solution will be easily replaced, the harder and the more complicate of the path from problem to solution, the harder it will be replaced.  
  
In this case, those jobs below will not be replaced.  
  
1.High-end scientific research, researchers who has cumulated a lot of knowledge from certain field, regardless it is hard science or literature, will be forever valued by the society at that moment because they are the group of mind highly likely contributing to the model itself.  
  
2.Politic representative, who represents the human factors in political decision making and execution. Ideally, regardless you think it's dystopia or not, AI will highly likely replace parts of the human political system, but there will be system required human execution and interference. For example, AI may be making the decision but human executes the decision, (like law enforcement, AI gives command on who will be targeted as criminal, but human will be the one to act, human can then give feedback on AI's judgement to keep improving its functioning and integrity) Things like this will become a dynamic balance between the human factor and machine mixed in.  
  
In nature, human will always trust something they are more familiar with.  
  
3.High and delicate craftmanship, some very very custom made stuffs, like clay making, miniature crafting , silk weaving, sword crafting, cock-tailing, etc,etc. Similar to case one, only the best of the best will be left among them, as the machine itself will still have its limit to surpass the pinnacle of a true craft-master from human. Their works will be learnt by the machine and be easily manufactured and mass produced.  
  
4.Human Connection, companionship,  
  
At that time, a human and human interaction will still be demanded. People will need touch and face to face conversation as usual.  
  
There will be spots of works exclusively be performed by human, even productively it would be better be done by machine, because people still want to familiarity mixed in with their life. This will highly like go to service industry or any job requiring face to face contact.  
  
waiters, teachers, nursing, or even escort(regardless its sexual or not or just companionship), these jobs will highly likely still be performed by human.  
This is not a stretch, as in Japan there are careers that are paid to just share a drink with customers, nothing else and just talk and talk.

&#x200B;

Similarly, theaters performing groups, orchestrators, bands. Even robots may do a better jobs, there always being people need that nostalgia. "

And if so, is it avoidable? 

I have seen piers and roads washed away by the sea. Houses, entire neighborhoods. Sailboats and motor yachts laying on their sides, ripped from their moorings and deposited on the highway.  

this destruction I have witnessed was related to hurricane storm surge either accompanied by high wind or a more minor tropical storm-level surge with moderate wind, compounded by exceptionally high tides. The continuous movement of water is like a grinder, creating debris that grinds against things like houses until they too become debris. Exceptionally high sea levels almost always leave gigantic debris fields on sea and on land at the water's edge.  

As sea levels rise due to climate change, regardless of whether tropical storm surge is involved or not, areas like Coral Gables, FL, the lowest-lying communities of the Mississippi Delta, All barrier island communities, etc. will likely be vacated in the next 50 years. Then the structures of those communities, plus abandoned cars, garbage, etc. will be ground to bits gradually by wave action. Much of this debris will become the flotsam and jetsam of Earth's oceans. 

If the sea is full of massive amounts of debris, shipping may become too hazardous to be feasible. Offshore wind farms and desalinization plant intakes would be at risk of being ground up by logjams of debris, borne by wind and currents. Fishing, if there are any fish left by then, would be hampered tremendously as nets would round up tons of debris inadvertently. 

Is this our fate?
