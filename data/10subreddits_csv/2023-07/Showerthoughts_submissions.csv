The only thing that prevents our primal instincts from running rampant is our sense of self-righteousness. Our moral values are merely constructs devised to bolster our self-righteousness. Every action we undertake, whether deemed good, bad, or evil by ourselves or by other human beings, is ultimately aimed at proving our superiority over others. This sense of self-righteousness has never developed in any other animal species; they simply follow their instincts."

Thinking about it.. you could just bury someone anywhere on public property and put your own quick grave marker there. People coming by would just assume it's there with permission and people who own the place like a forest could possibly find it way too late.

Thinking even more about it.. maybe you could get a grave site even without an empty coffin for some missing person and then purposefully dig that one up when you need it.

1,2023-07-15,Cosmic Singularity and Accertion Disk,u/SabbyDude,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1507gld/cosmic_singularity_and_accertion_disk/,Showerthoughts,"According to a new cosmological model, the universe is not expanding, but rather revolving around a massive black hole at its center. This black hole, dubbed the Cosmic Singularity, is the ultimate source and destination of all matter and energy in the universe. The Cosmic Singularity is surrounded by multiple galaxies, such as the Milky Way, Andromeda, Triangulum, Whirlpool, Sombrero, and many others, that are slowly being accreted by the black hole. Accretion is the process of gas and dust falling into a black hole, forming a hot and luminous structure called an accretion disk. The accretion disk emits radiation that can be detected by telescopes across the electromagnetic spectrum. The closer the gas is to the black hole, the faster it moves and the more energy it radiates. The accretion rate of the Cosmic Singularity is very low, so it will take a trillon googol googol years for all the galaxies to be consumed by it. However, once that happens, the black hole will become so massive and dense that it will trigger a second Big Bang, creating a new universe with new physical laws and constants. This cycle of birth and death of universes is eternal, as energy can neither be created nor destroyed. This model is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy and the second law of thermodynamics, as well as with some observational evidence of gravitational lensing and redshift."

On top of that, beef cows require 15 gallons of drinking water per day and milk cows require 10-40 gallons. As watery scarcity increases, cow products will become more and more expensive.

Water companies will eventually reach a breaking point where it becomes unfeasible to expand the city water grid. This will cause land within city limits to become more valuable, thus driving up the price. The migration of people from areas negatively affected by drought, depleted ground water, and the depletion of surface-level freshwater will also drive up the cost in the areas people want to move to."

I think a lot of people who grew up with Harry Potter fantasized about going to Hogwarts and learning magic, but now that I think about it, that school is horrible. Most of the problems have to do with Salazar Slytherin, one of the founders of the school. Slytherin ingrained his beliefs into the schools social structure, and it has had horrible ramifications. Death Eaters recruit from Slytherin House. They continue to honor this man’s legacy. Why?
This man straight up trained a fucking magic snake to kill muggle students. The surveyors couldn’t find it’s chamber for centuries. IT WAS IN THE BATHROOM. They didn’t even check where the student died. No one even bothered to ask Myrtle. 

Imagine going to a school where students have died due to the intentional designs of the schools founder. Imagine going to a school in which a large number of graduates become mass murderers. If this school was real, it would be shut down and burned to the ground."

Key points:

#1 Only the strong have the luxury of being nice because they have the capacity to fight back when that niceness inevitably ends up on a predators radar.
#2 Being nice while weak is perceived as being disingenuous. Many weak people use niceness to survive, henze niceness needs power to be perceived as a choice. 
#3 you will never get ahead in life purely by being nice, assholes will use any means to get what they want including stomping on the weak nice guy. 
#4 assholes are respected for their bold honesty and strength and do not have a need to seem nice to be liked. 

Edit: i am not romanticizing the assholes the world just happen to favor them."

This feeling that comes with goosebumps has been well known for thousands of years by people in the east but in the west, every information on such occurrence, has been meticulously guided to make you think that it is nothing more than a physical occurrence.  


Why?  


  
Because taking control of this very response, which is possible and has been achievable by Easterners who practice the control of their spiritual energy, is the key to your psychic senses.  


  
Any body with a mature mind could tell you what effects, the simple act of being able to use your senses from your spirit, would have on this illusioned concept of society the rulers of the western world have created to separate us from the truth.  


  
All this talk of psychic senses, spiritual energy and spirit might be a lot for anyone to accept, nevertheless, it all boils down to that positive feeling you get when you experience goosebumps.  


  
The physical reaction of goosebumps comes from your feeling of ecstasy, that feeling does not come from it. This means that you can, just like I and many others have done, separate that feeling from that physical reaction and gain access to the many properties that range from physical to spiritual benefits.  


  
Of course one of them is to be able to tap into your psychic senses.  


  
Now to see where it all comes together, this ecstasy feeling has has been researched and documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pitī, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.  


  
If you are interested in learning more about how your spiritual energy deals with your psychic senses, here's a short [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X-TjX9F_rY) going more in-depth on it all.

Moderate beer drinkers are just doing the same thing as trans girls but in slow motion.

We ignore people who are two feet in front of us because we're looking into the palantir to see what is happening with people across the world. We ignore businesses that are two miles away from us because we're staring into the palantir for what we can find on Amazon across the country. We ignore community functions that are 10 miles away from us because we're staring into the palantir for what groups are doing in their community 1000 miles away. We ignore opinions and lives of who know us the most (family) because we're staring into the palantir to get opinions and make internet friends with people 3000 miles away on social media (like the site we're on, or wherever else).  
  
And the list goes on.  
  
And in aggregate, we're all much worse off for the palantirs/smartphones existing. Yes, yes, some people can resist and all that jazz. This isn't a perfect metaphor, but the more we use the palantir/smartphone, the less fulfilling and meaningful our lives seem."

Kramer - Sanguine

Elaine - Meloncholic

George - Choleric

Seinfeld is always making sure the others are getting along.  He tends to arrange get togethers.  He will oppose a character, usually in the name of being friendly to someone else.

Kramer is spontaneous, chaotic and aggressive about his beliefs in a variety of things.

Elaine tends to go with the flow.  She'll only interject when the chaos reaches macro levels, or when her ability to flow along is being disrupted.

George panics when things aren't perfect.  He panics when he can't read somebody's mind.  He tends to fret over minor details."
