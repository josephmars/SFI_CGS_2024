The developer now leads a non-profit organization aimed at coordinating AI and machine learning systems with “human interests.” He also expressed concern about the process by which AI will reach human logic and creativity. “Perhaps we are talking about a 50% chance of disaster soon after the advent of systems at the level of human intelligence,” he added."

These AIs are just getting started, and we're counting on them being used by the right people. But it's inevitable that people with dubious motivations will use them. There's no way Russia isn't working on using an AI to control US elections already. We're about to go from having 20% fake social media accounts to having 99% fake accounts, billions of which can be controlled by a single person. 

There's no reason an AI with the right training won't be able to churn out new accounts constantly, thousands, maybe millions a day? With fake pictures of non-existent people visiting countries that don't exist, who seem to have years' worth of posts, comments, replies, all seemingly human? Will we want to use social media knowing that almost everything we're seeing is completely fake? instagram filters are bad enough, but pretty soon everything about those accounts will be completely generated, and entirely convincing.

There's no reason an AI wouldn't be able to make a million fake news websites with faked journalists who seem to have complete biographies, who seem to have written hundreds of articles over the decades. AI ""sources"" will be corroborating each other, making it difficult if not impossible for real journalists to get accurate information through the internet. Will we get news from the internet if we know it can't be reliable? How would we able to trust sites like wikipedia that could be taken over by AI editors who can create a new body of information? Schools already can't trust an essay written at home, and it's likely that the sources of info will be corrupted too, making education much more difficult.

There's no reason an AI wouldn't be able to start spending money, investing it, profiting, using that profit to expand its investment reach, and creating a stable system of money flowing through the internet that no one has access to because it never sits in an account. What are the chances it won't become the richest ""person"" on the planet in a matter of months, and tank any economy that accidentally gets in the way?

These things don't feel like a stretch to me at all. They feel entirely inevitable, and within a couple short years if that. For decades people have been worried about sentient robots destroying humanity by outsmarting us, but I'm more concerned about these ""stupid"" AIs that will almost certainly overrun the internet and make it completely worthless."

We don't have to believe anything of what they say, because no one controls the future. We also don't have to believe that it will cause any positive aspects to happen, but what possibilites are there?

Often I see people saying AI are already aware, because they can think. Awareness and thinking are two separate things. The force behind awareness is much stronger than the force behind thinking, that became very clear to me when my father passed away. Words will never do life justice.

I see a future where people and machines are more or less the same, except I can't really see AI ever getting a real consciousness/awareness. A future where there is equality, good quality of life, time and freedom to do whatever you want. The picture from the meme ""what society would look like if we didn't..."" is pretty close to what I imagine. Maybe even intergalactic travel will be possible. Who knows what's out there?

We would like to introduce you to Joseon, the first legally recognized cyber nation state in the world!

**Breaking this down**

**Definitions:**

Nation state - a sovereign state

Sovereignty \- possessing absolute power

Cyber \- of or relating to cyberspace

Legally recognized state \- international law dictates that a state is not a state until another recognized state confirms this to be such, typically through diplomatic relations.

**Who are we**

Joseon is the successor to the Joseon Empire which was founded in 1392. As a cyber nation state, Joseon does not seek any land in the physical world, including but not limited to the Korean Peninsula which it believes belongs to the Korean people and hopes that one day the US will fully relinquish control but leaves that issue to the people who live on the peninsula.

[https://www.joseon.com/l/en-US/government/ministries-of-chosen](https://www.joseon.com/l/en-US/government/ministries-of-chosen)

[https://imperialfamily.kr/](https://imperialfamily.kr/)

**How is this possible**

Joseon never ceased its existence. Although an “Annexation” treaty was signed in 1910 with Japan, technically the signers were both under belligerent threat of bayonet and also were not actually signatories for Joseon. In international law, the threat of force cannot end a nation. Further, in 1965, a treaty signed by ROK and Japan made clear that the 1910 treaty was invalid and deemed to be legally null and void.

Joseon confirmed its continued existence with a treaty with Antigua and is continuing to build more diplomatic relations with many announcements to come in the coming months.

As there are many ‘seasteading’ and ‘unclaimed’ land projects that have struggled to gain any recognition, including many of which were backed by billionaires, we feel that we’ve reached a significant milestone!

**We made it to the starting line as a nation state that’s been accepted into the family of nations!**

**Why are we doing this**

1. Technological Innovations (AI, cryptography, cryptocurrency, among others) are hindered by old and/or not so well thought out legislation. Generally, non-technologists are drafting this legislation, and while made with good intent, these regulations naively stop progress in its tracks.
   1. As a nation state, we make our own legislation wherein people and companies may subject themselves. Our legislation is meant to be non-burdensome and is driven by the technology and actions that take place because of it allowing for maximum innovation.
2. While cryptocurrency as a technology is real and helps to provide freedom to man, many scam projects have muddied the ecosystem and poor regulations are stopping global adoption.
   1. Joseon, as a nation-state, has the inherent right to mint its own currency. It has opted to mint said currency as a cryptocurrency. This gives Joseon Mun, our legal currency, the properties of a foreign currency in other jurisdictions combined with the freedom and fairness of a cryptocurrency. **This is the first unbannable cryptocurrency.** I am personally not receiving any allocation of any kind in order to quell any potential misunderstandings or libel about our intent. My note on this is here \[1\].
3. Koreans have generally lived a life not knowing why things are hard for them due to the censorship of their history. Further, the cultural legacy is dissipating quickly and being replaced by a weaker western culture.
   1. Without knowledge of history, these events could easily occur again. As the original motherland of all Koreans, Joseon is not inundated with a need to appease global hegemonies. As such, the truth about the history we have suffered by the hands of a very different (or maybe not so much at this point) colonial US will be shared loudly and publicly.
   2. We have continued to represent the Joseon cultural legacy through the years. Our most recent contribution is a statue of our very own Great King Sejong being installed at the Los Angeles Community College \[2\].
4. In westphalian sovereignty today, sovereignty is determined by borders and ownership of territory. If someone or something is inside said territory, then it is subject to the sovereign jurisdiction of said territory. In this new internet era, we’ve gone back to the pre-westphalian method which is based on consent and allegiance - someone is subject to a sovereign jurisdiction because it agrees to be. When a citizen of Brazil registers a company in Malta, that company is subject to the laws in Malta, not Brazil.  Further, when that person takes actions on behalf of the company, those actions are also governed by the laws of Malta.

**How is Joseon separating us from our physical jurisdiction and giving us freedom?**

Using the same concept of ‘ownership of legal actions’ and ‘sovereignty’ as it relates to corporations, Joseon introduces a new concept called the personal interest corporation which we have named “Denizen” in our jurisdiction.

Common jurisprudence dictates that a company is subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is domiciled and located. Since Joseon is a legally recognized nation, it has enacted legislation allowing for people to create a “Denizen” inside Joseon. Since the physical person is an agent of the Denizen, when it takes actions for the Denizen, the actions the physical person takes are legally attributed as actions of the Denizen. Thus, a person can physically be located in a nation-state, but his/her actions as an agent of the Denizen on the internet will be subject to the laws of Joseon which are significantly more free than anywhere else in this world.

In April, non-oil business activity surged on the back of new business strength, highlighting the success of the UAE's efforts to build a more diversified economy. As the country continues to invest in non-oil activities, it is well-positioned to weather any future fluctuations in the oil market and secure a more stable economic future."

It's often assumed that if we brought someone from the past, say the 1800s, into the present day, they would be completely overwhelmed by our technology and way of life. Modern conveniences like smartphones, TVs, cars, and airplanes would likely blow their minds.

However, I've been thinking that if we were to take someone from today and transport them 100s of years into the future, they might handle the experience better than their historical counterpart. The fast-paced nature of technological advancements in recent decades might have better prepared us for the shock of an even more advanced future.

What do you think? Would someone from today be better equipped to adapt to the future than someone from the past would be to our present? Or would both individuals face equally overwhelming challenges?"

The shortage of trade jobs lead to higher wages.

In fact, it may cause a sudden huge shift for high school kids to no longer want to go to college and instead go to trade school. First, those jobs, tends to pay pretty well without being in significant debt. also, the only reason to think about going to college would only really to be in fields like STEM or medicine(including nursing,psych, and social worker), and maybe law. Currently today we’re seeing a trend of Americans going to college at a lower rate due to concerns with debt. AI eliminating jobs would only add fuel to this fire. Also we have a significant shortage of skilled trade workers.

Edit: I’m assuming this will be continued advances in LLM and we’re still not near AGI levels. Also I’m talking about in the next 10 years. It’s a pie in the sky what happens after that."

Anyway I personally believe consciousness is directly linked to evolved organic life. Even if we'll create advanced AI, or general AI, it's still going to be a piece of silicon computing, as well as dear old calculators are doing calculations impossible for the human mind. The calculator is a piece of plastic and silicon doing amazingly difficult calculations, but it has no consciousness. The same for a LLM software, great at predicting text, but still a piece of plastic and silicon, with no consciousness. An AI may for example be able to code and spread a software virus that will cause great havoc on the whole worldwide internet: still, it has no consciousness. It can be aimed at taking control of power plants, and it may sort out smart ways to do that: still, it has no consciousness. It may destroy the world: still, it has no consciousness. AIs are just very advanced human tools, like an atomic bomb, and yes they can be very dangerous. But, like an atomic bomb, they have no consciousness."

It seems that, at-least in the short term, there might be less displacement in those countries.

The countries which I feel like might experience the most disruption, would be rich countries with smaller populations, such as Canada, Iceland, and New Zealand. Due to their small population and service sector dominated jobs, it would be easier to outsource and automate most labor. These countries would also have a small road network, allowing robotaxis to become quickly capable

Bigger richer countries like USA and the continent of Europe, may experience less disruption, since they have a bigger population, and more local governments and bureaucratic bodies hindering adoption of AI.

I think, if there will be a futuristic utopia, It will be first realized in those rich, small populated countries. Most likely with a negative tax rate as a pseudo UBI."

One intriguing idea that caught my attention is the emergence of decentralized and distributed organizations, like cooperatives and self-governing communities. These models seem to offer an alternative to traditional top-down hierarchies, potentially fostering greater collaboration, autonomy, and inclusivity.

I'm curious about your thoughts on this matter. What do you think the advantages and challenges of these new organizational models are? Can they effectively replace our current systems, or do you think they'll complement them in some way? Any real-world examples you know of that are already making the switch?"

21,2023-05-08,Are jobs actually getting more and more scarce each time there is a technological disruption?,u/pehnsus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/13by8ru/are_jobs_actually_getting_more_and_more_scarce/,Futurology,"I was wondering, for every technological disruption happening are people actually able to adapt? Or is this not the case and job opportunities are actually decreasing 

For example, during the Industrial Revolution everything transitioned to machine-based manufacturing and steam engines and factory jobs were made. So people still had jobs.

Then the discovery of electricity happened, light bulbs were made, generators, industrial motors, electrical transformers were created. And electrical/electronics engineering jobs were created.

When the car was created, mechanics and factory worker jobs were created and people who were riding horses transitioned to driving cars. So again, people do still have jobs.

Then the information age happened, we have computers, so manual book keeping and accounting jobs for example were displaced. So these bookkeepers and accountants basically just adapted to use computers and then the demand for digital skills were needed and also created new jobs like software and web development etc.

And finally we have artificial intelligence. Now what would happen if this time you have all of that technological upgrade and this time generative AI will do the work for you? Yikes.

Let’s say you are a writer and you transitioned from using a typewriter, then to a personal computer, and then the computer actually doing the writing for you this time? 

Or say you are an artist, you did hand crafted art, then digital art, now all you need to do is prompt a generative AI image software to create your art.

Sure, ChatGPT, Midjourney, and other generative artificial intelligence are there. Let’s say the scenario is similar to how people adapted to all technological disruptions, will more jobs be created? Will businesses start booming creating more jobs for people just like past technological disruptions? I know these events create both job losses and job gains but I know the ratio is not 1:1. 

I don’t know but it all feels sort of like an endgame scenario. But what do you guys think?"

3,2023-05-10,Social effects of technological change?,u/SkiingPenguin44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/13dklv5/social_effects_of_technological_change/,Futurology,"I think the following are fairly conservative predictions of technological change in the future:

1. Effective and safe human anti-aging tech: 20 years.

2. Safe and healthy human reproduction of female babies from female only DNA/parents: 15-20 years.

3. Human or super human level AGI (technological singularity): 40-50 years.

4. Safe and healthy human genome trait manipulation to create ""enhanced"" children: 20-30 years.

5. Almost unlimited potential for human genome manipulation and ability to safely change almost any aspect of human biology (with help from AGI): 40-60 years.

So the question must arise: what will be the social changes and effect on mankind as a whole caused by these developments?

### Anti-aging

When anti-aging tech arrives, I think it would be considered extremely unfair if anti-aging tech is available to some people but not others. Therefore I think that the global community will have to come to agreement on how or if this tech should be utilised. The human race will have to ask itself: ""How long should the future human lifespan be?"" If it is too long then we will have a world full of old people with no room for children and I think that that's a world that few people would want to live in. I think the world will have to come to global agreement that no human should be allowed to use this tech beyond a certain age, perhaps 120 years old?

### Female reproduction

With the arrival of female only reproduction it will become technically possible for the human race to continue to survive and evolve without males at all. Some female couples will decide to have children this way and the question of whether the human race could or should become a single sex species of females only will be seriously discussed, starting in perhaps only 15 years.

### Designer babies

As with anti-aging tech, the ability to genetically ""enhance"" children will become something that would be seen as extremely unfair if it's available to some people but not others. What happens when your child comes home from school and asks ""Why wasn't I genetically enhanced like the other children? They are all extremely intelligent and super good looking and I feel like a neanderthal in comparison, it's not fair!"" There cannot be two classes of human, enhanced super intelligent, good looking people and ""natural"" people. Again, this is a technology that the human race will have to decide as a whole how to use.

### Profound questions

As for even more advanced genome manipulation in perhaps 40-60 years, what if you could ""design"" your baby to have any hair color, any body shape, to design almost any physical trait/quality even skin color? When you can even choose the race of your baby, what race would you choose and why? What should be the rules and limits of this technology? Should parents be able to design their children any way they like or should the welfare, opportunities in life and sense of fairness of the child be the priority and therefore what constraints should be put on the parents when ""designing"" their child? These are existential questions that the human race as a whole will have to ask itself - we will have to come to agreement as a species about what it will mean to even ""be human"" in the future.  When almost anything is possible, we will have to decide as a species what the human race is to become and the limits of our genetic enhancements. Should all humans converge on similarity or diverge into greater genetic differences between people and why?. I don't think that it's easy to overstate the profundity of these questions and these questions will have to be answered in the remainder of this century, perhaps in only 40 years."

The Futurology community appears to encompass a variety of frames for the future, ranging from transhumanism, techno-utopianism, to others. There are also many contrasting perspectives in communities such as r/collapse, albeit they are far less present here. 


With an awareness of the spectrum of these, I’m wondering how one might best go about creating a map of these various frames, ideologies, or social movements, positive or negative (towards a likelihood of progress or civilization collapse). I’m not entirely sure how best to structure this or what to include, but [I’ve started creating a map here](https://imgur.com/gallery/AGxlAt1) and would be very interested in anyone’s feedback in terms of what to include. 

The Y-axis isn’t currently used, so the placement is not indicative of anything. Anyone is welcome to add to or edit the chart [with this link as well!](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/8d6c2484-d81f-49cd-b7ad-47ce21f0ad9f/edit?viewport_loc=2076%2C2049%2C2862%2C1146%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_2ba1a9db-c5aa-4c3a-9fb4-1073af484480\))"

I do not really think so, at least not in the way they would, if it was between 2003 and 2013. They would be asking, ""why is everything so much smaller?"" Saying how cool it is that you can use apps on your thin phone. Talk about how cool it is to be able to 3D print things in your home or fly a drone.

Everything between 1973-2003 was already around. There was a brick phone in 1973, but it did not take off until 1990 and became smaller around 2000. Video games came out in 1972, they would only look better in 2003. TVs would look pretty much the same. Computers would look very much alike, the coding systems improved and games for them already existed in the 1950s, they just looked progressively better. The internet already existed as ARPANET. 

How long would it take for someone put into statis in 2013, to notice any significant changes?"

If so, how can we preserve it?",u/Test19s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/13imzzr/is_there_a_risk_of_the_world_losing_some_of_the/,Futurology,"Full disclosure: Much of my ancestry comes from European Jews or other native European minorities, so I'm extra sensitive to discrimination on the basis of birth or ancestry.

Admittedly it's a bit of a cheat to start after *the absolute moral nadir of western civilization with colonialism/WWII*, but the period beginning in 1945 (and either ending with Covid or continuing to the present - trends aren't clear yet) saw pretty incredible gains in world peace, development, and human rights even if there were still localized wars and genocides (Korea, Vietnam, Pol Pot, Mao, Idi Amin, Bosnia, Rwanda, etc) and disasters and pandemics (AIDS and a couple flu pandemics, the Great Recession, the Japanese and Indian ocean tsunamis, and the Bangladeshi famine). Any indicator of year-on-year war deaths, poverty, or life expectancy on a global scale would show that this period was a golden age for organic humanity, and the last three decades in particular saw incredible progress in the developing world that has allowed them to at least partly converge with the West.

However, I have concerns that we may see a return to older ways of interacting across national, ethnic, and ancestral (""race"" as it's called in American English) lines. I'll list some:

-AI and genetic testing are getting better at capturing the small biological differences that exist between regional ethnic and linguistic groups.

-The trade share of world GDP [has never fully recovered from 2008,](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/trade-gdp-ratio) and although data cut off in 2021 we have seen a lot of skepticism of multinational and multi-continental supply chains.

-Although in theory a baby bust in developed countries would increase support for immigration, supply issues (housing especially, but also infrastructure and natural resources) as well as racist propaganda and the fast dropoff of birthrates in all but the poorest and most illiterate countries make such a degree of mass permanent migration controversial. 

-Automation could destabilize job markets further, especially if resources remain finite and humans and robots/AI compete for them. The impact on working-class populations, particularly service and mundane office work, could easily disadvantage the already poorer and historically disadvantaged.

-Collective action problems (from the regulation of the AI to managing the climate and public health) are widespread in the 2020s, and may become more so as we have less access to cheap trade, cheap resources, and cheap credit. Some economists argue that societies with more diversity in language, ancestry, religion, etc. cannot navigate them as well.

-The notion that nuclear-armed, essential trading partners will respect one another's interests is a bit less clear with the various economic conflicts involving Russia and China. 

-Unscientifically, I've noticed more countries behaving like caricatures of themselves. The days when the BRICS countries were regarded as the future of the global economy appear to have passed.

So, is there a non-negligible risk of us losing some of the strides we've made since 1945? And if so, are there things we can do to prevent it?"

Also, it appears that artificial neurons can be integrated into biological systems: 
https://youtu.be/1zLyGb0xl7I

So, i see it this way: 
We send/place an artificial neuron near an old/dying natural neuron and have it copy the neural connections existing with its neighbouring neurons, so that when the natural one dies, the connections remain.
Repeat for other neurons.
Progresively replace all natural neurons with artificial ones, effectively achieving immortality.

31,2023-05-20,Meritocracy and Inequality: From Divine Grace to Artificial Intelligence,u/masterile,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/13mm160/meritocracy_and_inequality_from_divine_grace_to/,Futurology,"Meritocracy, as a system where effort and individual ability are rewarded, has often been hailed as the ideal method for determining an individual's economic and social status. This system argues that anyone can climb the socioeconomic ladder if they demonstrate merit and effort. However, this paradigm, despite its apparent appeal, has largely served as a discourse to justify existing economic inequality, raising questions about its viability and fairness in the age of artificial intelligence.

The premise of meritocracy is that everyone has equal opportunities for success, however, this overlooks the reality that not everyone begins on a level playing field. Factors such as the family one is born into, the community one is raised in, access to quality education, and physical and mental capabilities, which are not chosen, can significantly influence an individual's opportunities for success. Therefore, meritocracy, in its current form, can perpetuate inequality by failing to address these initial disparities.

Throughout history, different discourses have been used to justify social hierarchies. For example, in earlier times, ""divine grace"" was often invoked as the reason for an individual's position in society. This view held that the upper classes were blessed by God and, therefore, had the right to rule over the less fortunate.

Today, with the rapid development and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into all facets of life, the concept of meritocracy is being tested once again. AI, with its ability to outperform human ability in various fields, poses an existential threat to meritocracy as we know it. When machines can perform tasks better and more efficiently than humans, how is individual merit valued?

We may need a new ideological system to justify and structure our society in the AI age. While it is difficult to predict exactly what form this system will take, it is likely that it will have to address issues of inequality and access to opportunities in a more comprehensive and equitable way than the current meritocracy.

Perhaps the future ideological system will focus more on the equitable distribution of resources, recognizing that individual merit alone is not sufficient to guarantee success in an increasingly AI-dominated society. This system could value cooperation and social solidarity more, rather than individual competition.

In summary, meritocracy, despite its appearance of fairness, has proven problematic in its application, often serving as an excuse to perpetuate economic inequality. As we move towards an era increasingly dominated by AI, we need a new discourse."

I don't want to live forever, but I'd be down to living couple hundred years looking like I am in my 30s-50s, mainly because I want to see the space exploration age before I die.

Hello, fellow Redditors,

I'd like to share and gather thoughts on an innovative proposal aimed at addressing the inherent flaws of capitalism, promoting equitable distribution of resources, and aligning humanity towards the shared goal of space exploration. This revolutionary system hinges on integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), alternative economic models, democratic decision-making, and the ambition of space exploration.

**1. The Problem**

Despite its successes, capitalism, as it exists today, has its shortcomings. These include the concentration of wealth, exploitation, and environmental degradation, which are perpetuated by the underlying ethos of competition and self-interest. This system often leads to societal inequality, fosters greed, and can push us towards self-extinction.

**2. Literature Review**

The proposed system draws on recent advancements in AI, alternative economic models, and space exploration. AI has shown promising results in managing tasks and resources, from project management to city planning. Various economic models have been proposed to address capitalism's limitations. Space exploration, as a shared societal goal, has the potential to unite humanity towards a common objective that promotes cooperation over competition.

**3. Proposed System**

The proposed system leverages a highly sophisticated AI to manage and delegate tasks. It allocates rewards (in the form of the system's currency) based on task difficulty and importance towards the end goal of space exploration. This currency, capped at 21 million to prevent inflation, also serves as a voting mechanism, creating a direct link between economic and political power. The AI redistributes the currency used in voting to promote economic equity. The system allows for interaction with capitalist economies to gain initial traction and resources, requiring approval from the community for capitalist participation.

**4. Analysis and Implementation**

The implementation of such a comprehensive system will undoubtedly face significant challenges. The AI must be designed to be impartial and incorruptible, which requires robust and transparent algorithms, and likely an accountability mechanism. Achieving widespread adoption and acceptance will involve overcoming resistance from those benefitting from the current system. Legal and regulatory considerations will need to be addressed, requiring extensive review of current laws and regulations, and potentially lobbying for changes. Careful negotiation and cooperation with capitalists will be required to gain initial traction and resources. And finally, the significant resources, expertise, and international cooperation necessary for space exploration must not be underestimated.

**5. Conclusion**

This proposed system represents an audacious vision to address the issues rooted in our current capitalist society. Despite the formidable challenges, it is through tackling such obstacles that societal evolution can occur. The system must be continually evaluated and refined to ensure it serves the best interests of all members of society. If successful, we may be steering towards a future of equality, collaboration, and shared prosperity. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas on this proposed system!

---

**TL;DR:** A revolutionary system is proposed to address the flaws of capitalism, promoting more equitable distribution of resources and uniting humanity behind the shared goal of space exploration. This system leverages AI for task management and resource allocation, uses currency as a voting mechanism, allows for interaction with capitalist economies for initial traction, and continually redistributes wealth to prevent accumulation. Despite significant challenges, such a system could transform our economic structures and societal values, steering us towards a future of equality, collaboration, and shared prosperity."
35,2023-05-21,"Anyone looking forward to ""The Singularity Papers""?",u/mjrossman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/13o845i/anyone_looking_forward_to_the_singularity_papers/,Futurology,"I just watched the recent U.S. Senate hearing about licensing and regulating AI, and the vibes were...off.

one of the major issues that came up was potential cascade of misinformation that is very cheap to manufacture at scale. while this is a concern, I think something was being said between the lines. sometimes things are defined as ""criminal"", ""illegal"", ""misinformation"" not because they are objectively, ethically wrong, but because there's some status quo that's being threatened. I think the recent talks of suppressing AI research are about a small cohort of society trying to not lose control over the flow of information and global literacy.  
here's some background:

* 1971 - [Pentagon Papers are published](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers). [from this summary](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/weekinreview/25-years-later-lessons-from-the-pentagon-papers.html), ""the Pentagon Papers had demonstrated, among other things, that the Johnson Administration had ""systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress.""
* 1986 - [Iran-Contra affair is revealed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair#Discovery_and_scandal). After a leak by Mehdi Hashemi, a senior official in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Lebanese magazine Ash-Shiraa exposed the arrangement.
* 2003 - [the Plame affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plame_affair) occurs because the husband of Valerie Plame (a covert CIA officer at the time) [publishes an op-ed refuting some justification](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/opinion/what-i-didn-t-find-in-africa.html) for the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
* 2013- [Snowden leaks details of global surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)). goes into exile because of retaliation.
* 2014- [Senate report on torture releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Intelligence_Committee_report_on_CIA_torture). [a previous whistleblower is imprisoned](https://abcnews.go.com/International/cia-operative-prison-punishment-whistleblowing-torture/story?id=27474359) prior to release.
* 2016 - [The Panama Papers release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers), detailing a tax haven for the wealthy & government officials. the whistleblower ""said the documents were leaked '[simply because I understood enough about their contents to realize the scale of the injustices they described](https://money.cnn.com/2016/05/06/news/economy/panama-papers-john-doe-manifesto/index.html)'.
* 2017- [Harvey Weinstein's sexual abuse is revealed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein_sexual_abuse_cases). multiple witnesses come forward, despite gag orders and the heavy implication that they would be retaliated against. more victims of sexual abuse by other perpetrators come forward as the reporting/whistleblowing gains momentum.
* 2019- [Varsity Blues college admissions scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Blues_scandal) is revealed, showing that some wealthy parents indirectly bribed college officials and faked test scores to get their children into colleges like USC

these are just some notable examples, but make no mistake, there's a bunch of examples where journalists reveal power and wealth being abused. even now, there's subreddits like /r/ElonJetTracker, though not necessarily revealing wrongdoing, still demonstrate a hard-to-suppress public awareness over one of the richest, most powerful individuals on the planet.

also consider all the developments past 2020, like [the George Floyd protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests), the [aftermath of the U.S. general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election), the drama of /r/wallstreetbets. right now, more people are getting bolder, because they're not advocating or whistleblowing on their own anymore. right now, LLMs are scaled up to the extent that models like [GPT-4 can handle every commonly spoken language around the globe](https://decentralizedcreator.com/list-of-all-language-supported-by-chatgpt/). moving forward, it'll be easier for automated correspondence with firsthand sources, and easier for whistleblowers to evade retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. where sources get corroborated and fact-checked at scale, a free, credibly-neutral narrative will percolate through the public more extensively. 

right now, researchers [are parsing massive documents like SEC filings](https://medium.com/llamaindex-blog/testing-anthropic-claudes-100k-token-window-on-sec-10-k-filings-473310c20dba). it's easier now to [report union-busting](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/the-union-busting-practices-that-landed-starbucks-in-hot-water), especially since [so many new unions are forming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_Joe%27s_unions). I don't think we've really seen the main body of developments that will occur in the coming months and years, but it all comes back to the increased ability of the public, with tools like AI, to create transparency and accountability of our own choosing. everyone can make their own podcast or blog, but with the recent developments, I think it's actually the ability for everyone to hire their own journalism team, or facilitate more whistleblowing. it's no secret that a lot of people have been silenced and a lot of rumors have been swept under the rug, but now the cost of wholly suppressing such information, or ""burying the lede"", will skyrocket. I think we're about to see [a Streisand effect on steroids](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/05/20/twenty-years-ago-today-barbra-streisand-sued-a-photographer-and-the-streisand-effect-was-born/). 

I will admit that ""The Singularity Papers"" may not be a single release like in the past. I think as time progresses, this will just be **the moniker of a time period where governments, the wealthy, and the powerful move to suppress AI tooling for journalistic movements because ""it's creating misinformation"", and the subsequent chain of events where suppression of massive public accountability fails spectacularly.**

How long do you think it would take for legislative bodies to remove the need for a driving license if you purchase a car with FSD capabilities?  
  
At present, I don't own a car or a license, as I reside in the heart of a major city, and it would be more of a burden than a benefit. However, I'm curious to know if this will become a reality within my lifetime. Living in the EU, it's common knowledge that there is often a resistance to adopting new technologies such as autonomous driving or AI. Hence, my belief is that while Americans might be taking pleasure cruises across the continent in their FSD vehicles, we may still be obliged to drive manually due to a sense of responsibility."

The future is probably going to be vastly different from what it is now. No one has a clear idea yet whether this will be for the good or bad.

As a society, we tend to put our hopes and fears into the unknown because that is the one area where both can be true at the same time. Yet we tend to dismiss how the way things currently are limit what those things can be.

For example, the internet had to possibility to be so much more than it is today. It could've been a technology that is considered a basic right for participating in a society so it is provided for free and it could've been a place where privacy and user control are valued above all else. But obviously, that isn't the world that we are living in today because the society in which we used to build the internet wasn't structured in a way that would make those things feasible in the long run.

Technology is a double-edged sword and the direction it points at is up to us. Since we are starting to build technology that is more powerful than what we have ever built before this question is really important.

But really all of this is something you probably have heard so many times so what is it that I am actually advocating we do?

Well the biggest problem to me is that when a large group of people have the same goal there is usually a lack of coordination and clarity on what specific actions an individual can take to help with that goal. And even when there is an organization to pursue these goals it becomes a hassle to keep up and engage in every aspect that is important to the goal and makes it very vulnerable to corruption. So I am proposing that we fix that.

I have something in the works that is trying to solve this so that anyone would be able to download an open source app and make their group more effective and would love to work with other people to help bring this to fruition. My DMs are open.

But beyond what I am working on, I want to discuss the main idea in the title and what you think we should do to make sure that technology starts working for us instead of controlling us.

Edits: Made the call to action more clear on what I am working on."

Hey Reddit,

I wanted to share a fascinating concept called ""Whole Brain Reintegration"" that could potentially revolutionize how we approach aging and consciousness. The idea revolves around gradually replacing sections of the biological brain with modular chips, allowing us to transcend the limitations of our physical bodies.

Imagine a future where essential brain regions, like the hippocampus responsible for memory and learning, can be seamlessly replaced by electronic circuits that function identically to their biological counterparts.

Neuroprosthetics are already making progress. A proof of concept for usage in humans was developed in 2018. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6576290/ 

This achievement paves the way for the gradual replacement of brain regions, resulting in a transfer of our consciousness onto a machine without noticeable changes.

Whole brain reintegration offers a potential solution for achieving immortality without compromising consciousness or creating mere copies of ourselves. While ethical and technical challenges remain, this approach presents a promising avenue to extend our cognitive existence beyond the confines of our biological bodies.

I invite you to join me in exploring this concept further and discussing the implications it may have on our understanding of aging, consciousness, and the future of humanity.

Let's dive into this thought-provoking topic together and share our insights on the possibilities and challenges associated with whole brain reintegration. Together, we can shape a future where aging becomes conquerable, and our conscious experiences persist far beyond the boundaries of mortality.

Looking forward to your thoughts and contributions!

Update:
This post has received 40 likes and about 60 comments, the most i was expecting was two or three people responding halfheartedly. I'm surprised by the overwhelming  contributions, questions and thought provoking discussions by all of you.
Thank you for this. You all made my day. I read every single word of every single comment ."

The incredible thing here is that the bot writes scripts for itself that makes it better at playing the game. So if it meets a spider, it writes a script for how to kill that spider. Once that script is working, it adds that ""skill"" to it's ""skill library"". Over time it keeps advancing and developing better abilities.  


It's skill library is also transferable to other AI agents like AutoGPT.

This seems like it has a lot of implications for the future of software development.  This is able to generate code and keep making it better without human help. Everything is automated.  


Here's a video overview:  
[https://youtu.be/7yI4yfYftfM](https://youtu.be/7yI4yfYftfM)  


  
GPT-4 here is used as a sort of ""reasoning engine"". It decides on what to do in the game, but also it creates the code to make itself better and add new skills for it to use.

  
Another thing is GPT-4 doesn't have vision. All the data is fed into it through a text prompt.

  
It's told ""you have a fishing rod, you are standing next to a river, and around you are blocks of sand, and a pig. What do you want to do?"".

  
What does this mean for software developers?

  
It seems like GPT-4 can now autonomously create, test and optimize code. It decides on what it needs to do like:  
""Craft 1 Stone Ax""

  
Then it writes the JavaScript code to make that happen, tests to make sure it's working and then adds it to a library that it can use later.

  
It works like a developer, thinking through the task, developing and testing code and continuously optimizing the entire application to make sure it's working well and getting updated.  
  


It seems like this would rapidly replace developers. You still need some sort of a person that sets up the environment for the AI to start and then also maybe ""babysits"" it to make sure it's not going off the rails, but overall it seems like it will largely do it's own work."

Even the metahumans from UE5 - ordinary people can easily tell that they are not real.

Is it due to the lack of computing power or the lack of research in the proper algorithms required to enable this, but why don't we yet have the technology to create photorealistic CGI NPCs/humans that are indistinguishable from real humans?

I am not talking about the AI - just the body movement and facial expressions - even this domain seems still very primitive compared to real life humans."

Advanced Robotics of the Future or ARF. ARF would include creating cybernetics/prosthetics and humanoid robots/androids/synthetics. Also selling to the public or private agencies. These humanoid robots would in theory be able to do anything a human can and can't do. Skeptics say this will never be a reality, lightsabers will probably never be a reality. ARF is very double. Imagine sending androids to distant planets to terraform them. Sending androids to distant solar systems to find habital planets for humanity to live on. Imagine android cops, soldiers, nurses, teachers, etc. Imagine never having to leave your home for groceries. How much should it cost to rent one or buy an android? Short staffed? Rent an android to work for you or buy it for a 24/7 employee. Maybe every android can't do everything, maybe androids are specialized for specific tasks. Androids that can do surgery or fly a plane. Androids that can pilot ships or spaceships. Android engineers or mayors. Or the next CEO of Twitter is an android! The next president could be an android. Adopt an android child maybe. A Jurassic Park filled with android dinosaurs and other extinct animals. Buy an android dog. 

Feel free to comment better names than ARF. 
Feel free to give name suggestions for my future enterprise. 
Feel free to add on to the discussion. 
This is not an invitation to ridicule me and my dream. Be civil and polite."
