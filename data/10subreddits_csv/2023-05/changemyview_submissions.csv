0,2023-04-30,CMV: FEFERs (Fix Earth Firsters) don't actually make much sense in the Grand scheme of Space colonization,u/Aggressive-Nature-51,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13475wx/cmv_fefers_fix_earth_firsters_dont_actually_make/,changemyview,"Hello guys, AN-51 here, and I'm talking about Space Colonazation and the reasons why we should do it and why FEFERs actually make no sense in the Grand Scheme of Things.

I am a big supporter of Coloniolism across our beautiful Solar System, I support the Artemis missions and also am I supporter of Dennis Hope and I'm here to tell you these 5 reasons FEFERs are wrong 


1. ""Let's Fix Earth Problems first"": Let's fix Earth problems can easily be addressed by Neil DeGrasse Tyson and his ""Cave Problems"" analogy, attempting to fix all problems on Earth seems kind of like a moving goal post we fix some problems and more will appear is this to say that fixing Earths problems are ultimately futile no but the point is to say we should tackle Earths problems as they come and we can't go into space while doing it, they argue but lots of the money going towards Lunar Base Alpha can be going into starving Kids pockets, it's not really one or the other 



2. There be riches up there: Colonizing Space will also open up lots and lots of riches up there, such as on the Moon and in the Asteroid Belt, Luna has He3, gold and titanium there be He3 in them rocks, look I know that some of you guys might clown me for mentioning Fusion because you may have heard those ""Fusion in 20 years"" folks come up disappointed every well 2 decades, but Fusion made a breakthrough by making more energy than used on the reaction this year, He3 in perhaps 30 years as humanity moves on towards more cheaper and effective Fusion fuels can easily become a valuable resource, mining rigs and such can easily open up new opportunities 



3. ""There's no life on their we can't form a Civilization""

Mostly older folks say this, but saying we shouldn't colonize other planets because other things can't live there seems kind strange its kind of like after a disaster destroys a landscape people wouldn't come back because ""There's no life"" 


4. ""We will trash the Moon just like Earth""

I was speaking to an classmate of mine about Space Colonazation and they mentioned ""We will trash the the Moon just like we did Earth"", while pollution on the Moon and other celestial bodies will be a problem, there is no ecosystem on the moon to worry about even if that wasn't the case colonies and bases will probably have ways to dispose of waste that builds up over time and it won't just be trash here trash there, at least in the early days 


5. ""Think of the Mental Health""

5 is actually quite sympathetic think of the Mental Health effects on researchers and colonists, there's some things to mention

1. They aren't all that isolated if you have a radio tower you can probably have real time conference's and such, and a ""LunaNet type system allowing communication with only a 3 second lag isn't all that implausible for bases 


2. They probably choose to join the mission, they aren't just randomly selected we're assuming they went through training and/or know how to cope with this in training but in the inital days relative isolation can be a problem 


To continue I personally think the Moon and other celestial bodies provide a new Frontier, homesteads to expand out to places to research and invaluable resources on the way to becoming a  K1 civ 

But feel free to debate this and keep an open mind"

I'm looking at the next presidential election like an asteroid: A big, looming, inevitable doom.

The left and right in the US hate each other so badly, and are unwilling to listen to one another. Trump's fans already reject outright reality with their 'stop the steal' nonsense. He's probably going to be in the running again, because it's impossible for this man to have to deal with the consequences of his actions. If he can't be impeached for leading a literal coup against the US government than nothing can stop him.

Which means that if he loses, or if the Republican candidate loses, than that means that his side will not accept that. And since so many of the maga crowd collect military hardware like pokemon cards I can easily see them starting an actual violent campaign to put their guy in office and keep him there for forever.

Given how much the two sides hate one another, I don't see either of them just accepting the outcome of the next election if their guy loses."

2,2023-04-30,CMV: All restaurants should have public photos of all items they serve,u/qezler,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1349h33/cmv_all_restaurants_should_have_public_photos_of/,changemyview,"I have always had ARFID, which is something I cope with by knowing what foods I can eat and planning around that in such a way that I get some variety. However, it means that most restaurant menus have only 1-3 items which I can actually eat. Usually, I play it safe by ordering the item which is least likely to be inedible to me. I have to steer clear of items which carry the risk of being prepared in such a way that they repulse me. But when I can see a dish, I know instantly whether I can eat it or not. Having that information would allow me to order a larger variety of dishes, and in turn enjoy restaurants more.

Because of Curb Cut effect, that policy I am advocating will be beneficial for many more people than just me. Generally speaking, it’s good to let people know what they’re getting before you give it to them. It will reduce customer complaints, “this isn’t what I expected.” It is beneficial for both parties, because you’re educating the customer about which option is right for them. If the customer wants to be surprised, that’s fine; they can ask the waiter to surprise them. But there is a reason photos on menus exist; I’m only advocating to expand that to all items.

The following is the most intuition-based and hard to express part of my argument. But I think photos just offer such extremely more information than text descriptions. It is possible it’s just a quirk of how my brain processes information, but given how extreme the difference is, it’s hard for me to believe that anyone actually gets more value from descriptions than pictures. Most descriptions are a list of ingredients or general food categories. This leaves out a lot. “How much of each ingredient are there? How are they cooked? How are they prepared? Ingredients come in different types and styles. It says it uses peppers. What is the exact size, color, frequency, and dispersion of the peppers?” 

In menus more than anything, text is a limited (and inferior) mode of communication. For one, menus expect from their readers a vocabulary that is compatible both with cuisine generally, and the regional terminology of the restaurant’s theme (eg, a French restaurant using French food names). It’s almost like a form of gatekeeping. 

You can say “sight and taste are unrelated”, but I don’t know what to tell you other than that’s totally untrue for me. I can tell a lot about taste and texture from the look. Next time you see a photo of a food item on a menu, compare whether you get more information from the ingredient description or the photo. Both should exist. But when the photo isn’t present, it forces me to visualize the item in my head as best I can from the limited description. 

It shouldn’t be too difficult to create what I want. Just have someone in the restaurant causally spend a day or two taking photos of all the outgoing food items and compile the best photos. They don’t need to hire the types of people who shoot fast food commercials. If you can’t even take a good photo of your food, without expensive cameras, then you probably shouldn’t be selling it. You should have confidence in your dishes. 

The argument that I’ve heard against this is that it would ruin the design of menus to have photos on them, that it would be tacky, or that menus simply don’t have enough physical space for photos of everything. I agree that it would compromise the length of menus. However, almost every restaurant (especially since the Covid era, as a silver lining of the QR codes to scan) now has a website. A website isn’t going to run out of space for photos. The online menu could have a “view image” item for each item, or something like that. Now, the physical paper menu does not need to have a single photo. I just want the photos available somewhere for those who really want it. 

I doubt that I will change my view, or stop wanting this. However, if someone presents me with some issues that I had not considered, that challenge some of my beliefs, I’m willing to grant deltas. Maybe there's a reason why this isn't more widespread."
0,2023-04-30,CMV: criminal sentencing length should only be dependent on specific actions and not be determined on a case-by-case basis.,u/Impenitency,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/134ankb/cmv_criminal_sentencing_length_should_only_be/,changemyview,"Status: this plan is not the good way to fix the system. I should have also initially phrased my post with better language like “should probably” or “this might be a better way” due my system not having a lot of evidence to back it up.

What I mean by this is that the sentence of a crime is a fixed length with no variability. Accompany facts can lessen or lengthen this by a fixed about. 

For example, let’s say someone robbed a store. The baseline sentence for armed robbery is three years with a six-month minimum and a 20-year maximum. Having a gun would be +1 year. Stealing under $500 would be -0.5 years, and over $2000 would be +1 years. Minor injuries of innocents would be +2 years. No prior convictions would be -1 year. Ect. So if someone robbed a store with a gun and stole $450 without injuries, no priors, they would revive 2.5 years, no matter the other circumstances. (These numbers are probably way off). 

Currently, the difference in prison sentences is highly dependent on the whims and pity of the judge or jury with wildly different punishments for the same crimes. This variability is often used to give worse convictions to different races/socioeconomic statuses/other while still maintaining the illusion of fairness. Removing this variability would force people to reconsider sentencing length and what factors contributed to sentencing because everyone who committed that crime would have to receive the same punishment. Hopefully, this would go a long way in reducing unjust punishment or lack of punishment for crimes.

Clarification: there can be different sentencing for the “same” crime, as long facts about the crime are different and these facts apply to each case in the same way."

There are many people that fall into two groups, either they believe that in the west that men are too entitled, living in the past etc and still holding to archaic expectations of finding a female partner who does the cooking etc or they fall into another group who believes women have too high of an expectation. 
So this is the first part. I don't want my view changed such in the way that proves these groups do not exist, I find it very hard as I see too much evidence that these groups exist. But simply to see it as a problem. Because for me the solution is simple. Don't marry them  have a ten year trial run. If the man insists on you being a bang maid. Leave. If the woman insists you have six figures or some shit. Leave. 

Now I want my view changed because I also struggle to understand the ""incel"" view and the ""many men are bad"" view. 

My view is that if neither party has any incentive why should they give two rats ass. Like people talk about how men and women are single. Sucks for them, but again I fail to see the problem. If a woman prefers a life of being single and rejects all men because the alternative is that all these men she's met with are bad in some way, how is that a problem for her? If men are rejecting non traditional or whatever women, how is it his problem? how is it his problem that women don't meet his standards. 

Now second. And this is the most important I want changed   Even if it is a problem. I don't think we have a compromise. let's assume that every man is a shallow ass who just wants a bang maid and all women just want a six figured man. How do we compromise. 

I feel this is a would you rather game. Would you rather be single and not stuck with mediocre Joe or would you rather be stuck with mediocre Joe and his problems. These women have evaluated they rather be single. Or maybe these women aren't single by choice. Or maybe they should lower their standards. but they saw no reason  to. If these women aren't offering enough, why should any man bother being with her  

Similarly  men are asked if they would rather be stuck with a whiny woman and all her problems and get non of the benefits. these men have evaluated they rather be single. Or maybe they havent. Maybe they are incels. But even if I grant them being single isn't their choice. The problem is there is no compromise. I'd say its like a buy and sell deal. If these men aren't offering enough to women, why should the women bother? 

Again. This is not a men suck women suck post. 
Like my point is we keep talking about the crisis of single hood but I don't see it as a problem. people are single either through their own choices or others but we cannot force people to choose to be in a relationship because that means its not a choice. 

I believe the happiness of individuals is important but so is freedom. We act like people should date for the sake of the incels. Which is utterly strange. I often hear that everyone should lower standard.s men should stop wanting hot chicks and women should stop pursuing pursuing high ranking men. But again why? For the sake of Incel? Doesn't make sense to me 

if I could tldr I think my point would be this. every single men and women have evlauted they'd rather be single than be with the people they've been proposed to because the whole package of pros and cons of such people is that the cons outweigh the pros, while being single there are more benefits, that or the prospecting partner has evaluated that they themselves have more cons than pros.

I don't think that's something we can change because that's a personal feeling. No one can convince these people which is objectively better or worse. No one can also convince people to please date Joe or Jane Doe. So there's no compromise. If we could convince people to date incels well... They wouldn't be incel. And I'm not just talking about sex.

We can't convince many men to settle. And that's OK. We can't convince many women to fuck some Incels and that's a society I'm OK with."

I work from job to job for my agreed upon rate, and that’s the way gig labor works. 

We’re in a situation now where massive backlogs of quality content are being erased from streaming services due to the piling up of residual fees. Streamers aren’t willing to pay these, and so they’re removing the content. The work of not only writers but set designers, casters, audio mixers, et al. There’s a lot of human capital that went into creating this beautiful art that now is fading completely into obscurity due to these perpetual payments. 

I believe this is an unnecessary loss of culture.

Edit: I can definitely understand wanting and deserving a share of a massive success. I can see the problem of having an upfront standalone fee potentially leading to a lower quality rushed product with a crew that has no stake in the financial outcome of the product. The view is against perpetuity. For arguments sake, let’s set the limit on residuals to 1 year from public release.

Axiomatic assumptions: I do not intend to argue for or against the proposition that we do actually live in such a system. For the purpose of this thread, I ask that participants concede (as hypothetical) that we do live in one. I also presume that those who favor a meritocratic system share my belief that society ought to strive to be fair and that this is similarly presumed for the sake of this post.

I offer the view that a system in which individuals advance through merit is, in effect, rewarding the individuals who are utilizing tools and faculties that are, in turn, the result of the accidents of their birth. As a result, correlating success with luck is also presumed to be unfair by definition.

Some might counter that other factors such as hard work, grit, risk-taking, sacrifice, et al, are informing an individual's success, and I propose that all of these must also be included in the category of 'unearned attributes' in the same way we would say about eye-color and skin tone in light of the fact that they are inherited or else the result of environmental circumstances - both of which are determined.

My view builds on the realization that free will does not exist, and so attempts to change my mind on the issue at hand would need to be able to account for that reality.

Consider the following statements that I have provided to summarize my assertion:

\* All individuals inherit attributes that are both genetic as well as environmental. These attributes are not chosen by that individual and thus are the consequences of luck.

\* A meritocracy that favors those very attributes in individuals that were the result of luck and circumstance will be unfair.

Of course a President or Governor can pardon the convicted murderer when the real murderer is found, but then again they may not.

I understand that the Supreme Court is worried about the burden on courts if every time a bit of new evidence comes to light criminals can keep appealing their sentences.  Sure.  But the arrest/conviction/confession of a new culprit for a murder is presumably not happening so very often.  Accordingly the burden there on the legal system is probably not large.  And the burden on convicted murderers who did not factually commit murder is quite large."

But regardless, if you disagree with the reality that they are a woman it seems best to just play along because it's such a small price to pay. It seems to me the only counter argument is ""but I'm super uptight"" (or some complex variation of being 'uptight').

I can maybe see an argument against letting XY chromosome people play sports with girls. In that case, I say trans people just miss out. I can't be a airline pilot if I'm blind no matter what's in my heart. You're just disqualified. Yes it's sad, but the fact that it means such a tiny fraction of people will be effected tells me that the utilitarian calculation seems to obviously favor disqualification.

People who object to the idea of letting XY chromosome people into women's bathroom in bad faith should be objecting to sexual predators who abuse the system - not trans people.

If I'm at a July 4th BBQ and a kid runs up to me with arms spread wide and says ""I'm a airplane! ZOOOM!"", I respond with ""Wow!"" and start singing Danger Zone. Seems like the people who don't sincerely believe in the idea that you can be XY chromosome but identify as a woman (or w/e variation) would have a much better life if we just *give it to them*.

The damage being done by the outrage is far greater than the supposed damage done by just letting them have it.

In the middle is an extra hour for ""break"" where you are expected to stop working and eat (in effect you spend 9h at your work place, so a 9 to 18). IMO this is a terrible idea in practice, even in pretty rigid and stringent countries, because:

\- You are spending an extra hour at work, for free.

\- Because the law says you have to have an hour, your time at work increases by 1h. But this is not necessarily an hour you can use to do what you want, there are still a LOT of workplace rules.

\- Because you have to be there, many employers will either nudge or force you to work ""a little"" at lunch. It leads to unpaid work. 

\- In some instances, you are strongly encouraged or forced to partake in social eating. In effect that's mandatory socialization, and unpaid. Its something you may be doing solely because it is forced upon you, and you do it for free.

\- An employer should be required to allow for the needs of the resources it employees: i.e. humans. If you as an employer have a legal obligation/burden to allow employees to go to the WC, or be sick, so should you have the obligation to, at the very least, provide time for eating. The fact that those are ""hours of work lost"" is the cost of employing a human.

\- Especially in more precarious domains, this supposed ""1h break"" is simply a ""1h of free labour"".

The way I see it, lunch break should just be part of work time. Yes employer will loose some work time, and bad employers will loose free labour. But those aren't necessarily bad things. And as breaks are already mandatory (or should be, depending on where you are) and already come-out of the normal work schedule, you would get them anyway (obviously in practice many don't, but those are also usually the same poor sods working during lunch).

IMO this ""lunch hour"" is basically either wasted private time, free labour time or mandatory socialization time. Individually you may be loving it, but IMO it should not be part of work by law. 

Disclaimer: I think for physical/manual profession 1h of break makes sense, but these areas, at least where I am, have specific regulations. The issue is more enforcement; I worked most of my adult life in very low paying jobs (2€ to 5€ an hour, compared to the >50€ I make now), and for sure in some (physical ones) I would have loved to have a break. But enforcement was about as good as the singing skill of a stone."

In the modern day justice system, a great deal of crime etc. Is handled on a case by case basis where a judge or police officer can choose to exercise leniency or ""throw the book"" at an individual. It's my opinion that despite this being nice for the individual when it works out in their favor, it ultimately leads to an abusive system.

As it stands, there are a great deal of laws that most citizens do not follow in their daily lives, and these laws are typically not enforced as a result. However, this leads to a scenario where a government can choose to selectively enforce these laws upon an individual based on whether or not they like them. This is bad because it means anyone can be a criminal based on the whims of authority, not based on the conduct of the individual. A response to this might go along the lines of: 

If we enforced these laws without discretion, many people would be punished too harshly for minor infractions. 

However, if such a scenario were to occur, we collectively would be outraged and push for removal or updates to these laws, instead of just ignoring them and allowing them to build up and be used against us on a bad day. These outdated or abusive statutes occur precisely because of discretion.

At the end of the day, laws are laws, and they should either apply to everyone or to nobody and be removed. A wish washy justice system ends up hurting people far more than it helps."

It's common these days for both men and women to talk to multiple people while searching for the right person, and I think it's essential to consider this in our dating approach.

I understand that some might assume that men who prefer coffee dates are cheap or broke, but going all-out on every single first date seems nonsensical. As someone who might be engaging with 3-6 women at a time, it's not practical in terms of time and finances to take every single person out for an expensive dinner or an elaborate date. Weekends are limited, and so is the budget.

Opting for a coffee or movie date is a more sensible choice. It's low-key, cost-effective, and provides an opportunity to evaluate the presence of chemistry and the potential for a second date.

Let's also consider that women typically aren't the ones paying for dates, so their main investment is time. A coffee date provides a comfortable environment to see if there's any connection worth pursuing without unnecessary pressure.

In my opinion, coffee dates offer a reasonable and relaxed option for both men and women to quickly assess potential partners without excessive time or financial commitment. The casual setting of a coffee date also promotes more natural and honest conversations, making it easier to determine compatibility.

Change my view. Are coffee dates just an excuse to be frugal, or is this a practical approach to modern dating?"

Democrats *seem* to believe the United States is an inherently wicked country beyond redemption, unlike Republicans who seem to acknowledge the country has its flaws, but believe we’re inherently good and capable of improvement through our system of laws. I point to efforts like the 1619 project, or the film “Exterminate all the Brutes” that seem to mistake *correcting* the historical record with *replacing it* with a message of self-loathing.

The emphasis on identity politics after the failure of both economic populism (Bernie) and neoliberal condescension (Clinton) in 2016 has made the Democratic Party a divisive movement at its core. One that seems to see some people as inherently wicked and some as inherently virtuous based on deeply ugly grievance politics that often have no basis in reality. Republicans on the other hand seem to have a more unifying view of America as a melting pot where all are welcome.

At the end of the day, I’m a deeply progressive person. I believe in a strong social safety net, an end to economic monopolies, the repeal of Citizens United, and the right of all people to live in dignity, peace, free from want, hunger, and fear. 

I also believe in social cohesion, that we all belong to one American family, that people ought to work hard and be willing to be productive members of society in order to enjoy the protections and privileges that come with being a citizen of the richest most powerful nation in the history of civilization.

I’ve been a registered democrat my entire life, I met my wife working for Bernie Sanders, I’ve worked for elected officials at all levels of government, I’m even a member of my local and state Democratic Central Committees. But, the dysfunction and division of this party is becoming too much for me, and I’m thinking of switching my party registration to none.

166,2023-05-01,"CMV: Psilocybin is superior to traditional antidepressants at treating clinical depression, if proper guidelines are followed",u/Aromatizing,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1352ad5/cmv_psilocybin_is_superior_to_traditional/,changemyview,"Psilocybin (commonly referred to as *shrooms*), is a naturally-occurring compound found in hundreds of species of fungi with psychedelic properties.

My argument is simple: **psilocybin is clearly superior to traditional antidepressants at treating clinical depression**, whether or not the patient is treatment-resistant or not. I see no reason it shouldn't be used as a *first resort* in the future (once regulatory bodies eventually approve it) rather than a last resort, if the patient is willing to have the experience. 

I'll start with effect sizes. Essentially, this is a statistical value that can represent how strong a potential treatment is. An effect size indicating no difference is 0.0, small is around 0.2, medium 0.5, and large 0.8. Of course, it's subjective whether something is ""large"" or not, but the point is that an effect size of 2.0 is vastly larger than 1.0, which is vastly larger than 0.2.

For antidepressants, the effect size (using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) is ""around 0.30"" according to meta-analyses.^1 While certainly antidepressants work for many people, and should continue to be used where it has an antidepressant effect, they only work for a ""small subset of patients,"" according to a large scale meta-analysis of 232 clinical trials^2


For psilocybin, the effect size (for the same metric, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) is consistently larger in studies. While one might argue that these trials have smaller sample sizes and there aren't many of them, it is hard to ignore how significantly larger the antidepressant effect is.  According to a recent meta-analysis of ten studies^3, the estimated effect sizes for each time period after psilocybin administration are:



Time Period | Effect Size | 95% CI
-----------|-----------|------
1 Day | -0.75 | -1.15 to -0.35
1 Week | -1.74 | -2.15 to -1.32
1 Month | -1.35 | -1.77 to -0.93
3 Months | -0.91 | -1.31 to -0.51
6 Months | -1.12 | -1.56 to -0.68

Clearly, all of these are far above antidepressants. Even the bottom estimate in the 95% confidence interval of the lowest effect size period (one day) is larger. The argument that ""this effect doesn't last that long"" is clearly not true though, as large effect sizes persist after six months.

The other interesting thing to note is that this table understates the true effect in optimal conditions. In studies with higher doses (>0.5mg/kg), [not a single study from this meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8879743/figure/jcm-11-00938-f003/) had an effect size *under 1*, and several have been greater than two, indicating an extreme antidepressant effect. 


As I stated though, it is important that the right *set* (mindset) and *setting* (social environment) are used. It's much less likely you'll have a truly transformative experience if you take it at a party than if you have a guide, a specific intention, and the right environment (like a living room with a calming playlist on).

Psilocybin is also extremely safe. While one might experience nausea, change in heart rate and blood pressure, and other side effects while under the influence, it is essentially impossible to overdose or die on shrooms, unless you somehow eat several pounds of dried shrooms (the typical dose is 1000 times less than this). [It also has a very low dependence potential](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Drug_danger_and_dependence-no_title.svg). A famous Lancet study, which assessed the ""harm to users"" and ""harm to others"" of over a dozen drugs, found mushrooms to be the [least harmful drug](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b0c2fe594edc505014ba0b47353e7f5b/tumblr_pvqgdrmpjn1suxeeyo1_1280.png). Population surveys have found that there is no link between use of psychedelics and psychosis, a common fear of skeptics^4. The only people who should be excluded from this type of therapy (if they are already willing to try it) is those with a history of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia.

With all of this out of the way, I think that psilocybin-assisted therapy should be normalized and even used as a *first resort* for patients with depression, if they so choose. Of course, not everyone wants to lose control or have this type of experience. That's fine. But it's a relatively low-cost (7g of shrooms spread over two trips costs only $60, although psychotherapy assisted sessions would cost more) method that potentially could have life-changing effects for users. In the future, if studies continue to show this massive of an antidepressant effect, it should be normalized as a treatment for depression.

I’ve been reading various women’s rights and feminist subreddits as well as sex worker subreddits and I’ve seen a lot of controversy and different opinions.

What I HAVENT seen is a single argument against sex work that wouldn’t also apply to all sports and in particular fighting….if it’s legal to get the hell beaten out of you for a few hours and possibly die or break bones, this objectifying your body for harm, why shouldn’t this exact legality apply to sex work? How is it different? Even football gives you traumatic brain injuries. 

I’d go as far as saying construction work and sanitation workers also face significant health risks. But those aren’t quite as directly super harmful / risky to the body

Why is it morally wrong to sell usage / access to genitalia but perfectly legitimate to get your head, chest arms, and other body parts just absolutely pounded? I’ve never seen a feminist argue to make the UFC illegal, so men’s body’s do not have this moral protection / sanctity, but as soon as sex is involved it is this extremely wrong objectification of women. Aren’t ALL workers especially physical workers inherently objectified? Are Amazon workers working like dogs directly objectified? Should we ban all fighting, construction work, and sports like football? Maybe there is something I am missing.

interesting counterarguments

The shells have more pellets in a smaller diameter which equates to better hit probability, less potential for over penetration through an assailant and also through drywall should a pellet not hit the assailant. While 00 buckshot does have better penetration at 50 yards, most home defense shootings take place under 10 yards or so.

#4 buckshot barely meets minimum FBI penetration recommendations and 99% of birdshot won’t meet those standards at all.

Why Flite Control? With the aide of a special wad design, you can get a fist sized pattern at 15 yards with what could be a 10 inch pattern at the same distance with typical buckshot ammunition. While a wide buckshot pattern can be helpful in home defense, if the pattern is so wide that you accidentally hit a family member or neighbor with a stray pellet, that’s not going to be a good scenario. Flite control shells might be hard to find and expensive, but considering all the things that can go wrong in a home defense shooting, it’s worth it to spend the extra dough on good ammo for when the going gets rough.

I have great hopes for the application of Artificial Intelligence, Transhumanism and the possibility of a prosperous Utopia, helped by technology. I have been tinkering with technology since I was a child, and to this day, I get excited about new products. This is to say that I do not hate technology or call myself a Luddite. 

But realistically, I have little hope as to how AI will help the average person. Throughout history, we’ve seen corporations act only for the sake of profit and satisfying shareholders. 

Given [IBM recently ceased hiring for roles that could be done by AI](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-01/ibm-to-pause-hiring-for-back-office-jobs-that-ai-could-kill?leadSource=reddit_wall) and [DropBox letting people go to focus on AI](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23700629/dropbox-laying-off-500-people-pivoting-ai)

These are just two massive corporations. What happens when this becomes the norm? There is no real safety net for the average person, especially when many are living paycheck to paycheck in developed countries.

The common arguments I’ve heard against my view are:

1. AI, much like other technological advances, will make life easier for humans, reducing work hours, leading to surplus free time while maintaining productivity gains.

While this is true to an extent, the very nature of AI makes it able to adapt. Tools such as AutoGPT for example, are essentially using multiple instances of itself to solve problem, instruct each other, and provide reasoning. Admittedly, this tool has not netted any massive success yet, but it is concerning as a concept. Moreover, generally speaking, we have increased work hours, reduced work-life balance, despite seeing technological advances in every field.

2. AGI/ASI is imminent and will create a utopia for humanity. AGI/ASI will not cause problems for humanity since it will be benevolent and aligned to humanity’s interests.

Perhaps the first part of that statement is true, but an AGI/ASI is more likely to be developed by a corporation to serve its interests, than by a regular Joe with a terminal. And historically, the interests of corporations have always been at odds with the interests of the working class. Secondly, the [Alignment Problem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment ) as been discussed since the 1960s with no clear solution, and I’m skeptical we will find a solution now, with such rapid progress in AI on multiple fronts. I do concede that, there may be solutions for it happening behind the scenes.

3.. UBI will ensure we don’t need to worry about jobs or bills anymore

UBI is a very west-centric solution. And even there, it is not guaranteed to be implemented for various reasons. For a person living outside, the argument for UBI makes little sense to me.

CMV: AI will replace human workers, leading to massive poverty, social unrest and other societal issues that the average person will bear the brunt of, while corporations enjoy their ever increasing wealth.

0,2023-05-02,CMV: It is inconsistent to want gun reforms but not want to remove the 2nd Amendment,u/Front_Appointment_68,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/135fv73/cmv_it_is_inconsistent_to_want_gun_reforms_but/,changemyview,"In the 2nd Amendment it outlines the right to bear arms. 

Therefore logically it should be treated as any other right like free speech or a right to a trial by jury. If you wouldn't restrict who has access to these rights e.g (people with a criminal record or mental health problem) - because these are rights then it isn't consistent to want to do it for the right to bear arms.

Just a few caveats - This argument assumes that you have complete control of the house/senate and so would like to exclude the ""what what is easier to change argument""

As ""Well regulated militia"" is ambiguous and has many different interpretations I would argue that it isn't enough to suggest that we should treat the ""right to bear arms"" differently to any other ""right"" in the constitution."
21,2023-05-02,CMV: Chemical castration is an appropriate punishment for paedophile sex offenders,u/mankindmatt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/135gd6n/cmv_chemical_castration_is_an_appropriate/,changemyview,"Chemical castration involves the use of injections which lower testosterone levels, essentially killing off the libido/sex drive of the patient/criminal.

This is currently practiced in a handful of nations, including S.Korea, Russia, Poland Thailand and Estonia, while it's used as an incentive for a lesser prison sentence in parts of the US and Australia.

I believe that this would contribute towards an overall societal good, with reoffending rates amongst child sex offenders plummeting, whilst those convicted earlier for less serious crimes (such as possession of indecent images) can be prevented from progressing onto more serious crimes.

I can imagine several objections to this punishment, so I'd like to preemptively address these.

Firstly, the drugs used could have damaging long term health implications.

However, the very same could be said of prison sentences. In fact, some estimates suggest that every year spent in prison reduces overall life expectancy by 2 years! That's not to mention the stresses of living as the most hated of inmates, or the potential dangers of violent reprisals from prison gangs.

In addition, the very same drugs can be used as puberty blocking treatment for children/teenagers undergoing gender transition. Countless reams of evidence suggests that this is a fully safe drug, without serious side effects (beyond the intended reduction in libido)

Secondly, it could present an issue if the convict turned out to be innocent. If such a case were to arise, the convict would be taken off the drugs and compensated by the state, much like someone wrongly sent to prison for a lengthy period. Chemical castration is fully reversible with modern methods.

Lastly, the potential for a slippery slope. Couldn't this lead to the chemical castration of gay men or other people deemed to be sexually deviant? (ala Alan Turing) This would appear to be fallacious reasoning. Paedophile sex offenders are already subject to a range of legal consequences, whilst gay men and others generally are not. This would simply be arranging a more serious punishment for something already widely considered criminal behaviour, not introducing a new offence itself.

Whilst chemical castration may appear a particularly brutal punishment, which has a major effect on the convicts overall quality of life, I believe this it outweighed by the peace of mind given to the community, in knowing released offenders no longer present a serious risk to children, and the fact that fewer children are going to be abused and suffer the life long trauma that this can cause."
7,2023-05-02,CMV: We should look into changing trial procedures by verifying traditional jury results with additional subject-blind judge rulings in some cases,u/Impenitency,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/135gl2c/cmv_we_should_look_into_changing_trial_procedures/,changemyview,"Status: minor change.

How this would work: in any trial that sentences the accused to a punishment greater than 1 year of prison time or a fine of over 30,000. Key trial proceedings would be summarized in text then modified to remove any mention of the accused race, gender, location, age (unless they were a minor) and economic status(if required by the accused and they have a salary less than 50k or net worth less than 300k). It would also remove any mentions of victims race or gender. After this an unrelated judge would look over this case and issue a ruling for the sentencing. If the difference in sentencing was less than 10% different or half a year (whichever is less) the the traditional ruling would be used, otherwise the subject blind ruling would be used. If there were minor differences aka 10% or less this would indicate the original ruling was fair and that the difference was due to increased information. If the difference was greater this would indicate there was some sort of unconscious or conscious bias and the case needed to by judged by someone without access to irrelevant personal details about the accused and victims in order to determine a fair punishment.

Currently there is a large disparity in how different demographics face legal consequences. One of the results of this is significantly harsher punishments for undesirable segments on the population. Hopefully this would prevent unconscious or conscious bias from affecting sentencing. This would of course lose some of the nuance, however I believe the bias we currently have is worse than nuance that would be lost. Something about this system needs to change in order to eliminate these systemic biases, this might be a solution.

This system is currently just a theory of mine, however it seems like would be effective and not cause too many problems, but there are probably a lot of things I haven’t considered yet.

Edit(what constitutes changing my mind): considering this is a rough idea, if you suggest an alternative you must convince me that it more(not equally) viable, or in the case of minor changes (much better). Of course simply convincing me that this change would be detrimental would obviously be a change.

Edit(change in viewpoint): In cases where there was a strong racial gender/other motivation, such as in hate crimes, but not limited to them. Either side could request that this process not apply to the case. As long as race, gender or other motivation was determined to be a significant factor, this would be granted."

Normally, let’s say there’s a 5% threshold. 10 parties run for the election, 6 get in. The remaining parties in that case could have up to almost 20% (though that’s unlikely of course. These up to 20% would then be distributed according to percentages of those parties that did get in. 

Problem with that in my opinion is for example: let’s say there are two left wing parties running, one with more support and the other closer to what I believe in terms of values/agenda. Normally I‘d vote for the first, knowing the second might not get in. If in that case I‘d vote the second, and it wouldn’t get in, my vote would basically go to the parties that DID get in, according to results. Potentially, most of my vote would go to right wing/conservative parties. 

Now I believe that’s not as democratic as it should be. My suggestion would be: before the election, every competing party publishes a list, who their votes go to in case they don’t get in. A party could still choose not to do that, which would lead to the current mechanism described above to be used. I would not even see a problem in saying „in case parties x and y get in but we don’t, give each of them half our votes“ or somet like that, with some limitations on how complicated it can become. 

In this scenario, I could vote for the second, less popular left-wing party mentioned above, knowing that if they don’t make it their votes go to the other left-wing party. 

I can see, why this hasn’t been implemented: it would mean less votes for the big, established parties, that are sure to always get in. But I still believe my suggested system would be more democratic, as each voter can vote something closer to what he wants/believes in. 

Am I forgetting something? Is there a logistical or democratic problem with my idea, that I‘m forgetting?

EDIT:
As many have pointed out, ranked choice would be the even better method. More work for those counting ballots, but better for democracy and the voter. 

It does however seem like there is, in terms of democracy, not much speaking against a ranked choice voting other than big parties losing votes (which really only sucks for them and not anyone else)."

I mean obviously if the developed countries give ressources to help develop or rebuild a country they'll want it to be built in a way that won't threaten their security (and the global security given that the actual world is interdependent because of globalization and all).

I get that intervening means you consider there's one reality that is better than the others but I don't understand why that would be bad. If humanitarian interventions make people happier and safer then shouldn't it be a good thing. Besides, like I said, if what happens in other parts of the world threatens your own people happiness and security then you'll obviously want to do something right?

Also given that the world is based on multilateral relations where multiple centers of power constantly interact, it is way more complicated to rely only on soft power. Using hard power (combining force to moral) seems like a natural response to me.

And I don't get why not intervening would be better than intervening, like how is more fair to let people die only to leave them the right to determine themselves?

What I'm wondering about is whether or not occident is wrong about what the center of the problem is. Like maybe they need food (an example) and not democracy, maybe we are not giving them what they really need.

P.S.: I'm really sorry if you don't understand my English or arguments so please feel free to point out any mistake I made."

I'm not that knowledgeable in macro economics, so I suspect I may be completely wrong in my assessment of UBI, which is why I'm here.

I believe that UBI cannot work if applied to our current society. This is because there are already economic forces in action that will defeat the positive effects of UBI.

First of all, here is my understanding of UBI, best case scenario : 

The government hands out money to every citizen so they can live in reasonable comfort. That amount of money might change depending on the region. Then, these citizens will spend the money on food, rent, etc. That money is taxed multiple times over, as it changes hands from citizen -> business -> someone's salary -> purchasing more things, and so on and so forth. Eventually the government ""gets even"" and can hand out money again for everyone. If they don't get even on time, they can always borrow money.

But here's my reasoning on where the loop breaks, and why UBI can't work : 

As soon as a given business will start making extra money from the additional influx of people with disposable income, at least some businesses will start investing that money. That money might be invested in a house internationally, or an offshore account, or whatever. The point is, some of the money is going to be taken out of the system.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that as money changes hands, it will eventually end up in the richest people's hands, who will sleep on it until they retire, so they can keep their lifestyle. This would force the government's hand : they'll have to borrow more to keep feeding everyone their UBI every month, essentially making the rich richer, and the government poorer."

A developing embryo contains both the wolffian duct (male reproduction tracts) and the müllerian duct (female reproduction tracts),  when a y chromosome is present, it creates a signal that leads to the destruction of the female mullerian duct, however people initially thought that without any interference whatsoever the embryo would just “continue” to develop into a female, which is not true. My link shows that females embryos also need a protein called coup-tfII to shift the development of the embryo into female sex.


You can say that the embryo “looks” more like a females but that’s because females has more characteristics (nipples and simplistic shaped genital) . the embryo starts off as both sex, their genitals develops from a none specific blob called genital tubercle

I kid you not, every Sunday, sometimes Saturdays, and a sprinkle of Wednesdays. Even as a child, the religion never sat right with me and ever since leaving I've been on a constant search of what to believe in life. Revisiting this god forsaken belief system, I think I'm close to a conclusion. And I can go down the rabbit hole, but I will do my best to keep this short.

Modern christianity is obsessed with morals. What is good, evil, and what glorifies their definition of god. Ok, we know this, but from my understanding what they define as good and evil is them justifying suffering and valuing pity. This is how herd mentality was formed. A priest tells you to pity those who have done you wrong, who have acted against you, then tell you it's a part of a plan we know nothing about because our suffering *has* to have meaning. It has to. So we make the herd weak.

As we make the herd weak, we make the herd believe in our concept of evil so now all the suffering, pain, torment, everything that is wronged against you is not their fault, so who's fault is it? Well it's your fault. Forgive them, for they do not know; and to me, that's just a roundabout way of making your herd feel guilt.  So we've made the herd subservient and have instilled in them to feel bad about themselves when other people have done bad things to them. That is absolutely fucking horrible.

And as a black man, I take this one step further. The African slaves were forced to be christian. So through generations of extreme trauma and suffering, it confounds me that an entire culture today would choose to be christian when the evils that were done to them were in the name of the same god they worship. 

I'll make an analogy: If I was abducted and my capturer said everything they did to me was in the name of Pikachu, I would **never** associate myself with anything Pokemon related ever again once I was rescued."
0,2023-05-02,CMV: The Leafs are not winning the Stanley Cup this year,u/centerofstar,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1361ykl/cmv_the_leafs_are_not_winning_the_stanley_cup/,changemyview,"This is coming from a die hard Leaf Fan who has a yearly disappointment with the Leafs for the past 20 years. I'm still being somewhat optimist of pushing as far as we can go but my realist mentality still stuck on with me and here is my reasoning.

Despite overcoming Tampa Bay Lighting and Boston Bruins out of the playoffs, there is too many factors that can crush the Leaf's Cup chances or even the finals chances.

No. 1- There are at least 4 teams that are better than the Leafs which consist of the Oilers, Golden Knights, Hurencains, and the Devils. Oilers have the MVP in Connor Mcdavid and other top heavy talent that they can afford to have a bad defence. Golden Knights and Hurricanes are a solid cup contender with great balance of Offence and Defence similar to Boston and Tampa but with less pressure and low-key. And the Devils just crush the Rangers who are another Cup favourites as well. The Leafs barely defeated Tampa and not in the most dominating way as possible and just avoided Boston.

No. 2- Lack of Experience and choking history. Leafs finally gotten over the demons of the first round, but what about the 2nd round and beyond. It's whole new ball game of better teams, pressure, fatigue  and so much more. Plus the Leaf core are incredibly inexperience with John Tavares only getting far as the 2nd round as an Islander. Sure they beef up some veterans like  Ryan O'Reilly to help boaster toughness, but it may not be enough. Plus the Leaf has a history of choking and they may do it with the Panthers.

No. 3- The Leafs have still have tons of flaws within the team and still yet to truly dominate a playoff team. Yes, they make an awesome comeback against Tampa, but it was due to luck and Tampa losing steam in the end an are considered to be one of the Cup favourites. Leaf have a somewhat inconsistent Goalie in Samsonov no matter how much I love this guy. Couple of trouble makers like Holl and Bunting nearly cause us penalties like Kadri did back in his day. The big 3 of Mathews, Marnier, and Tavares are great yet have a history of not showing up when it matters the most. They show up against Tampa at the right time but can they do it again in further rounds.

No. 4- Panthers are coming off a underdog victory against the greatest team in history and now have this killer mentality/nothing to lose at this point to give Leaf huge trouble and possibly upsetting them in game 7. Leaf has a tendencies to piss of leads against weaker teams so this will be another huge test to see if they can handle the Panthers tenacity. 

No. 5-  Gary Bettman. Yeah enough said, as long as he is on the helm as a commissioner, he will never let a Canadian team win ever as it is bad for business in America. Canadians would love it but we are far a few in between compare to the Americans. The last Canadian teams to win a Stanley Cup is the Montreal Canadiens and he wasn't a commissioner back then. If he ever lets a Canadian team to win, the last team he will ever let them win is the Leaf due to their negative reputations from both the fandom and the history.

Even still, I'll enjoy the little victories the Leaf will get and will be open to changing my views as well."

In general that would mean anything that is not fact based or that is trying to invoke emotional buying should be illegal.

Examples of what is definately wrong:
1. ""Best food in town"" (even if its currently true it won't be forever)
2. Customer satisfaction or customer opinions about a product (customer opinions are fine as long as they are not used as advertising material)
3. ""Great value"", ""Cheap"" etc (what's cheap for you might not be cheap for me - especially if the shop has managed to buy it cheaper than what they're selling it for)

The reasoning is that they provide either no value or an incorrect/skewed value to the potential buyer. In a majority of cases it is intentionally misused anyway."

102,2023-05-03,CMV: Romantic relationships with only children generally require an unfair amount of effort.,u/newadventures96,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/136e3v4/cmv_romantic_relationships_with_only_children/,changemyview,"I’m not a psychologist, and I’ve done zero archival research into the topic. My opinion formed from two past relationships with women who grew up without siblings. I acknowledge that I’m generalizing. 

I believe that maintaining romantic relationships with only children is much harder. I believe that growing up with siblings teaches us important social lessons about emotions, sharing living space, and how to communicate. These lessons can be learned elsewhere, but are easiest learned by loving and living with someone (or someones) for the first 18 years of your life. 

I will begin by stating that only children live increasingly “me-centered” existences. They’ve rarely had to compete for a parents’ attention, love, or care. Onlies generally grew up without the child-aged jealousy after craving a parents’ affection or time and watching a sibling receive it instead. For example, a young kid may think “I would like to cuddle with mom,” but mom may choose to cuddle a brother instead because its his turn. These experiences teach a person to form realistic expectations about love and attention, which translate down the road to emotional maturity in a relationship. Onlies generally never experience what it’s like to have a sick sibling, and being told to fend for oneself (at a reasonable age), or even being cast away to another caregiver. For example, when I was 12, my brother was seriously ill for two months. Hospitalized. My dad worked and my mom stayed with him in the hospital. Unless dad was home, I was stuck caring for my younger brother and myself. A neighbor checked in on us hourly. This experience teaches a person the importance of priorities, and prevents a “drop every one else for me” mindset that I’ve come to find Onlies develop throughout their lives. 

Only children typically grow up with their own living space to themself. Typically decorating, furniture choices, and habits are never challenged by someone else. Siblings might have to share a bathroom, a bedroom, or other portions of the living space. Siblings are quick to point out “you don’t need to take up the entire bathroom with all of your make up.” Onlies grow up without these experiences, and when confronted as adults about how they might have tough to handle habits, they are discovering this for the first time in their life. Decoration and furniture conflicts might be the first challenges they’ve ever experienced. I had an ex girlfriend tell me she hasn’t had to “deal with” other people’s stuff in her space before. 

Communication is also very important and growing up with siblings, a person (hopefully) learns a healthier way to express their thoughts and feelings to someone that they love and have to see every day. Siblings teach you that even though someone is bothering you in the moment, they aren’t going anywhere for a long time, so it’s important to confront the issue instead of avoiding it. Siblings teach us how to go about confronting issues in a way that doesn’t make the conflict worse. 

Siblings are kind of like a non-gross dry run at a relationship that only children miss out on. Obviously there are ways to learn these skills and have these experiences later in life, and obviously some house holds with multiple children aren’t perfect. There are plenty of people with brothers and sisters who don’t communicate, share, or are jealous. Again, I’m generalizing. Communication can fix a lot of these issues, but I hated telling a 26 year old woman that she needed to share and compromise almost daily, as if she were 4 years old. 

Feel free to tell me that my past relationships made me bitter, maybe I need to hear that. Not a joke."

Today in modeling, fashion and other industries are trying to promote the idea that you can be “fat and beautiful” and society is leading people to think that it is okay to be overweight and you should love yourself for who you are.

This is obviously very flawed, approximately [2.8 million adults globally](https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/6-facts-on-obesity) die due to being overweight and obese.

[Many diseases and chronic illnesses are also caused by obesity](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/effects/index.html), such as diabetes, heart diseases, strokes, HBP and etc.

Self love and acceptance is often an excuse to justify avoiding losing weight. However it makes more sense that self love is about improving and investing in yourself to become the better version of yourself you are capable of.

Self love and self care are connected. Taking steps to care about your physical health will also improve in your mental well-being, having a healthier body weight can boost your self esteem.

Painting obesity as “beautiful” and normal is simply not true and sugarcoating laziness and very bad health. Society is not doing a good enough job at encouraging healthy beauty and will put just anyone in that category of “beautiful” with the excuse of diversity and inclusion.

Glorifying obesity and the term “fat shaming” being overused makes people think it’s okay to be at an unhealthy body weight because you are “accepted and beautiful the way you are.”

Beauty is subjective, and modeling industries should have a variety of diversity such as height, race, complexion. These are factors you cannot just change.
Being overweight can be reduced and changed with working out, eating a healthy diet and cutting off unhealthy foods and habits.

Using eating disorders is not a valid enough excuse. Especially with overeating disorder. Teaching yourself self control and taking slow steps to achieve a healthy and possible goal is not impossible.

If society puts in their best effort to discourage unhealthy eating that contribute to obesity, there will be more healthy people in the population which is what should be the goal.

Self acceptance should only apply and be encouraged when talking about things that are humanly impossible to change. With the right motivation and determination, anyone can make the correct steps to to improve in theirselves and become a healthier human being."

1,2023-05-03,CMV: Most people aren't actually against people 'forcing their morals/beliefs' on others,u/Few_Mud9147,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/136migf/cmv_most_people_arent_actually_against_people/,changemyview,"TL;DR - For moral opinions/beliefs, it is not immoral to 'force' your belief on others, as long as the belief itself is valid, and it is hypocritical to ask others not to 'force' their views on you without also adequately dismantling why their views are wrong.

As a vegan, I hear ""no one cares if you're vegan or not, just don't force your beliefs on others"". Recently, I realized that I don't believe most people actually feel this way. We all force our views on others literally everyday. Murder and rape of humans being illegal? That is the majority of society forcing the belief that rape and murder of humans are wrong and should be avoided onto those that don't. And this forcing of beliefs is done through force, or at least the threat of force. But I haven't heard anyone ever argue that the laws in place against the rape and murder of humans should be removed so that we don't 'force our morals/beliefs' on others. The entire foundation of a legal system is forcing certain beliefs onto everyone, or at least certain people. 

The only time that people say 'don't force your morals/beliefs onto me' is when the topic at hand is something that they disagree with or when they don't want to change their behavior. In reality people should just say 'I disagree with your opinion on this, and here is why...' because pretending that we don't all force our beliefs onto people is absurd. People should say 'you shouldn't have that opinion or try to spread it to other people because..."".

Most people have moral beliefs that go against what the majority of people around them believe. Trying to convince people of something is not inherently wrong, it just depends on the thing itself that is 'being forced'. Trying to 'force' people to not rape and murder humans is seen as good (as it should be). Trying to 'force' people to wear shoes that are too small for them would be an example of a bad thing to force on people, since it is harmful. These are just examples.

Some caveats: 

1. This applies to moral opinions or beliefs. Trying to force someone to believe that orange juice taste better than apple juice is silly since that is purely a subjective thing. 
2. It depends what is meant by 'force'. Obviously in the case of the murder and rape of humans, force is used literally. Not every moral belief will be justified to use that. But usually when people say 'don't force your beliefs on me', it is just a debate or argument, not an actual use or threat of violence to behave a certain way. Saying that you believe something is morally right and that all or most people should do it is what I generally mean by force (aka having a moral opinion and trying to convince others of it)."

However, the LED bulbs that most people will purchase will be on the cheaper side (race to the bottom in Chinese manufacturing) and likely not last ""forever"" - far from it. And because there is no great way to repurpose/recycle or repair these bulbs, they largely end up in landfills or incinerated.

Amazon is full of reviews of bulbs that flicker, arrived DOA, don't work with a particular dimmer, or otherwise didn't last longer than a few years. They often have warranties, but the manufacturer isn't asking anyone to send anything back because it's trash. I'm writing this today as I had a 4"" inset (can) fixture from a VERY reputable company simply stop working- there's plastic housing, wires, socket adapters, etc. that are now in the trash after 2 years of operation. And it was like $22!!!

For the sake of this discussion I looked at a quality (high CRI) bulb from a reputable mfg: [https://a.co/d/b2fyEOa](https://a.co/d/b2fyEOa) \- $10 for a 75w equivalent bulb. I don't want to get into the maths, but $10 buys a lot of electricity in many markets in the US - I concede that in some other countries, it's a different conversation.

I guess the net of my view is that if we only allowed certain quality standards or designs or otherwise required manufacturers of these products to take back and repurpose ""bad bulbs"", I'd be more inclined to think these are a ""net positive"" for the environment.

What would change my view:

* info that indicates that incandescents are actually worse for the environment when they end up in land fills due to materials used. i.e. What seems like thin glass and a copper coil is actually way more impactful due to coatings, manufacturing processes, etc.
* the delta on energy consumed and related emissions are actually worse for the environment than any additional plastics/chips/etc. that end up in our land fills. Not sure on this for residential use as I see HVAC being the lion's share of energy consumption, not some bedroom lamp.
* Info that some new tech or legislation is creating a higher quality bulb or placing more responsibility on manufacturers of these consumables. e.g. new laws requiring modular pieces for easy repair by a consumer or local shop

EDIT: I thought of a couple of pretty good reasons that folks haven't provided.

1. Having to change less often (which I agree with) would result in fewer injuries from folks on ladders/stools and allow elderly residents to perhaps never replace bulbs (reducing operational costs of nursing homes).
2. Also, the side impact of fewer cycles per socket would reduce people ignoring burned out bulbs which in some circumstances could result in injury (on a stairwell, etc.) - thus reducing strain on local medical facilities.
3. Ultimately as our planet warms, we don't need additional items in our house creating heat, thus creating more strain on our HVAC systems in those parts of the world - this could in some areas result in deaths as AC systems may fail prematurely."
0,2023-05-03,CMV: Renewable energy is also destructive to nature.

While I don’t care much for that part of the argument, the other main argument is that even renewable energy is destructive to nature, causing very great CO2 emissions to build etc etc, so they will just never get us out of the climate crisis. All industrial production is destructive to our environment and causing climate change in some significant way, and so will all future inventions probably (rely on metal etc), so unless we stop all that (yes these types literally advocate for caveman style living, arguing that enough people will die of climate change to make it viable), we’re doomed. 

This is a view I’ve come to hold myself. I don’t see any hope anymore. I sincerely think it would be best if we just strived to die out by not having children or something because I don’t see hope and I just don’t want to go back to pre industrial ways and I doubt many others would, including deep ecologists who never really follows it them selves.

We are not going to discuss whether these groups are right, or call them wackos, instead, I'd like to talk about something else.  
Once those B people say it is wrong after thousands say it is right, the next step is for A supporters to say that B people hate A people and are unloving and are the reason for murders that happen to A people. My view is that this in general, is not accurate. There are two problems with the things they tell you to try and make you feel like a criminal for disagreeing. And those problems are . . .

**1: Showing you disagree tars you with the same brush as the worst of those who disagree**

In many cases, if you say, ""I think A is wrong,"" A supporters will start screaming things like, ""you are exactly the reason why murders of A people happen!"" Are you though? If you said shoplifting was wrong, would you be supporting armed lunatics who chase shoplifters? Ask most people, and they would say no. But once it moves into something most people think is right, instead of something like shoplifting, suddenly, if you say it is wrong, you are an armed lunatic or a supporter of them. So, due to tarring with the same brush, I'm calling logical fallacy on these things.

**2. Showing you disagree gets you labeled as a hater**

If you say you don't think something is a good idea, possible, or right, all of a sudden, you're a hater. But are you? Is not agreeing or saying you don't a hate crime? Is it in some way bitterness? Frankly, I would consider any bitterness to be coming from the person who doesn't even hear you out or respectfully say they don't want to, but instead, plays the victim and labels you a hater.

**My stance:** People of any group A should not say you are hateful if you are the disagreeing group B who happens to be in the minority.

**Your job:** Provide a logical argument, and *change my view.*"

Politicians routinely lie about how they'll vote on policy while campaigning. Kristen Sinema campaigned on pro-worker policies but then voted against everything she promised, effectively killing hopes for a minimum wage increase. 

The KKK was very politically effective through the use of intimidation and violence, effectively crippling the Civil Rights Movement in southern states. The KKK's violent influence has led to white supremacy surviving in the south to this very day.

The United States spends an insane amount on its military not just because of corruption and corporate lobbying (although that's a factor) but because in realpolitik the threat of overwhelming violence in the ultimate trump card.

If public opinion mattered in war the US would've dropped propaganda pamphlets on Japan instead of Nukes.

The US military makes soldiers sign contracts saying they'll serve for a certain number of years precisely because they don't want popular sentiment leading soldiers to leave. That's why the UCMJ punishment for desertion is so severe, up to execution, because the ruling class don't want their 'volunteer' soldiers refusing to fight imperialist wars of aggression.

In developing countries elections are rigged all the time and it just so happens that the strongest Warlord usually wins. It's impossible to expect politicians to respect the voters when they have no self-interest in doing so. Some lynch mobs and assassinations might teach them to respect the will of the people."

Looking at the statistics I think that it’s actually always been an issue in the US. I think violence have been ingrained in our culture from the start. 

My view boils down to this. Instead of focusing on singular issues about how violence is being perpetrated we should be studying the root cause of why violent crime in the US happens. I believe it would be better to focus on curing the disease instead of triaging every symptom. I don’t know what a solution would be. My assumption is it’s probably a mix of factors like poverty, wealth inequality, the state of the justice system, and the US focus on individualism."

This impedes these parties' ability to tailor their policies to their region. And for states that are significantly more right wing or left wing than the country as a whole, this often leads to uncompetitive elections and extended single-party rule, which are cancer to democracy. The solution is obvious: prohibit any regional party from having the same name as a federal party.

The best evidence supporting my argument comes from the US. But I want to encourage people to look at this with fresh eyes, so let's focus on an example from a different country.

Alberta is significantly more right wing than Canada as a whole. So it's no surprise that in federal elections, 85%-100% of the people Alberta elects to parliament consistently come from the most prominent right wing federal party.

This lack of competition isn't great, but it's acceptable. Because unless a country can sustain a high number of prominent, competitive federal parties, it makes sense that people in the country's most right wing (or left wing) region are going to feel like they only have one viable option in national elections.

Provincial elections should be much more competitive. Provincial parties should be free to fine-tune their policies to Alberta, since other Canadians don't get to vote. So although Albertans consistently vote for a single party federally, on the provincial level they should have a competitive, thriving democracy.

This should be true, but it isn't.

From 1971 to 2015—*44 years*—Alberta's Progressive Conservative Party ruled the province. They won a majority government in 12 consecutive elections, so no other party had any negotiating power for nearly half a century.

All three major provincial parties—the Progressive Conservatives, the Liberals, and the NDP—shared their names with the three biggest federal parties. Albertans already knew the federal Liberals and the federal NDP were too left wing for their taste, so it was incredibly difficult for the provincial Liberals or the provincial NDP to gain a foothold.

Take oil as an example. Alberta has tons of oil, so Albertans tend to support pro-oil policies. The federal NDP generally opposes oil extraction. The provincial NDP, however, is far more pro-oil because they know their voters and they want a shot in hell at winning elections.

But most Albertans don't know this. The federal NDP gets more media coverage than the provincial NDP, so Albertans naturally associate the provincial NDP with the federal NDP's policies. The provincial NDP can shout until they're hoarse that they support the oil sands, but few Albertans hear them and fewer believe them.

The provincial NDP tries to tailor their policies to Alberta, but their name holds them back from gaining as much support as they otherwise could.

So why doesn't the Alberta NDP simply change their name? This seems like a problem that should fix itself.

For three reasons:

1\. They still benefit from the name recognition of the NDP moniker, which every Canadian is familiar with.

2\. Their ties to the federal NDP help with organization and fundraising.

3\. The dominant Alberta party, the Progressive Conservatives\*, have no reason to change their name and break their association with their federal counterparts.

This last point is the most important. The provincial NDP adopting a new name would do nothing to diminish the enormous boon the provincial Progressive Conservative Party gets from being heavily associated with the only federal political party most Albertans find acceptable.

If the provincial NDP changed their name, it would be unilateral disarmament. They would suffer in terms of name recognition, organization, and fundraising, while their rivals would retain all these benefits.

The dominant party will never voluntarily give up this advantage, so they need to be forced. No state, provincial, or regional political party should be legally allowed to share a name with a federal party. At least not any federal party that gets more than 1% of the vote, so provincial parties don't need to worry about sharing a name with one of the dozen tiny federal parties no one pays attention to.

If this rule were adopted, Alberta would be a big beneficiary. But there are a bunch of American states that would benefit even more.

Political tribalism is so entrenched in the US that the winner of many state elections is a foregone conclusion. If you're hoping, for example, that Democrats will lose the next California election or that Republicans will lose the next Texas election, you're going to be disappointed.

With no competition, the dominant party has little motivation to provide for their people. They grow incompetent, like the California Democrats, or vindictive, like many state Republican parties. If you're virtually guaranteed to continue winning elections, you're free to attack people who oppose you instead of trying to gain their support.

The nationalization of politics has made it nearly impossible for regional parties to get out of the shadow of their federal counterparts. Most people establish their political identity based on federal issues, since that's what we hear about most. We put much less thought into regional politics. So if there's a regional party with the same name as the federal party you support, you're likely to vote for that party without putting much thought into it.

If state political parties all had different names than federal parties, people would actually have to think before voting in state elections. You couldn't blindly transfer your judgements about federal parties over to the state level. You would actually have to pay attention to local news, read the state parties' policies, and watch the debates.

States and provinces deserve to have competitive elections and parties whose policies are tailored specifically to the needs of their region. Democracy works far, far better with competitive elections than with single-party rule.

Let's look at some counterarguments:

1\. Regional parties already have different policies than their federal counterparts. The former are not carbon copies of the latter.

This is true to some extent. But not nearly to the extent it would be if regional parties weren't handcuffed by their names.

You may even be able to find examples where this is true to a large extent. But the clear trend is that regional parties have significant trouble differentiating themselves from their identically named federal counterparts.

2\. This regulation wouldn't accomplish as much as you think it would. Sure, it would stop people from conflating federal parties with regional parties. But some states and provinces would still have uncompetitive elections and extended single-party rule. And people still wouldn't pay enough attention to regional elections.

No, my idea is not a panacea. It wouldn't fix these problems completely. It would just help fix them.

3\. If regional parties are forced to change their names, people will still figure out which regional parties are similar to which federal parties.

This is only nominally a counterargument. Because making voters figure out where regional parties stand is one of the primary aims of my idea. If you do research and discover that Texas' new Armadillo Party shares 90% of their policies with the federal Republican Party, then you've become a much more informed voter.

4\. Regional parties will try to skirt the rule. Instead of the Texas Republican Party changing their name to the Armadillo Party, they'll just call themselves the GOP, which is a nickname for the Republican Party.

If parties try to skirt the rule, the rule will need to be enforced strictly. The country's elections agency should make rulings on whether a regional party's proposed name is too closely associated with a federal party.

Will there be tough calls?

Yup.

The fact that it won't be easy to draw the line is a horrible argument for drawing no line at all. There will always be edge cases that are difficult to decide. This shouldn't deter us from striving to strengthen democracy.

5\. But the elections agencies in many countries suck. For example, the Federal Election Commission in the US is doomed to perpetual gridlock, with votes on most important things resulting in a 3-3 tie.

My proposal is not a good solution for countries with elections agencies that are corrupt or structurally designed to be ineffective. If this describes your country, you need to deal with this problem first.

6\. Would a regional party be allowed to have the same name as a regional party in a different part of the country? If this were prohibited, it would be much more difficult to enforce because there would be a much larger list of names that regional parties have to avoid.

It *could* be somewhat harmful for parties in different regions to share the same name. But I'm not convinced it'll be harmful enough to forbid it.

People pay little attention to local news in other parts of the country, so a Texan is unlikely to conflate the policies of the Texas Armadillo Party with the policies of the Louisiana Armadillo Party. It's also far less plausible that a Louisiana political party would have influence over a Texas political party than it is that a federal political party would have influence over a state/provincial/regional political party.

7\. This puts too much of a burden on voters. If we can't blindly vote for the same party regionally that we vote for federally, then we'll have to pay attention during election campaigns and think before we vote.

Oh no. How horrible.

8\. There are many problems with elections, such as gerrymandering and low turnout, that this would do nothing to fix.

This isn't supposed to fix everything. It's just supposed to be an improvement.

I've noticed that my mind will come to 10 conclusions before I've finished digesting a thought. The same is to be said about reading responses online.

If you're typing out a message that only you have context for (hearing the inflexion of your voice or subtle face gestures you might make) I think it's only courteous to give hints at what you're trying to say not only for your sake, but the recipient's as well. (Both of you can become asses quickly)

Some conversations, it's obvious because there's enough context to help people along. 

I just can't help but wonder if people see using such things, like emojis or text clues, as a sign of weakness. Maybe they see it as an action that condescends their intellect 🤷🏼‍♂️

To sum up my thought, I think it's bullshit people expect you to know what they are saying all the time, and I think more use of emojis would cure this problem 👌🏻"

I'm here to discuss an idea that might seem a bit unusual: the idea that always trying to be happy might actually be causing us more problems than it solves. Happiness is usually seen as the ultimate goal in life, but I believe that there are a few reasons why focusing on it too much might not be the best idea. I'm excited to hear your thoughts and see if you can change my view.

1.	**High Expectations:** Always trying to be happy can lead us to think that life should be perfect all the time. This can make us feel let down, upset, or even depressed when things don’t go the way we want them to.

2.	**Ignoring Other Feelings**: When we focus on being happy, we might forget that it’s normal to feel sad, angry, or scared sometimes. These feelings can teach us important things about ourselves and help us understand and care for others. If we only care about being happy, we might miss out on these valuable lessons.

3.	**Wanting More Stuff**: Sometimes, people think that being happy means having lots of things or always doing fun activities. This can lead to a cycle of constantly buying and wanting more, which can harm the environment and cause stress when we can’t afford everything we want.

4.	**Putting Ourselves First:** If we're always focused on our own happiness, we might forget about the people around us and the importance of working together. This can make society less connected and caring.

I'm looking forward to discussing this idea with you and hearing your opinions on whether always trying to be happy is really the best approach to life."

Succession isn’t good. It’s not overrated. It’s actually kind of crappy.

Where the writing is good, the timing is terrible. Any humour in the script is completely lost between long, non-entertaining, badly paced dialogue. 

It’s an interesting character study, but the gimmick of seeing unapproachable and awful real life corporate Elites up close and personal grew old very quickly for me. The fact that they are insufferable human beings feels utterly predictable and unoriginal also. I never recognised a huge amount of depth in the characters, which I think is sort of the point for some of them but I’m fatigued.

Speaking of predictable - Logan Roy’s snappy insults and comments seem non surprising and corny as fuck, so much so I often violently roll my eyes when he talks. I’d go as far to say that his character is actually written pretty badly. 

Isn’t the whole thing a little pretentious? The handheld cinematography and quick zooms is the only thing that keeps me engaged. My mind often switches off completely whilst I watch, and I usually cannot help but spend time thinking about other things during its inappropriately long run time, like my groceries, or what I’ll do in the weekend, or my washing, for example.

The problem is then, if god could exist eternally then We would never reach the present (the point of time we are now) since before this point of time there was eternal time. I call this the eternal paradox, if you’re eternal cause and effect dosn’t exist. since eternality dosn’t have a beginning, a infinite amount of time had to have passed  for the present to happen.


Imaging a river representing the flow of time, stream of flowing water stretching into the horizon, and a rock in it which represent a point in time, more specifically the present. Now look at the horizon, noticed how you don’t see a end? Well that’s the amount of time that would have to pass for you to get to that point in the river.

And therefore, with all of that being said, that would utterly contradict there being a eternal creator of the world.

Nothing.

However, if this is true, it makes gender essentially useless and practically just a subset of personality.

Every culture has male and female roles and behaviors tied to biological sex. As much as they may differ, there is always some separation based on that. Fine.

Then, we have some transgender people that have *body* dysphoria as a result of gender dysphoria , and wish to have the body of the opposite sex.

Finally, we have people who have no transgender people who have no body dysphoria, but still have gender dysphoria, no plan to transition, but will claim to be a gender that does not align with their biological sex. The thing with this though, is in every instance, they are describing *personality*.

AMAB but is mild-mannered, feminine, interested in make-up etc. Says they feel like a girl. Thing is, these are all just personality traits. Having a mild mannered demeanor is personality. Liking certain things is personality. How does someone in this context claiming to be a girl mean anything other than that their personality traits align with those that AFAB women typically have due to being molded by society.

Inverse example, AFAB woman, claims to be non-binary. Likes her body, but doesn't like the expectations that go along with womanhood. Doesn't care about makeup, likes being strong and aggressive, but also likes some typically female things, very big into romcoms, likes flirty with men etc.

Again though, these are all *personality* traits. They have no bearing on being male or female.

Gender when divorced from biological sex are just personality traits, and are not sufficient justification to identify as the opposite sex, compete on sports teams as the opposite sex, use bathrooms for the opposite sex, etc.

Of course it goes without saying if a pedophile acts on those urges they’re a piece of shit because they’re ruining the life of an innocent child/person. But they shouldn’t be villainized for being born that way if they’re not actually acting on those urges."

I can completely understand that people may not like how it feels to have birth privilege in our democracy, but I feel that the economic and diplomatic benefits far outweighs this.

As I understand it, the uk monarchy owns the crown estate, which owns many of the parks and lots of land in the uk. 25% of the profits are kept by the monarchy, 75% are given to the British government. There is some deviation year on year but generally it is the case that the uk monarch gives 75% of their earnings from their private property to the government. 

Unless we disagree on the fundamental idea of owning private property, surely this is a benefit to the UK?

I guess my view is based on two key assumptions: we assume that private property cannot be seized, and that the economics of the monarchy is more important than the ‘fairness’ aspect.

EDIT: after reading many of the fair comments, I have accepted that the monarchy is at cost to the taxpayer, to the tune of about £86M a year. I think the reason why I (and presumably so many other royalists) try and find perhaps tenuous arguments for them is a more sentimental attitude to the royal family and ‘Britishness’."

This is further proven by the fact that most local governments will have festivals where (for a fee of course) they'll suspend the open container laws for a specific area of the city. They obviously don't suspend related laws that actually matter like public intox or littering, because those actions do harm the community.

I'm not talking about kids who are a bit chubby, I'm talking about kids who are obese to the point that it affects their health and mobility.

These parents are drastically reducing the quality of life of their children, and endowing them with an unhealthy relationship with food that will very likely carry over into adulthood. These children are highly impressionable and aren't mature enough to understand that their diet is unhealthy, and it may be too little, too late if and when they ever reach that conclusion. Furthermore, they will likely be subjected to extreme bullying. I am not condoning bullying whatsoever, but the unfortunate reality is that obese children will almost always be bullied by their peers. This is highly likely to result in low self-esteem, social alienation, and possibly poor mental health.

I believe that there is a responsibility for authority figures in the child's life (primarily teachers) to intervene, and there should be some oversight to ensure that children are given a fair chance to maintain a healthy weight. I don't believe that there should be any punitive measures in place for the parents, since this will likely lead to the parents of obese children hiding their children so that they can't be identified and punished for their neglectful behaviour. Rather, social services should intervene to educate both parent and child about nutrition and healthy eating, as well as how to prepare quick, convenient and tasty meals.

There are, of course, exceptions. Once a child is old enough to purchase their own food, it is no longer within the parent's control, and they can't be held responsible for their child's eating habits. Also, parents of children with health conditions that predispose them to obesity should be granted exemption.

Essentially, I believe that allowing your child to become obese is akin to watching them struggle with any other health condition and failing to act on it, which would be considered neglect. I feel strongly that there should be some oversight to prevent this.

I'm interested to see what you all think!"

I’ll start by saying, imo, the Switch is painfully underutilized, underpowered, and has long surpassed it’s expiration date. 

The Switch wasn’t even more powerful than like a PS4 pro when it came out, yet they still are trying to keep it alive years into the PS5/Xbox Series X lifespan with no new console announced? Considering Pokémon of all games had widespread performance issues, maybe that should be a sign to Nintendo that it’s time to move on?

And so much of it’s library is just ports, remasters, and remakes. Ask somebody what they play on their switch, imo chances are they’ll list of a few wii U titles and smash bros/splatoon. It feels to me as if Nintendo has been dropping fewer and fewer high quality, original titles in favor of porting Wii U titles banking on the fact that like 90%+ of the Switch’s userbase prolly doesn’t have a wii u, or they drop a game often considering disappointing, like Mario Strikers Battle League and Nintendo Switch Sports. 

And the Switch’s online, in comparison to that of the Wii U’s, is, imo, dreadful. First, I’ll mention NSO, which is crazy to me that ppl are fine with $20/year for access to old games (not even owning them like with Virtual Console) and for online that pales in comparison, at least from my experience, to the decade old Wii U.

Look at Splatoon 3 for example, so many people in r/Splatoon and the Splatoon community constantly cry about disconnects/lag/etc. This may be anecdotal, but I personally didn’t experience it anywhere near that level on Wii U. And when you consider that Splatoon 3, along with other games iirc all still use P2P for online multiplayer instead of servers makes me question why you even have to pay for NSO. 

And imo the Wii U clears the Switch in terms of controllers. The GamePad imo, was amazing and opened up the opportunity for the Wii U to basically be a big, HD, Nintendo DS imo. Compare that to the Switch’s Joy-Cons which imo are kinda just like less inspired Wiimotes with crippling drift. I personally also prefer the Wii U having the joysticks symmetrical at the top, instead of the right stick below the buttons."

In many sports I see athletes gaining weight after they retire but in the NFL it's the opposite: most of them lose weight. I've read about players that retired and one of the causes was the side effects of all that extra body mass they must have in order to play, specially for offensive and defensive linemen. One famous player, Rob Gronkowski, retired for one year and came back a lot lighter and he said he was feeling much better because of that.

Also there is the concussion problem that never seems to go away. In the last decade the damage from the concussions has increased and I believe the increase on the players weight plays a huge part on that. I would much rather be hit by a 250-pound guy than a 300-pound guy any day.

About the game itself, I remember once when I watched a game in the stadium and how slow all linemen looked. I feel the whole game would become much more dynamic if the players had a maximum weight of, let's say, 250 pounds."

This is especially true in countries in Africa where patronage and tribal loyalties can oftentimes combine to screw over countries' development. It gets even worse in developing countries where lobby groups can lobby for certain policies such as the US, resulting in procurement issues.

&#x200B;

We need to push our genetic and cybernetic sciences into creating an army of enhanced politicians, raised from birth, free from any familial connections and enhanced to remove their human nature (such as computers in their brains to lobotomize their human mind) so that they don't fall to corruption and other vices common in politics.

Challenge my view on why we cannot play God (besides the moral issues that will be raised) in creating better politicians free from their human nature to run our government since I think we better play God to engineer better politicians if our politicians keep on succumbing to their human condition and abusing their power."

School doesn't educate about consent and how that actually works, which results in lots of sex crimes. Since you don't get educated about this stuff, you will start doing minor inconveniences like touching people randomly (not on sex organs). Then the butterfly effect kicks in, where you will try something more intense, like you will start touching someone inappropriately in their sex organs. That will keep escalating, since you lack knowledge about consent. Finally, you will start raping them, and common sense won't save you here, since you still lack the education about consent. My opinion is that school should teach people about consent, every year repeatedly, to grave that into your mind. One year isn't enough, you need to be reminded every year, so you can actually develop common sense. So, teaching people about consent is necessary."

-Enjoyment of the status quo : you can do nothing and the women will mainly do the hard work.

-Non engaging investment : you can say for decades ""A male contraceptive pill ? Count me in the second it goes out !"" without having to actively invest yourself and try to gather informations, ressources on it. So you also enjoy a position of a somewhat ally/feminist without having to do anything to actually change it.

-Same goes for ""I'll see it when enough studies will be done on it !"". While it's also a legitimate thing to say, it encourages passivity towards this issue. How many people have said this and have actually tried to look up any studies ? How many people have just scrolled down the page, forgot about it, and saw a similar news a few months or years later reactivating the same reaction in them ?

-By staying in this passive position, you're participating in the status quo. You're not giving incentives to government or pharmaceutical companies that there will be a demand from men, and so it eternally looks like a topic that ideally everyone would be on board but on reality no very little give a shit. So it seems like not a lot of money or votes to be collected here.

-While a minority of men want to get invested in the development of new male birth control options, most are fine with condoms, vasectomies and withdrawal and don't see the point because they're not the one taking hormones, taking day after pills, getting pregnant, aborting, possibly dying. They're also mainly not the ones experiencing stealthing, having to impose usage of condoms, etc.

-Male birth control options have been in the work for decades but have also encountered the resistance of a good chunk of the male public : it may seem like an attack to their virility, their social status as a man. It is not uncommon to have this kind of argument linked with ""you're a cuck"" or other ""feminists brainwashed you"" type of deal.


I'm saying all this without hatred or anything : I genuinely think most guys that fit into this narrative don't do it with malicious intent or even consciously for that matter.

And there are men actively trying to take part in it, like the men in some trial for a hormonal pill and wanted to pursue the study despite the bad side effects they experienced, but we're halted by the ethical panel concluding that it was too risky.

But I am convinced that if men really wanted it, they would have had it by now.


Other good reasons exist though : 

-Ethical standards for trials in the academical work have evolved and strengthened over time, meaning the same studies done for female birth control wouldn't have been approved by today's standards.

-Reward/side effects ratio that implies it's ok for women to tak emote risks with their contraceptives because the alternative can be dead, while for men it is mostly nothing, so the bar is higher with men.

-AIDS epidemic in the 80-90s halted progress in the area since the focus was to be done on condoms."
0,2023-05-06,CMV: Traditional families are not necessarily the best families,u/Key_Path_8277,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/139vsv8/cmv_traditional_families_are_not_necessarily_the/,changemyview,"I’m here to explain that traditional families are not necessarily the best families, and here’s why. You see nontraditional families such as same sex parent families, single parent families (whether by choice or circumstance), families headed by cohabitating parents, extended families, families headed by polygamous parents, etc. can actually be good families, you know as long as the parents do good for the offspring. On the flip side traditional families can be bad families, especially since many of them are headed by abusive, irresponsible, and negligent parents and since many parents heading a traditional family are often drug addicts, gamblers, and other ill mannered walks of life. Not only that the traditional family has greatly declined over the years. I’ll cite some references momentarily. With all this said, there has been a great rise in nontraditional families and many have proven to be good families. 

Of course I should define what a traditional family is, which would basically be a family of where the parents are married, monogamous, and heterosexual and it doesn’t matter whether the children are biological or adopted. A traditional family is often so a family where the parents are in their first marriage but a blended family, where the family is headed by a stepparent can sometimes be considered a traditional family, though that’s debated. But anyway, no matter how you define a traditional family, it’s been on decline for decades and it’s still not necessarily the best family, and anybody who says traditional families are the best families are rather prejudiced against nontraditional families."

To wit. There is no reason for ""speeding"" to be a finable, or jailable offense, when through the use of common, cheap tech, it could be impossible. Every car with a function on board computer gets a gps tracker installed which connects directly to the tranny, throttle, and speedometer. When the legal speed limit is reached, it cuts fuel, engages a rev limiter, or prevents the tranny from allowing an increase in speed.

A counter to any possible arguments:

* ""No one said you have to speed!"" I don't have to be punished either.

* ""It's not the roll of the government to control my vehicle!"" It's not it's roll to punish you either.

* ""What if there's an emergency!"" Please, any law enforcement or judges in the comments correct me if I'm wrong, but no jurisdiction in the country recognizes ""an emergency"" as an excuse to speed.

* ""What if I'm being chased by a *bad guy*?"" Well, if neither of you can go faster than the other, than so what. Also, refer to my previous statement.

42,2023-05-06,Meta: Feedback Survey Results,u/Ansuz07,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/139x83y/meta_feedback_survey_results/,changemyview,"As many of you know, Reddit recently launched a feedback survey for subreddits so that users could give anonymous feedback directly to moderation teams.  CMV was fortunate enough to participate in this survey, and we are very thankful for those of you who filled it out.

As promised, here the links to both the [summary document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSVQ3U5tEUjbylObigrICUGcr2NsuroMpM3JLpAZxMVpWhWqByiGX_ikOfICpzLKA/pub) and the [raw data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRQztIu8wevW-Ys7hH9ZhUoe58uWfMhCKRg7tBYjxFNCQ1WJNDXhutqnI0Lxty2Aw/pubhtml), exactly as it was provided to us from the Admins.

I'd like to address some of the negative feedback here (I'll skip over any possitive stuff).  The TL:DR is that there isn't all that much actionable we can take from this, either because the requests simply aren't feasable or they would change some of the core aspects of CMV that we just don't see as up for debate.

-----

**Overall Satisfaction:  60.38% vs. a 73.89% benchmark.**

This doesn't surprise me all that much.  CMV isn't exactly a ""fun"" sub - it is sub that serves a purpose and function, and folks are not always going to be happy about what they see here.  I'm not sure what could be done about this beyond limiting unpleasant topics, and that would really kill the purpose of CMV.

**Exposure to Harmful Content:  22.42% vs. 10.53% benchmark**

I was honestly surprised this was so low.  It's not a shocker that you get exposed to tough subjects on a subreddit designated for discussing tough subjects.  

I _will_ say that from looking at the raw responses, this was mostly related to transgender topics.  We tightened up on those posts a few months ago and it's clear that we need to go a bit further.  We are working out the mechanics of what that would look like, so stay tuned for an update - I'll be clear though, we won't be outright banning the topic.  That isn't something we are going to do.

**74.82% thought the rules are appropriate and 71.79% thought they were enforced fairly (77.59/77.41 benchmark)**

We're basically average there, so not much to say.

**Moderation Team (multiple metrics)**

I was a little disappointed to see that these were so low.  I'm not sure what else we could really do to build trust iwith the community here.  We try to enforce our rules as fairly as we can and make decisions in line with the core purpose of CMV.  I do suspect that people are frustrated that a lot of suggestions aren't implemented, but CMV is a mission-driven sub and we aren't going to sacrifice that core mission just to make the sub more popular.  I hope people can understand that, even if they don't agree with it.

**Community Culture (multiple metrics)**

Low, but again, not shocked here.  I've never seen CMV as a community people ""belong"" to like a normal sub.  CMV is a service, not a club, so it makes sense that these numbers would be much lower.

-----

To the top suggestions:

**Add a symbol for partially changing opinions**

This would require a rewrite of Deltabot and no one seems super excited to donate time or money to make that happen.  If anyone is willing to commit to either, then let us know and we'll talk.

**Allow Devil's Advocate posts**

They don't work with the format.  How can your view be changed if you never held it to begin with?

**Anything that makes the rules more likely to be read.**

Let us know if you have any ideas on how to make this happen.

**Actually crack down hard on bigotry.**

This is _really_ tough. Bigoted opinions are the ones that CMV exists _for_ - if we crack down on it, then what purpose do we serve? The sub will be sanitized and people who hold those opinions will just voice them somewhere else, where odds are even lower that they will be changed.  I'd love it if I never saw anything hateful here again, but that isn't the world we live in and whitewashing viewpoints here doesn't make them go away.

**CMV's biggest issue as with almost all political-ish subreddits is the constant influx of 5-day-old right-wing sockpuppets /r/asablackman-ing with zero intent of any actual engagement**

Very fair. We already don't let those types of accounts make posts, but we feel that stopping new Redditors from being able to even comment would make the sub too inaccessable.

**Discern faster when a post is either lionfishing or soapboxing.**

Far easier said than done.  If you've got objective was to make Rule B better, we are all ears.

**Because of the specific rules around awarding deltas too you'll often see commenters cynically challenge posters on semantic grounds to weasel their way into a delta rather than actually engaging in interesting or meaningful discussion on the merits and shortcomings of the expressed view.**

One of our principles as mods is that it isn't our job to decide good or bad arguments.  You _really_ don't want us doing that, because it would give us too much power to eliminate arguments we simply don't like.

But again, if you've got objective ways to make a rule around this, were open to listening.

**Posters too often violate the rule about sincerely being open to having their mind changed.**

Thats already a violation, so I don't know what else to do here.

**I think that ""your view is correct and shouldn't be changed"" should be a valid (top-level) response that would allow people to participate more naturally.**

Again, doesn't fit with the format.  We specifically don't allow agreement because this is **change** my view, not **reinforce** my view.  There are plenty of other places out there to go if you want to agree with people.

**Change my view should be more serious with relevant topics that makes you think.**

The users decide what they want to post, not us.

I don't believe in monarchies, I don't think any country needs a monarchy, and I think it would be great if all commonwealth countries became Republics tomorrow. The whole thing is an antiquated vestige of an illegitimate and illiberal institution, and I've no love for it.

King Charles' coronation is probably the biggest event in the last few decades of British history.

Many anti-monarchists have expressed displeasure at the fact that such a lavish, expensive, and elaborate ceremony is being held at a time when the people of the United Kingdom are struggling to pay their bills and afford the cost of living amid biting inflation.

The estimated cost of the coronation is [125 million USD.](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/05/king-charles-iiis-coronation-set-to-cost-the-uk-up-to-125-million.html)

I guess I need to start by defining what I mean by ""video game logic"". Well, in several video games, items can spawn out of nowhere and buildings can be constructed out of nothing, or at least a potentially infinite number of pixels, like say in Minecraft. Several modern leftists and progressives, seem to have a view that wealth and resources ought to be distributed in this manner, I guess another term would be ""post-scarcity"". If food and housing are a basic human right, how do you ensure that everyone has infinite access to food and housing? It can't be conjured out of thin air or pixels. I've also heard the Marxist term ""seize the means of production"" to accomplish this. How do you ""seize the means""? Who or what is doing the ""seizing""? How do you ensure production remains indefinite enough to provide for everyone? At what standard of living? A remote village might consider housing that is more complex than a straw hut to be an excessively gaudy luxury. An average Westerner might consider anything that does not have electricity and running water to be sub-standard and primitive. How do you build an infinite number of Minecraft houses?

&#x200B;

Also, I need to make a second point that touches on the concept of genderfluidity for a bit, but it is still relevant to my first point. In a video game, one can often create a character or avatar according to a wide set of physical characteristics and even switch between different avatars or characters as one chooses. From my point of view, modern self-identifying genderfluidity is an attempt to force this upon the real world when it isn't a medical possibility. Some people seem genuinely upset that their restricted to a single physical form and can't choose whatever form they want (see some furries/""otherkin""). If the concept of male and female is merely what you identify as at any given time, then why can't someone identify as non-human/a different species/otherkin, etc? People want to physically display as whoever or whatever they feel like, but outside observers are not allowed to question it or express a different opinion. That is a form of dishonest and illogical thought policing in my opinion. We don't actually live in a video game world where we can change out avatars whenever we feel like it.

&#x200B;

TLDR - It seems that the more progressively minded, especially on Reddit, wants to live in a limitless/concequence-free video game world and are willing to try to forcibily impose dishonest and physically impossible standards to do it."

wet is ontologically parasitic meaning it relies on an other to exist for example shiny is also ontologically parasitic, you wouldn't say a car is shiny if there where no car no would you say the shiny is shiny.

ontological parasitism relies on an other as demonstrated by the shiny example and shiny is not sufficient for shiny to perform its parasitism as demonstrated. water is equivalent in this matter.

wet is the state of being covered or saturated with water or another liquid

now you might say but this means water can be wet with another liquid this is correct but relies on a non sequitur and this case is specifically excluded.

what is the smallest unit of measurement of water?

a microgram or a nanogram? no neither of these qualify as they are not the smallest possible unit while the basic properties of the substance are retained ie chemical composition. the smallest possible unit of water is a single molecule and since we established that an ontologically parasitic state requires an other water does not meet this requirement.

the next argument your going to make is well what about two molecules of water?

in this case the the requirement of an other is satisfied and so both molecules could be considered to be wet however this does not fulfill the basic property stipulation as it is a cumulative effect and is akin to saying all ammonium nitrate can detonate in its current state. this statement is false because ammonium nitrate requires above a certain mass to be present and other elements such as continued heat for the decomposition reaction to achieve a supersonic speed. it is not a basic property and requires more than count 1 of basic units to achieve."

There are many stories or recordings of people inside the towers calling 911. In my opinion this was an illogical move on their part and was poor decisionmaking

The 9/11 attacks were extremely visible and affected the largest building in the city. Obviously the police and firefighters would know that there is a fire there. 

In my opinion, it is pointless for them to dial 911 at that point. Many people have already called the event in, and even if NO ONE called it in, the firefighters would still see a big fire and smoke. 

Little is gained by calling emergency services, as they are obviously already going to be trying their best. In my opinion, it is highly illogical and counterproductive for people to call 911 instead of simply trying to find a way to escape or survive"

However, I have been finding this stature of belief to be too openminded, where does one draw any line to an absolutely delusional opinion? Such examples include those believing that animals do have the ability to consent to intimate sessions with humans, or young girls can consent faster because they mature faster, or other absolutely insane ideas you can come across. You can obviously back up your opinion with facts as to why all of the things I mentioned are wrong - but so can they. So can any opinion really be purely incorrect?

Understandably, opinions (arguably disguised as facts) such as the earth being flat are objectively wrong.

Women suffer the most when their choice and their healthcare are stripped away. I don‘t mean to detract from this at all. 

(Note: I’m going to use “women” as a stand in for birthing parent and “men” as a stand in for non-birthing parent. It’s may be less inclusive but it gets the point across better.)

However, we don’t talk much about how the loss of abortion rights affects men. With abortion being stripped away:

1. Men are responsible for raising unplanned children that they may not have the financial ability or other resources to raise.
2. Especially if the woman is unwilling or unable to raise the child, the male parent will be left on the hook.
3. If women are forced to go through with risky pregnancies they may die, and the male parent will end up being single fathers left to raise the other kids. (This almost happened to a man I know personally, who would have had to raise 6-7 children by himself if his wife had died in a risky unplanned pregnancy. In this case abortion was recommended by the doctor, but would likely have been forbidden in Texas for example.)
4.  Men who want to have children will have a harder time finding a willing partner because the risks of childbearing are increased.
5. Men will be pushed into having vasectomies, as an effective but permanent birth control method because condoms and the pill are not 100% effective. This takes away their ability to have children if their circumstances change in the future.

This might seem like an asshole take. All 5 of these issues affect women as well and in all of these cases women are much more affected then men. Pregnancy can be fatal, and many state do not provide adequate protection to protect the pregnant person’s health.

However, I think it’s still important to include men in the discussion. They are losing rights, too, even if indirectly. I think men will be more motivated to actively defend abortion rights if they see it as an issue that significantly limits the choices they are able to make with their partner rather than as a “women’s right” that doesn’t really affect them. 

Yet I’m not sure I’ve ever seen abortion discussed in this way."

At the time (approximately 25 April) that the twitter account @ESCdiscord took a [screenshot](https://twitter.com/ESCdiscord/status/1650787662125580288/photo/1) of Ian Banham's reply tweet, the BBC had used as a title for previewing ""Woman jailed after stabbing and tying up victim"", making the perpetrator's gender the entirety of the perpetrator's identity for that headline. When tweeted (approximately 28 March), there was a tweet summary of [Zara Jade: Halifax woman jailed after stabbing and tying up victim](https://twitter.com/BBCLookNorth/status/1640625011168870401).

By contrast, the BBC only mentioned the victim's gender twice: in the sentence ""Zara Jade, 54, attacked her victim at a Halifax flat last year and left her tied up while she went to an ATM"" and in the phrase ""also demanded her PIN number"". It's almost the bare minimum the BBC could do, and you could easily miss it. Meanwhile the article repeatedly used gender-neutral terms for her: in the headline itself, ""attacked her victim"", ""from the victim"", ""tie her victim"", ""the victim's wounds"", ""Jade's victim had serious health issues"", and ""towards a vulnerable victim"".

While the perpetrator's gender is newsworthy, in that the perpetrator is going to a male prison, so is the victim's gender. While violence is bad in general, violence against women (especially vulnerable ones) is especially abhorrent. And yes, that includes violence against a victim who's reported elsewhere as being transgender. It also indicates more attention is being given to the perpetrator of violence than its victim.

244,2023-05-07,CMV: The public education system is a huge cause of the economic and racial segregation in America,u/mrm0nster,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13afyxd/cmv_the_public_education_system_is_a_huge_cause/,changemyview,"In the US (not sure what other countries do) we have geographic school district lines that dictate which public school a student will attend. I recently saw that homes on the Frisco, TX side of the district line are ~15% less per square foot than homes on the Prosper, TX side. Reason is because Prosper High School is very highly ranked/regarded. I’m sure this dynamic is present across the country.

In almost every state, property taxes in local district fund education, which creates a flywheel:

Higher home prices -> more property tax revenue -> more education funding -> better schools -> more housing demand -> higher home prices (loop)

The opposite death spiral occurs in low-income school districts. 

Not surprisingly, these school district lines also separate the population along socioeconomic and racial lines. 

The government is running a program aimed at equalizing education, but in actuality we have institutionalized mechanisms that drive further inequality, as the rich get better schools and the poor get worse schools—by law."

Heck, even when prohibition gangsters were using unrestricted machine guns in the 20’s to massacre rival gang members, I cannot think of any instance of them using those guns to slaughter school children during that time period.

An assault rifle ban, even on a federal level, is not as effective as people may think. The infamous Columbine shooting happened during the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 as signed into law by Bill Clinton before it sunsetted in 2004.

Recent mass shootings in California and Buffalo New York also bring into question the effectiveness of bans on assault rifles and high capacity magazines

Serious talk of assault weapons bans usually leads to a noticeable increase of gun sales, especially of the assault weapons that are on the chopping block.

Confiscating AR-15’s and other assault rifles is unlikely to ever be passed into law due to the widespread use of unserialized lower receivers or “ghost guns” and an unwillingness by many gun owners to relinquish their guns.

The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that was signed into law last year enacted extended background checks to those under 21, implemented funding for red flag laws, further criminalized straw purchasing and partially closed the boyfriend loophole.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan_Safer_Communities_Act

Yet it seems like mass shootings show no signs of stopping with almost 10 people killed at a mall in Texas just recently. I must imagine that gun control advocates are very frustrated with what seems to be a never ending mass shooting problem.

All the potentially effective solutions are not realistic as far as being implemented or signed into law due to gridlock and the solutions that have been proposed are likely to have little impact on the issue."
0,2023-05-07,CMV: America as a whole will likely be much more anti gun in 20 years than it is now,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13aiwuf/cmv_america_as_a_whole_will_likely_be_much_more/,changemyview,"The constant mass shootings that are happening on at least a monthly basis are wearing on the American people, and they want these massacres to stop.

Right to carry laws have changed dramatically in the past 30 years (only one state had permit-less gun carry in 1990, now there are over 25 states that allow permit-less gun carry), DC vs Heller and McDonald v Chicago has affirmed an individual right to keep and bear arms and NYSPRA v Bruen striking down may issue gun licensing.

But despite all that, younger American adults are noticeably more anti gun than older American adults and also less likely to own a gun. Why? Because they’re more likely to be Democrats than their parents and grandparents. Political party affiliation is one of the strongest indicators as to how someone views the gun control debate. Millennials are the most Democratic generation compared with Gen X, boomers and the silent generation. 

https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/ 

Other factors are potentially to blame for America’s potential increase in anti gun viewpoints. The demographic that is most likely to own a gun are white, conservative, rural dwelling old males, a demographic that is quickly becoming one of the smallest in the nation with increasing urbanization and significant growth in the country’s Hispanic population. As Hispanics immigrate to America from countries with some of the worst gun violence problems in the world, they will want a reprieve from that issue. And as Americans who live in urban environments, who often see the damage guns can do in gang violence and street crime, increasingly outnumber those in rural environments where guns can be a useful tool for hunting, farmland work and so on, an increasing majority of Americans will see guns more for their negatives than for their positives.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/

As Americans become increasingly removed from positive gun ownership experiences, they may fail to realize the potential benefits of gun ownership for others or themselves.

As hard as it may be to predict the future, I think with all the present data available I’m fairly confident in my prediction."

I think the vast majority of the population of younger people would be best served going straight into employment via apprenticeship and that higher education should be pursed by the talented or only if the person knows it’s the best route to a career they want.

Let’s face it the massive debt US college students face is ridiculous, but for myself I’m talking about the UK system and POV. 
Many people here go for a jolly up and get degrees that are useless and due to the amount of younger people that go and get degrees makes it that much harder for people who want an internship that much harder because it has become common and accepted, 
The standards are ridiculously to even get or land an internship, 
I can’t verify if true but I’ve heard it said that before all this Min-maxing generation, employers would often give an potential employee a chance without all the qualifications or promote them from working their way up.  Now we are seeing most jobs asking younger people to have Qualifications and Experience before even getting a first job.. 

They are also open to woke ideology and harmful ideas to society. 
So in short I don’t think pursing ‘higher education’ should be encouraged and that other careers which are vital like Trade jobs should be encouraged way way more than a degree in ‘women’s’ studies or ‘Gender’


Edit : To clarify what I mean by Woke ideology, is the ability to not have a difference of an opinion without being ‘cancelled’ which to me sums up woke ideology and this why it is harmful because if you can’t have an opinion then it is very very harmful to society."

389,2023-05-07,"CMV: The British Royal Family is a relic from Feudal times and has no place in the modern world, and is a net cost to the UK",u/pragmojo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13aqmzv/cmv_the_british_royal_family_is_a_relic_from/,changemyview,"With the coronation of King Charles, there's been a lot of talk about the monarchy lately.

The topic often comes up as to whether the royal family is a net cost, or a net benefit to the UK.

It seems the argument in favor of the fact that they are a net benefit/contributor to the UK is based on the fact that they are funded through the profits off of their own properties - of which a majority gets paid to the UK government, and they retain a small percentage.

So if you look at the royal funding situation at face value, it might seem to support the argument that the royals are in effect paying their own way:

- The royal family is paid through something called the Sovereign Grant, which is income paid to the Royal Household, as a percentage of revenue collected from the Crown Estate
- The Crown Estate is a collection of land and properties owned by ""the Crown"" - i.e. the British monarch

But if you look a bit closer, things get significantly murkier.  For instance, the Crown Estate contains:

- A large amount of property in London and across the UK, including housing.  So people living in these properties effectively pay rent towards the Crown Estate revenue.
- Around 8000 square km of agricultural land and forrest.  So people paying for food are effectively contributing to this revenue.
- 55% of the UK's shoreline.

So it's not as if the royal family is some kind of charity organization.  The revenue being raised is at least in part originating from hard working citizens meeting their basic needs.

Also you have to consider the history of the Crown Estate.

Originally it dates back to the Norman invasion - when the ancestor of the current Royal family took control over Britain through violence.  And under the feudal system, the monarchy owned literally everything, by ""authority of god"".  So the subsequent wealth and power accumulated by this family was essentially built on the backs of the entire population of the UK, who had no power, and no right to own property themselves for the better part of a millennium.

And the current management structure of the Crown Estate dates back to the time of King George III.  That was during the era when Great Britain was moving beyond the system of absolute monarchy, and negotiating the relationship between the royal family and the parliament.

When George became king, the arrangement was that the monarchy would have responsibility for running the civil government, and as compensation for managing this responsibility, they would be allowed to retain the Crown Estate.  But George did a terrible job of managing the civil government, which went massively into debt, as well as he himself did permanently.  At that time, the Crown Lands were earning relatively little income compared to other income sources, such as the excise taxes coming in from the colonies.

So George asked to be bailed out by the Parliament, and relived of his debts.  In return, he would surrender control of the civil government, as well as turning over control of the Crown Estate, and instead to be paid in the form of a fixed stipend.  So the monarchy willingly surrendered control and profit from the Crown Estate to avoid personal ruin and the disgrace of the royal family.

So it seems to me given the history, it's a bit incoherent to claim that the royals are ""paying their own way"" through the Crown Estate.

Like on one hand, people justify the existence of the monarchy by saying they are just figureheads without any *real* power.  Because obviously it would be a bit strange in 2023 to have an absolute monarch ruling over a western country like the UK.

But then on the other hand, they want to say that the monarchy is contributing through society by surrendering the income from their property.

So in my view, if the monarchy is a symbolic entity, which exists only on paper for historical reasons, then the ownership of the Crown Estate is also something which exists only as a symbolic relic of the past, and any income from it should not be viewed as a sacrifice from the Royals."

They are in a much better position in life and yet are whining about how little they make, while a lot of regular people are struggling to stay financially afloat.

I do believe in strikes for good reasons. Case in point with the railroad strike. They were average joe workers asking for healthcare and sick days, which is a very reasonable ask. These strikes (WGA / MLB) just reek of ""I want 8 million dollars instead of 7 million.""

Most people who dont have easy access to a method of suicide in their vicinity dont go through with it and are more likely to get help and i think there is a similar situation happening here. Guns are way to easy to obtain and the vast majority of people never use them. As well as this, misuse of the gun in a self defence situatuon could land the owner of the gun in jail anyways depending on the laws of the state anyways. So on top of mental health needing to be less stigmatised, we need to make firearms illegal to all but law enforcement and people who display a absolute need for them (ex. People far away from police in rural areas). The US is behind the times compared to a lot of the world om lots of its policies and this is one of them.

I think I wrote a CMV the same as this before, but I didn't get many replies, and it didn't change my view much. So, this is me trying again. 

I converted to Hinduism age 13/14 (can't remember how old exactly). I love yoga, especially the philosophy, the chanting, the meditation, and the commitment to peace and non violence. I am vegetarian, and have a shrine in my house. 

Why wouldn't I want to raise my hypothetical kids Hindu? Because this is a thing that **I** believe in and practice. The teachings and practices may not resonate with my children. To me, telling your children to partake in a philosophy and spiritual practice they show no interest defeats the purpose: One of which, in my opinion, is to bring joy and peace to the practitioner. 

I have a shrine in my bedroom, but if I one day get enough money to do so, I will make a meditation/prayer room in my house. How would I prevent my children from going in and becoming indoctrinated? Put a lock on the door and explain the room is private. 

I would want to do this because otherwise it would feel like I'm forcing my practice on my children, which to me would feel immoral. Why, as a parent, would I assume the things that bring me inner peace and tranquility are the same for my child? To me, that's arrogant.

0,2023-05-07,CMV: Online porn should be banned,u/ReserveSimple1648,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13b42nf/cmv_online_porn_should_be_banned/,changemyview,"There are a couple of reasons why pornography should be banned so I made a list:

1. Any media that sells porn will start selling tabboo porn because it will make them more money

Enter pornhub and you will see titles that sound something like this on the main page which means you will not have to even search for these:

-A woman stuck somewhere (normalization of rape)
-Stepsis fucked (normalization of incest)
-The holes of sluts get destroyed (normalization of misogyny)

Now, an adult would know that these videos are fake but I and nobody I know has started watching porn after they were 18, it was almost always around 10 years and while unfortunate a lot of 10 year olds could see all these videos and start believing that is how people behave and act when it comes to sex that they mighr try it in real life and that is very problematic because we will have a portion of women and men who will think that the way pornhub promotes sex is the normal thing
And the problem is, what pornhub cares about is money and just like youtube they need a lot of people to stay and click on the vids which will not happen if every video is titled 2 people have ordinary sex and those more tabboo will get more views and more watch rate which will make people who make porn do more of those videos and then they would be the ones that are normal to watch and  people will suffer

2. Does the opposite of help to mentally ill people

There has been research done where they showed that actually watching porn would decrease your prefrontal cortex (logical part of the brain) and increase your amygdala (your fight or flight response), now someone who has anxiety or trauma related mental problems can use porn and masturbation as a form of coping but by doing so they are making their anxiety and trauma worse by increasing what causes it and decreasing what would slow it down

And the more hatefull mental illnesses like narcissists, psychopaths, people with anger isuue etc can easily find porn that helps soothe what they are looking for which not only makes them think that it is ok to feel the need to put others down but rather they would be reward with sexual pleasures, and just look how many messed up sadistic porn subreddits are and that js only on reddit

Not to mention the additional possibility of another mental illness and that being addicted to porn

So porn only adds fuel to the fire when it comes to mentally ill people

3. Crime

Women getting raped, human trafficking are quite common in porn conpanies and are heavily advised and scared of to not talk about it, even pornhub the biggest porn platform had to remove so many videos last year because of how rapey they are and some (just like many platforms) included underaged teenagers into the mix. The thing is that the people who work in such places breed in sexually sadistic and masochistic people and with that , the dynamics will always have people who are very rapey and like to control others

4. Normalization of rape, misogyny and others

Things feel normal to a person once they are expose to such same things a lot and i said porn companies will always give tabboo titles more time to glow which means when you open them, you will be more and more in the mindset that the titles you see are normal behavior (especially if you are a young person)

5. It's misinformation about sexual education 

Condoms are almost never used, it is almost never showed that they cleaned their asses before doing anal, they keep showing women putting big things in their pussy that might tear some tissues, a lot of creampies happen and somehow no one gets pregnant, the way the woman moan when absolutely nothing is being done to them and a lot of stuff."

3,2023-05-07,cmv: i don't believe women enjoy when men show actual vulnerability.,u/StratoSquir2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13b4vwu/cmv_i_dont_believe_women_enjoy_when_men_show/,changemyview," now that i got your attention with the title, let me expand on it.

most women might say they, they might even *believe* they do, but i think they wouldn't.  
i think what they unintentionnally mean by ""i like men who aren't afraid o showing vulnerability"":  
\-is when the dramatic music swell and the attractive-actor share a single tear in a really sexy manner on screen.  
\-and when the attractive-actor break-down alone on his own where no-one can see him.

they're both extremely romanticized and dramatized scenes, but since it's always been considered pathetic for a man to cry or show vulnerability in general,  
this kind of idealized dramatic scenes are the only standard women have.

let's be honest, men, women, **no-one** look good when they cry and/or break-down.  
men are aware because we know how we are when we do, and most of us have also seen other men have a emotional-breakdown, most of us have also seen somes womens cry as well since they're a lot more comfortable showing-it as there is no social-stigmate against it for their case.

the thing is, women are NOT aware of that at all.  
i'll go on a leg and say most of them have NEVER seen a teenage-guy cry, let alone a grownass man.  
maybe thoses with brothers might be familiar, but family dosn't register as ""others"" exactly, when your brother/sister cry, you don't see it as someone from the other-sex breaking down, it's your family.  
a realass personn, could be for stupid reasons or valid ones, but if tommorow your brother had a break-down, you wouldn't register it as a **man** having one.

womens are unfamilliar with men showing actual emotions or sensitivity.  
they like to see it on TV, because in a 2 hour long video or 40 minutes long show, you can dramatize it to make it look good.  
no wailing, no irationnal complains, no emotional-outburst beside maybe a single moan, no snot coming from your nose, no red-eyes, eyebrows are not even frowned  
just the calculated right ammount of tasteful droplets of the most pure water you can have,  
and then the guy immediately go back to be in control again.  
it look fucking \*immaculate\* .

womens might \*think\* they like to see men vulnerables, but IRL, they'd either be extremely uncomfortable, or straight-up disgusted by it.  
because it's not half as glorious as medias make you believe, or as expected as it is with womens.

when a guy has a emotional-breakdown, it's because shit has went so over and beyond what they can endure that they don't even know what to do anymore.  
and both social and gender-standards expect men to always be in control, dominants, and find ways to deal with whatever situations or events they might meet.

emotional-breakdowns for men are seen as absolute-failures on every levels.  
it means that you're a failure as a man because you've let yourself be dominated, and had a moment of weakness instead of overcoming your situation and/or environnement.  
and this is pretty-much the most unnatractive you can be, a failure.  
a vulnerable man, is a man who's a failure on every possible levels.

and while i'm absolutely sure there's womens with enough patience and maturity to understand that at the end of the day mens are just human as well,  
i'm convinced most chicks wouldn't like to see their male-partner show that kind of vulnerability unless their relationship is extremely serious."

This post may sound stupid, but hear me out. Isn't that what games like God Of War (2018) supposed to be? It changed the gameplay and style of the original GOW games, but still continuing the story of the games and not abandoning it. That's what Sonic Adventure is, it has different gameplay how it is played, a different type of soundtrack, how the art style changed, and how the story is told. There was also a soft retcon of Sonic CD during the start of Amy's story in Sonic Adventure where she was carried by Sonic while Metal Sonic was chasing them, but in Sonic CD, Metal Sonic has already captured Amy, and Sonic defeated him by being faster in a race and then Sonic saved Amy while Metal Sonic was already destroyed. Amy even said ""I miss the good old days. Hangin' out with my hero, Sonic"", so she was probably implying the events of Sonic CD that also proves Sonic Adventure is a soft reboot."

Breath of the Wild is essentially a giant world with very little in it. You can walk around for hours and encounter nothing. Each of the divine beasts are super easy compared to any of the temples in Ocarina of Time. The divine beasts each took me less than 20 minutes to complete (though I did go in with all items at the end). The forest temple in Ocarina of Time, in contrast, is much more challening. On top of that, there is an incredible soundtrack that when coupled to the well designed eerie rooms gives you a real sense of seriousness that I just never got at any point when playing Breath of the Wild (and I put in 130 hours). It's so weird that there is literally no urgency Breath of the Wild. I feel like I can just walk around forever like 'oh yeah I can do what I want forever cause Zelda is holding down Ganon. NBD.' Don't get me wrong: Breath of the Wild is a great game. It just doesn't clear the forest temple from Ocarina of Time, which is a high bar."

&#x200B;

I tried as hard as I could to find any solid information about this emerald mine. I cannot find any. I cannot find where it is. I cannot find what it's called. I cannot find a picture of it. Not one person has come forward (with proof) that they have ever been there.

The only actual evidence that it exists is the say-so of Errol Musk himself. Who, as I've come to learn, is likely a deeply unreliable source. For example, he once claimed that he had a ""Clint Eastwood moment"" where he had a shootout with three men and killed all three, shooting the final man in the groin, all while his young daughter Ali clung to his leg. He claims his sperm is in high-demand and has had offers from ""high-class Columbian women"" to buy it. He also claims to have impregnated his stepdaughter who he raised since she was 4 years old. True or untrue, that last claim shows a major lack of integrity on Errol's part.

Onto the emerald mine: Errol Musk claims he met ""an Italian"" at an airstrip in Zambia. There, Errol agreed to trade his plane for shares in an emerald mine that the italian owned. Which is kind of odd, given how Errol supposedly flew to Zambia on that plane, and would need to make pretty spurious arrangements to get back home. There is (conveniently) no paperwork for this transaction because the deal was made on a handshake. Errol also (conveniently) never revealed this name of this Italian person so that he could verify the mine's existence with his own paperwork.

After Elon publicly denied the emerald mine's existence, Errol recanted a bit. He now claims it's not really a *mine*, per se, but more of a tiny rock formation with emeralds in it, which is why proving it exists is so hard for him to do (I guess taking a video of workers digging emeralds out of it hasn't occurred to him yet).

Here's what I think: The mine doesn't exist. Errol lost his plane somehow due to a crash or through gambling or some other embarrassing fashion, and concocted the emerald mine story to cover his ass. He now uses the story to claim some amount of credit for his son's success, because he's a blowhard who makes things up to make himself sound important.

I believe perfection (in character, results, rewards, looks etc) is completely subjective and based on preference.

His side was based on if you ask for a job to be done such as welding, that it has an ideal result of being 100% strong, resistant and neat. However, my side of the debate was based on my understanding that perfection is subjective and unachievable. The idea of perfection is something to strive for at all times in life, health, business, career and relationships, but it does not exist as a single shape or form.

By looking at things from his side i get where he is coming from, but that 'perfect welding job' he referred to could be fit for purpose to one individual, while not specifically to another. 

If i had to personally describe perfection ot would be as like a percentage of above 80% but below 100%. 

The goalposts for 100% will always be growing/ adapting/ moving....along with our experiences and maturity over the course of our lives.

EDIT: I am conceeding on the basis that my point was not clarified or specific enough to get a good run at what i am attempting to dig into.  

CONCLUSION: If perfection exists. I am not it. Thank you all for the enlightenment. I will be back 😀"
0,2023-05-08,"CMV: We should abandon ""heritage"", ""culture"", ""tradition"" and ""people"" as a proper noun",u/HenryWu001,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13bohpm/cmv_we_should_abandon_heritage_culture_tradition/,changemyview,"EDIT: I mean collective noun not proper noun. Or just ignore that term, its not vital to the post.

&#x200B;

When we're born we are simply a relatively self-sustaining blob of biomatter with the ***potential*** to develop over the next half a decade or so into an intelligent, conscious and self-aware person. I highlight ***potential*** because at that point nothing about this new person is defined. We can see trends and tendencies of course, some universal to all humans, some dependent on this particular genome, others derived from reasonable predictions about the social environment.

But the content that defines who this person will be isn't decided yet, and fundamentally it never will be. By young adulthood many people have developed strong personality traits that will persist their entire lives, many other people seem to be completely new people each time you meet them. Most people end up falling somewhere in between. We create and recreate *ourselves* continuously through life.

But heritage, culture, and tradition --- these ideas attempt to impose preset labels (and thus inherently considerations) where none should exist. Regardless of which particular scheme we may use (and admittedly may sometimes have legitimate practical use as society exists), whenever we derive a scheme that treats the word ""people"" as a proper noun (ethnicity, nationality, heritage, culture, tradition, eg. ""my homeland for my people"", ""the American people"", ""I am German"") you can never escape it.

There are maybe half a dozen of these identifiers that apply to me that in no reasonable sense can I choose. Yes I can say ""I dont consider myself blah blah nationality"" but the ways in which these systems impact our lives dont respond to something like that.

And when offered a so called choice what we do get is either a cultural politics version of a double major/minor system in college; or a blind admittance that we should abandon these systems anyway - if there is no agreed upon system (however complex, contingent, and difficult to implement in practice) to apply these labels then they don't *mean\** anything in the first place.

I don't mean pretending discrimination / prejudice (individual) or racism (system) don't exist. We should make political use of any identify that is useful (sometimes I'm gay and sometimes I'm not. I may wish we abolish the concept of sexuality and any societal effect it has, but that fits lock and key with all the personal and impersonal ways societal impacts you when youre queer). But that's exactly what they should be - tools we use to improve our lives. Not shackles that we have blindly allowed ourselves to tie to our own ankles. Ancestors are dead, they don't care, and if they were alive more than 200 years ago, you'd probably want to kill them.

The birth of a new person should be considered exactly that. A new person, not another Italian, or Iranian-American, or European.

&#x200B;

\* Obviously using these terms has a societal effect. And so these terms have a *meaning*, of course they do, I'm using them. By *mean* here, I am trying to express that the labels can no longer be coherently used because theres no way to ascertain what they refer to."

It is just a fascinating idea human attach themselves to make life more meaningful because without the existence of God, life would feel miserable and hopeless. Maybe there is something called energy- good energy, bad energy. But that energy is not like the GOD we have made for ourselves who has so much shit to give about our business; like do this ,do that or God would punish us. I believe life is random and there is really no explanation why some suffers so much, while others do not. It is what it is.

The main premise for my argument was that that any moment, the human civilization could get wiped out of existence due to several threats, unknown viruses, nuclear attacks, asteroid impacts, unresolvable climate change, etc. and that our best hope for survival is to colonize other planets. 

The main premise for their argument was that the information gained/achievements due to space exploration does not justify the cost and that this money could be better used to improve life on Earth directly. They argued that our priority should be to combat crises on Earth before attempting to explore space and colonize other planets. 

See while I agree with several of their points, I find it difficult to draw the line at what point do we begin to colonize other planets if not now? At what point are we satisfied with the conditions of life on Earth for the average human? Majority of the current exploration missions such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic are run by private corporations while the budget for publicly funded missions like NASAs are much lower so the argument that the tax payers money going waste can’t really be used.

Also a simple analogy I brought up was asking if they rather have all their eggs in 1 basket, or have their eggs spread out which I think conveys the point i’m trying to put across as i’m thinking long term."

878,2023-05-08,CMV: Trans men are largely ignored in conversations about trans rights because it's inconvenient,u/mortusowo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13c9w7o/cmv_trans_men_are_largely_ignored_in/,changemyview,"I'll preface this with I'm a trans guy.  


I'm mostly going to be talking about anti-trans laws here. There are some that are blanket in terms of healthcare, but a lot of the bills around bathrooms, and women's spaces are focused around this idea that women are having their spaces encroached on by trans women who in their eyes are predatory men.  


A lot of this ignores trans men and how things would play out if these rules were enforced. For example, in terms of bathrooms, many trans men pass. If we are going to expect people to adhere to these laws then bearded trans dudes are going to be walking into the women's bathroom and definitely will cause problems. People will likely pick them out more than they might even pick out a trans woman. Yet, this is ignored completely because I think this reality does not fit into this vision of trans women overtaking spaces.  


Some of the sports bills are similar. I've listened to my representatives debate these bills in my state, and it's always about protecting women and fairness, even in lower level school sports. But this ignores the fact that some trans men, especially in high school, may be taking testosterone which would put them at an unfair advantage. They reasonably shouldn't be competing with the women's team. I saw a story about a teenage trans boy that was forced to compete in women's wrestling. He clearly looked like a boy and even won the competition ([https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/27/517491492/17-year-old-transgender-boy-wins-texas-girls-wrestling-championship](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/27/517491492/17-year-old-transgender-boy-wins-texas-girls-wrestling-championship)). I did see some more anti-trans people sharing images of this boy, but they mistakingly framed it as him being a trans woman.   


I think acknowledging trans men would sort of put a damper on these kinds of arguments. Not because they completely destroy anti-trans arguments, but because addressing them would require more nuance and push the conversation in a bit of a different direction. Frankly, the only time I've seen trans men acknowledged is if someone who identified as a trans man detransitions, but not much in terms of these other laws that attempt to force trans people to be grouped with their birth sex.  


I am looking to have my mind changed on this, and I will award deltas to those that can give me good reasons why trans men are ignored in these contexts that are beyond what I'm talking about here. Please note I'm not here to debate the legitimacy of trans healthcare or identities."

I believe one could make an ethical argument to the effect, which would more-or-less align with a libertarian outlook, but I’m really curious if their position has any real basis.

To my understanding, it originates from a different interpretation of Common Law that basically amounts to *”I never agreed to your system despite being born into where it resides, so it does not hold weight over me”* — and while I can see how that feeling would be empowering to those that feel the current system is broken, I wonder if it actually has legs.

While Law itself is broad, open to interpretation, and malleable — it is ultimately dependent on the people to subscribe to it or it does not work. That subscription typically comes either by choice (law-abiding citizens) or enforcement (criminal punishment via force)… but making an argument that circumvents this entirely seems fascinating to me but no matter where I look, it doesn’t seem to pass the smell test.

I’m all for giving rights back to the people but I also believe for this to work, it needs to happen within a system because without we quite literally find anarchy. So while I understand the ideation sovereign citizens propose, I really don’t believe it makes sense from either a practical or legal sense.

242,2023-05-09,CMV: Celsius is better than Fahrenheit,u/PandaDerZwote,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13cjij1/cmv_celsius_is_better_than_fahrenheit/,changemyview,"Before I begin presenting my arguments I want to make one thing clear: I don't think Fahrenheit is somehow unusable or that the difference is so great that you ought to switch systems now if you're using °F, so any argument resting on the idea that it wouldn't be worth it isn't going against my point. The view is strictly about how we, if we had to choose one or the other, ought to choose Celsius.  
This is also not a very important believe to me, so don't take it too seriously.  

With that out of the way: Fahrenheit seems to be defended more than any other kind of measurement system when it comes to the old metric vs imperial debate and I'd like to present the arguments I most often see in its defence and why I think that none of them hold up.  

1. The temperature range - The most common argument I hear is that F is for measuring air and therefore weather and it is better than C at that. 0°F is -17.6°C, which anecdotally was just the coldest temperature in a winter in the city in which Fahrenheit was invented, but nowadays refers to the freezing point of a mixture of water, ice and ammonium chloride. 100°F is about 37.8°C, based on the average human body temperature (which is not 100°F, but slightly lower).  
I personally don't see any advantages of these two points, cold places get colder than 0°F, while hot places  will get hotter than 100°F, they aren't really useful for anything (I don't think many people need to know the freezing point of this special brine and also the human body temperature, albeit a natural benchmark, isn't really relevant outside of someone having a fever, at least in everyday life. No weather related events happen at either end of the scale, nor do any of these ends have any everyday use otherwise. The system will result in most people having to deal with two digit temperatures most of the time, which is fine I guess, but not really anything noteworthy.  

2. ""Celsius uses the freezing and boiling point of water, thats not use either"" - I've seen this argument a couple of times, basically saying that a temperature scale is most used for telling weather and involving the boiling point of water doesn't make sense in that regard. I disagree with that statement on both points. Firstly, there is no scale that is perfect for telling the weather and both of these scale do an equally fine job at it, for the most part. If you only want to know which way to dress, either scale will do a good job.  
But I do think that picking the freezing point of water of the brine mentioned above is clearly the superior choice. Water freezing is basically THE most important temperature for most people when it comes to how to handle any specific single temperature value. I mean of course, if it is 50°C outside, you have to react to that too, but any temperature over say 35°C would make you react that, but no other single value has a greater influence than that at which water turns to ice. It is important not only for how we want to dress, but interacts with all of our infrastructure. If we use any kind of transportation, we will have to keep that one value in mind. Sidewalks need to be cleared, streets too, there could be ice on surfaces, ice inside pipes etc, ice freezing and erroding streets and much more. Of course, there are other temperatures too, like those at which it becomes impossible to use a diesel engine or the like, but those are spread all over the temperature range and water freezing might be the single most important single point in that regard.  
As for 100°C, water boiling is (hopefully) not something you have to deal with when it comes to weather, but if you think about it, there simply is no higher bound that makes sense in any weather scenario. In some places, 30°C is crazy hot in the summer, for others, its mild even. Any point in regards to weather will be arbitrary and useless for a good chunk of people. Therefore any other use you can get from that temperature will benefit you more. The boiling point of water is, once again, very relevant for people. We boil water basically every day, for beverages, for cooking or for basically all the electricity around you. I do believe the 100°C is of less relevance to everyday life than 0°C, but I also don't know any more useful capstone for the 0° to 100° scale, so I'd call it a #1 for the spot, albeit a weak one.  

3. ""Fahrenheit is more accurate"" - A weird one which I still read. They pick some round number in F and convert it to C and its all floaty, claiming basically that if you use C, you will need to handle decimals. This is obviously nonsense, you get the same if you do the reverse calculation, most flat C values will get decimal F values. For the greater accuracy, you would establish that the finer gradiant matters, which I'd argue it doesn't. Maybe the difference between 50°F and 51°F is smaller than that between 50°C and 51°C, but in reality these differences either don't matter (I've never cared for the decimal behind any C value when it comes to say picking what to wear) or the differences matter in F too (For example in a lab environment).  
For this point to have any merit, there would need to be a widespread usecase in which both C is too inaccurate and F isn't. I don't really see that point existing."

So I see the idea presented often that there are certain sexual practices that are biologically preferred and that we ignore these preferences to our detriment. 

A classic example is female promiscuity, that the women who do it are actually unhappy and that most men will not want to have them as a partner and that these responses are biologically driven. 

Another is that humans are generally wired for monogamy and that while exceptions exist, our biology will ultimately reward those who remain monogamous. 

It’s my view that the array of sexual behaviours humans can exhibit and still be fulfilled and happy is incredibly wide and has more to do with our social environment than our biological one. 

You can change my view by citing respectable research on at least one area of human sexual behaviour (again leaving aside orientation for the moment) that shows that it is to a large degree the biological default."

But this is essentially the same thing as using a random number generator to pick a number between 1 and 10\^100, getting 2457234982893249857247485784287, and saying

'WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW DUDE, WE ONLY HAD A 1 IN A 10\^100 CHANCE OF GETTING THE NUMBER 2457234982893249857247485784287, GOD OR SOMETHING MUST EXIST'

No. There is nothing inherently special about the number 2457234982893249857247485784287. You didn't call it before hand. You had a 100% chance of getting a number that has the same odds.

Likewise with humanity, sure there was a 1 in a trillion trillion chance of it turning out the way it did. But whatever way the universe turned out would be equally unlikely. If it had turned out that earth was a rock, that would be equally unlikely. We just seem to to add a sort of intrinsic value to humanity existing.

Some people might say 'well thats not a fair analogy, it's more analogous to using the same random number generator to pick a number between 1 and 10\^100, and we get a 1.'

But this is not a fair analogy. We still 'implicitly' called this number beforehand. We had already implicitly attached a value to this number (the number 1) over the other numbers before we did the number generator, which is what makes it cool when it turns up. HOWEVER, we never implicitly attached a value to humanity showing up before the proverbial dice was cast, and the universe resulted in us.

What happened is that the universe made us, then we decided that humanity had more implicit value than all the other outcomes (like earth being a rock formation) AFTER THE FACT. This means we can no longer use humanities existence as proof of anything special happening. It's circular reasoning. We can't use the random number generator, get the number 2347825893248, give special properties and significance to the number 2347825893248, like making it the beginning of any number line, giving it special gramatical rules like the way we do with 1 (we make 1 things singular and all the other number of things plural), saying there are 2347825893248 God, making 2347825893248\*a = a (like the way we do with 1) etc...  - and then after all of this, after we attached special significance to the number 2347825893248, we say 'Wow, the fact that the number generator chose this number, 2347825893248, is proof of whatever'. We can't define humanities existence as significant AFTER THE FACT, and then say 'well something really significant has happened despite the odds, that must mean god exists or whatever'.

And the exact same is true for argument's like 'well humanity is complex'. We have defined the idea of 'complexity' to place humanity on a heirarchy of value of outcomes the universe could have resulted in. We did not define  the property 'complexity', or any other mode of attaching value to an outcome for that matter, before the universe existed, so the fact that something 'complex' happened is not proof of anything.

There is no objective measure of humankind that definitely existed before the beginning of the universe, which we didn't come up with ourselves, which makes humanities existence a more valuable outcome than any other outcome the universe could have resulted in.

And the exact same is true for argument's like 'well humanity is complex'.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Lot's of people are saying a similar argument, but with something more general, like sentient life. My argument still applies. UNLESS YOU CALL THE RESULT OF A DICE, EITHER IMPLICITLY OR EXPLICITLY, BEFORE IT IS ROLLED, THE OUTCOME IS NEVER PROOF THAT THE DICE WAS BIASED. The universe resulted in sentient life, but there was no objective measure before the universe existed that said sentient life had any more significance than any other outcome.

EDIT 2: I should have worded my title better. I am not saying that examining the probability of humanity existing cannot tell us anything - like the probablity of other sentient life existing. I am only saying humanities existence doesn't provide evidence that we were MEANT to be here, because of God or the universe or whatever. **All this is essentially just a counter to teleological argument, argument from design, etc...**"

You won't be able to maintain friendships unless you give them positive experiences. You just have to figure out how to get through the panic suicidal  episodes. It's hard having positive things to say when all you think about is suicide everyday but there is no other way. Venting to friends is a temporary fix and in the long run makes you lose them."

It's almost 100% driven by men committing acts of violence (whether suicide, gang activity, domestic issues, or mass shootings). Women are typically only involved as victims of the violence.

This sits in stark contrast to gun rights advocates insisting that guns are a great way for women to protect themselves. 

The best way to actually protect women/children (if that is part of your goal as gun rights activists claim), would be to ban men from owning or carrying guns. Only let women own and carry guns. This would protect men from gun violence as well. 

Perhaps men could be allowed guns on a case by case basis after thorough background checks, but there should be much stricter constraints on gun ownership for men specifically than there currently is. We have a violence problem with men and we need to address it.

If someone is upset with me saying ""nigga"" they should be upset with me also saying ""n-word"" too. And if they're fine with n-word they should be fine with nigga.


I have the same issue with censoring I guess. It's unreasonable to say ""f-word"" instead of ""fuck"" when the person I'm talking to already has heard the word ""fuck"" before. (except when talking to kids because they likely never heard the word before)

I recently heard the term blackfishing and it was explained as someone who makes their skin appear darker with tanning or makeup, or wears their hair in small braids or something similar. I immediately thought of how many black women straighten their hair or wear a wig with straight hair. If the former is blackfishing wouldnt that make the latter whitefishing? I asked a friend this and she said that's racist. Cultural appropriation is a problem and offensive to the respective culture, but I don't think that should mean that certain hair or makeup looks are off limits because you are not from the culture that the look came from. 
Many looks can also be traced to multiple cultures depending how far back in time you go. Multiple cultures have women who cover their hair, braid their hair, or whatever aesthetic a woman chooses to wear. 
Just as someone shouldn't take offense seeing a hijab worn by another, the hijab wearer shouldn't find it offensive if someone else wears a hijab in a different way than they do. People regardless of their color should have the freedom to try different looks without being called offensive or racist."

While I understand the importance of being respectful, I think it's gone too far and is now actively hindering our ability to address real issues. People are afraid of being labeled as offensive or bigoted if they even dare to question certain ideas, which effectively shuts down dialogue and prevents us from exploring different perspectives.

For example, discussions around immigration, race, or gender can become incredibly hostile, even when participants have well-reasoned and genuine concerns. It seems that there's little room for nuance, and if your opinion doesn't align with the majority, you risk being ostracized or attacked.

This environment not only hampers intellectual growth but also further polarizes society. We need to be able to engage in uncomfortable conversations without fear of backlash, in order to truly understand one another and find common ground. I'm not advocating for hate speech or promoting harmful views, but I believe that we need to prioritize open dialogue over political correctness."

Edit- Here’s an analogy to express my view better -

There were once a bunch of rich powerful strong bullies in school beating the crap out of weaker kids and literally owning them. This was the situation since kindergarten. Stealing all their money, their food, their stationery and destroying their confidence. 

Then one day a far worse and way more evil bunch of bully kids show up and start bullying the crap out of everyone including the og bullies. These bullies are unarguably and definitely way worse and are even murderous. Or even worse than murderous. Henious.

Please help me make sense of this otherwise.",u/Planet_Breezy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13d4i7b/cmv_when_i_think_of_who_scantilyclad_attires/,changemyview,"For years I've had mixed feelings on revealing attire. In junior high it wouldn't have even *occurred* to me to be the *least* bit worried about it; though I grew up in a cold enough climate that the weather alone *usually* deterred it anyway. In senior high, I went to a school play where there was a subplot about a girl whose dad criticized her outfits as ""teasin' the boys,"" but I was shocked at the time that such a criticism thereof even *existed*.

&#x200B;

Cut to participation in webforums, wherein I was so accustomed to seeing scantily clad attire criticized almost exclusively by the most well meaning of people, and defended disproportionately by douchebags, that I came to conclude there *must* be something harmful about it, even if I'm not sure what. Maybe it's distracting to others, but it wasn't to me, as I'm easily distracted by all sorts of things and as far as I recall I've had no problem taking a quick enough glance for a mental picture and moving on. Maybe it's arousing to others, though I've never been aroused in public even by some lady with thicc thighs showing them off through tight pants. (Maybe my blood sugar was high?) Maybe it's that it makes him feel teased he can't have her, but apart from that being an immensely cowardly reaction to such feelings, it wouldn't have made much difference for *me*... I've felt far more tantalized by the sight of my cute redhead crush in her modest loose-fitting spring raincoat and loose-fitting splash pants during a field trip than by any of my other classmates in one-piece swimsuits during the swim meet the rest of us immediately went to after said field trip... *even though I wanted to get over said crush*. And I thought one of those girls had a crush on *me.* If them showing that much skin drew me out of my crush on that redhead girl *it'd have been music to my ears at the time*.

&#x200B;

It is not in spite of said experiences, but partly because of them, that a part of me is still vaguely worried about the ill effects of it. Because the people who say scantily clad attire is harmless then proceeded to make *me* out to be an example of that which I assume is true about *other* guys. In my mind's eye, such attire's defenders have escalated from being obnoxious (not inherently, just a bit more so on average than its critics) to being just plain prone to spouting falsehoods about me... which I extrapolated to their remarks about revealing attire itself being just as false.

&#x200B;

It often seems one-sided (those advocating stricter dress codes are cast as a slippery slope to Iranian dress codes, those advocating more lenient ones never cast as a slippery slope to public nudity). I keep hearing about school principals being smeared as pedophiles for enforcing said dress codes as well, which makes me worried about who I'm siding with if I believe them about said attire being harmless. To cap it off, when Randy Fine tries to smear drag as prurient despite supporting his wife doing actual burlesque, and gets called out on it, even *then* a part of me thinks ""oh, *now* popular opinion is willing to criticize someone for doing burlesque? What if Randy only supported it because he was worried popular opinion would have called a slut-shamer if he didn't?""

&#x200B;

And yet, if there's one common theme in all of the above, it's guilt by association reasoning. Something I otherwise usually *decry*. So how can I make sense of siding with all of the above? If other guys are more like me on the distraction/arousal/teased counts than I thought, how come the people who say so are wrong about *me*? And how am I to know whatever led them to that mistake isn't responsible for their view that this sort of thing is harmless?

&#x200B;

I have a feeling a part of me will always be reflexively siding with the fearmongers and the moral panic crowd anyway, if only because they don't have popular opinion on their side. As opposed to everyone else, who *do* have popular opinion on their side and will be fine without my help. But I sure would appreciate being assured that the world isn't teeming with guys who are unable to get a quick mental picture and move on, teeming with people who get it up at ordinary outfits, or teeming with guys who are going insane over what they can see but not touch, all of whom are terrified to speak out...

The rise of social media has lead to an unprecedented political divide. Commonly now you see posts of people cutting off their friends and family for their political views on both sides and generally just refusing to engage in anothers views even momentarily. Evidently, this isn't a good thing at all and yet basically every time the mention of politics and the idea that one side isn't inherently morally evil gets brought up you see a swarm of people that dig their head into the sand and say ""The republicans want me and those like me dead and buried"" or ""the damn liberals want my children castrated!"" and its appallingly sad to see. In my eyes the root cause is the fact that lets be real politicians kinda suck on both sides, so when somebody sees somebody say they're a democrat or a republican they automatically fill the gaps in knowledge of what that actually means in regard to that specific person with the malice of these old politicians. It feels like while republicans unironically regard their favorite politicians as saints that can do no wrong, people on the left do genuinely believe in the fallacy of ""the person you vote for/support represents your moral values"" so a conversation with them about politics ends up feeling like arguing over whos the better sports player out of kobe bryant and michael vick.

But nowadays its not exactly on the up and up to say something that implies ""I'm a slave to your every desire"" to a boss or business partner. So saying ""yours truly"" in a business email these days is just a completely empty platitude and sounds super bizarre if you take one second to think about its underlying meaning. Just go with ""best regards"" or ""thanks"" or something that doesn't make you sound like you're the biggest suck up in castle court."

841,2023-05-09,CMV: Open carrying a firearm in public is stupid in most cases.,u/thelink225,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13dbb3l/cmv_open_carrying_a_firearm_in_public_is_stupid/,changemyview,"Okay, let's get a few things out of the way first. I'm not a liberal. I'm very pro gun rights, with the only exceptions being that I think people should get proper training before they are able to carry in public, and I think that guns should be kept out of the hands of people with a demonstrable history of violence or a demonstrable inability to exercise agency over their person, including closing domestic violence loopholes. Other than that, I think people should be able to own almost whatever they want, and carry pretty much any semi-automatic weapon they want in public for self-defense purposes. On those points, you are not likely to change my view. I'm also not proposing that open carry be banned — only that it's stupid. And that is the point I'd like to see if you can change my view on.

My main reasons for thinking this are as follows:

Firstly, it telegraphs to potential attackers exactly what you have. In a fight for your life, information is crucial, and by open carrying a firearm you are telling those attackers not only that you have one, but what type you have, where it is, and if they are smart they can use that information to potentially neutralize you first, or otherwise account for you, before they begin whatever kind of attack they are intending to do. Conceal carry does not have this problem — if it is properly concealed, your attacker has no way of knowing what you have, where it is, or even if you have it. You become a wild card, and that will likely work in your favor.

Secondly, it makes you more vulnerable to getting disarmed by a potential attacker. Especially if you are carrying your weapon in a place that you can't always directly see. I've seen people carrying their firearms in holsters behind them — a sufficiently skilled attacker, even one that doesn't currently have a weapon, could potentially come and take that weapon out of the holster and use it against you if they are quick enough. I'm sure there are probably holsters designed to make this difficult — but, short of some biometric locking mechanism, I doubt there's anything out there that could prevent it entirely. I'm not an expert here, so I acknowledge the possibility that such a holster exists and I just haven't found it because I wouldn't even know what I'm looking for. But I would need to see proof that such a thing existed, and that it worked as advertised.

Thirdly, while there are people like me who are not bothered by the presence of a firearm in public, there are still plenty of people who are. It's liable to make some people uncomfortable, put them on edge, and that's likely to increase the probability of some kind of negative interaction. People are going to be more likely to look at you with suspicion and concern. It also reinforces negative stereotypes about firearm owners, and, as that negative outlook spreads throughout the population, that means people will be more likely to vote your gun rights away. It just adds tension to a situation where it doesn't need to be added, which doesn't benefit anyone, including the carrier, even if they think it does.

Lastly, and less pragmatically, there seems to be a common theme among most people I've seen who open carry. I'm all for carrying and self-defense, and I would do so myself if I had more firearms knowledge and enough money to buy one — but, for people who open carry, most I have encountered seem to be more about showing off and putting on an image than simply about self-defense. I'm sure that doesn't apply to everyone, but it seems to be a common theme. A lot of them seem to be deliberately trying to act macho — which, as far as I'm concerned, is stupid. One big reason why gun violence is so bad in the US is because of toxic gun culture, and how much people have their identity wrapped up in their firearms. A firearm is a tool, not an identity. Using it is something you do when you absolutely have to, to protect the life and well-being of yourself or another, not something that should be part of any culture.

The one counter argument I can think of to all of this is that, in some situations, it might be necessary to open carry to intimidate potential attackers. And I can think of a few situations where this might actually be the case — like with the Black Panthers, who opened carried when guarding neighborhoods, and were making a very legitimate statement in the process. There may be times and places for this, but I think this is very much the exception and not the rule. And usually, this is best done in groups, not by lone individuals. There might be a few niche situations where the benefit of the intimidation factor might be greater than the downsides for a lone individual — but a situation that severe would also probably warrant hypervigilance, which would be far from a normal everyday scenario. And if a situation is that bad, you probably shouldn't be going into it anyway unless you absolutely have to.

Now, I have a lot of friends who are gun people, but I'm not really a gun person myself. I'm very pro-gun rights, I'm familiar with the basics of gun safety, but I do not have a lot of intimate knowledge about firearms. There's definitely room for me to have missed something here, which is why I'm throwing it out here for scrutiny. Of course, I will also scrutinize your scrutiny to see if it holds up, but that should be expected.

***TL;DR —*** I think open carry of a firearm in public is usually stupid because 1) it gives potential attackers intel on your capabilities, 2) it gives potential attackers the possibility of accessing your firearm before you can, 3) it often raises public tension unnecessarily, and 4) too many people do it as a matter of status and identity, rather than utility, which contributes to toxic gun culture.

*Edit:* Wow, this certainly blew up while I slept. I've got a lot on my agenda for the day, but I will try to go back through this and read as many comments as I can when I get the chance, respond to the ones that warrant it the most. That might be a while, however."
0,2023-05-09,"CMV: From a purely legal view, overturning Roe v Wade was the correct decision",u/Allon-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13dc2yx/cmv_from_a_purely_legal_view_overturning_roe_v/,changemyview,"I really need some legal scholars here; just a heads up this is a *long* one.

I read through *Dobbs vs Jackson Women's Health Organization*, the Supreme Court's decision to overturn *Roe v Wade* and by extension *Planned Parenthood v Casey*, which reaffirmed *Roe* in 1992.

To start: I am not a legal expert by *any* means.  I also want to clearly define what I mean by ""a purely legal point of view"".  To me, the law is impartial, strict, and occasionally heartless.  It should be a logical process in which cases are examined and judged on whether they follow the guidelines society has chosen to run by; in this case, the Constitution and its amendments.  Personal morals and beliefs should never be in consideration when the law is involved, if possible.

For example, there was a case where a truck driver offered to help unload his truck when the receiving company was short staffed.  He was hurt, and sued the company to pay his medical bills, as the trucking company he worked for said he was not performing duties under his contract, and therefore was ineligible for their own insurance.  The jury determined since the driver volunteered to help, the receiving company was not responsible for his injuries either.  The guy was screwed.

I think most of us would agree that we feel terrible for the driver, and that from a moral and social viewpoint, the result is a tragedy.  I agree.  However, from a *legal* viewpoint, the law worked perfect in this case.  In a society of millions of people all interacting, we must have a legal system that remains constant in its application and is not susceptible to being altered by personal beliefs.

If we don't like the result, the law should be changed, but *not* by the court.  The court should not decide ""Well, in this case, I think we should do something different"".  Society should decide that the law needs to be different.  But the law should never be changed for specific judgements.  It may be heartless, but it provides a solid baseline for our legal system to stay consistent, and not up to the whims of judges.

Let's jump into the Supreme Court's repeal of *Roe*.

This is vastly oversimplified, but the majority's decision to overturn *Roe* was based on multiple points:

* There is no legal precedence; *stare decisis* is heavily influential in many rulings, and there are no prior rulings regarding abortion.
* For historical precedent, abortion has been illegal in many states, and there is very little history of it really being a huge thing--throughout history, more kids has always been better.  A significant chunk of the population not wanting kids is a recent development.  *Roe* was uncharted territory.
* *Roe* and *Casey* both had their detractors and criticisms even when they announced, and even some of the justices in favor of it had reservations-it has never been a solid, bedrock agreement.  *Casey*, reaffirming *Roe*, actually dropped all the original amendments used in *Roe* to argue for abortion except the 14th amendment.
* Both *Roe* and *Casey* agree that the state/society has a vested interest in a ""potential life"", and depending at the time of pregnancy, the mother does not have full decision in the matter.
* The court also made note that *Roe* and *Casey* both wanted the matter to be over.  As the abortion debate very much is not over, they argue the rulings have not solved the issue, and they are well within their rights to reexamine the decisions.
* There are virtually zero laws classifying how fetuses are regarded.  There is no codified way that we treat fetal life.
* *Roe* and *Casey* can read almost like legislative acts, setting out guidelines and rules about abortion that they did kind of make up on their own (basically viability outside of the mother was the cut off point).

With all the above, the Court ruled that it had vastly overstepped its powers by effectively creating legislation on how abortion is handled in the US.  They favored returning the power to the states and the people's elected representatives (they liked to phrase it as 'returning power to the people' a lot, ironically enough).

With all of the above, I... kind of have to agree that it was the correct decision to overturn *Roe v Wade*, from a purely legal point of view.  The Supreme Court is supposed judge cases that are brought before it to see if they fall in the confines of the law.

But there *are* no laws on abortion or fetal life on a national scale-it's a free for all between the states.  There is nothing in the Constitution or amendments on abortion besides the 14th Amendment (as declared by *Casey*), and the Due Process Clause prohibiting the deprivation of ""life, liberty, or property"" falls apart if you believe the fetus is fully human, because they deserve life and liberty too.  *Roe* and *Casey* compromised by using viability, and did in a sense say ""All right, here are the rules from now on"".

The Constitution declares that all other powers not listed as the federal government's are to be given to the states.  Regardless if you like this or not, this is how our legal system has operated.  And I do think our justices should be impartial arbitrators who make there decisions based upon the law, and the law alone.

I know the conservative justices didn't make this decision for those reasons.  I know they have a conservative agenda that they have finally been able to push through, and this also-fucking-lutely was because of their own moral beliefs and political ambitions.  But this makes them hypocritical assholes who I would love to see removed from power; it doesn't affect the validity their arguments.

After reading through the document, I can't find a reason to disagree with the court.  They thought a contentious issue that has virtually no prior cases or historical precedent should not be decided by the Supreme Court, but be left up to the states to decide.

I can't really find a legal reason to disagree with their reasoning that the Supreme Court should not be able to decisively decide the issue when there really isn't anything in the past for them to decide about.  This would be very different if we had ANY laws defining fetal life and their rights, but we don't.  How can the court make a decision about an issue that basically has no laws behind it?  They have to legislate to do so.

I wasn't impressed with the dissenting opinion.  Most of their counterarguments were that the wording the majority used would allow states to pretty much ban abortion if they wanted, and how it would negatively affect many woman's lives, and the huge clusterfuck on the horizon.  Basically everything that's happened since.

But those are moral and humanistic arguments, not legal ones.  I think the dissenting opinion is correct, but I can't see a good *legal* reason they are correct.

&#x200B;

So.  I read a document that obviously is going to show the opinion to overturn *Roe v Wade* in a positive light, and I have the barest knowledge of the law.  But I cannot find legal reasons to disagree with the majority, and the dissenting opinion didn't offer much more.

I said at the start that I firmly believe the law should be impartial, strict, and even occasionally heartless if it is to maintain standards that do not deviate over time.  I firmly believe our judicial system cannot bend for any other reasons than legal reasons if it is to endure--even if it gives results that we don't like.

I can think of tons of moral, rational, hell, even philosophical arguments on why *Roe v Wade* should not have been overturned, but am at a loss with legal ones.  Can anyone help me out?"

The debt is currently over $30 trillion, which equates to $90k per citizen and $250k per taxpayer (rounded). That's more than the average mortgage, and mortgages take 20-30 years to pay off. However, rather than slowly paying off the debt, the US continues to spend more than it gets from taxes. It's true that they have ridiculously low interest rates--far lower than inflation--but their debt is still increasing far faster than the inflation rates (2020-2023 was \~15% inflation, but debt ballooned from $26 trillion to $31 trillion).

This isn't even including all other forms of ""debt"" the US has: social security liabilities, medicare, and many others. It totals out to $187.4 trillion. Note that the *total assets in the US* (which includes corporations) is $187.6 trillion. You can find this information on [https://www.usdebtclock.org/](https://www.usdebtclock.org/). The US is practically insolvent.

Rather than trying to solve this issue, it seems like everyone's given up on ever paying off the debt. They'll just push it off for another few years, hopefully a few decades. But all the while 10% of the tax revenue goes to just paying the interest on the debt (note: that was 5% in 2000). Soon it'll grow to 20%. Then 50%. Or maybe before then the US will default/print a bunch of money and devalue the dollar. If they do nothing, they're screwing over everyone ten years from now."

To solve this, human cloning should be the go to answer. Take DNA from all citizens of a nation, living or dead and clone them to provide manpower and arrest a shrinking population. I don't care if there are issues relating to cloning people in terms of morality. The improvement to a shrinking population should be proof that human cloning can work for solving shrinking fertility.

There is no minimum qualification or education standard required to become a member of parliament. The idea being to minimise barriers so that MPs can come from a variety of backgrounds which sounds good in theory.

The issue is you often get so many MPs voting on decisions they do not understand on poorly informed or misunderstood information (see 30p Lee). I think it is reasonable for MPs to have to demonstrate a reasonable grasp on areas such as: being able to critically read and interpret statistics and laws, being able to show an understanding of the make up of their constituencies (demographics and socio-economics), know how things like the UK benefits and tax systems operate, know how much things cost.

In the UK, the way I would do this would be have an test set by an independent body (maybe the civil service college) which could perhaps contain questions about the UK, both national and perhaps also local issues. Parties should fund proposed candidates to take the test which would discourage them from putting forward non-credible candidates.

An MP’s job carries a great deal of responsibility, and anyone who is serious about doing a job should not object to putting in a relatively small amount of effort to prepare. If I wanted to be a lawyer or a civil servant or basically any other job I would expect a minimum level of qualification to be required.

Edit. Have changed my opinion somewhat thanks to multiple comments on the thread. I now don't think that a blanket test to pass is a good solution. However I do think that more information, ideally standardised on candidates should be publicly available and ideally this should include an indication of their ability to think critically and interpret information, so that constituents can make a more informed decision when voting.

I also think that the conflation of parties and local candidates is unhelpful as it stops people voting for the most competent candidates and instead basing votes on the party/party leaders, and solving this would go a long way towards getting competent MPs."

(1) We can date both men and women, 2x chance to get a partner. **DELTAED**: Less than double but still increased chance to find a partner. 

(2) In a homosexual-unfriendly environment i can pretend to be straight. In a too politically correct environment i can use our social capital of being part of the LGBTQ+ community or even pretend to be fully homosexual. 

(3) There are some LGBTQ+ communities that think ""bisexuals or breeders, they don't count"" but they're a tiny minority and politically incorrect. We are generally still accepted into the LGBTQ+ community although our ""identity politics buff"" does look a bit less powerful than other sexual minorities in the eyes of radicals and we are also discriminated by conservatives sometimes, overall we face more friendliness than hostility, and if we are in a hostile environment we can pretend to be either straight or homosexual. Anyway the pink capitalist megacorps are still gonna pretend to support bi as part of the LGBTQ+ community or they're asking for backlash. 

(4) Straight people usually don't discriminate against bisexuals. When I told many people I'm bi none of them appeared shocked, disgusted or whatever. But some conservatives are homophobic --- far fewer are biphobic.

I'm not looking to talk about the pros and cons of gun control, I'm just saying that the 2nd Amendment itself does not matter. 

Why do I say so?  Here's the entirety of document:  

>*A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.*

Pretty succinct, right?  And that's just the problem  The right of the people to keep and bear arms has been under infringement for about 150 years, at least.  There are so many arms which are not legal any where in the U.S.:  M1A Abrams Tanks, A-10 Warthogs, Howitzer cannons, any kind of fully automatic machine gun, the list goes on and on.  

So, that means that the whole amendment does not matter, right?  We've all agreed to ignore it since the advent of weapons that are a significant force multiplier.  And such weapons did not yet exit in the pre-industrial era when the Bill of Rights was written.  So, can we all just start from scratch with laws concerning firearms?

Before leaving, I understand that some people might say, ""But, there are restrictions on speech, so should we just forget about the 1st amendment?""

To that I would say, yes, but almost all speech is still legal in the United States.  In fact, it's probably is the best country at protecting speech in the world.  But almost all weapons and all of the most deadly weapons are illegal.  So the 2nd amendment is irrelevant.  Change my view."

But it seems like the left is moving *again* and given some of the recent proposals, I don't think I'm going to follow them this time. 

There are two recent proposals that stand out to me. The first is Oregon's ""right to rest"" act. It's one thing to say ""You're homeless, you can sleep wherever they want as long as it's public property."" It's another thing to say ""not only can you sleep wherever you want, if anybody tries to get you to move they have to give you $1,000."" That's what the right to rest act would do. It seems ripe for abuse. And if a law is passed that says homeless people are allowed to camp wherever, police aren't going to be able to do anything. Such an act would make it so homeless people are allowed to be as disruptive as they please and nobody can stop that disruption. Being familiar with Portland myself, that's the last thing the city needs. 

The second proposal is San Francisco's ""make every black person an overnight millionaire"" reparations proposal which has advanced in recent months. 

San Francisco doesn't have enough money to give every black person $5,000,000. And even if they did have that kind of money, why? Is anybody really going to argue that if slavery and segregation had never been a thing the majority of black people would be millionaires? Reparations are supposed to undo the effects of racism and discrimination. $5,000,000 is way overcorrecting, unless one believes some kind of reverse race ""realism"" that black people are biologically superior to white people. 

I believe when I last did a CMV about San Francisco's policy it had been proposed, but wasn't taken nearly as seriously as it is now. Now various committee members have expressed support for this idea. 

Yes, these are just two places, but they're big progressive strongholds. It's not like Winnikey, Georgia population 20 is proposing it. 

That's my view, but I'm open to changing it. But I do want to note a couple of things. First, I will respond regularly but I'm not going to try to respond to everyone instantly. It's exhausting and I think the discussions are often less productive when I do. Secondly, I'm not going to respond to the character assassination comments. I used to, but I don't think there's a point. And having looked at the sub rules, I don't think either of these ground rules is violating sub rules. So hopefully this stays up and some good discussions can come out of it!"

Charisma is one of, if not the most, valuable asset a presidential hopeful can have. In the Kennedy Nixon debates, many radio listeners thought Nixon won, but because of the advent of televised debates Kennedy's charisma shown through and Nixon appeared to be sweaty and fluster in comparison. Arguably the most charismatic candidate of the Republican or Democratic party running for president won every election since televised debates started.

Ronald Reagan is another former actor and governor of California. If the term limit amendment didn't happen he probably could have served many more terms. Incumbency is a major advantage for Presidents seeking reelection.

If Schwarzenegger and Trump were opponents in this Republican primary or the last, I bet he would have won. Trump relied on ad hominem attacks, often belittling the manhood of other candidates e.g. ""little Marco"" and calling Ted Cruz's wife ugly. There would still be those who thought Trump was the manliest, but I bet more would see past his false bravado.

Here's a good article showing how the US is an outlier among the G7 for requiring natural born citizens. https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2022/03/10/the-millions-of-americans-who-are-ineligible-be-president-are-excluded-from-an-important-part-of-the-american-dream/

Interestingly, virtually all of the western hemisphere has birthright citizenship citizenship, while most other countries have no or restricted birthright citizenship. This may be in part due to American influence. The 14th amendment to the US Constitution overturned the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision that denied American born black people citizenship. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli

One could argue there should be less or even no years of citizenship required to run for President, or that the founders were completely right in their decision to protect the country from undue foreign influence."

You’re not being ripped off you came to see a performance and that’s what the person is doing, performing. A lot of times lyrics just sound better after being worked in a studio and you still have a band playing in a lot of cases. Performers sometimes just don’t have the voice to sing live and aslong as they are out there putting on a show I don’t see the problem. 

Outside of concerts you have Milli Vanilli. The guys making the music were good at what they do they just didn’t have the looks to make it, which helps a lot im sure. Then you have two guys that have the looks but can’t sing (actually they could but I’m just making a point) so what do you do? To me if both parties consent you put the two together. One party of talented singers and the other party of talented looking good while pretending to sing. They lost an Emmy when it came out they lip synced and their careers were never the same. 

Of course I don’t think they should just sit on stage and mouth the words but do what they usually do, move around and really perform, you know how they move during a song and a certain line be like bent over then rising on a long drawn out note. 

It’s entertaining and everyone has a good time being there then what’s the harm? Also god help you if you go to a rap concert to see someone that is half-assing it"

339,2023-05-10,CMV: SpongeBob season 4 is not a classic quality season and is overrated.,u/RefrigeratorNo4700,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13e4xto/cmv_spongebob_season_4_is_not_a_classic_quality/,changemyview,"SpongeBobs classic era was from seasons 1 to 3. Season 4 brought a drastic change in tone, characters and direction that makes it difficult to consider a classic quality season. I have seen a number of people say season 4 is as good as the classic era, but this is not true.

Let’s consider some aspects of season 4 compared to the classic era.

Classic SpongeBob was able to make the mundane interesting and had a much more grounded approach. Look through some of the plots of classic SpongeBob and you will notice how many involve very grounded premises. SpongeBob plays with a box, SpongeBob has a snowball fight, SpongeBob goes camping, etc. While there were occasional fantastical concepts, a majority of classic SpongeBob stuck to grounded premises because the characters were strong enough to carry an episode.

Compare that to season 4, which was far more reliant on using fantastical elements to carry an episode. Fear of a krabby patty for example, is a much more fantastical version of graveyard shift.  The latter involves SpongeBob and squidward working the nightshift while the former involves SpongeBob going insane. 

This can also be seen with the change to Sandy’s character. Season 4 is far more reliant on Sandy being a scientist to introduce more fantastical elements in the show, where in classic SpongeBob, it really only comes up once, and the science in that episode is more realistic.

This isn’t to say that having fantastical elements is inherently problematic, rather, the issue is that the writers use it as a crux to carry episodes because the character writing is worse.

SpongeBob in the classic era was a 3 dimensional character and had a large range of emotions. He was childlike and naive, but at the same time it is pretty clear he is a functional adult. In season 4, the writers made SpongeBob far more childish. A similar issue applies to Patrick as well, they amplified his stupidity and ignored what made him likable. These factors are why season 4 was the first to have episodes as bad as Good Neighbors, where SpongeBob and Patrick are completely oblivious to Squidwards frustration. 

Older episodes would have either made squidward do something to deserve the torment or make him secretly interested in SpongeBob and Patrick. Compare good neighbors to snowball effect. SpongeBob annoys squidward accidentally in much more believable  and far less obnoxious ways and makes squidward interested in their shenanigans.

I could go on, but season 4 is ultimately a bad SpongeBob season when compared to the classic era. It’s a passable childrens cartoon, but that is a huge downgrade compared to being a classic."

The changes of that number being lowered are extremely slim. It was 18, 19 or 20 depending on the state until the 1980s when the drinking age uniformly became 21. Anyways, cutting to the chase.

In many popular nightclubs, there are popular artists performing. Most of these nightclubs are centered around hip-hop music or EDM music. Here in Portland, we have one popular nightclub that is centered around indie music and attracts a large hipster crowd. Most of the time, everyone needs to be 21 and up to enter since that's the legal drinking age. However for some shows, the minimum age is 18. Especially if the show is happening on a weekday.

It makes sense that way since nightclubs can still make lots more profit. The college crowd which consists of older teens often have Fridays off so they can party on Thursday nights. Meanwhile most adults after college have to work on Fridays so Thursdays would be inconvenient for them.To ""filter"" out the 18-20 year olds when it comes to alcohol purchases, there should be bouncers who can carefully read the ID cards and give some fluorescent stamp to those 21 and above. When buying drinks, the bartenders have some special flashlight that can show these special stamps clubgoers have on them. That way clubgoers under 21 will not be able to purchase alcohol while those 21 and up can.

Most people who are into clubbing and bar hopping are younger people. There are numerous instances of college students having fake IDs and going to bars when they are still teenagers. However unlike bars, the point of nightclubs is to get people dancing and the energy moving. Not drinking alcohol and getting buzzed and drunk. In many cities with a large party and touristy environment like Miami, NYC, Las Vegas and Honolulu, it would make perfect sense to have the age restriction lowered to 18 in most nightclubs and bars (that serve many things other than alcohol).

If the drone strike was a legit attempt to attack the Kremlin, than that means that Russia will retaliate hard and are now primed to do so. Against either Ukraine, or the USA who supports Ukraine by sending them weapons.

Or it was a false flag, which Russia is going to use as an excuse for further retaliation. Which also means it is inevitable. Because if the Russian state has already gone through the effort to do this operation (and make it's own military defense systems look very incompetent in doing so), it means that Russia is committed to a drastic - ie. nuclear - response in Ukraine. 

Simply put, if Russia has the motive to fake this attack on their own government, it means they are primed to want to use these more drastic measures. 

The only other option is someone other than Ukraine or the US is behind this, which I frankly don't see given the US and Ukraine are Russia's major global competitors.

So Russia is primed to want to nuke Ukraine now. And if they do that who the fuck knows how the USA is going to respond.

Why Russia would want to do something so insane is beyond me, and why anyone in the US or Ukraine would want to provoke Russia in such a way is also beyond me. No one could have possibly thought that launching a drone attack on Russia would do anything but further commit them to their current invasion.

Maybe all our leaders are just fucking madmen, I don't know. But given it just seems like Ukraine is about to get nuked, which might very well prompt a nuclear response from the USA and it's allies, so we will likely be at full scale war with Russia soon."

Yet personally I've only ever had good things to say about it. I always pay the full statement on time. I also make sure never to spend more then I'm willing to pay, while its technically not my money, I do owe back on it at the end of the statement and know better then to go over 25 percent the best I can. I also noticed people will go crazy and max out their cards thinking it wont hurt them in the long run then they turn around and wonder why they are piled on with debt and then blame the system itself, rather then taking the time to understand the basics of what credit is. 

I do acknowledge its not a completely flawless system. I can understand there are predatory practices with Credit Card companies out there. But overall its been nothing but good for me since it gives me not only a high credit score but also hundreds of dollars in rewards spending every year.

Edit: Forgot to mention something. It also allows an extra layer of security. If your credit card information gets stolen and used, the credit card companies will take care of it for you since its THEIR money. Where as if it was your debit card..well good luck lol.


Edit 2: I noticed people keep bringing up ""Credit card fees"" that merchants have to account for. But isnt that the simple cost of doing business? Even Debit has fees (Though not as much obviously.) I feel like the ""fee"" issue is a completely different topic though since there are many ""fees"" out there that really shouldnt be fees but merchants get away with it anyways like ""Convenience fees"" or ""service fees"" that are randomly tacked on for online purchases.

Edit 3: Lots of great discussion! I believe the post is starting to wind down now though. It was nice seeing a lot of well informed people talk about this subject as well. My mind has not changed but it was good to see what others felt on the topic of Credit as a whole."

201,2023-05-11,CMV: Trans women feel entitled to redefine womanhood due to misogyny they never unlearned.,u/Grand-Management-720,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13f4id5/cmv_trans_women_feel_entitled_to_redefine/,changemyview,"I have been noticing a trend recently , mostly online, of a loud minority of trans women stepping on toes when it comes to integrating with cis or afab women. Some examples of this include:

-Insisting that trans women have periods, and calling anyone who points out that this is impossible ""transphobic"". 

- Insisting that afab women be referred to and labeled as 'ciswomen', and calling them transphobic for not wanting this label. While insisting that trans women just be referred to as 'women'. 

-Referring to mothers as ""birthing persons"" and breast feeding as ""chestfeeding"" to be ""inclusive"". 

- Insisting that the idea of binary sex is a myth. 

These are just some examples. It seems to me that some trans women feel the need to redefine womanhood to validate themselves. The most telling thing is that we do not see trans men doing this. They have not seemed to feel any need to go in an redefine manhood to fit their experience. Yet some transwomen seem to feel that in order for them to feel valid in their identity they need to bully others into conforming to their needs. This to me feels clearly indicative that certain traits remain with people even after they transition. 

So while I believe that trans women are women and deserved to be welcomed with open arms I do beleive that these ones who are pushing for these things have begun to overstep their bounds. And I think this comes from misogyny. Many trans women grew up and were socialized as boys or men, with this comes a sense of entitlement to women. I think that some trans women have transitioned and failed to leave their misogyny behind, this has left them feeling entitled to women's spaces, issues, problems, and womanhood as a whole. They feel it is thier right to come in and redefine them to fit their emotional needs. And they become bullies when they are told they can't do that. 

I realize that some people may feel this makes me Transphobic or a TERF. But this seems to be glaringly obvious to me and I'm wondering if there something I'm missing or not considering. I do not want to be transphobic, I do want to be a good ally. But not at the expense of women."

0,2023-05-11,CMV: Hitler was incompetent at everything and there was no way he should've led the Nazis,u/Novalith_Nirvana,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13f8vnh/cmv_hitler_was_incompetent_at_everything_and/,changemyview,"When judging historical characters, it is important not to look down at them because you miss out a lot of context if you dismiss them because you don’t agree with them. A classic example is that many people judge people from the past using the moral standards of today and claim they are bad people.

However, the more and more I read about Adolf Hitler and Nazism, the more disgusted I am with him and the more I start to believe he might actually just not have a brain. I have looked at Hitler from 2 perspectives, his ambition to win World War 2 and his ambition to fulfill Nazi ideology.

Straight off the bat, Nazism is already an incredibly flawed ideology that relies on false racial science to work and dismisses real science when it is inconvenient. It isn’t even the best way to make the German people the superior race. But let’s pretend we buy it as much as Hitler does. The goal is to kill all the Jews, enslave all the eastern peoples, create lebensraum and make the Germanic ethnicity the world’s most dominant ethnicity.

Well, why then would Hitler not create any laws, institutions or systems to help Germany actually survive when it isn’t at war. Germany’s war economy needs to plunder and loot from conquered territories and eventually, they will run out of people to plunder. Germany has to quit while they are ahead unless they wanna invade Britain, America and China.

Hitler’s plan for Operation Barbarossa was to advance up to the Archangelsk - Volga line and then build a barrier to keep out the Asiatic hordes and he believed that the USSR could be defeated easily and within a couple months at most. He made these plans in January of 1941 and the invasion was set for May 1941. Hitler should’ve been thinking NOW about laws and institutions to keep the German economy up to the task of remaking Europe the way he wanted it. Economic reforms and new institutions should have been made so that Germany just straight up doesn’t collapse under the strain of occupying the entire USSR, but he just doesn’t address that at all. His only laws are about oppressing and killing those he occupies now and no concern about the future.

If I were a Nazi and I were serious about fulfilling the ideological goals of Nazism, I would call Hitler out for being an absolute moron who isn’t fit to be leading the 3rd Reich.

As for winning the 2nd World War, Hitler had made great strategic victories only to completely undo them with stupid decisions (Battle of Britain and Operation Barbarossa threw away incredible strategic advantages Nazi Germany enjoyed). I especially have a problem with Operation Barbarossa because Hitler hadn’t wrapped up his war with Britain and decided to open up another front and make his biggest trading partner into his biggest enemy, which is a massive self inflicted strategic defeat unless he were to beat the USSR in the timeframe he thought he was going to beat them in.

He then, as he was losing the war, dedicated more of Germany’s few resources to killing the inferior minorities and doom the German people so that the enemies of the Reich would “Inherit a graveyard”. This guy had no interest in winning WW2 judging by that statement. He hurts the German people to comparable levels to how much he hurt those he oppressed.

There is an elephant in the room I haven’t addressed, the Holocaust. If he wanted to fulfill his Nazi ideology, he was gonna have to win WW2 and if he wanted to win WW2, he needed the Jews. He needed their science so he could create atomic bombs and he needed their manpower because he was gonna take on the USSR. Then once he won, he could do whatever he wanted to them.

Well, he was so short sighted that he wanted to kill them NOW and reject nuclear science because it is Jewish and waste resources killing his hated enemy when he could've exploited them.

Nobody doubts that Hitler was a bad man but I don't think that Hitler was a good Nazi or an effective ruler. I can't find one good thing about him. Look at all the other evil men of history, Genghis Khan was an effective tactician, leader and state builder. Hitler was none of those. Stalin was at least somewhat competent at fulfilling communist ideology and he had the geopolitical foresight to leave the USSR a better place than when he found it. I cannot say the same about Hitler. How did this clown end up in charge of the 3rd Reich?"

There is not now and has never been, an industry definition of assault weapon, unlike assault rifles.

No politically based definition definition of assault weapon has consistently referred to the same set of guns.

Every ""AWB"" lists different guns and features to the extent that I have no functional idea, which guns you intend to be included.

Actual Assault Rifles have a very clear industry definition, have been regulated for decades, and are very rarely used to commit crimes.

To that extent, I'd be willing to give an award, if not a delta to a person that pointed towards an actual ~~industry~~ defined use of assault weapons.

Edit: The ""industry"" defined was actually unintentional and just me being sloppy sorry. 

I still don't think there's a consistently defined political definition but now totally grant there is an native public understanding that is vague but roughly equates to Semi-auto rifles with big mags, or something similar to ""military style"" weapons. 

There is nothing wrong with this native usage or understanding of the term.

My problem here is more how that public understanding of the term matches its political usage, but that's conversation for another day.

I feel like the education system is cruel to both those who don't plan to go to college by making them suffer by wasting their time, and also cruel to those who do plan to go to college by making them suffer alongside the ones who don't plan to who interrupt class and bring everybody down.

It's like asking two groups of people to build a house together. One knows they will probably get paid reasonably well a few years after the house is built, and the other knows they will probably never get paid for it. Of course the second group is going to mess around. Of course they are going to be unhappy. Of course they are going to bring the first group down."

When everyone is dressed in the same attire, it eliminates any competition or judgement based on clothing choices. This can lead to a more inclusive and positive school environment.

Additionally, school uniforms can help to reduce bullying and discrimination. When everyone is wearing the same clothes, there is less opportunity for students to make fun of others who may not have the latest fashion trends or expensive clothing brands.

Furthermore, school uniforms can help to increase academic performance. Without the pressure of trying to keep up with fashion trends, students can focus more on their studies and less on their appearance. This can lead to better grades and overall success in school.

Edit: apparently this isn't true.

Overall, while some may argue that school uniforms limit individual expression, I believe that the benefits they provide in terms of promoting unity, reducing bullying, and improving academic performance make them a worthwhile investment. It's school, not a fashion show.

In companies that have a longer remote work tradition, such as Oracle, HP, IBM and Microsoft, you had much better apps for staying in touch: XMPP chat, forums, knowledge bases, project trackers, etc.    
The cool capabilities of XMPP clients are similar to MSN/ICQ chat clients of the past, where you had a list of people, it would tell you who is online who isn't, and you can group these users into friends, family, work, etc.    
At work this allowed you to have a group of managers, peers, live ops/noc, my directs, dev PoCs, etc.  So when you need to reach out to someone in noc, you open that group, see who is online and chat to them directly.    
In Slack you can't do this, so you have to go to a channel, put ""@here"" and hope for the best, but you don't have visibility of who is around.  
Also, these channels usually have very valuable content that gets lost and is very hard to search, resulting in a lot of knowledge remaining tribal and lost to newcomers.    


As an office companion, Slack was super good, but with most of a company going remote, many companies like [chess.com](https://chess.com) are 100% rely ing on Slack for pretty much al coordination."

0,2023-05-12,CMV: The news about a Canadian Member of Parliament or his relatives being threatened has no evidence and might be blown out of proportion,u/bro_please,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13fmjq8/cmv_the_news_about_a_canadian_member_of/,changemyview,"Before reading, please note that I do condemn China's very real pressure on members of the Chinese diaspora, and I do not wish to condone its behavior. I am not even arguing that it would be surprising that China did pressure Michael Chong or his relatives. I am merely saying I haven't seen evidence for it.

Context: Michael Chong was sanctioned in 2021 by China after a vote on Canada recognizing the genocide of the Uyghurs. Two weeks ago, a Globe & Mail stirred uproar leaking a CSIS report with plenty of damning information about Chinese covert activity in Canada. A small portion covers Michael Chong's situation. The G&M article wrote on the topic:

>The spy agency said an MSS officer sought information on an unnamed Canadian MP’s relatives “who may be located in the PRC, for further potential sanctions.” This effort, the CSIS report said, “is almost certainly meant to make an example of this MP and deter others from taking anti-PRC positions.”A national-security source, whom The Globe is not naming because they risk prosecution under the Security of Information Act, said the MP targeted was Conservative MP Michael Chong, and that Zhao Wei, a Chinese diplomat in Canada, was working on this matter.Mr. Chong, reached by The Globe Friday, said he had no knowledge of this. He said he has relatives in Hong Kong. He was hit with sanctions by China in March, 2021, after sponsoring the parliamentary motion on genocide and has been careful not to contact his relatives since.Mr. Zhao is listed in the Department of Global Affairs’ record of foreign diplomats as working in China’s Toronto consulate. In February, The Globe reported that a national-security source described Mr. Zhao as a “suspected intelligence actor.”

Later, Chong met with officials and the PM, and described it as such to the Globe & Mail:

>Mr. Trudeau told the Commons Tuesday that he made contact with Mr. Chong and “ensured that he got a briefing from our top security officials.”Mr. Chong said Mr. Vigneault informed him he was authorized to read to him from the CSIS report quoted by The Globe “because it **relates to** a threat to you and your family.” (Emphasis mine).

Now, both politicians and the media state as fact that the MP and his family were ""threatened"", or ""harassed"". This is not what is written in the leaked report, and it seems like a stretch to conclude there were threats. We have seen no evidence of this at all, and the specifics are never discussed. The narrative has gone undisputed, but I believe it's because nobody has an interest in disputing it: Chong and his party are obviously interested in being portrayed as martyrs; the opposition wants to hammer the government; the Liberals - and nobody else really - don't want to be seen defending China; and generally we can all agree that China has a scummy behavior especially with its diaspora, so might as well turn the heat on; and the evidence seems shrouded by secrecy.

Is that all we have to go on? The story just seems so... weak. Not saying there is no truth to it, just saying we have no evidence to believe it. I genuinely want to be convinced, because I would love to join the mainstream view."
76,2023-05-12,CMV: The word “Abuse” is wildly abused.,u/Plazmik87,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13fn70d/cmv_the_word_abuse_is_wildly_abused/,changemyview,"I want to preface this opinion by stating clearly, I am not condoning or supporting any form of abuse. Be it drugs, sexual assault, violence, or verbal harassment; abuse of power, or station, or trust… All people deserve a basic level of respect and consideration, and this opinion, strictly surrounds the usage of the word itself, and is in no way intended to demeaning or downplay, actual cases of abuse. 

The word “abuse“ and all of its tenses, derivatives, and past participles has a fairly loose definition in the dictionary, and it is far and away, used much too frequently in common language. In my personal experience, there is almost no individual that I am aware of apart from infants and children that can’t claim they have been the victim of abuse in the past. It is a very relative term, based on one’s personal experience in life, and thereby totally subjective.

Even just investigating the definition online yields numerous and varied applications. It is applied liberally in legal documents, and to describe a great deal of criminal activities, however, there is a very large gray area surrounding what constitutes specific abuse, which is where we find ourselves with so many semantic loopholes in our law making, as additional specific wording is always necessary.

In every day vernacular it most commonly gets used to describe almost any situation where someone feels they weren’t treated the way they felt they should have been. I don’t mean to paint every and all claim(s) of abuse as being false, because I am certain a majority of them are serious, actual claims, and the victims of abuse are certainly just that, victims.

However, it is much too powerful of a word, especially considering it’s legal connotations, to be used as it is to describe ANY perceived slight against one person by another.

The greatest offenders are those who use it to exaggerate for dramatic effect, and to claim a sense of victimhood. In my experience it very much seems like the people who throw it around the most casually are often times the same people who are least familiar with actual abusive situations.

An anecdotal example; a woman I was recently becoming acquainted with claimed herself to be an heiress and socialite, and that her parents fully fund her lifestyle so she has never had any cause to seek any sort of meaningful employment. She further detailed several of her past romantic relationships, describing all of her male partners as being well to do, and also fully capable of supporting her in whatever ventures might catch her fancy.

Through the course of further conversation she revealed she ran away and abandoned her family, and moved halfway across the country on a lark. She broke off engagements with all of the men that she described, and in every case cited abuse as her reasoning for getting away from the people. It should also be known that after a couple of weeks of floundering, she reached out to her family, who immediately resumed supporting her in every way, without even pressing her to move back.

When I pressed her on the subject, there was nothing she described in any of the situations that to me that amounted to anything more than simply disagreeing with her on some viewpoint or another. In the case of her family, it was simply rebellion. They didn’t like the boy she was seeing. With the ex fiancés, one wanted her to find a safer part of town to frequent when she would go clubbing (this seemed to be a nightly activity for her at the time) and another didn’t care for the house she wanted him to buy so she ended it.

All of them were controlling and abusive in her mind. From another perspective, though, she is very sheltered and protected and has seen little to no “abuse” in her lifetime. Either way, the implications of labeling all of these people in her life as “abusers” and making them sound monstrous at first is not a thing she had ever really considered.

Many many words are often misused in order to make things sound more exciting, or appealing. Words like “terrified“ or “hilarious“ get thrown around to describe completely mundane events all the time.

*I don’t see the word “abuse“ disappearing from modern dialogue anytime soon, but for legal purposes, there should be some mechanism to provide clearer distinction, similar to how we have first or second-degree murder or manslaughter. Not having more clearly understood meanings and applications of it in the legal arena seems (to me at least) to be the indirect cause to a majority of “unjust“ judicial rulings. By and large we seem to only define abuse by its varying types, rather than degree or severity of it being perpetrated. Smacking someone on the butt should not be met with the same punishment as forcibly groping a person’s genitals. Failing to have clear distinctions between the two actions while labeling both as sexual abuse opens the door wide open for victim blaming on one end of the issue, or pleading out for minimum sentencing in the other, and neither result is desirable.*

Adding an edit: A lot of this was voice to text while driving, which did me dirty on a lot of punctuation, and I have no idea why my line breaks all disappeared. I will clean it up later when I am not at work.

Also, first time poster on here so I have to figure out the whole Delta thing. Glad to be getting a conversation started though.

Second Edit: Cleanup time! Fixed some bad dictation and got rid of a lot of extra commas. Also want to add further clarification, and explain my changed view, the italicized bit.

I stand corrected as far as legal aspects go. As charges of abuse are commonly (always?) partnered with clarifying language, I realize that isn’t really the focus of my point. I didn’t make my point very well in the first place. 

I am still of the mind that the word should be used more responsibly in general conversation, and more so in media and social-political conversations. What I am advocating is calling people out on using it incorrectly, and moreover encouraging the use of more accurate or appropriate language when someone is using it for dramatic effect or to garner sympathy."

Even with identical CVs, whites and asians are more likely to be hired than other races, and men are more likely to be hired than women. With this demonstrable downside, and no clear upside to having names on CVs, I think names should be removed from CVs. 

To be clear, I'm not suggesting that individuals should opt not to put their name on their CV, obviously this would get you nowhere, I'm suggesting that it should be standard practice when hiring that names are omitted from CVs. This could be done by having applicants submit their CV with no name, or by having the name removed before the CV reaches whoever is in charge of hiring.

My view could be changed by someone pointing out a significant upside to having names on CVs that can't practically be achieved by other means.

1007,2023-05-13,CMV: Managers should be the one to find covers for shifts,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13gf1lg/cmv_managers_should_be_the_one_to_find_covers_for/,changemyview,"In many jobs (multiple ones I've worked anyway), it's the responsibility of the employee to find someone to cover their shift if they can't make it. In other ones, the manager will do it. My view is currently that the manager should be the one to do it by default. 

Reasons: 

-The manager, having gone through the hiring process, knows more about each of the employees, and would be better at selecting the right fit, making the process more efficient

-The manager comes from a position of higher authority and so employees are more likely to say yes, making the process more efficient

-Keeping it consistent where the shift cover requests come from limits the bias of workers based on popularity. There is no reason that a more popular worker should deserve time off for an unexpected occurrence any more than an unpopular worker. This increases fairness. 

-The manager typically gets paid a higher salary to make sure the overall shift runs smoothly and handle any problems that come up. Usually, the manager is in charge of scheduling. So this is their job. 

-The manager has the option to make calls like ""maybe the shift can run with 1 less worker for today if I'm there on standby"", which the employee that needs to leave does not have. This increases flexibility. 

-An employee who has something come up on short notice is already dealing with an unexpected issue, and to require additional work of them at this time just increases their burden. 

-An employee is getting paid to work the shift. If they cannot make the shift, they do not get paid. If they are not getting paid, they should not be subject to doing the additional work of finding a replacement. Finding a replacement is work, and work should be paid. 

Obviously, if a worker elects to find the cover themselves because they have a good relationship with their coworkers, that's not a problem. Not saying people can't volunteer for additional duties. But it shouldn't be the expected norm."

In a lot of ways, these make it into a gig job and lower the quality of the product. But fundamentally, I feel if the producer finds a minimal quality product acceptable, they should be able to get it. They are paying for it.

One of the complaints was they were asked to break a season of a show in a weekend saying that is normally weeks of work and there should be minimum duration. But as long as they were compensated for weeks of work and didnt have strenuous hours, the producer should be allowed to get that quality of work.

Writers should get what they want on pay, and get a day-to-day working experience that is healthy. But they shouldn't be concerning themselves with quality."

The universe is possibly infinite and it's probably bustling with life (I think it makes sense), your chances of reincarnating on Earth as a human again are probably slim. 

Deep down, we all just our consciousness, the consciousness adapts to your own life but some brain traumas can revert you to that default consciousness in an instant.

After you die, you wont exactly reincarnate per se as your consciousness won't magically transfer to another living being.

You may be reborn as a human, car, rat or even some being you cant even imagine, living across the universe. Any downtime without consciousness, you simply wont feel, because nothing can feel it.

I don't believe in heaven or hell. Where are they? How do they work? If heaven is supposed to be a place without suffering, wouldn't the idea that you died and left your loved ones deeply depress you? I think its paradoxical. Heaven and Hell are places all over the Universe, they are a state of mind.

2,2023-05-13,CMV: The most vile murderers should not be released simply because it is guaranteed that they would never harm anyone again.,u/DexQ,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13gkguf/cmv_the_most_vile_murderers_should_not_be/,changemyview,"I make this post because I have a different view from the popular comments in a recent post: [Would you allow the most vile murderers out of prison if it was guaranteed that they would never harm anyone again?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/13fceqn/would_you_allow_the_most_vile_murderers_out_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). First I will clarify my interpretation of the topic question. Then I am going to summarize the most popular opinions in the original post. After that I will explain my view them.

# Interpretation

The key word that needs qualification is ""guaranteed"". In particular, what kind of guarantee do we have? Is it a report from a well-established psychological evaluation? A replacement of personality (like brainwashing)? A reliable prediction made by some program? Some chips installed in the brain to monitor and intervene with the behavior? Or just perfect surveillance? I believe different guarantees yield different kinds of answers. But since the original OP didn't make clear of its meaning, I would take the interpretation that makes least assumptions. That is, we somehow just know with absolute confidence that the murderer won't do harm again. If it helps, you might think it as a prediction given by a perfectly reliable AI. We don't know how the AI arrive at its answer, but this AI has made millions of predictions and all of them turned out to be true.

Also, I won't take the question to be asking whether we should *ever* release the murderer, but whether we should release the murderer *as soon as* there is such a guarantee. Though I believe some points can still carry over to the other interpretation.

# Popular opinions

The most popular opinion was that the point of imprisonment is and sentencing isn't punishment, but rehabilitation. Even the most vile murderers should be set free once they are reformed, because there is no more need to protect citizens from a reformed person, and it is more beneficial to the society if we allow rehabilitated people to return to the society and be productive, than to pay tax to keep them in jail.

Another related and very popular CMV post also brought up a similar view, that no one should be punished for the sake of punishment, and if any punishment is ever justified, it is only because of its utility to the greater good (mainly from deterrence). Since modern research suggests that heavier punishments do not deter crimes better, punishment have little place in modern justice system.

It is also pointed out that the society is also partly responsible for the crime, because in many cases it is the unjust social conditions that give rise to criminals. Hence what we should do is to improve the social condition and transform the criminals into a well functioning citizen. Once the criminal is transformed, they should be allowed to be given a second chance for it is unfair to put all the blames on them when the society is also responsible.

# My view

First, I think these popular opinions ignore accountability of being a moral agent and fellow citizen. To be accountable is to face the consequence of an action. This starts with trying to repair the damage and followed by earning forgiveness. When you make a mess in another's place, you can't get away simply by guaranteeing that you will never do it again. You have to help cleaning up and convince them you are sorry.

What can we do to make up for a murder and to ask for forgiveness? To the victims, we *can't*. That's the point, and that's why some acts are unforgivable. What about to the families? This is a difficult question. But the emotional suffering is the most direct and significant harm, thus the murderer is responsible for the pain they suffer. So even if punishment can relieve just a bit of the suffering, or to put it differently, if absence of punishment exacerbates the suffering and induces a sense of injustice, then there should be some form of punishment up to a limit. So while I agree that no one should be punished for the sake of punishment and suffering alone, a proportionate punishment is justified for bringing a *sense of justice*, and is a mean to relieve suffering (if it works).

The murderers should also be responsible to communicate with the victim's family (if the family agrees) to help both parties to come to an understanding and possibly *closure and forgiveness*. And the degree of success and the amount of efforts should be considered in deciding whether we should set the murderer free.

This brings to my next point. I think we can't just focus on the consequence from the murderer's side, i.e. whether the murderer will refrain from recommitting crimes and whether they will be a contributing citizen to the society. Moral acts are *not fungible*, you cannot trade good moral deeds, let alone economic profits, for immoral deeds. Moreover, moral acts like murder are *personal*, and the concern of greater good should not automatically override justified demands by and compensation to the victims. As fellow citizens, we expect each others to respect our basic rights. And when someone infringes our rights, we expect the perpetrators themselves to be held accountable. Allowing murderer to be off from prison just because of the guarantee and greater good is like absolving all accountability from a defaulter just because of the guarantee and the economic benefits they will contribute to the market, without compensating the victim.

Personally, I am against thinking only in utilitarian terms. But even if we are to consider the utility only, it is a mistake to only consider what the criminal (and other future potential criminals) will do. But we should also consider what the innocent and victims will do. Luckily I've never lost any loved ones from murder, but I think I would be enraged if I learn that the murderer walks freely simply because they won't murder again. Seeing other less popular but many comments, I expect not few people would share a similar feeling, and there is a chance some would even go for revenge. What's more, knowing that society won't care about you if you ever get murdered one day promotes a sense of insecurity among law-abiding citizens. That's why the sense of security and the danger of mob justice should be in the calculus of utility.

That being said, I don't think murderers should always be punished and imprisoned indefinitely. One reason is that I agree with the popular view that the society is at least partly responsible for the crime. In many cases, it was unjust social conditions that breed troubled people who end up committing crimes. In other cases, unfortunate and compelling situations push people into making wrong decisions. However, I reckon this view actually works against the popular conclusion. Because it implies that besides the issue of recidivism, what's more important is the nature of the crime, which takes into account the manner of killing, the motivation, the personal history, and the context under which the murder is committed.

In short, I think we should not release murderers (not to mention the most vile ones) if it is guaranteed that they would never harm anyone again. For there are other *more important* factors: namely (1) whether it disrupts closure and sense of justice to the victims, (2) the nature of the crime, and (3) whether the murderer fully understand the moral significance, feel remorseful, has made an effort in reaching a mutual understanding with, and compensating the victims."

But I have been researching the history of Israel as we know it today and to be fully honest, yes the Holocaust was absolutely terrible in all respects. But I don't think it was necessarily correct to immediately carve out a piece of already settled and lived on land to give to another demographic which it seems is what America and Britain collaborated to do for Jewish individuals by giving them a portion of Palestine based on religious texts written hundreds of years ago by people none of us ever saw or met.

 By that logic, shouldn't we give Mexico's land back to Mexico since we can also confirm their ancestral ties to many of the states they are killing themselves at the border a lot of times trying to get into? I mean, America literally baited them into a war to steal like half their land. Or at least be a little more understanding of people at the border. Cali and Texas were not originally American possessions. I just think by the logic of creating and restoring Israel for Jewish people we should hand over all lands to their indigenous people right?

I guess what I am trying to ask is what makes the Jewish claim to Israel any more relevant than any other race or ethnic group's claim to a certain land mass? Was it the fact the Holocaust happened? Because I feel like in that case, perhaps the forty acres black people were promised after slavery should have been distributed. Perhaps we should give Hawaii back to actual indigenous Hawaiian people.

If my point of view seems ignorant, just educate me then, don't belittle me or what I'm saying lmao. Because this not some underhanded slight at Jewish folks. I'm only asking because I genuinely don't understand since there were plenty of persecuted ethnic groups who were persecuted based mostly if not solely on ethnicity and they did not receive their land back after the fact or receive part of another established nation's land as reparations. Some of these groups were even promised this but did not get it.

Tldr: the Holocaust was terrible first of all, not a Holocaust denier or any of that shit and I def feel something should have been done for Jewish people after the fact. However, many ethnic groups have been persecuted based on ethnicity and things of the like and asked for land or reparations after the fact and didn't get shit. Why is Israel different?"

I’m starting to think most people care about being right or looking cool than changing anyone’s minds/opening their own. If they really cared more, they would be more respectful. Insulting someone is just going to make whomever you’re arguing with not listen to you and resent you.

Is insulting someone really necessary when having an argument? Are people really that insecure that they feel the need to insult everyone who disagrees with them?"

Please note that i'm talking about things you smoke. Cigarettes, cigars, vapes, that sort of this. Specially vapes.

I mean, what is the goddamn reason for people puffing out smoke and finding it cool? What's cool in getting unhealthy putting something in your mouth ? This isn't the 1940s where no one really knew the effects of smoke and that was as common as eating a Big Mac nowadays - everyone does it and it's goddamn okay to do so.

Also, the glorification of it - inclusing private users on social media - makes people want to smoke or use a vape because it looks cool, not to mention that if more people use, it creates social pressure, because you have to smoke to be part of a group - and this happens more and more as it becomes common and more accepted.

The absolute glorification of it must be terminally removed from social media. People can use it all they want but they shouldn't promote it, like when you recommend a restaurant to someone - recommending a restaurant is harmless, recommending vape isn't. 

Oh and don't come to me saying ""but coffee and alcohol are also glorified!!!"" or anything about coffee and alcohol. Alcohol shouldn't be promoted too, and coffee, well, it's a technicality to view it as a drug. Don't come to me with that typical vaper/smoker argument."
435,2023-05-13,CMV: Western socialist parties are being taken over by an upper class of liberal elite academics and artists who are more interested in hedonism than the actual working class,u/MentalDespairing,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13grsny/cmv_western_socialist_parties_are_being_taken/,changemyview,"I am a western man who has for a while been interested in socialism from a moral standpoint. I think the world is unfair by nature and socialism could aim for a world or at least attempt to reduce suffering as much as possible. But whenever I look into socialism it either does not make moral statements (Marxism) or it has been taken over by a liberal elite of artists, which I will here call Aesthetic Socialists.

Right-wing ideologies think tradition and hierarchies are natural while liberal capitalism is obsessed with hedonism and what I will call art worship - to believe art and literature is the most important thing a human being can do, which I find insulting as it implies that in a post-scarcity economy everyone will obviously be artists because nobody wants to do manual labor because it is ""lower"" and not ""high-minded"".

What bothers me is that this liberal class is starting to take over socialist discourse as well. Contrapoints, Philosophy Tube, Red Scarce podcast, Hasan - these are all mainstream socialists who does not seem to give a shit about socialism from a standpoint of morality but from a standpoint of pleasure and artistry. Reading the works of older socialists is not helpful either as Marxism is a scientific analysis and does not make moral statements. I mean, listening to the Red Scarce podcast they straight up sound like conservatives or nihilists in half the episodes.

Let me explain. I think there are artists out there who used to be capitalists, but realized that capitalism is bad for art and literature, combined with the fact that in the US conservative Christians are in league with capitalism, thus they are looking for something else to further their goals. They want a post-scarcity economy so that they can be artists. There an almost implicit idea that in our nihilist, meaningless world the only way of dealing with existentialism is to create great art and literature and theater and worship art in itself!  At times it seem like people straight up want socialist economics so that the world can finally thrive and seek out new struggles on our own!

But I don't give a shit about socialism being used to create new meaning, or to be combined with Nietzschean ideas to re-create yourself and all these ivory tower, philosophical goals. I just want the world to be more fair, to get help with the weakness of me and other people like me to suffer as little as possible. **There seems to be this trend in art and literature that suffering is so intelligent, so noble, so deep and meaningful!** But these people forget about people like me who wants to avoid this. 

Here is an article about it, not written by me but it explain Oscar Wilde's hedonistic style of socialism: [https://victorianweb.org/authors/wilde/diniejko.html](https://victorianweb.org/authors/wilde/diniejko.html)

This all pisses me off as I want socialism as a way to hold down the strong, which is what I think Nietzsche called slave morality. I have zero problems with this morality as long as we remove the spiritual elements of Christianity, and homophobia, sexism, etc etc. Nature is inherently unfair and socialism could help people like me who simply cannot deal with the harshness of reality.  Yet it seems that any person who actually makes videos or writes literature on socialism ignores people like me and instead makes socialism out to be this great artistic benefit when the main goal should be to reduce suffering and struggle.

Where are the working class socialist parties advocate socialism for moral reasons - not hedonism or because of ""historical determinism""? It just sucks, man.

At the end I want to make it clear I do not have hatred against art and literature. I am genuinely sorry for those of you who has to work 8 hours a day in a job while your mind decays.

Please note that this is not really the best point to CMV on socialism. If you are here to say Stalin killed 600 million people I understand the desire to change my mind, but this CMV is about socialism being taken over by a specific branch of people. It is this I want to change, so please stay on topic. Mods, please consider this so this thread does not become an anti-socialism circlejerk."
0,2023-05-13,"CMV: In the relatively near future, people wearing fake tan will be regarded as offensive",u/forbiddenmemeories,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13gsbx7/cmv_in_the_relatively_near_future_people_wearing/,changemyview,"There has been some social media discussion recently around an article published in the Irish Times entitled ""[Irish Women's obsession with fake tan is problematic](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/irish-times-removes-opinion-article-163018815.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALZrPqG-i4nBvRq6zLlB5athajDbJQrJRLrt5mBoywDj-WwbegL5BvxINimyGuoSeFjIAiaJOW9Bk-5ozL_6NT3vT0_KyIiQmkyZt5bDSTe6MbWLdhil_cDmRujZNbSbfFxdfDahfKWbOFaRVxWwnYUXPtch0IJDd_Z8N5HXkY2L)."" In a peculiar turn of events, the article has since been removed and there are claims that the author may not have been genuine or even that it may have been written by AI rather than a human being.

However, whether the article was serious or merely a hoax, its central argument that ""fake tan represents more than just an innocuous cosmetic choice; it raises questions of cultural appropriation and fetishisation of the high melanin content found in more pigmented people"" is one which I think does tally very strongly with views on race, culture and what is acceptable or appropriate that have become common in recent years, to the point that I think this view will in fact become similarly popular in the near future.

Compare it to the following issues. First of all, there's the very uncontroversial one that practices like blackface or yellowface are already widely agreed on as very offensive and have been for a long time. In more recent years, the threshold for what we consider to be 'blackface' or 'yellowface' has also become more resolute - for example, the view that voice actors voicing characters of different races is inappropriate, with the likes of *The Simpsons* recasting characters like Dr Hibbert which had formerly been voiced by white actors like Harry Shearer. This marks something of a shift; it's unsurprising that something like a white actor playing a non-white character using garish make-up has for a much longer time been considered wrong given both that it's extremely obvious and that it's very much associated with portrayals that were deliberately intended to mock people of that race; the more recent view extending to voice actors as well to me marks a shift to the view that portraying someone of a different race is *inherently* a problem, whether or not the portrayer's own race is obvious or whether it is done at the expense of people of the other race.

Similarly, discussions of racial appearance have also developed in recent years to the point to discussions about 'colourism' and the inappropriate differences in treatment of people from broadly the same racial/ethnic group but of different skin tones. For example, we've seen [criticism of the casting of the Lilo and Stitch live-action film](https://news.sky.com/story/disney-criticised-after-revealing-cast-for-lilo-stitch-remake-12857544) for casting Sydney Agudong; Sydney Agudong is Hawaiian but does have a noticeably lighter complexion than the character she is playing had in the original version. Similarly, [we have seen plenty of criticism of the use or even existence of skin-lightening products](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/30/how-skin-whitening-reveals-the-depth-of-the-beauty-industrys-colourism), on the grounds that their use reflects a prejudice against people with darker skin. Of course, in the case of fake tan we may at least be less wary that someone's desire to darken their skin stems from poor treatment they have received for their natural skin colour or bad media messaging about their natural skin colour, but as noted about the actors discussion, popular opinion now seems to be that the *reason* for someone outwardly displaying a skin colour different to their own is not especially important, because the action of doing so is generally or inherently a problem regardless. On that note, the term 'blackfishing' has also been used in recent years to describe light-skinned women like Ariana Grande using cosmetics to change their appearance to appear as if they are black or mixed race.

'Blackfishing' has not yet become as controversial as some of the other things mentioned - at least, celebrities are certainly still doing it, anyway - but it has also been talked about for less time than the others, and most people aware of the term do seem to agree it is a problem with few people actually defending it; I expect in the near future it will be widely regarded as offensive. I can also see that 'blackfishing' specifically may have reasons to garner more criticism than simply wearing fake tan; it may involve changing other features about one's appearance as well as one's skin colour, and it would probably also be fair to say that white people playing at being black has been in recent decades regarded as especially offensive even more so than anyone of any other race playing at being any other race. But even if imitating fewer features and of other races doesn't garner quite the same level of offense, it certainly still is regarded as offensive to *some* degree.

On these grounds, I believe that in the relatively near future, wearing any amount of fake tan that noticeably changes one's complexion will be regarded as offensive. It probably won't be regarded as offensive by *everybody*, but I think it will be regarded as such by the people who at present regard the other aforementioned situations of bluffing one's race to be a bad thing to do. Likewise, it will probably not be regarded as being *as* offensive as something like blackface, but I think it will still be regarded as offensive enough to be a problem; enough that for example, a person appearing on mainstream television in fake tan would be enough to garner an apology from the person and network.

I am open to having my view changed; this is a view that I have only come to hold recently, and I also am not seeking to claim that wearing fake tan necessarily *is* offensive, merely that I predict it will be considered as such. CMV."
10,2023-05-13,CMV: Manchester City should rest their entire starting line up on Sunday. For their far more important clash on Wednesday.,u/barbodelli,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13gscbe/cmv_manchester_city_should_rest_their_entire/,changemyview,"Man City has already won several English Premier league titles. They would still likely win the BPL even if they lost to Everton this Sunday. 

They have never won anything in Europe. If they beat Real they would see a much easier opponent in either Inter or Milan. No gimmie by any stretch but Real is a much tougher challenge. 

Basically this is such a big must win for them. There's no reason to risk injury against Everton. It would also help to be well rested for that game. 

I know Pep is likely going to rest ""some"" players. But I think he should do more and straight up rest the entire starting 11. 

Also the B squad for Man City would probably still give Everton a good game. They might even win. 

I'm curious to hear about the rest factor. I remember thinking that Argentina had a huge edge against France in 2022 because they had 1 day extra rest. And thinking the same thing vice versa in 2014 when Germany was the well rested team. I know it's just one variable, but it seems rather important. A tired body is not going to perform well in a crucial match."

Here's what I've been thinking: certain severe crimes, such as rape, aggravated murder, particularly those involving children, should be met with equally severe punishments, akin to practices found in Singapore and Japan. 

In Singapore, they have a practice known as caning as a part of their judicial system. I believe such a practice should be adopted for rapists. I understand this may sound harsh or unusual, but I feel the severity of the crime should be reflected in the punishment, as a deterrent and a form of retribution. Rape is a horrific violation of a person's rights, autonomy, and safety. A punishment as severe as caning, in my view, seems to be an appropriate response. 

Similarly, for certain crimes, I believe life imprisonment should be a mandatory penalty. In certain cases, the damage done to victims and society is irreparable, and I feel it's only just that the perpetrators face an equally severe consequence. 

Hard labour is another practice that I believe should be implemented more widely. It serves as a form of restitution, having offenders physically contribute to society as a means of offsetting the harm they have caused. 

Finally, and perhaps most controversially, I believe the death penalty by hanging, as is practiced in Japan, should be considered for the most heinous of crimes, specifically those involving the worst forms of child abuse, murder, and assault. The rationale here is twofold: Firstly, the severity of the crime is such that the person has forfeited their right to live in society. Secondly, the fear of such a penalty may serve as a deterrent to potential criminals.

I understand these are controversial views and may seem draconian or regressive to some, but I believe there is a place for these practices in our justice system. I think they could serve as effective deterrents and provide a sense of justice for the victims. 

I'm really keen to hear counterarguments or perspectives that could help me refine or challenge my viewpoint. So, Reddit, Change My View!"

That is 50 men killed to every one woman killed.

White men are killed the most overall by police. Black men are killed by police more so than white men when we go by per capita. At a rate of about 2.5 to 1 per capita. There is no denying that. Hispanic men are about 1.3 times more likely to be killed by police per capita than white men.

The numbers 2.5 to 1 we could argue are in the same ball park. It's a difference yes, but nowhere near the 50 to 1 number in the gender gap.

The media has people brainwashed to believe ""Police are racist against black men."" Some may be, but that's not the biggest problem by the numbers.

When in reality the actions of police are more showing ""Police are sexist against all men.""

Remove all taxes. Add a tax on all purchases. Tax is removed from human rights/ necessity purchases, including but not limited to things like living expenses (primary household mortgage or rent), food, utilities, education, etc.

Tax is increased on high-end luxury items. This could scale exponentially with price or have price categories or some other system to scale higher tax with more expensive/ luxurious items.

Example:
Disclaimer: Example numbers are for concept conveyance only are are not real numbers aka the numbers are not the suggestion, the concept is the suggestion.
Example 1: 2k tv has 15% tax and 2m yacht has 40% tax. 
Example 2: Or maybe like luxury items priced 0-5k = 15% tax, 5-50k = 20%, 50-150k = 25%, 150k-500k = 30%, 500-2m = 35%, 2m-10m = 40%, 10m+ = 45%.

Why? It helps standardize tax and helps prevent avoiding taxes. Rich people spend money. Poor people don't spend as much. If you can afford higher end items, you can afford to pay the luxury tax. If you're struggling to buy groceries, you get the benefit of no tax on your groceries.

It would have to be a federal law that says something like the only tax allowed to be applied to us citizens is sales tax and is set at X% at a federal level and X%-X% allowed by individual states to add on.


Edit to clarify: In this system, all money spent on anything non-essential by any US citizen, corporation, resident, entity, etc. would be taxed. Avoiding the sales tax would be a crime."

8,2023-05-14,"CMV: India should and can build a high-speed rail network to connect its major cities as soon as possible. And it should repeat China's path of absorbing foreign technology and developing its own HSR on its basis, instead of simply importing foreign HSR.",u/ConsCom1949,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13h9img/cmv_india_should_and_can_build_a_highspeed_rail/,changemyview,"Sorry for reposting principally the same content and adding a ""should develop own technology"" part, but it's past 24 hours and the mod approved my original post only many hours after submitting so it didn't get many replies nor changed my view. Also I added some new stuff to represent my new ideas.

Clarification: by high speed rail network I mean:

(1) Maximum operating speed: 300 km/h or above 

(2) Method: Either conventional rail or Maglev

and (3) Scale: Connecting (almost) every major city in the country. I mean at least all the 5 cities with more than 5 million population, with stops in the way including >1 million population cities.

Reason 1: India is a densely populated country, with multiple megacities located only a few hundred kilometres apart, in the perfect range of HSR. An HSR network could render domestic air travel, sleeper buses and conventional passenger rail all nearly obsolete.

Reason 2: HSR offers more comfort and speed and at a price level barely higher than traditional rail travel. Let's do a comparison of Indian conventional train and Chinese high speed train. The comparison will be between Beijing-Shanghai HSR and Mumbai-Delhi railway. Beijing-Shanghai is 1,318 km apart while Mumbai-Delhi is 1,165~1,360 km (different sources show different results). 

China 350 km/h train (CR400 series): travel time 4 h 18 min,  second class ticket price $91

China 310 km/h train (CRH380 series): travel time 5 h 38 min, second class ticket price $79

China 160 km/h train (CR200J): travel time 12 h 3 min, second class sleeper $58

India express train: travel time 16 h 3 min, AC2 class (similar to Chinese 2nd class sleeper) $52

India normal train: travel time 25 h 20 min, AC2 class $30

We can see Chinese 310 km/h high speed train is only about 50% more expensive than Indian AC2 sleeper of an express train, and is almost three times faster. What's more, JR Shinkansen is about 2.5 times more expensive than CRH trains. And Japan/China GDP per capita is similar to China/India GDP per capita. That means high speed trains in India might even be ***cheaper than conventional trains***, because seats take up less space than berths.

Reason 3: HSR has a per-capita carbon emission of less than a tenth of flights. Moving more domestic travellers from flights to trains would do great good to not only the economy but also the planet.

Reason 4: Conventional railway system in India is pathetic. Train accidents kill 32 people a ***day*** on average. In comparison, Japan has never had a high-speed train accident with deaths and China has just 1 back in 2011. So high speed trains are far safer than normal trains. By largely relegating normal trains to freight travel (reserve a few passenger trains for price conscious travellers), we can directly save **13,000** lives every year just by avoiding accidents. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-13-000-train-accidents-in-2020-32-lives-lost-daily-on-average-ncrb-report-101635646106710-amp.html

Reason 5: Why I said as soon as possible: China built up its HSR network from scratch in a mere 15 years. It opened its first HSR line in 2008 and now has connected almost every major city by HSR. In fact the central government recently told local governments to stop building new HSR lines because the network is almost complete. How about India? 8 years since offering Japan the chance to build its first HSR line and the actual construction has barely started yet. It's scheduled to open in 2027 but IMO it will be delayed to 2030 at least because it's already impossible to meet the 2027 deadline with the current pace of construction. And other lines haven't even began land acquisition yet. I don't see any possibility of India finishing a national HSR network in 15 or even 20 years if it maintains its current snail-slow pace. It needs to speed up. And I mean as fast as possible even if it means spending some more money on land acquisition to please land owners. The long-term economic benefits will by far outweigh the construction costs, not mentioning the extra comfort, the national pride factor, and 13,000 less deaths every year.

Reason 6: India has a deep, rich railway culture and developing an HSR network is a huge boost for national pride and solidarity. It will be a super big achievement for any political party that completes this feat, so whatever government should have the incentive to do it. And also, the present day Indian economy is facing semi-recession, and should the government issue a stimulus package, constructing HSR should be a significant part of it. In fact Chinese HSR project was a part of the stimulus package in response to the Great Recession. 

Reason 7: Why develop its own technology when other countries already have mature high speed trains? If you use foreign technology it would depend heavily on diplomatic and economic relationships with that country. That foreign country can rip you off with exorbitant prices if they want to. And they won't sell you the trains if they think you're having too much. Not to mention political strings that often come from such projects. Buying foreign technology, instead of just rolling stocks, may cost a bit more, but it's worthwhile as it saves future maintenance and purchase cost. India already has train 18 so it does know how to build EMUs. The next step is to learn from foreign countries like Japan, Germany or China how to build 300+ km/h EMUs or even Maglevs. China bought foreign 250 km/h trains in 2004 and developed its own 380 km/h ones in 2009. It took them only 5 years to import foreign technology, improve upon it, and making it their own.

Reason 8: Buying foreign technology and innovating on its basis isn't ""stealing"" foreign technology, because they agreed to technological transfer at the beginning and what they gave you is typically their old technology. Japan didn't give China JR 700 or JR 900 or E5 trains, only E2-1000. Germany gave China a heavily nerfed version of ICE3. Now CR400AF is based on CRH380A which in turn is based on CRH2C which is based on CRH2A which is a slightly nerfed ER-1000. But guess what, CR400AF hands-on beats E2-1000 in almost every aspect and is one of the best trains in the world while E2-1000 is on its way to retirement. Now it's a completely different train from what it was originally."

0,2023-05-14,CMV: Lawyers are immoral,u/Distinct-Yogurt9276,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13hewg6/cmv_lawyers_are_immoral/,changemyview,"Edit3: Some lawyers are immoral

Lawyers that represent corrupt corporations are immoral. These lawyers work for big companies and help them sue innocent smaller companies. The most obvious example of this are patent trolls. Another example, Monster Energy Drink is a trademark troll. Lawyers who work for Monster Energy Drink are immoral. Monster Energy Drink has sued a restaurant for using the word monster on their signs. They also sued a video game titled Dark Deception: Monsters & Mortals.

I consider these types of lawyers different from lawyers who defend violent criminals. It's not immoral to defend a violent criminal because you can't be sure if the defendant is innocent or guilty. It IS immoral to work for a company like Monster Energy Drink because everyone knows Monster Energy Drink is in the wrong, they shouldn't be allowed to sue people just for using the word monster.

I've been watching How I Met Your Mother. In season 3 Marshall is deciding between working for the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) or working for a law firm that represents corrupt companies that pollute the environment. The NRDC pays much less money than the other law firm. I don't judge people who choose money over saving the environment, but I do judge people who actively help to destroy the environment. It's ok if Marshall chooses a higher paying job than the NRDC, but not if that higher paying job involves working for corrupt companies.


Edit: Another example of immoral lawyers:

Wealthy companies will sue poor companies with a bogus claim. The wealthy company can't win the lawsuit, but they don't need to. They just need to force the poor companies to pay for lawyers until they're bankrupt


Edit2: I blame both the corrupt corporations and the lawyers. I'm not only blaming lawyers


Edit4: Imagine you are a poor person being sued by a rich person over a bogus claim. You're forced to settle because you can't afford to go to court. Are you upset with the lawyers who are suing you? Or just upset with the rich person who hired the lawyers?


Edit5: Lawyers should not blindly work for the highest bidder. Lawyers can ruin innocent people's lives. Needing money is not an excuse to hurt an innocent person.

Someone said that's it's unreasonable to hold lawyers to completely different standards than everyone else with a job.

Is it unreasonable to hold cops to completely different standards than everyone else with a job?
Or what about doctors or pilots?
Lawyers have the power to ruin lives."
0,2023-05-14,"CMV: I can't get behind the internets' fascination with ""Karens"" and wish it would go away",u/RedditExplorer89,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13hfplv/cmv_i_cant_get_behind_the_internets_fascination/,changemyview,"The whole thing feels wrong to me, like its thinly veiled sexism.  I understand there can be ""male karens,"" but really the focus seems to be entirely on women.  It's a woman's name, and 99% of the videos I see on ""Karens"" are women.  Of the videos I see,

* the vast majority are missing a lot of context that could explain the woman's actions to be reasonable.  The video starts halfway through her tantrum (not sure what the best word to use here is, but not meaning to be demeaning here) and some text appears on the screen explaining what lead up to the tantrum.  But how should we believe that is actually what started the incident?  Anyone can put some text on a video and claim what was going on.  For example: the woman (uber?) driver who supposedly throws out the passenger's belongings on the highway after being asked to drive under the speed limit.  Large portions of the video are cut out; anything could have happened in there that might make those actions more reasonable.

* are reasonable.  Sometimes being inconvenient in public is justified if you have been wronged.  In a lot of the cases it feels like people just want people to ""suck it up"" rather than stand up for themself.  An example of this is the woman on the airline sticking up for her crew being treated poorly by a passenger.  Another example is the woman holding the parking spot.  The cars waiting for her to move should just keep driving and find an unclaimed parking spot.

* are just someone being racist, in which case there is no need for a ""Karen"" label.

* someone having a mental breakdown, which shouldn't be laughed at IMO.  (thinking of the cop freaking out about the mcdonalds order).

* Are fake.  Thinking of the woman ""being attacked by a doberman.""

So yeah, I think this fascination isn't really justified, and causes harm in targetedly portraying women in negative lighting.  It also sucks for anyone who happens to be named Karen.

**What would change my view**

* The ""karen"" videos I've seen are some compilation videos on youtube, and the occasional one that makes r/all when I happen to be browsing r/all.  Maybe there are some more justifiable ""karen"" videos I haven't seen?

* Explain why one of my issues with the fascination isn't an issue.  Are none of the karen videos showing a reasonable woman?  Is laughing at someone having a mental breakdown okay?  Does applying the term ""karen"" to a racist do anything meaningful?

* Explain or show that there is no harm being done to woman as a group or women named karen by this fascination.

**Deltas**

* The term originally started as a way to call out racist behavour that women were able to do due to societies view of them being innocent and vulnrable.  [This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13hfplv/cmv_i_cant_get_behind_the_internets_fascination/jk5opdy/) did a great job of IMO of explaining it and providing good information on the topic.

* Its really hard to justify harming someone's items in most of these videos.  I still think it might be more reasonable than the video portrays if we are missing context, but not fully reasonable.

* Standing in a parking spot to claim it is socially not allowed.

* Men are criticized for being violent in public, ~~called ""popeyes"".~~ - nope, that was just the restaurant name.

* Good has come out of the Karen phenomena.  It has brought light on racist behaviors."

I think you can take any given person and make it work with them.

1.) I don't think they decrease sex for money due to the history of prohibition they actually found banning alcohol increased consumption by a little. So these laws likely does not do as intended.

2.) If someone wants to do it it's their own freedom. They should have the freedom to choose. Nothing wrong with 2 consenting adults having sex for money. A decent amount of men only take girls out on dates and pay for things for them so they can get sex in return so we some what do this already even though it's not a direct exchange.

3.) Having it illegal opens up the black market which means we'll have more pimps and gang members regulating things themselves. This will increase crime, especially violent crime such as murder, assault, robbery, etc. 

4.) Due to more crime due to prostitution and everything that comes with the black market this equals an increased demand on our justice system which increases taxes for us. So it's a lot more costly to keep it illegal.

5.) Studies have shown that diseases related to sex are lower in sex workers in country's where it's legal vs country's that it's illegal. So we get less diseases as well."

After giving it some thought, I’ll try to reason it with 5 points.

1. It’s more “whatever”. Agreeing to “could” is being open to flexibility and possibilities. It’s more consistent in going with the flow. Any way the wind blows- they’re up for it. This is as opposed to expressing the bold, rigid, and hyperbolic self-proclamation of caring absolutely 0. There’s something a bit try-hard about caring enough to comment just to say that you care absolutely 0 and refusing to care less or claiming that to do so would be impossible.

2. It’s shorter. Talk is cheap. You can say that you give zero cares or you can actually show it by using less syllables in a sentence. Not caring should be effortless.  

3. It’s more visceral. “Caring less” is more immediately striking than “not caring less”. The lasting effect should be the concept of you “caring less” rather than “not caring less”.

4. Infinite carelessness. Even though I knocked the hyperbole of giving absolutely zero cares, the idea of saying we can still care less even if we’re already at 0 hits the same vibe as “I’m so hungry I can eat a horse”. Of course you can’t actually eat a horse, but the exaggeration amplifies the sentiment. 

5. Being illogical shows carelessness. Maybe the person didn’t think things through when they said it. Maybe they’re logically wrong. But if anything that actually shows that they didn’t care enough to care whether what they said even makes sense! They just wanna give off the vibe of “caring less” as opposed to “caring more”."

The UN describes human rights as ""inherent to us all"" ([https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights)) which I just don't think is true.  Nothing socially constructed is INHERENT.

I've been thinking about this alot and I think that the idea of a ""right"" is much less helpful than the idea of a social contract.  This might just be an issue of semantics, but in my mind shifting our vocabulary to better acknowledge the fact this is a social contract feels like it could be productive.

Thinking about this politically, there have been times when I have been in a more conservative mindset where  I am less interested in the idea of diverting a lot of money to social services.  I can find the language of ""rights"" grating in such instances, because it's just not a right.  I feel differently when it's re-presented to me as something along the lines of: what kind of society do you want to be in?  Why don't we agree on providing this service as a social contract? 

I have no issue with the idea of human rights, I just don't think its particularly helpful pragmatically, and acknowledging the underlying web of social networks and systems that constitute them feels important to me."

The argument goes that by allowing the US citizenry to arm themselves, in the event of a tyrannical overthrow of the US government and the cessation of the democratic process, US civilians can use the weapons they own (thanks to 2A) to overthrow the tyranny and restore democratic processes.  
  
This argument is often seen as absurd because it assumes that an un-coordinated and poorly equipped (relative to the US Armed Forces) citizenry would somehow have the capacity to overwhelm/overthrow a tyrannical dictatorship. Yet 2A defenders point out that guerrilla tactics and other unconventional warfare means have been effective in the past in other situations, and could result in the toppling of a dictatorship in the US, were one ever to emerge.  
  
However, if this is true, and we accept pro-2A arguments that we believe that a tyrannical US could genuinely be overthrown by an armed pro-democracy citizenry, it also follows that a democratic US could be overthrown by an armed pro-tyranny citizenry. Arming a citizenry does nothing to ensure that their weapons will always be used in service of democracy. As has been seen thanks to events like 6/1/2021, it is wrong to assume the population will always be unambiguously on the side of democracy. They could be simply deceived that they are acting in the interest of free and fair elections, when the reverse is in fact true, or they could genuinely believe that democracy is no longer in their interest.  
  
Essentially, the reason the pro-2A ""protection from tyranny"" argument is intellectually dishonest is that an armed citizenry is at least as much a threat to the continuation of democracy as it is a threat to the emergence/continuation of tyranny, and if that's the case, protection against tyranny cannot be reasonably called an argument in favour of 2A/gun de-regulation."

""He gets us"" and US Military ads specifically that continuously infect my screen even though I've blocked the owners of the ads and reported the ads for being offensive still exist spouting clearly and blatantly biased information. 

We used to be able to block the people which block the ads. Clearly this was removed on purpose. 

Need ad revenue? Not gonna get it from the people blocking the accounts of offensive content (to them). May as well not harrass people with ads they hate then.

I'm open to changing my position but it would have to be a really good point.

19,2023-05-14,CMV: Stevie Wonder's 5 Album Run in the 70s was the Greatest of All Time,u/blackdynomitesnewbag,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13htel8/cmv_stevie_wonders_5_album_run_in_the_70s_was_the/,changemyview,"It is uncontested that Stevie Wonder has one of the most brilliant musical minds of any person living or dead. His music was transformative and pioneering across genres that include rhythm and blues, pop, soul, gospel, funk, and jazz. While I believe that his album Songs in the Key of Life may be the best album ever created, that’s not what what I’m here to argue. I’m here to say that his 5 year run of 5 albums in the 70’s was the single greatest musical run of all time. No other artist has put out hit after hit after hit album, each one more transformative and ground breaking than the previous. In these 7 years, he won 12 Grammys and got 7 nominations. He released three consecutive albums that got Best Album of the Year, something I don’t believe any other artist has ever done. Four of those five albums made it on to Rolling Stone’s best 500 albums of all time 2020 edition, three of them in the top 75, and one of them reaching number 4.

[1971: Where I'm Coming From](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_I%27m_Coming_From)While I don’t include this album as part of the run, I do think of it as a preamble. It’s the first album that he broke out somewhat from his previous sound and let everyone know he was no longer your Grandmother’s Stevie

[1972: Music of My Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_My_Mind)The start of the run, the first album where he had full creative control, he starts off strong using synthesizers in a way that had never been heard before in music, in particular his use of famous Moog Synthesizer. He recorded multiple takes of himself playing multiple instruments and vocal tracks so that he could compose them together. He pioneered the use of the vocoder and TalkBox as voice modifying tools.

* No. 350 on Rolling Stone’s best albums of all time

[1972: Talking Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Book)In the same year, Stevie released the album that gave us Superstition and You are the Sunshine of My life, neither of which are the best song on the album in my opinion. That goes to Tuesday Heartbreak.

* Charted at #3 on US Billboard Pop
* 3 Grammy wins and nominations for Record and Song of the year.
* No. 59 on Rolling Stone’s best albums of all time

[1973: Innervisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innervisions)The next year, Innervisions hits, charts at 4, and gave us three huge hits “Higher Ground”, “Living for the City,” and “Don’t You Worry ‘Bout a Thing’”. It received universal critical acclaim

* Won 2 Grammys, including Best Album of the Year
* No. 34 on Rolling Stone’s best albums of all time

[1974: Fulfillingness' First Finale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulfillingness%27_First_Finale)Even more experimentation with the synthesizer and mixing genres that you wouldn’t expect to hear on the same album.

* Charted at #1 and had two charting singles, one at no. 1 and one at no 3.
* 3 Grammys, including Best Album of the Year again

1975:At the 1976 Grammys, during his reception speech for Best Album of the Year, Paul Simon thanks Stevie Wonder for not releasing an album that year.

[1976: Songs in the Key of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_in_the_Key_of_Life)Stevie releases his double album masterpiece. Took him two years cause he put twice the music on it. Countless hits that all got radio play that I’m not going to list. Many regard this as the best album of all time.

* Charted at no. 1
* Certified Diamond
* No. 4 on Rolling Stone’s best albums of all time
* 3 Grammys, including Best Album of the Year again, and 3 nominations. Also won for Best Producer"

There is ""The mother"", released this year, where she improvises a time bomb and not only is this included, this constructing is shown to the audience. Or ""Ambulance"", where the main character sends ambulances with bombs and cars rigged with machine guns into crowds of police and populated areas, and is generally supposed to be felt bad for at the end of the movie. 

Obviously this is entertaining to watch for somebody, or else it wouldn't be in here, but showing the audience how to build a bomb from shit you found in a bathroom or showing 2 literal terrorist attacks be done by the main character that you are then supposed to feel bad for is too far for public audiences. 

There is no fucking reason to show those things to convey the same idea. Then there's the fact that every action movie has to have overly violent scenes and collateral damage, like the fact that John wick only needed to hunt 4 people. However, he kills over 400 people in deranged, improvised ways (snapping someone neck with a book) over a car and a dog he had for one day.

I'm not saying movies cause violence, but these could and should be regulated more heavily.

Edit: this post was fucking stupid, and I'm giving everyone their points as soon as I figure out how. My point was, don't include bomb making footage as a plot point."

I've been stuck on this problem for a while now and it's really damaging my relationships, so I'm looking for some feedback. I'll be as candid as I can for efficiency's sake.

I'm struggling to be a religiously tolerant person. Here's my spiel:

I grew up really conservatively Catholic, and had a few abusive teachers in my Catholic school. While I thought I could handle it at the time, in truth they scarred me more than I care to admit. Part of the reason was because I turned out to be transgender (MtF) and just didn't know it at the time, and survived that messy environment by repressing my gender and goose-stepping my way through life. But most of it was because the Catholic Church is an authoritarian organization that more or less ruined belief for me. 

I should explain.

I thought I was just a hardass and stubborn- so did everyone- I'm doing a lot better now, but digging through my trauma is hard and I get very combative with people. I wish twelve-year-old me would've never been in that situation to begin with, but here we are, and now I watch me be very rude to people I actually like, all because they're doing something I think is religious, like assign 'souls' to objects and thank them for their 'service' once they're discarded. Current me thinks this is more dangerous than anything else- doing that shit is playing with fire, because believing in anything other than material reality- the reality we all know and have to interact with- can and does justify a lot of nasty shit, and that includes 'souls'. When people do shit like that, I remember all the times that happened to me, how I was literally forced to do religion constantly for so many years... and I blow up at them, and they stop talking to me.

Now I know plenty of nice and kind religious people, but do I think their beliefs are a concern? 100%, yes. Even if they're gay themselves, I fear for gay people the second someone starts talking about how much Jesus has done for them or whatever. The representation has been so consistently bad for me that I really don't want to deal with it, but I live in America and Christianity is unavoidable here, not to mention there's loads of other people of faith I have no choice but to interact with. So the end result is a disconnected, pessimistic, cynical me, personality traits I've taken to heart.

Idk, gamers. I don't want to be known for this shit and I'm becoming known for this shit. Will happily answer questions, but fire when ready~

TLDR I had a really bad experience with the Catholic Church and now no one gets to have a good experience with religion/spirituality/belief at all."

It’s the basic emotions like feeling excited, fun, being love, lust, obsession, friendship, being validated, being accepted, feeling safe that contribute to their sexuality at the time which you can’t control emotions. It just happens so that’s not a choice.

But there’re values more than that in people’s life. People’s views on how society,family and their groups perceived at being LGBTQ+ are varied. Some groups are supportive, others could be intolerant. Which after weighing with the feelings I stated on first paragraph, each people choose how they label themselves or their way of lives. That’s a choice.

Also I believe that people who are homophobic or biphobic also have the part that their sexuality are also a spectrum and fluid in them"

And I want to distinguish rude from violent (I'm talking about just being rude/nasty with words or actions, not physical harm). But lately, it feels like I hear/see so much aggression in public. It's scary, like anyone could flip a switch and go off at any moment. And then there's the video evidence - at airports, on the street, kids in schools. There is one of a woman involuntarily deboarding a plane and yelling that she hopes it crashes. I just don't remember this in the 90's/early aughts at all. Even though, I know, we weren't recording everything like we do now, so its easier to collect evidence. I recently witnessed a woman screaming at a grocery store stocker because they ran out of fresh ginger. He kindly suggested that she could buy some frozen cubes which just set her off further, she ""NEEDED FRESH!"" And then told the entire produce section that he ruined her day, he did not. He doesn't grow the ginger, just stocks it. Even on here, I'm sure I'll get some nasty responses to this post, for no reason, like people are looking for a reason to be rude (why go out of your way? what a waste of energy). I was raised with the idea that if 'I don't  have something nice to say, don't say anything at all'. Which I think is the way to go (unless speaking up for injustice which can be done politely). Our entire collective society can not be having a bad day, every day, all the time. Not everyone is dealing with mental illness (a lot of people but not everyone) which can explain a small amount of rudeness (it's not intentional in that case). People are just ruder now, perhaps knowing there are no real consequences for being rude.

Edit: Update - There have been some really great points made here. My mind isn't changed entirely, but the best arguments in support of changing it (to me) have been by posters who explain why people are more rude these days (getting worse over the past thirty years or so) and don't care about being rude anymore. I think for a plethora of reasons people used to care more about how they're perceived and no longer do. But it's still baffling to me."

As you can probably extrapolate this does not work, for one youd have to know every fact and every piece of data on the subject, then youd have to be able to weigh up all this information and come to a conclusion. Even if you did manage to do this you wouldnt be able to say that whatever conclusion you came to is definitive because new information could come about at any time. Even the studies that you might incorporate into your analysis are based on hypothesis which are based on the researchers feeling that something might be true or not and then that is proven either way, but there will be lots more hypotheses that may not be tested.   
I find people use it because they cherry pick one or some statistics that back their own 'feeling' about a particular subject of which they had already come to the conclusion on before finding out about the fact. The truth is oftentimes messy and not as easy as 'this is true because there are facts about it'. The statement is very simplistic and promotes black and white thinking without due regard for the obvious nuance in every subject.

Edit: most are saying that the statement itself is not nonsense. I agree with this but what I should've said is that the common use of it is nonsense for their purposes which is usually online discussion. You never hear from someone who actually researches or  an academic, that would use the that statement as the statement when used in the common way can come across very dismissive and actually blocks discussion. 

I agree in general that of course facts are essential in coming to truth but it's also extremely easy to cherry pick certain facts to prove your theory."

&nbsp;

**However there is a large potential failure mode:** the child could be so disagreeable that they refuse to stay in the ""timeout spot"", and repeatedly chasing+catching+placing them back into the timeout spot becomes an entertaining game, which defeats the point of the timeout. The only solution to this seems to be to either abandon timeouts as a strategy, or passively limit their freedom of movement somehow. 

&nbsp;

Public perception rules out cages and restraints, but would perhaps allow parents to lock their kid in their room. For the latter to work as a timeout, all forms of entertainment (toys, drawing implements, electronics, etc) would have to be removed from the room. Is it not simpler and easier to just have a cage? With a flat bottom and enough room to stand + lie down in, so that they aren't uncomfortable? 

&nbsp;

Arguments against this seem without basis; they just take the form of ""that's cruel"" without any substance. Leaving your child in a cage for long periods of time, and thus depriving them of everything for long periods of time, is indeed abusive. **But the cruelty/abuse in that situation isn't coming from the cage, but from the extended time out.** The cage is a useful tool, just as timeout is itself a tool, and tools can be misused. The cage seems like the perfection of the timeout."
6,2023-05-15,CMV: Compatibalism doesnt make sense.,u/polyvinylchl0rid,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13ig542/cmv_compatibalism_doesnt_make_sense/,changemyview,"*Preamble:*

So in the discussion about whether free will there are 3 prominent positions:

* Humans have free will, determinism is false
* Humans dont have free will, determinism is true
* Compatibalism, humas have free will and determinism is true

With determinism im refering to the macro scale, im aware that consensus is that some quantum events are truely random (though whether something is random or determined, either isnt free).

With human action im also including the action of thinking.

If human action is wholly determined by prior events, than humans dont have free will. If human action is not wholly determined by prior events, there is a good chance that it is free. Our intuition surely provided a strong reason to belive so.

What even is free will? While i dont have a rigourus definition i do have a though experiment: You get to make a choice between chocolate and vanilla. You pick vanilla. Then we magically rewind the Universe to the exact state it was in before you chose. If you have free will you might choose chocolate this time, if you dont have free will you will always pick vanilla, no matter how many times we repeat the experiment.
****
With that layed out how could compatibalism make sense? idk, it doesnt to me. The explanation of compatibalism ive heard is the following:

If you are pushed into a pool your are not free, but if you jump in yourselfe you are free. The result of landing in the water is the same, but when your pushed the reason is external while when you jump the reason is internal. That some actions are internally determined demonstrates free will.

I think the distinction between those two is usefull in practice, maybe with regards to determining guilt in a court of law or just for everyday conversation. But in the free will discussion this distinction is not really relevant. It feels like compatibalism is talking about something that seems similar to free will but is actually categorically different. If we go back to the thought experiment i layed out, i think its clear that this distinction is not relevant. Either you pick the same thing every time, or you dont. If that reason originates in a particular place over another doesnt seem realevant (in the big bang, quantum fluctuations, human brain chemisty) or it does not originate somewhere but comes from a soul or similar i dont see how determinism could be true.

Ive heard that compatibalism is actually the most prominent position to hold on the topic. Determinism (with regard to everything except human action and quantum stuff) seems extremly plausible and widely accepted, and not beliving in free will is uncomfortable. So the best way i can make sense of that is that people want to be as reasonable as they can but not give up the comfort of free will.

delta awarded to /u/Hot_Candidate_1161 for pointing out that with a different definition of ""you"" compatibalism makes much more sense. I used ""you"" as in my consciousness or my experience. But if ""you"" is defined as before but also adding body/brain to it makes a lot more sense.

delta awarded to /u/ignotos for pointing out that compatibalism ist ""trying"" to ""make sense"", at least in the way i am talking about free will."

Like it or not when countries are involved in international competitions politics are going to play a part in choices. For example if the vote was left to the public it would've become extremely biased as country with massive diasporas would've had a massive avantage.

Also take countries like Israel an extremely hated county. This year their song was very good but without the jury they would've done poorly due to a lot of hate and feelings surrounding their current situation.

The Eurovision Jury enables musical professionals to give proper and reasonable views which makes it fair to prevent advantages and disadvantages"

147,2023-05-15,CMV: Requiring Open Availability + Rotating schedule should have a mandatory penalty similar to overtime.,u/Cody6781,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13il7ke/cmv_requiring_open_availability_rotating_schedule/,changemyview,"Most retail stores ask or sometimes require open availability + rotating schedule. That means they can assign you work at any point during the 7 day week, and your schedule can change week to week. This is done for a few practical reason but also a few reasons that are just abusive, but regardless of the motivation the effect on the employee is

1. Very difficult to plan family/social time more than 1 week in advance
2. Very difficult/impossible to attend school to eventually leave the retail work
3. Very difficult to schedule interviews with other companies, making it harder to leave the retail work
4. In some cases leads to abusive schedules such 2, 8 hour shifts with only 8 hours between, which is not enough time to go home, shower, cook, eat, sleep for 8 hours, wake up, dress, and make it to work. 

I constitute the above reasons (and probably others I could list) as labor being performed outside of working hours. Specifically

1. 'Actual' labor of having to move plans around and forcing others to plan around you
2. Emotional labor of not knowing your schedule, leading to stress
3. Sleep deprivation (i.e. #4 from above list)

There are some practical benefits from the employer's perspective so banning it entirely is unfair, also it's not *that* bad so banning it seems unfair + over policing.  But the employees should be compensated for this and it should be disincentivized, the best way to achieve this is to enforce compensation via a system similar to the way Overtime works in most countries. (i.e. every hour worked over 8 hours is paid at an increased wage.

The specific policy I propose is:

>Employee + Employer negotiate a 40 hour + lunches availability at the time of hire. The schedule can be renegotiated later, but both parties must agree + sign relevant paper work. Any hour worked outside of that schedule must be paid 150% (""time and a half"") normal wage. If that time is also  Overtime pay, the total wage is (overtime pay + 50% of normal wage)"
0,2023-05-15,CMV: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is Overrated (The Movie),u/W_Anime,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13il7p3/cmv_harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban_is/,changemyview,"So, this has been a long time coming. I've been wanting to post my feelings in this film for a long time and I've been wanting to see if anyone can change my opinion on it. I've let my thoughts on this cook on this subject for a long time and I feel as though I'm finally ready to put my thoughts down and see if there's anyone that agrees with me, or heck if you don't please let me know too, I'd love to hear if you vehemently disagree with what I have to say here. This will not be a comparison with the book, although I will bring the book up more as an after-thought as opposed to the main bulk of this post.  


Firstly, I'd like to give you my impressions as to where I was at the time when I first saw Azkaban. I was about eight or nine years old and I was very much into Harry Potter. I loved the first two movies and I was eagerly anticipating the third film. I had not read the books at the time, but started to pick them up after Goblet of Fire. Basically, my first exposure to Harry Potter was the first two films, although my cousins who had read the books were giving me some information on what was happening in the books, albeit nothing major.  
  
Now let's get into it. Azkaban has always felt like a disappointment to me, even from such a young age. I keep hoping that someday I'll be able to look on it as the masterpiece the rest of the world does, but it never has. In fact it gets worse as I get older.  
  
I have always hated the pacing and plotting of the film. The majority of the film is spent on Harry and his friends worrying over Sirius Black hunting him down, or at least that's the main plot-point kicking off the entire film. In between that the film seems to stall itself, exploring disconnected vignettes that feel so small on scale that they come across as completely irrelevant and when its revealed later on that Sirius was not a threat all along and Pettigrew is haphazardly revealed to be the real culprit who betrayed Harry's parents in a scene that is so rushed and executed dreadfully, it feels so anticlimactic. I remember being incredibly confused the first time I watched this scene, so much that the rest of the film just falls apart. I honestly can't believe they decided to include such a badly written scene, the scene should have been rewritten in a few more drafts because the final scene is awful. In the book the scene is given much more room to breathe and all the plot points are developed (somewhat) very well and yes I know, the movie can't imitate the book a hundred percent, but I'm not asking for that, I'm asking for a well written scene, unfortunately the pacing and writing of the scene is very sloppy. Nothing in the film ever feels like it comes together naturally, say what you want about the first two films, but at least Columbus knew how to stick to the plot. I guess the director, Alfonso Cuaron was too distracted adding in pointless Shrunken Heads, Toad Choirs and cringey humour.  
  
The visuals feel cheap and dull. One of the absolute best praises the film gets is that the visuals are ""amazing"" and ""beautiful"". I don't see it. The colours are so drab and grey, it feels as though I'm not watching a movie at all, maybe a student film, but not something that is supposed to look like a big budget film. Could it have killed Cuaron to add in some colour here or there? This is a magical world after all, which brings me to my next point, these dull colours make the ""magical"" world feel so drab and plain, almost as if it isn't even another world at all. Hogwarts is meant to be a place of escapism, something lying just beyond the boundary of the regular world, here Hogwarts looks like any old castle, it doesn't feel magical, it doesn't feel welcoming and that's the point, Hogwarts is supposed to feel magical, whimsical, like a warm embrace. I don't want to step anywhere near Cuaron's version of Hogwarts, it doesn't like a place I would actually like to be, which is the entire point, Hogwarts is the only place Harry feels at home. The visual discrepancies also extend to the special effects. While the Dementors look pretty good, even today, the other effects look very subpar, especially the Werewolf, which looks hilarious. I never found it scary or intimidating, just funny. It looks like a furless cat with an oversized dogs head on it.  
  
The tone is all over the place. Another praise the film gets is that it is dark and mature, again I don't see it. Sure, the film may look dark, but tonally it doesn't feel at all scary or tense to me, keep in mind I was around eight when I first saw this film, I was the prefect age for the film, this isn't me judging the film as a jaded adult, even as a kid, the film felt very uneven. It tries to make you take it seriously with Dementors, Werewolves, talks of betrayal, the grey visuals and yet it also feels the need to include awful slapstick such as the Whomping Willow scene, the awful Monster Book of Monsters or the cringey invisible Harry scene which feels ripped straight out of Home Alone. Speaking of the Dementors, everyone loves to comment on how scary and terrifying they are, I guess I just be the bravest person ever (I'm not) because they never seemed to be a threat to me. They are slow, easily repelled and even if they step out of line, Dumbledore can just send them off easily. Compare that to the Basilisk from Chamber of Secrets, a creature that can move throughout the castle undetected, kill you with a single glance from its eye and is so secretive no one knows it's even a Basilisk for the majority of the film. Sorry, but the Dementors feel like an nonthreat to me for the majority of the film.  
  
The score is unmemorable. Another praise is that the score is, not only the best in the Harry Potter series, but is one of John Williams best scores of all time. I beg to differ. I hate saying this about a John Williams score, but most of the score is completely unmemorable to me. It's not bad, but it never becomes so wholly engrossing or engaging to me. Most of the music feels like leftover tracks that never made it into any of John Williams' other scores. The main problem is that none of the music feels like it has an identity of its own, nothing about it screams Harry Potter to me, the only time it ever comes close to feeling like a Harry Potter score is the scene where Sirius flies away on Buckbeak, apart from that I never find myself even remotely humming any of the music from this film. Compare that to the iconic Hedwig's theme or any of Williams' other themes and it just falls short.  
  
I genuinely feel that most of the praise this film gets is contributed mostly just to the name attached to the director, Alfonso Cuaron. I very much believe most people going to see this film for the first time had an expectation with Cuaron's name attached to it, as if his name is some foreseen seal of quality and they only saw what they wanted to see with this film, fortunately I was a young kid at the time, not stricken by premeditative bias and just wanted to see a good Harry Potter film at the time and had no knowledge of the director nor did I care and saw the film for the mess it always has been. I'll admit I have not seen all of his movies, but I have seen a majority of them and the only ones I genuinely like are A Little Princess and Children of Men, but he almost always comes across as a style-over-substance director, with the characters and story taking a backseat to the visuals. This is just incompatible with Harry Potter. The characters always came first with the incredible world and settings being a nice cherry on top of what was a great cast of characters. After reading the books this became even more apparent."

I write this because people keep complaining about Disney and Microsoft buying other companies and calling them monopolies in a content sense. To me the problem is that even if Disney bought every other studio other movie studios would be started. It's impossible for one company to serve all content nuches and thus their will always be holes in the market for others to fill. But I'm open to someone proving me wrong."

I'm not going to use Lenin's definition, because it was clearly manipulated into his favor. Imperial acts have *always* been done because the imperialist had power, it didn't matter whether it's a capitalist, socialist, or any other ideology. There are many example throughout history of states committing imperialist acts, regardless of ideology. A good example is the Ottoman Empire, it was neither socialist nor capitalist, yet it expanded like crazy during its rise.

Let's remember that imperialism has predated most of modern day economic systems, including both capitalism and socialism, so there probably would have little to no direct connection between imperialism and modern ideologies.

Edit: OK, let me be a little more clear on my position, what I mean is that states with power will be imperialistic will happen regardless of ideology. It doesn't matter whether it's socialist, or capitalist or anything else, if they had power, they will commit imperial acts. "

547,2023-05-16,"CMV: (high-speed) Train travel is almost always better than air travel in distances less than 1,500 km",u/ConsCom1949,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13j7c19/cmv_highspeed_train_travel_is_almost_always/,changemyview,"Why I said ""almost"": there are exceptions like (1) the air ticket is super cheap on that day or (2) you have an absolute emergency and every second counts or (3) you have train-phobia or something, but such extreme cases are pretty rare.

CLARIFICATION: If there is no direct rail link or only low-speed train then air travel is probably better beyond 500 km. I mean when there is a high (>285 km/h top speed or >200 km/h including stops) speed train running between the cities. 

**Reason 1: the speed factor**

**DELTA** I can't assume 280 km/h including stops when the fastest train including stops is 311 km/h in China. 220 km/h is more realistic for most cities. So that reduces the advantage distance of high speed train to 1,100 km or something. But if it's 1,500 km and you are okay to spend a couple extra hours it's still better to take the train because of the confort, economy and environment factors. 

**DELTA** Not every airport is located far from the city and not every airport have strict or even harsh security checks 


Let's assume it's 1,500 km. 

High speed train: maximum 350 km/h, let's assume it's 280 km/h when accounting for stops. So it will be 5 hours and 20 minutes.

From home to train station: 30 min

Waiting for the train: 20 min

From train station to the city: 30 min

Total time: 6 hours and 40 minutes

Flight: 1,500 km usually takes 2 hours.

From home to airport: 1 hour

From airport to taking off (checking in, boarding, taxiing etc): 1 hour and 30 min

Actual flight: 2 hours

Waiting for luggage: 30 min

From airport to the city: 1 hour

So it's 6 hours in total. Almost the same as train travel. So anything below 1,500 km is a win for the train. 

**Reason 2: The Comfort Factor**

Economy class plane seats are cramped

You can't use your phone during take off and descend and landing 

You can't move around when there is a disturbance or weather

Your ears hurt during take off and landing and personally that's a big problem for me

On a high speed train you can work, play, eat, do everything, even lay down and sleep if it's a sleeper. You can also watch the scenery, while all you get to watch is clouds on a plane.

Airline delay rates are close to 40% but trains are 95~99% punctual in China where I live but IDK whether plane delays are such a big problem in Western countries 

**Reason 3: The Money Factor**

**DELTA** Trains can be ridiculously expensive depending on the country and line. 

Train tickets cost roughly the same as airline tickets but it's because of low taxes of airlines and subsidies. When we move that from the equation, train travel is about 40% cheaper than air travel. 

Also, air ticket prices skyrocket during peak days and for last minute purchases, while train tickets usually have a fixed price and free or low cost cancellations.

**DELTA** Filthy rich people can have private jets which is a massive win over trains. But filthy rich people principlely shouldn't exist...

**Reason 4: The Carbon Factor**

Train travel has a carbon emission of about 5%~20% of air travel depending on the source. IDK the number for sure but certainly it's a lot more environment friendly than air travel.

**Reason 5: The Flexibility Factor**

Almost every medium-sized city in Japan or China or Germany has a train station. Not many have airports.

0,2023-05-16,CMV: Romantic relationship is redundant if you've found satisfaction in being single.,u/PlaneQuit8959,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13jbbd7/cmv_romantic_relationship_is_redundant_if_youve/,changemyview,"I believe most of you now have read/heard of the statement ""You need to be happy yourself before you find a partner."" I 100% believe that statement, because ONLY you are responsible for your own happiness. Sure being in a relationship does bring the comfort/stability/happiness that you want, but often times, people are rushing to be in a relationship because of multitude of reasons:-

* Being in a relationship is the ""default"" thing that your society/friends/family expected you to do once you're at a certain age. It's akin to college - your family/friends have this default expectation that you would graduated from college in your 20's because that's what others are doing.
* Relationships are being highly romanticized especially in books/movie. Especially true in social media. We're seeing the highlight reels of others who have achieved stability (seemingly) in relationship and are posting their fun moments on Instagram, but we don't know how much of time & effort were spent on taking that relationship into the next level. Or even if the couples are honestly happy, or merely posting their photos just for the sake of it.

Those above are just some of the main reasons on why people wanna be in a relationship. Again, back to the statement of ***""You need to be happy yourself before you find a partner.""*** \- I really believe in it. However, there's only 1 thing that bugs me about it and I question myself:

    If you've already achieve happiness & contentment in being single, then why bother finding a relationship? It's already redundant at this point.

I'm sure others have thought about this to a certain extent; we want to be in relationship because it makes us feel good (seemingly). We have someone around us, lessen the burden of managing/doing tasks, and even potentially improves our emotional health. But all these are **dependent** on the type of relationship that we have. If we have good partners/relationships, the results will be good. Vice-versa.  
  
I bolded the word **dependent**, because I personally feel that if you've spend all those years working on being self-sufficient financially, emotionally, then why are you still searching for the risk of potentially being hurt again by getting into a relationship? 

It sorta doesn't make any sense to just throw away the self-reliance and independence that we've learned by being at peace with our own, and then proceeded to wanna find someone out there just to be our other half. We could get hurt again if we're with a negative partner, and that would just puts us back into square one.  
  
In a nutshell:- If a person is content by him/herself, then he/she should just outright avoid relationship, period. I'm interested in reading your thoughts about this."
0,2023-05-16,CMV: Jiu Jitsu is largely a scam,u/CafeConLecheLover,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13jbkdx/cmv_jiu_jitsu_is_largely_a_scam/,changemyview,"I've been practicing Jiu Jitsu for a couple years now and have routinely been unable to shake the idea that Jiu Jitsu, while it does have some clear benefits, is in many ways a scam.  

I'm genuinely interested to hear from people who have been practicing it for longer, or are a higher belt, etc, because I think the ideas of self-defense and discipline are extremely important and valuable regardless of where they come from. 

Below are the primary reasons to back up my claim in no particular order:

&#x200B;

Reason #1: The business model. 

Gym fees are outrageously high compared to what you are getting.  To put this in comparison, let's look at a comparable non-martial arts gym. Equinox (a ""luxury"" gym and fitness center) offers weights, classes, nutrition, coaching, some combat sports, and more, for \~$170/month. The cheapest I've ever seen a BJJ gym cost was \~$150, after a student or military discount. In my experience, the average cost for BJJ is about $175/month but in many cases is above $200/month. Disclaimer: I'm not an Equinox member and mostly use a home gym I made.

While this may be a product of supply/demand, at the end of the day, what you are paying for with a BJJ gym is the knowledge. Most BJJ gyms have a mat and some free weights, and if they also teach boxing, Muay Thai, or MMA they'll have heavy bags, sparring gear, etc, as well. While I do understand different people value different things out of gyms, the idea of paying $200 for any gym is simply way too high compared to what you receive.

The length it takes to get belts is the other side of the coin here - I do get that it takes time to achieve anything worthwhile, however it seems a little weird considering that there is a profit to be made here. If I'm a gym owner, I have a vested interest in maximizing the money I'm making, and the logical way to do that is to keep students there for as long as possible. What made me start to think about this was when I overheard a student ask the professor when they would be promoted, and the professor responded with ""it's not something you should ask about"" or something like that. If you don't know what the timeline looks like, and you're paying regardless, then what expectation should the student have?

&#x200B;

Reason #2: The mentality the community views BJJ with, especially new people.

I'm not sure how this came about, but BJJ seems to be viewed by many people as the touch of death regarding self-defense. There appears to be this idea that if you train Jiu Jitsu, you're immediately a complete badass and capable of taking down any person regardless of size or abilities. I genuinely think that this false confidence people are adopting is going to lead someone to overestimate their capabilities and get hurt or worse. While I do think there is a huge advantage to knowing how to grapple in general (anyone who has rolled with a wrestler knows this), BJJ is not a one stop shop for self-defense and I think that this implication is leading people to start training with the expectation that they'll be ok with just that. 

  
Reason #3: The practicality of BJJ.

I'll be honest here and say that I might be wrong here because I haven't been training as long as others. I do think BJJ has its place in self-defense but what I see being taught in gyms appears to be geared more toward a competition or a sport than actual self-defense. If I get mugged, the last thing I'm doing is shooting for a leg lock or taking the fight to the ground. Ideally a combination of BJJ, boxing, etc is probably the best, but on a practical basis the last place I want to be is on the groud, especially if I'm with my loved ones. 

&#x200B;

I want to stress that I'm not hating on BJJ because I've met some incredibly high-quality people through the community and have very much enjoyed training, and don't intend to stop. There's just some parts that I can't reconcile, and Reddit seems to be good at showing why in some cases. I would love to hear about why I'm wrong here and any experiences people have had that show that."

My contention is that if you believe something is more tragic, then you have in mind what is less tragic. 

Is she right and I am not comprehending this correctly? If something is more, then for it to be more, doesnt something have to also be less?

To clarify this example is for an office type job. I am in school for graphics. If I was going on an interview and the interviewer is dressed like a slub wouldn’t that say something about how they conduct business or maintain the appearance of the company?


Let’s say I want to work for a gaming company. Why should I have to come to the interview dress like a secretary and the interviewer is in a Graphic t-shirt, jeans, shaved and dyed hair and covered in tattoos. Wouldn’t it make since to look like you belong there.  Would you hire someone to do tattoos if they had none? Would you hire someone to do your makeup that never wears makeup? If I came into a gaming company wearing a shirt with a popular game on it wouldn’t that say hire me because I’m familiar with the companies games. 


I have been on two interviewer where both interviewer were dressed on old shorts, jeans and t shirts. I’m sitting there in a blouse, pencil skirt, and ballet flats. Yeah I know ballet flats and pencil skirts are out of style this was about a year or two before the pandemic. It’s always been stated to dress up for an interview to show you take the work seriously. Tell me if you saw an interviewer dressed like he was about to go do gardening or go on a jog would you think by looking at them they take their job seriously or care about the company they work for?

I know I have said this in other post but if they are cool with me doing the job in jeans, a t-shirt and pink hair why should I have to show up looking like I’m about to do their taxes?"

I think if you use bodily autonomy as a basis for “normal” abortion then you are also saying that elective abortion is morally justifiable at any point during the pregnancy. 

A fetus is not meaningfully sentient at any point during pregnancy. Drawing the line at some week is just arbitrary and based on cultural norms and the fact that a late term fetus looks like a baby, meaning you have to confront what you’re actually doing. 

I don’t see any reasoning that satisfactorily explains why bodily autonomy cuts off at some point when there is still no sentience (the basis of the abortion rationale, it’s not a person, it’s just cells etc)

Here are the arguments to why

1. The food is almost the same anywhere you go in terms of taste

2. The classic McDonald’s smell is also the classic taste - they literally created a new taste cuz a lot of their food taste like McDonald’s it’s unique 

3. It’s literally everywhere and it’s always busy I have seen McDonald’s in some of the most isolated areas in the world. 

4. You know what your going to get, I have never been in a restaurant where I know exactly how the quality will be and that’s all restaurants from top flight ones like nammos and Zuma to kfc (cuz even kfc can give u a bad batch) 

5. Brand, always have commercials that make produce smiles it’s kid friendly adult friendly it’s price effective

6. Yes it is unhealthy but a good restaurant by the definition I provided doesn’t need to be healthy for it to be the best.

7. Taste and texture the food is phenomenal and the texture is extraordinary I mean the cheeseburger is confluent it’s the texture of a cake with the taste of a burger it’s just a real feat of human innovation. 

I really really love McDonald’s and for those you in the us I understand McDonald’s is not as tasty as it is for those of in Europe / Middle East 

I know I said the taste is the same, but in America the taste is the same all over America in Europe it’s the same all over Europe etc and the difference is negligible still. 

Also disclaimer I don’t work for McDonald’s and if it wasn’t so bad for me I would eat it 3 times a day 7 days a week. 

Right now I eat McDonald’s once every 2 weeks or so but I religiously wait for that day it’s usually one of my favorite days of the month"

At worse case complex life on earth will be destroyed and never recover either way, life won’t be worth living if it isn’t now.",u/Ok_Atyourword,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13k4no8/cmv_there_is_no_future_for_humanity_especially/,changemyview,"Pretty much every climate report from what I can see is bad news, with various levels of how fucked we are. I’ve come to the conclusion that as it is, the future I’m preparing for at least in this society is useless and there’s little hope for our civilization to make it past 2050.

There hasn’t been any meaningful reduction in fossil fuel emissions, and last year emissions peaked. And seeing as scientists say need to slash our fossil fuel intake by a considerable amount to even hope to keep global temperatures manageable, that seems unlikely without a straight up global revolution- which will A. Never come and B. Probably make things worse for life on earth. 

That leads to best case scenario; societal collapse. Humanity survives in smaller numbers, either eventually dying out due to a nail in the coffin, or we just go back to how we were back in the stone ages. 

That means the end of the internet modern medicine and anything remotely good about modern life. Technology ceases to exist. They don’t prepare students for that future. And even this best case scenario in like 2030-2050 the future isn’t one worth living in. 

The worst case scenario (and probably what will happen anyways in a hundred or so years at worst) is earth becomes completely barren and intelligent life ceases to exist even if we magically stopped emissions today, we’re still completely fucked it’s just longer-term. 

We’re already likely gonna warm a few degrees no matter what we do, and that will be enough to trigger a tipping point from which there’s no return and the earth gets stuck in a feedback loop from which we never recover- planet turns to Venus. And checkmate. (Also societal collapse along the way) we’ve probably hit a tipping point already, and if not yet, then this El Niño’s summer will do the job and the planet will be a hellscape 100 years from now. 

Rewilding, ocean cleanup, conservation won’t mean shit if the entire biosphere collapses, which is probably not a matter if but when. Even the good news we get is torn apart by commentators. There isn’t one good technological advancement that hasn’t been debunked.

Add the other things, like ocean acidification, deforestation, species loss at an alarming rate, and other non climate related threats that will worsen because of the climate collapse, and the fact that no meaningful change has happened (and even if it did it would be too late) I don’t see any point in things like education or planning for the future. 

All those things will be obsolete within a few generations do to the biosphere collapse. I want to be wrong though, I want hope for the future. 

I’ll add that I’m no climate scientist, and I’m a teenager with already existing anxiety who’s been fueled a lot by what you could call “doomerist” comments and posts online, but so far every argument I’ve seen has been appealing to emotion, not debunking the worst of my conclusions about the future of society, the human species, or even life on earth. 

So if anyone who knows what they’re talking about wants to prove me wrong about my predictions for the future, cmv."

Ukraine was attacked in an unprovoked and unjustified invasion. They are justified in fighting back to regain all of their territory, and as long as they are committed to that, the US should not pressure them to a negotiated peace in which they would need to concede anything. 


Ukraine is a sovereign country, and none of its action warrants Russia’s aggression. Russia does not get a say in other countries’ affairs. 

Besides unjust, a negotiated peace in which Ukraine has to make concessions will likely embolden Russia to just strike again later.

 If Ukraine wants to negotiate, that’s fine, it’s their country, and their call but NATO should not pressure it to do so. So far, both Ukraine’s leadership and people are firmly against anything other than reclaiming all their land. 

The defense of a young democracy in Europe fighting an invading authoritarian state is in the US’s best interests because:

1. It is in defense of the rules based order the US has worked to establish. One of the key tenants being “wars of conquests don’t pay”

2. It is good to assist Ukraine, a democracy and a US partner (but not ally). The US is morally in the right and reassuring our Allies. 

3. We are degrading a strategic competitor at a bargain by supporting Ukraine while not losing any NATO troops. 


Also, when I say negotiations, I mean ones geared at concretely ending the war. Things like prisoner swaps or the grain deal, while important, are not aimed at ending the war and are not included in this."

It's very reminiscent of schools telling kids if they're being bullied to report it and not defend themselves.

At what point are these rules like ""dont call someone out for lying or arguing in bad faith"", "" Any rude language is banned"", or ""No arguing"" simply stopping people from defending themselves, especially in subreddits where the mods dont tend to  anything when instances of rule violations in the original manner occur but the responses are taken down?

I just don't see how this is productive but maybe im either over thinking this or projecting?

Edit: To be clear, im not saying subreddits shouldn't have any rules. Im specifically talking about opinion based/ conversation based subreddits having rules that limit your ability to communicate disliking something someone is saying to you.

Edit 2: I dont mean to edit so much so im sorry if this is annoying. Just wanted to clarify my position one more time; Subreddits shouldn't have rules that stop you from calling out negative behavior. It's not conducive to a productive conversation.

I don't believe this precludes me from engaging in systems that currently exist, whether they be voting or investing, etc.  
  
However, the notion of ""public companies"" particularly rubs me the wrong way because these companies are not actually ""public"" — ownership is limited to the ""shareholder"" class and very few have the ability, knowledge, and access to investing to become shareholders in companies. I do appreciate that ""public"" companies can provide us with *some* conception of collective ownership, but I feel like attempts to engage and activate shareholders to make change within companies is futile at it's worst and an uphill battle at it's best.  
  
Have companies actually shown that they would change their culture and practices due to collective shareholder activism? Are there clear examples of companies changing because of coordinated action from everyday people acting as shareholders? Or are there any signs that it's even possible?  
  
To be clear, I don't feel like I have to choose between ""revolution"" and ""reform"", because I don't believe it has to be either/or. I feel cynical believing that these efforts (i.e. of shareholder activists) are misguided!

818,2023-05-17,"CMV: A time traveler from the Middle Ages would have the hardest time adjusting to social, not technological, differences",u/Swipey_McSwiper,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13kga3p/cmv_a_time_traveler_from_the_middle_ages_would/,changemyview,"This is in response to questions I've seen posted in various forums and so forth where people ask what the biggest adjustment would be for someone from the Middle Ages, or Ancient Egypt, or whatever long-distant time period landing in 21st century New York, London, or Tokyo. The most common answers are invariably technological in nature. Smart phones. Airplanes. Cars. Televisions. Medical technology.

While many of these would be challenging, I submit that social changes that have occurred over the last several centuries would be even more challenging, as they would require understanding a whole different social context that the time traveller would not have had access to. Examples:

* **Nearly everyone can read.** And getting around in society means reading almost constantly in a way that no one finds especially spiritual or remarkable. Most people receive most information in written rather than oral forms. Someone coming from an oral culture would likely find it extremely difficult to get used to receiving  *and trusting* information delivered any other way.
* **Women live alone without husbands or parents.** And this is totally normal and not at all scandalous. It's hard to overcome social assumptions from your own time. As a parallel, imagine zooming 600 years into the future to discover that being a virulent racist is not only acceptable but considered admirable. Adjusting to that mindset would be extremely difficult—and perhaps impossible—for many people.
* **Laws apply to everyone uniformly within a certain region.** There aren't different laws for different kinds of people (in theory at least), and the same laws apply to beggars on the streets as well as to the leaders of the country.
* **...But they only apply up to a certain line, beyond which different laws apply.** Territoriality as we think of it is a modern invention. A time traveller from the Middle Ages would understand the concept of being constrained by laws based on group membership *no matter where you physically happen to be*. The idea that some laws cease to apply because you've crossed an imaginary line would be hard to fathom. And those lines are *extremely specific,* not just a general zone or area.
* **People think of people who look different from them as belonging to a different ""race"".** Obviously a medieval person would be familiar with the idea of different languages and different ""nations"", but the modern idea of phenotypic race was born around the end of the 17th century, hundreds of years after the Middle Ages. And the notion that different characteristics and capabilities could be attributed based on those ""races"" is even more recent than that. The time traveller would be even more confused by the idea that we organize huge swathes of our society around that made-up concept.
* **Money is paper backed by debt. And usually it's not even paper; it's just a ledger entry.** The thing you exchange for goods and services does not itself have any value. It's just a token in a complex global record-keeping system that keeps track of who owes what to whom. You never have to ""settle up."" Everyone just keeps making changes in the debt ledgers forever until they die.

I'm leaving out a couple of obvious issues: language and disease. Clearly, a time traveller from hundreds of years ago would not be able to speak a modern language nor would they have immunity to many modern diseases. These are true but these strike me as being so basic as to be uninteresting to think about.

**EDIT:** Whoa, this really blew up more than expected. A couple of clarifications:

* This post is not about arguing that one time or place is somehow better than some other time or place. All I'm trying to do is contrast the difference between adjusting to *social* changes vs. adjusting to *technological* changes.
* I accept that I focused too much on the Middle Ages (whatever that is exactly). I was using that as an example, but tried to make it general in the original post by saying ""someone from the Middle Ages, or Ancient Egypt, or whatever long-distant time period"". In other words, the point was not to get hung up on the details of the Middle Ages, per se, but to use that as an example of someone who would have to make a big cultural adjustment. But that may not be a valid form of argumentation."

Labor doesn't intrinsically create value. If you sit in your backyard all day picking up a rock and then putting it down, you've done a lot of labor but have created no value. If you work in a factory lifting a gear and putting it into a clock you have created some value.

I can think of a lot of people that I would say are objectively homophobic and I can DEFINITELY think of people that are objectively transphobic. However, I know of many people that may have opinions and views about people I disagree with, but I don’t believe they are pieces of shit because they still treat everyone equally regardless.

I don’t think we should ban views that are inherently racist, homophobic, etc and I think people generally overreact and immediately call that person an absolutely awful person when in my opinion they only become a horrible person when they display actions that would be discriminatory or hateful.

Say someone has the opinion of “I think black people should be segregated”. Now is that sick and twisted? Sure. But let’s say that same person, although they do believe that, they understand the society we are in and their actions would display that they treat everybody equally. They are racist at heart but they haven’t done any THING hateful, so to me they are not an absolutely horrible person until they commit a hate crime.

You see this a lot with transphobic people, which there are plenty of on the right. Many people I believe to be transphobic are transphobic but they’re also respectful to all people, they just have their views, which again I believe until they’ve committed some sort of hateful ACTION they are not a terrible person.

So overall, you see any type of discourse with people who have -ism beliefs being completely banned and cancelled when I don’t really agree with that at all. I don’t think being a racist, homophobe, transphobe, etc inherently makes you a terrible person, I think when your actions reflect your thoughts that’s when the line is crossed and you are a truly bad person. Therefore, I think hate speech shouldn’t be censored unless it’s harassment of a specific person and I don’t think having objectively discriminatory opinions alone makes you objectively bad."

1-Christianity was not an minority religion and was not sythematicay persecuted like their supporters argumented
In depth response:Okay,Hold to this one, i’m not implying that it was peaceful and flowers, But the idea that christianity was systematically persecuted over the whole empire was an complete nonsense,The christian movement has empirical evidence that was well large and structured and had some influence in the society around them,so they were not the victims that they painted to be, so this led me by the second point:

2-The idea of marthydom,Alright this is an more complex one,The idea of marthydom was completely overrated,most of these stories was written by the christian themselves who painted an more dark vision that was really was the reality,Some evidences suggest that early christian lived some peaceful and tranquili lives with relative tolerance to others,but most christians liked to painted this idea to paint an virtuous ideal(For some sources on this one i suggest an really good book called the myth of marthydom by candida Moss)

3-Now we are going to an more radical idea,That christianity is really the responsible for weakining the roman empire.

We know that an belief can change and influence the world for the best or for its worst(Nazism maybe the more influential that people think), But really christianity with their passive ideal and “ universal brotherhood “ actually weakened the roman society and culture and maked more vulnerable to external threats,the roman society was an militaristic and really patriotic one, when the idea that individual sacrifice was more important than protect and zeal for the state, in an ancient violent world this was an recipe for disaster,they make people passive and tamed in a really cruel and violent world.

0,2023-05-18,CMV: BMI is essentially a meaningless heuristic for adiposity and health.,u/SoigneeStrawberry67,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13kowfl/cmv_bmi_is_essentially_a_meaningless_heuristic/,changemyview,"Where to begin? I've flip flopped on this issue hundreds of times myself - I couldn't seem to bring myself to a coherent position - but my current understanding of BMI is that it is mostly arbitrary and useless as a heuristic for adiposity and health.

I don't think I need to reiterate the usual arguments about how pro footballers are classified as obese, because those are trite. My conjecture is that any active man who is well nourished will eventually become overweight over the course of his lifetime, unless he participates in some sort of sport or activity that is more catabolic than not (running based sports, endurance sports, weight sensitive sports, etc). This occurs simply because the high levels of testosterone, IGF, and other anabolic hormones in his blood promote gradual accrual of muscle and growth and strengthening of bones over time, and of course, modern caloric abundance to fuel it. I'm not exactly certain of whether it's the same for women, but given that athletic women accrue 75-80% as much muscle as athletic men, it's probably very similar.

This is the main pitfall of BMI. It was created to describe the average (sedentary) man [in 1800s Belgium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4890841/). Sedentary people naturally have low amounts of muscle mass due to lower circulating levels of anabolic hormones. Try to induce greater anabolism by force feeding a sedentary person and they just become insulin resistant - so there's an obvious need to keep them trim! However, being physically active is an easy way to break the cycle. Excess calories go to productive uses.

Simply put, the formula on its own says nothing about health. There's also the problem that the formula relies on height squared instead of height times width (waist circumference?) which means that tall people will have disproportionately high BMIs and short people will have disproportionately low BMIs.

There's some other anthropometric characteristics that might skew BMI. Let's consider a sedentary population in this hypothetical. Given that natural muscle accrual is largely [linked to bone density](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/99/1/30/2836155?login=false), we would expect people with thicker, denser bones to generally have higher BMIs, because they have more muscle mass. Indeed, in the real world, we see that wrist circumference correlates with BMI (r\~=0.4). Obviously, most obese people are obese, but there will necessarily be a significant degree of confounding misclassification of overweight people, since most of them simply have larger frames than thin people. That's all BMI really is, it's the rawest, most stripped down measure of how thick or thin someone's body is.

Currently, [33% of normal weight individuals](https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo201617), 50% of overweight individuals, and 29% of obese individuals are classified incorrectly by BMI according to health metrics. That's 75 million Americans, or around 1 out of every 3 adults. If we exclude extraneous variables and make the determination solely based upon relative fat mass, then [48%(!!) of non-obese women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3317663/) are actually obese according to body fat percentage. I'm not very comfortable with a classification system that misclassifies a plurality of overweight people by one metric *and then* also misclassifies a near equivalent percent of ""healthy people"" by another! This isn't just an isolated health statistic either. It has downstream effects on health insurance premiums and coverage. Given that poor people are more likely to be classified as overweight or obese, this has obvious classist implications.

There's also notes of racial discordance here. BMI was created based on data from white Europeans, for white Europeans. There was, and continue to be, no adjustments for racial differences in predicted risk of T2DM & heart disease from BMI. Southeast Asians, owing to their considerably lighter frames, have a science based [normal weight cutoff of around 23 BMI](https://web.archive.org/web/20061210180811/http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/bmi_asia_strategies.pdf) and an overweight cutoff of 24-25!. The overweight cutoff on the other hand is highest in whites (30) and lower in blacks (28) and other east asian populations (27). Though, the difference between whites and blacks is likely due moreso to socioeconomic factors, given that the racial disparity in BMI cutoffs [disappears in british blacks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8208895/) and both black and white populations have very similar anthropometric measurements.

BMI cutoffs used to be at least marginally more science informed in the US. The BMI cutoff for overweight classification was once 28 (the point at which risk for T2DM rises significantly), until it was changed on [account of European lobbying](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4890841/). Guess they couldn't deal with how we transcended their beauty standards.

\^ I want to touch that a bit more because I think it's important. It's actually pretty hard to tell overweight people from normal weight people (disclaimer: am American). I could correctly identify the underweight, nearly obese, and obese people in [this album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/77367764@N00/albums/72157602199008819/), but I could not reliably differentiate an overweight person from a normal weight person. Most of the overweight people in this album still had a healthy body composition - unless they were mentioned as ""near obese"". Sure, they don't look like svelte Europeans, but they aren't fat.

And inb4 people start arguing about how more muscle technically puts more strain on your body and thus will still kill you faster - no it doesn't. When relative fat mass is accounted for, more LBM is not associated with an [increased risk of dying until LBM exceeds 90 kg](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6028901/figure/f1/). You'd have to be taking copious amounts of anabolic steroids or be morbidly obese to get to that level of lean body mass, so controlling for fat mass is meaningless at that point.

We can easily come up with better heuristics that measure adiposity. Even something as simple as waist circumference to height ratio would be better because it would inform us about whether you are thick or thin in the area that matters. Waist to hip ratio, 3 site skinfold calipers + waist circumference, inbody scales, and the navy body fat formula are all examples of cost effective heuristic tools for measuring body composition that would be more accurate/informative than BMI.

1,2023-05-18,CMV: Nate Shelley is getting the best possible ending on Ted Lasso,u/Subtleiaint,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13ku1n4/cmv_nate_shelley_is_getting_the_best_possible/,changemyview,"Cards on the table, this post is just an excuse to talk to people about Ted Lasso. I'll be discussing spoilers of the show up to episode 10 of the third season so, if you haven't watched it yet, stay away.  

We only have two episodes left of what is assumed to be the last season of Ted Lasso and it's fair to say that season 3 has been a bit rudderless. There's no central narrative that's really driving the show towards its conclusion. Instead we have a series of largely unconnected character threads that, whilst interesting in their own right, don't really add up to a cohesive show.  

One of these plots is about Nate Shelley, the wonder kid. Nate's story had been one of the most compelling in the show, the shy and awkward kit man who's talent was recognised and elevated by Ted but who was then brought down, personally at least, by his insecurity.   
In season 3 Nate had been on his own journey, professionally he's been hugely successful but he's come to recognise the toxic situation he's found himself in and, in episode 10, he escapes from it. Watching the show casually it's all a bit anticlimactic, Nate has barely interacted with any of the other principal characters all season and the undoing of his heel turn in season 2 has been undramatic, he's just become nice again.  

I was disappointed with this, I wanted Nate to hit rock bottom, to realise how awful he'd been and come back to Ted to apologise in a explosive and cathartic moment in the finale. But then I realised this is what a normal show would do and that Ted Lasso is not a normal show.  Other shows are all about the drama but Ted Lasso often goes out of its way to avoid the drama, it's all about resolving problems and personal growth. Ted Lasso doesn't fix everyone around him, he'd kind, decent and believes in people, those people then fix their situations themselves. We've seen this happen over and over again and that's what's happened in season 3 with Nate.  

Early on in season 3 Nate wants to talk to Ted to try and build bridges but the show gets in the way and the moment doesn't happen. Instead Nate is left on his own to deal with his situation. He slowly comes to realise that the success and plaudits he craved are not what matters, it's genuine and honest relationships that matter. He comes to realise who his new boss really is and he rejects that person. It's a huge moment of personal growth and it's the final stage before he becomes the best version of himself. It's a perfect ending to his story, Ted has not fixed Nate, he's just been the support and influence that's allowed Nate to flourish.  

Season 3 is, in many ways, the perfect culmination of the story Ted Lasso is trying to tell. It comes across as disjointed and fluffy because it's not adhering to normal dramatic conventions (most of the time at least, I thought Roy and Keeley weren't going to get back together). Am I right? Is season 3 the perfect conclusion or am I just making excuses for a show I really want to like?"

In the US, the really strong immigration laws are just barely less than 100 years old, and this was after the constant scares of Asian and Irish/Italian immigrants during the 1800s, so it came after all that, not in response to it. It seems like even the racist people of old understood that it was someone’s freedom to migrate to another country, even if they personally disagreed with them doing so. Of course, this doesn’t just apply to the US; any stable country that isn’t based in extreme nationalism shouldn’t have a problem with immigrants.

If immigrants aren’t paying taxes, then that’s a separate crime entirely. If they are uneducated in general or in the civics of the country they entered or are unproductive, most countries already have plenty of those people and are getting by just fine. If they aren’t obeying the rule of law, that’s why we have police forces. Every problem with immigrants isn’t unique to them.

Everything about illegal immigration as a concept circles back to race and nationalism somehow. At the very least, I don’t see why this isn’t true in countries with effective governments and stable economies that can support more people suddenly entering them. It does make sense that this would lead to problems in places that are built on a nationalistic foundation or places with unstable regimes, but nationalism doesn't have a great track record at this point. Individuals can believe what they want, but collectively, we can take the ego hit, right?

I just don’t understand why simply entering and trying to live in a country should be a crime, but this is such a widespread idea that I feel there has to be more to it than your standard garden-variety human tribalism.

Note, I’m not saying anything about the path to citizenship and how hard it should be."

I still hold this same view, but more and more things are making me think that I may be wrong.

**Disclaimer: I am not talking about, or trying to defend, US gun law, as that is a steaming pile of dogshit inside of a garbage fire inside of a trainwreck that I don't want to get into, simply because that topic is much more complicated than the view that I hold and want to challenge.**

For context: I am from the Czech Republic, a country where you can get a firearms license and buy almost any non-fully automatic firearm, but am not yet old enough to legally own firearms.

I personally believe that guns are very much like cars. Incredibly dangerous and capable of killing people, many people at once if used by someone especially violent, however, their ownership is important in the world that we live in.

Cars are obviously much more important, however, image someone walking home later in the evening at night. Maybe a bartender coming home from work, or someone that goes to the gym late in the evening going home, or a jogger that jogs in the evening and comes back home after dusk. 

There is a not insignificant (especially if the first case, due to the people that sometimes frequent bars) chance that you may be attacked/mugged. Maybe at knife point, maybe at gunpoint, or (as is most common in the Czech Republic), by several people that appear to be unarmed (and either are or just haven't drawn their weapons yet).

Obviously, any person with half a brain will realize that handing over their wallet or whatever the aggressor wants is the correct approach. Your wallet is not worth your life.

However, there is a miniscule chance that the aggressor still wants to attack you, even after you co-operate, or maybe, the attacker *just* wanted to attack you. This happens: The bartender pisses off someone because they stopped pouring them beer, the gym-goer gets into an argument with someone at the gym, or any other number of possibilities.

Now, what happens next?

If you are unarmed, you are basically out of luck. Unless somebody else sees you get attacked, you're either going to the hospital, or into the morgue. In either case, you basically cannot defend yourself. Even if someone calls the police, they aren't going to arrive on time, that just doesn't happen.

**Does a gun guarantee your safety? NO! Absolutely not. Does it give you a fighting chance? Yes. Yes it does.** 

And this is why I believe that people should have access to firearms. In those small, fringe cases where normal, law-abiding people are assaulted for some reason (hell, people have been shot because of their race, gender identity or sexuality before), they need to defend themselves, because the police won't be there in time.

&#x200B;

You may ask ""What about assault weapons, would a pistol be enough?"".

An assault weapon, while nice, doesn't really give someone with ill-intent more power. Hear me out: Pistols can be loaded with magazines that have 30-50 or even more rounds. These can be concealed well, are lighter and considerably cheaper. An assault rifle (like an AKM or any AR-15-esque weapon) is, effectively the exact same. 

A rifle is made to pierce armor, have more range, and a higher accuracy than a pistol. All 3 of these things don't really matter for someone in a civilian setting, because none of these ever come into play. This means that rifles are basically just fun guns to shoot at a range. They aren't practical, but neither is a massive Ford truck."

The easiest way to do that is to sell working rights.,u/HalfBlueCat1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13l7jo7/cmv_the_easiest_way_to_solve_the_illegal/,changemyview,"A lot of people are concerned about illegal immigration, particularly in the US. The easiest way to fix this issue is to make it easier to migrate legally, document immigrants, and allow them to become legal and tax-paying members of society.  


My suggested solution would be a fee based system, for example $10k + 1% extra tax give you a 5 year working visa, renewable indefinitely. It could be more, it could be less, but this is a win-win-win for migrants, locals, and governments.  


For those who think 10k is too much for people from poor countries, this problem could be solved either through loans (would be VERY easy to pay this back over 5 years), through other people paying (families or charities), or scholarship/bursary equivalents (no fees for people from very poor backgrounds, or very talented individuals).  


I believe a 10k fee would clean up illegal immigration quickly, as when given the choice, I feel that people would prefer to come in legally, allow them to be part of society, and contribute. This is true not just for migrants coming from the South, but also migrants from Europe and Asia who are highly skilled but find the migration process very cumbersome.   


Finally, this is a truly capitalist solution to a problem."

Anyways to the post:

A common one that easily gets people upset would be the protrayal of bipolar disorder. people get upset fast when a character with it lashes out violently or acts irrational. Im aware that its a super cliché

but it's a real thing that could happen in real life, so why is it wrong to show that side of the disorder in media?

nearly every disorder has a dark side to it, some ARE scary and some ARE dangerous. Disorders arent just ""Quirks"" as some people have, theyre serious problems.

I frimly believe that if media showed both the lighter/darker sides of disorders it would help die-down the romanticizing and tiktok-ization of disorders.

people never defend the protrayal of like drug addicts or alcoholism when theyre protrayed as dangerous or scary, even if not everyone with those problems act that way. People see those things as serious problems that need serious help, i believe we should do the same for disorders.

(To state i hold the same opinion for disablities like autism, ADHD, OCD exc: having watched the awful and downright creepy Sia movie

A lot of people went online to say that ""No one with autism acts like this"" which is false, some do so why is it wrong to protray the dark or ""Ugly"" side of disablities? (I'm not defending that shitty movie.)

**TL;DR:I am not saying we should villanize every person with a disorder in media but i am saying we should be allowed to protray the dark sides of disorder in media(correctly)**

Giving reparations to just one group when other groups were harmed too doesn't make sense, and the US cannot foot such a massive bill. (And I'm not talking about 5 million dollar payouts, I'm talking about far smaller amounts that reparations advocates call ""insulting."") And even if you only give Reparations to black citizens, there are significant budget constraints. 

From what I've seen, a common argument of pro-reparations people is ""ignore the budget do what's right."" But the budget dictates what can and can't be done. 

People are struggling, especially poor people, and a disproportionate number of poor people are African American. I believe part of the push for reparations is desperation and that if people weren't so desperate the conversation would fade. 

So I think, instead of paying one group huge sums of money, the US would be far better off using that money for social programs and services- especially given Republicans' recent threats to cut them. Reparations would benefit- in the short term, at most- 13% of US citizens, many of whom do not even need the money. Social programs can help everybody- or at least everybody who needs them.

16,2023-05-18,CMV: New White Collar Jobs Created from Disruption of Old Jobs Will be Fleeting,u/simmol,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13leswa/cmv_new_white_collar_jobs_created_from_disruption/,changemyview,"Many people are predicting that AI/automation will lead to disruption in many of the existing industries with jobs disappearing relatively soon.  I agree with this assessment.  However, others think that there will be new jobs created that we cannot forsee at the moment and will somewhat balance the destruction of the old jobs.  Here, I partially agree.  Yes, I do think that new jobs will be created.  However, I think these will be fleeing before they become automatized as well.  Here is my reasoning.

The current AI models can be trained with a large amount of dataset and this allows the models to handle tasks that pertain to human jobs.  Depending on the specific field, the AI model can do a very good job and replace few of these jobs immediately while in others, the AI does an ok enough job but isn't ready for deployment.  In the latter cases, there will be fine-tuned models and feedback loops that can enhance the performance for the AI models.  And there is an incentive for people to automate these industries as whoever invents these tools can profit immensely from automating away a lot of jobs.

So let's say that this type of workflow/model succeeds and many jobs as well as many industries are destructed.  What will inevitably happen is that new jobs will appear.  And the argument is that many of these jobs will (a) require humans and (b) be designed such that the best AI models won't be able to handle the tasks that pertain to doing these jobs.  So I will grant all these assumptions.  However, this is what will happen then.

If new jobs arise and become popularized, then there will be a lot of data generated regarding the tasks that pertain to the new jobs.  And inevitably, these data can be used to train the machine learning models to become better at these new jobs.  And once the performance of the AI increases, there will be a market to fine-tune/optimize the performance of these tasks and there is a very good chance that these new jobs will be automated away.

And this is a vicious cycle.  New jobs will be created and AI won't be able to do these new jobs as there isn't much data.  However, once the jobs become popularized, there will be a lot of data generated, which can be used to train the new AI models and these new jobs will disappear.  Repeat and rinse.  And given that AI models, GPUs, keep on improving the cycle time of new jobs arising and disappearing might become shorter and shorter.

p.s. I purposefully omitted jobs related to physical tasks because I recognize that physical labors are much more to replace with the current technology as well as an added hardware cost of a robot.  So if you try to make an argument that AIs won't be able to readily replace the new jobs that involve physical tasks, then I agree with you there.  But I am more focused on white-collar jobs for this CMV.

252,2023-05-19,CMV: High-speed sleeper train would be a viable and competitive alternative to flight and traditional sleeper train,u/ConsCom1949,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13lmm59/cmv_highspeed_sleeper_train_would_be_a_viable_and/,changemyview,"Define high-speed as a top speed of more than 200 km/h.

This proposal is internationally focused. Maybe Europe if we can get the multiple train companies in different countries to cooperate.

1. Speed

A 350 km/h high speed sleeper train that departs at 8 pm and arrives at 8 am can cover a distance of 3,600 km if the average speed is 300 km/h including stops.

A 250 km/h sleeper train can cover 2,400 km and a 200 km/h train can cover 1,800 km.

It saves precious daytime and provides a full night of sleep so the ""effective"" time wasted is shorter than flights because if you fly you either use day time or don't get sleep and become exhausted the day after. So it's effectively ""faster"" than flight in non-emergency situations because the seemingly longer travel time mostly overlaps with sleep.

2. Price

Beijing-Guangzhou 350 km/h sitting train: ¥965

Beijing-Guangzhou 310 km/h sitting train: ¥915

Beijing-Guangzhou 310 km/h sitting train, first class seat: ¥1465, business class seat: ¥2885

Beijing-Guangzhou 250 km/h sitting train: ¥709

Beijing-Guangzhou 250 km/h sleeper train: ¥1000~1150.

So the price of the sleeper high-speed train is 1.41~1.62 times that of a second-class seat of the same train and first-class seat is 1.60 times of the same train. Thus you get a 75*195 cm berth for the same price of a first-class seat which is only slightly wider than a second-class one, and you can't really sleep on it. Therefore a high-speed sleeper train would render the first-class seat obsolete.

Compared to airline: 

Economy class ticket: around ¥900

Business class ticket: around ¥1700

High speed sleeper train: ¥1000~1150

So a high speed sleeper train is only slightly more expensive than uncomfortable economy class travel and much cheaper than business class flights. It would provide a very viable alternative to passengers who value both comfort and affordability. 

In addition to standard berths, we can also add luxurious ones (wider bed and more privacy like a mini-hotel) for a higher price, and economy ones which are similar to ""hard sleepers"" in normal trains, for a 30% cheaper price. The economy ones would be cheaper than economy class flights, and even the luxury ones would be about the same price as business class flights. 

And what if you also count in the saved cost for a hotel room for the night? 

3. Comfort

A standard high speed sleeper berth is 75 cm wide and 190~195 cm long. It provides a fairly comfortable night of sleep. However you can't sleep on economy class (flight), second/first class (train) or even some business class flights that don't have fully reclinable seats and is usually only 60~70 cm wide.

The ""economy"" sleeper I proposed would be 65 cm wide and 190~195 cm long, with 3 layers of beds as opposed to 2. Yes it would be less comfortable than standard ones but it reduces cost by more than a third and you can still have a full night of sleep on it.

The ""luxury"" sleeper would be a capsule hotel, with a fully private space and a 90*195 cm standard single bed. It has basically the same level of comfort as very high-end business flights or standard first class flights, but much cheaper."

Tell me that doesn’t make perfect sense!

I am referring to sightings that don’t fit with these more mundane explanations and which cannot easily be proven to be hoaxes."

If it makes you feel good, great, but don't ever expect to get rich that way.

In most Batman canon, the writers actually accept this premise when they show Bruce as an old man; his methods have escalated to bend the rules more and more, and crime just keeps getting worse. In the media where he *does* make a difference like TDK trilogy, it's usually because the system gets its act together and is able to take control from him.

Either way, using real world examples, it seems to me that the countries that are ""toughest"" on crime (Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and The United States) all have the highest levels of crime compared to countries to have attacked crime at the root cause (Western European, Scandinavia, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, etc.) 

I'll admit that certain fascist regimes *on the surface* seem to be more efficient at eradicating crime quickly, such as Italy and the Sicilian mafia. But hopefully I don't have to argue of why embracing fascism is a viable long-term solution, such as Italy and the Sicilian mafia.

Overall, it seems if you deal with people's mental health, create a fair economy, create social safety nets, and offer free education and health services, you'll have much less crime than going down to the street level and beating up ever mugger you see."

9,2023-05-19,cmv: Lower the American drinking age to 18 or 19,u/Ok_Spell1407,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13m6ebb/cmv_lower_the_american_drinking_age_to_18_or_19/,changemyview,"Every young adult in America has the same frustration, that turning 18 isn't true adulthood. That is because the American government took away young adults' right to choose what to put in their body as a low effort solution to a complex problem. Yet, Americans 21 and over still overwhelmingly support keeping the drinking age that high, despite our law being an international outlier. My case for lowering it is fairly simple.

&#x200B;

1. Adulthood and freedom

I think the idea of someone being considered an adult while lacking certain adult rights is absurd. Why even consider me an adult if you're not going to let me choose whether or not to drink? The government really wants to tell me that they deem me responsible enough to own a gun, serve in the armed forces (possibly against my will if a war breaks out), serve on a jury (against my will), and sign legally binding contracts, but not to drink alcohol? Absurd. 

2. The age was raised as a low effort solution to a complex problem

Drinking and driving is a complex problem. I understand that young adults are more prone to doing it. However, there are other ways to do it that don't involve restricting society as a whole. Enhancing penalties, zero tolerance laws, and more enforcement are all much more effective solutions than raising the age. And these solutions are effective across all age groups, not merely young adults. Raising the age hardly even reduced teenage drinking, it simply forced it underground. Which brings me squarely to my next point. 

3. The impossibility of enforcement means the law is counterproductive

Instead of drinking be a rite of passage done legally and safely for young adults, as it is in almost every other western country, American young adults often experience their first drinks in unsafe environments, such as college hazing. Not only that, but adults who ""allow"" underage drinking also face punishment, which prevents responsible supervision by adults. Why not make it responsible and legal? Why expose so many people to unsafe situations and legal penalties for something that's inevitable anyways. 

4. The supposed ""benefits"" are exaggerated

You'll always hear about how raising the age lowered drunk driving fatalities dramatically. This point reduces meaningful discussion about lowering the age, as it makes supporters seem like they're willing to increase the rate of death just so young adults can drink. However, a closer look reveals that the decline in fatalities in the US in the late 80's and early 90's corresponded with a similar drop in countries like Canada and Australia that didn't raise the age. It may have corresponded to seat belt enforcement rather than raising the drinking age.

&#x200B;

So that's my take on it. Feel free to change my view."
0,2023-05-19,CMV: The future is sold off and we're all doomed,u/fieldsAndStars,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13m6j10/cmv_the_future_is_sold_off_and_were_all_doomed/,changemyview,"Birth rates are declining worldwide at an astonishing speed. To be able to sustain our current population there should be an estimated 2.1 births per woman. However, [we've been under](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?view=map&year=2021) the replacement level for quite some time now all over the globe (the only exception is Subsaharan Africa). Developed nations have been trying to cope with this shift by easing on immigration laws, however the number of immigrants has to be in the number of millions to be able to keep the economy afloat, and apart from the problematics regarding immigration, where the hell do you even get that number of people??? 

Now, social security and other policies have drastically increased the quality of life of the population, there's no doubt about that. However, to be able to keep the system running, the [(old age) dependency ratio](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.DPND.OL?view=map&year=2021) can't get too high, otherwise the whole thing collapses.

Due to the ratio rapidly increasing, countries have taken to selling bonds and other forms of debt to make up for the economic gap between production and spending. [We can already see](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS?view=map) that all nations (and especially developed ones) are in a tight spot, given that paying back any debt over 50% of GDP takes many years and reduces the economic activity drastically. The only other way that nations have of reducing their debt to GDP ratio is by inflating it away, which also incurs into great economic costs.

To sum it up, we're in a bad place right now, and it's certain that it's going to get much worse in the next 30 years. Economic output will stagnate if not decrease significantly, which will lead to a lower birth rate (basically a catch .22). To bring it down to earth, it means fewer jobs, people won't be able to buy houses anymore, less stability, and a lot more stress. Our only hope is an AI economy of sorts in the near future (which won't happen, I work in Industrial Automation and can vouch that that's at least 100 years away).

P.S.: The guy who's writing this is 25, has two engineering degrees, the best job his country's job market can offer, and yet can't get his own place because moving out of his parent's house would wreck his budget. This is officially the end guys."

0,2023-05-19,CMV: It's often objectively less effort and stress for everyone to leave cleaning dryer lint and clearing the microwave time for the next person.,u/BigMacDaddySupreme,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13mc3wt/cmv_its_often_objectively_less_effort_and_stress/,changemyview,"Pushing the microwave clear button falls into the same category as cleaning the lint from the dryer trap for me. Minimal effort, minimal time, pretty much the same every time. 

You will never be disappointed if you (not everyone, just you) focus on being OK with resetting the system to default before you use it and leave it however you want it. For example, I approach the dryer, clean out the last person's lint if there is any, use the dryer, leave my lint for the next person. 

If I use this method, I will never have to clean the lint twice. Hell, there may even be times when there is no lint for me to clean at the beginning (but if there is lint at the beginning, that's totes cool and expected). I will never have to ask anybody to follow my method for me to get these results, and therefore never be disappointed. I'm always guaranteed one or less lint cleaning. Plus people aren't annoyed with me for being ""bossy"" over something trivial. 

Any other method guarantees one or more lint cleaning fort me if there is anything less than 100% compliance. Other methods are literally more work and more disappointment. 

Same goes for clearing the time on the microwave. 

Obviously, there can be extenuating circumstances and a single philosophy can't account for everything. But under normal circumstances, I find this philosophy holds true for these and other trivial tasks. 

However, as the complexity and variability of the task increases, this philosophy applies less and less. If I have to wash the last person's dishes before I use them for my meal, there can be a big variation in how much work and time that might take depending on what kind of meal they ate. This leaves more room for people to fuck each other over. So best practice is for everyone to wash their own dishes and leave them clean for the next person. 

TL;DR It's less stress and work to not sweat the small stuff. For bigger things, leave stuff the way you found it.

Please respond as objectively as possible (no moralizing)and assume that trying to enforce compliance will never be 100% effective and will count as more effort expended and likely more stress for the enforcer and enforcee."

If your job at mcdonalds requires you to wear a regular shirt that says mcdonalds, you were gonna wear a shirt anyway so like just wear that one.  That's on your own time.

For context, I used to work at this factory that processed fish.  Butchering, freezing, cooking, you name it we did it.   

First thing, you have to stand in line and get a smock from some guy.  Then you go put on your special boots that never leave the factory, put on a hairnet and an apron, wash your hands, put in plastic sleeve covers, put on gloves, etc.... 

I believe these are all part of work.  It's required by the job, so it's work.   I wouldn't wear them normally and i have to get them at the job.  It's not like I can put this shit on at home on my own time.  I'm at the job, it's required, it's part of work, it should be paid.

Same as breaks.  Say it's a 15 minute break at 10:00 am.   I'm required to take a break, and I'm required to leave the production floor.   That takes me 1 minute, so my break doesn't start until 10:01.   I have to remove my gear and wash my hands extremely thoroughly.  That takes 4 minutes.  So my break doesn't start until 10:05.   At 10:20, when I walk back in and begin the process of putting my boots back on, I am ""back"" from work.   

Same with lunch.   Lunch break is at 12, I leave the production floor, remove my shit, clean up, THEN I clock out.  I come back, I clock in then put on my gear and wash up."

For this case I would put aside if it's ok to do it when you are in a relationship.

But everytime some people (usually women) post naked pictures or videos etc. everyones arguments are that they are loosing their dignity or that they have no values. But I think those are just empty arguments. Why are they loosing their dignity or values? Or how exactly? Why should showing something that we all know they have and we all know how it looks like should be something immoral?

Nowadays when prices are going up and everything wouldn't it be stupid tu refuse money just for showing part of your body? We aren't children to point at someone ""omg they are naked!"".

However as someone that doesn’t need a mental health companion just as many others don’t, dogs are stinky and they require much care. You have to walk them in the rain or the cold day and even late at night sometimes. Pee pads work but they stink up your place and are a mess. When you pet a dog, your hand then smells like the dog. And anyone who’s trained a dog knows how difficult it can be but it varies from dog to dog. Anyway my point is, they’re adorable little buggers but it’s possible that they can make your lifestyle a living hell. Oh and P.S. the barking… it can be nonstop and torturous"

40,2023-05-20,CMV: Just Stop Oil proposal of halting new fossil fuel licenses will not reduce global climate emissions,u/Adzadz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13n005f/cmv_just_stop_oil_proposal_of_halting_new_fossil/,changemyview,"Just Stop Oil Objective: To curb UK's climate emissions by advocating for a governmental commitment to stop issuing new fossil fuel licenses and halt production, which will in turn lower overall global climate emissions.

Premise 1: Given the current circumstances, it is improbable that the United Kingdom will be able to completely eliminate oil consumption in the near future. As a result, the UK will either have to produce its own oil or rely on imports.

Premise 2: While opting for domestic production might increase the United Kingdom’s carbon footprint, it does not necessarily exacerbate total global climate emissions. Importing oil merely shifts the carbon footprint to another country instead of eliminating it.

The issuance of new fossil fuel licenses and increasing production can stimulate job creation and foster energy independence. According to the first two premises, this would not cause an increase in overall global climate emissions.

There are other viable ways to decrease both the United Kingdom’s and the global climate emissions. These include transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency through methods like insulating buildings and using energy-efficient appliances, promoting the electrification of transportation, and endorsing sustainable agriculture and land use practices.

If the United Kingdom were to boost fossil fuel consumption in the energy sector for example, this would undoubtedly lead to an avoidable increase in global climate emissions. However, given the indispensable role of fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, licensing new fossil fuel projects does not inherently worsen global climate emissions, as the alternative would be to import oil. Therefore, our focus should be on finding and implementing sustainable alternatives to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels over time.

Edit 1:

**Argument 1: Reducing domestic production of oil, leads to an increase in price, which reduces demand therefore reduces global climate emissions.**

Technically correct however I don't believe this is the motive for Just Stop Oil's proposal, as this can be achieved by a carbon / fuel tax.

Edit 2:

**Argument 2: Increasing domestic production of oil, leads to a decrease in price, which produces a negative economic incentive to decarbonalise.**

This is a perspective that I overlooked, A responsible government can both license new fossil fuel production and pursue decarbonization at a rapid pace. This would involve policies that incentivize the transition to renewable energy, even in the face of lower fossil fuel prices, such as subsidies for renewable technologies, carbon pricing, or regulation requiring a certain percentage of energy to come from renewables.

Under an irresponsible government, cheap oil might further deter the transition away from fossil fuels. In this scenario, the prospect of expensive oil could paradoxically serve as a necessary stimulus to drive investment in renewable energy sources."

That's up from 5.6 billion when I was born in 1993, and 3 billion when my mom was born in 1960. 

In fact, if you look at the [distribution of mammals by biomass](https://ourworldindata.org/wild-mammals-birds-biomass), humans represent 34% and human-owned livestock represents another 62%, leaving only 4% represented by wild mammals. 

Humanity is spreading across every square centimeter of inhabitable space on earth, paving it over in concrete and using up resources until nothing is left for literally any creature not belonging to the species of *H. sapiens*. The carbon footprint of one single human is over 1,000 metric tonnes in the US, and this number is comparable in most developed countries. 

Don't get me wrong, I think all of the pro-environmental policies are great steps in the right direction. But our progress in reducing carbon footprints is quickly counteracted by making more and more humans. A 10% decrease in average carbon footprints per capita doesn't mean much when the population rises by the same amount. 

The solution to all of this is obvious, but no one wants to hear it: we need less humans on earth. If we gradually returned to 1960s levels of humans, *and* we kept going with switching to renewables as best we can, the earth might have a fighting chance to heal and provide beautiful, natural space for all the biodiverse species that call this place home. 

Meanwhile, as soon as anyone advocates for population decrease, the uproar is immediate and usually based on economics. This is because our entire economic system is based on the premise of eternal growth. A company is only considered successful if it grows, and when one exists in stable equilibrium, it's considered failure. 

The problem extends to governmental programs, too. Healthcare is funded by economic growth, and if we experienced population decline, the number of working people would fall and funds would become limited to pay for the ageing population's care. Our taxes are not saved and used later to pay for our own healthcare when we need it. Instead, they are used to pay for the previous generation, and it is assumed that there will be enough growth in working people to pay for the current generation when they age and need care. The system perpetuates a never-ending cycle. 

But at some point, we need to face the music: if we don't start doing something radically different, the earth will be destroyed by humanity's need to spread like cancer."

But I think you have to at least enjoy a majority of the main focus of something, for you to be a fan of a that thing. Like for example, if you said you were a fan of Batman Begins; but you hated the characters, the story, the visuals and only liked the soundtrack; I'd say you were a fan of the soundtrack, not a fan of the overall movie.

Another purely hypothetical, imagine if you were a media celebrity that claimed you were a fan of a video game franchise about a superpowered blue rat. But you express clear distaste for nearly every single game and only like the soundtrack and a couple of  the character designs.  I'd say it would not be unreasonable for people to assume that you aren't a fan of that franchise, and are instead a fan of a select few things about the franchise.

For me, this isn't a strict rule, you don't have to like over 50% of the main focus of a piece of media to be a fan of it otherwise you're cast into the pit of hell with the non-fans. I'd give some tolerance around how much you need to like the main focus of something.

I could play Satan's Avocado on this point and say this is more a problem that people find it easier just to generalize when talking rather than going into specifics that might muddle or over complicate saying ""I'm a fan of something""

***Also, I'd like to state any possible relation to a media celebrity with the word Grump in their name and a hatred of a blue rodent game in this post are completely coincidental and were entirely unintended.***

***And also there's probably some holes in my way of thinking because I can't be bothered spending more than a few minutes on a post.***"

(""*Of a person, action, or motive) lacking consideration for other people, concerned chiefly with one own's personal profit and pleasure*

Straight to the point, I believe most if not all people are self-serving, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. When you help someone else, you do that because you know it makes you feel good that you're helping someone. So in a way, selfless acts are selfish acts to either rid someone of their own guilt or to feel good about their own accomplishments.

I think what would change my mind on this is more specificity around where the line is drawn at if doing selfless or positive things for others to make yourself feel better is indeed self-serving. I think the only entirely selfless act would be one that's unknowingly selfless to the one performing it, they must do an act that they make them miserable or sad or make their life in some way worse but unknowingly is actually doing some good for someone else. But even then, performing the act in itself would mean you believe in some way that it must be done, therefore serving to please your conscious(otherwise you wouldn't do it.). Thought maybe being forced to do it might be a way around it, but then if its forced via threat; then you're doing it in a self-serving way to save your own life."
0,2023-05-20,"CMV: ground floors of major buildings in dense cities (or at least some analog thereof) should become public property, for better urban design",u/RandomTW5566,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13nbkrt/cmv_ground_floors_of_major_buildings_in_dense/,changemyview,"I think tall buildings in dense cities should be connected on the interior, in order to maintain good city design and living standards, while reducing sprawl and automobile dependence. One way to do this is for those buildings to have their ground floor completely open aside from the elevator/stairs to access the apartments. That way:

* everyone can walk in mostly straight lines to their destinations, literally ""across"" buildings.
* the lower part of buildings can sort of become ""park""-style empty areas.
* residents of the city could open up businesses, restaurants, etc. in the ground floor

This is how many of the buildings in my university work.

But there is actually precedent for this on the city level, even in the US! In many northern Midwestern cities, where the weather can often make it hard to walk on the street for much of the year, there are municipal walkways connecting the *second* floors of buildings, almost functioning as a secondary sidewalk system. I've never been to those IRL but from what I've seen of them, they're pretty cool! And I wish I lived in a city that used *those* instead of a crummy car-dependent American suburb.

Atlanta, Toronto, and Montreal don't have skyways, but they do have underground complexes for shopping, business, and transportation. In addition, Chicago and Seattle have historic ""underground cities"" leftover from historical processes of ""raising"" the city from the 1900s, small portions of which are open to the public as tourist attractions for a fee, but it would be nice if we could see those ""underground cities"" being repurposed for good use *gratis*.

So what do you think? I'm open to all views."

in both television and film, the actors simply look unreasonably attractive, enough so that it makes it difficult to take the story seriously. what was once a medium filled with content that starred average-looking people - barney miller, the jeffersons, archie bunker, the french connection, cooley high, etc. - has become a glorified runway of men and women who could pass for supermodels. 

the average white man looks like william h macy or will farrel, not brad pitt or tom hardy. 

the average white woman looks like jenna fischer or frances mcdormand, not margot robbie or blake lively. 

the average black man looks like don cheadle or mekhi phifer, not shemar moore or omari hardwick. 

the average black woman looks like viola davis or regina hall, not zendaya or thandie newton.

because of how unrealistically attractive these actors are, the stories in which their roles figure also become unrealistic, preventing me from being able to connect with the narrative.

EDIT: i wanted to add that i believe the over representation in film and television of classically good-looking men and women has had a very harmful effect on our society. it reinforces this dangerous and toxic belief that so-called “ugly” people don’t matter, that their stories are irrelevant and not worth telling. and, i believe this has contributed to a hierarchal treatment of people in our society according to how closely they are aligned with the images projected by popular media."

The most important foundation of democracy’s success is directly linked to the unrestricted and easily accessible quality sources of education. If you would like an undeniable fact on this matter?  Thomas Jefferson & John Adams, we’re not born in the same environment or equals but found each other because of their ability to intellectually meet on the level.

A congregation of men who all felt they were being discriminated against on a variety of levels by their own country found the courage through an intellectual connection to draft the Declaration of Independence which by the time it reached England would mean certain death for all of them if it didn't go well. Everything else that came after that took sacrifice and various forms of calculated intelligent and education-based maneuvers.

So please examine this very the unifying fact - all levels of education in this country have grown unequal, underfunded, and when examining any level of higher education or career training the costs are not only astronomical but they don't even represent realistic earning potentials for most to the point where it is economically and competitively damaging to the future of your country and those you love.

Therefore, anyone in an influential political position today or those that will seek even greater influence in the very near future who fail to make the paramount focus on the academic system about ensuring that every tax dollar Americans pay now is redirected in the most equalizing resource  that will without a doubt will enhance everyone and everything around us in the most powerful and democratic ways - should not only avoid discussing American history but reconsider their position of influence or political leadership.

I am an antinatalist (can be a toxic subreddit, i know, but essentially i believe that it is morally wrong to have children)

main arguments i have:
- nobody asks to be born (personally i feel violated that i was ever born)
- birth is just death with extra steps
- genetic/ rare diseases, disability etc… esp when there is a KNOWN hereditary disease in question- it is just cruel to knowingly pass it on to an innocent baby.
- in the most respectable manner i can phrase this: your genetics are not superior.
- there are enough humans in the earth to create irreversible damage to all life.
- exposing them to the human condition: death, pain, heartbreak, sickness, natural disaster, discrimination… 
- a chance at POSSIBLE happiness < GURANTEED pain and death.
- i just see no real reason for having children other than obvious selfish ones: you love babies, life is a joy (not all are lucky to feel the same way), family 
heir, to save a marriage, to give yourself fulfilment,  retirement purposes etc. are just selfish reasons to me.

with that said, i would like to remind potential commenters that i am aware i may have a ‘pessimistic’ world view, but i believe these views are valid. at the same time, i love children and would love to adopt someday. it is precisely because i love them so that i do not wish to bring any to the world. i really do wish to be enlightened, so serious discussion please. ironically it is my birthday today 😂 so please dont be too harsh with your criticism"

Most female artists perform in leotards where there arms and legs are the only body parts that are exposed, and that is only during SOME of their performances. Wearing a one piece leotard is not half naked at all. Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez and Lady Gaga wear the same type of stage costumes that artists like Cher, Madonna, Paula Abdul, Tina Turner and Janet Jackson wore in the 70s, 80s and 90s. These comments usually come from older people who seem to just be looking for a reason to look down on the entertainers of today because they think their generation was so much better. Female artists today are almost never half naked on stage and are usually completely covered up. I think people just love to be overly critical of women for doing the same things men do. For example, people say ""I don't understand why Beyoncé is always girating on stage"", when Prince used to stick his tongue out and get on stage wearing thongs and a crop top, and MJ used to thrust his hips and grab himself in every performance.

https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/mass-revelation-at-sinai/

The idea presented is that:

1. No other religion makes such a claim that more than one person recieved divine communication with God in this way. 

2. That the entire nation heard God speak to them and command them. 

3. How could such a claim be accepted if it did not occur? Ie, the claim is so big it must be true!

4. The claim is true, therefore the religion is true.


I think there are severe issues with this ""logic"".

Firstly, it is not true that only Judaism makes such a claim of widespread divine communication. I find it funny that the link does not include Hinduism, which not only incorporates mass divine interaction, but the idea that each individual _is_ God, which is surely not only a larger claim, but an ongoing one to each devotee.

The idea that a lie is not a lie just because it is a big lie is pretty funny, and I don't think the magnitude of the claim has any bearing on its believability.

I find it so odd an idea that I feel I must have misunderstood some aspect of it? Is there a different understanding of this that I've missed?

I'd like to change my view on the idea that Mass Revelation is somehow a compelling argument to the overall truth of the Jewish religion/claim."

No, not discussing using weapons in a firing range.

I mean— those that carry weapons in grocery stores, target, etc. in case of “emergency”.

Context:
Recently, a post hit r/all of a man who brandished his weapon to a tik tok prank to get the tik tokker to back off. In my honest opinion, I believe that man should be allowed to conceal carry. He displayed a calm collected, and spent time collecting the full details of the situation. 

Yet, the amount of people that said if they were in that situation — he would never have had a chance to pour it in the first place. Shot dead. HiS LifE CoUlD’vE BeEn iN DAnGEr.
He also could have easily walked away and de-escalate. And in a way, he did — by expressing a verbal warning first.

The news of people getting shot pulling into driveways, people getting shot playing hide and seek, police shooting a man just trying to follow conflicting directions — makes it clear that there is a unlawful transgression in our culture around self-defense… 

OR: certain people lack the distinct brain processing to quickly assess *accurately* levels of threat. In nature some people are predominantly fight while others are flight. When holding a gun, do you really think people who will fight a cloud passing by should conceal carry? 

Arguments that will not work on me:
-Muh 2A SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED. Well shit, your right to voting gets infringed every election season, what then? What about free speech and causing a riot? What about needing to register a protest? The constitution is not a bible.

-NO TEST OR ASSESSMENT COULD FAIRLY DETERMINE. Well, with that attitude lets scrap driving tests. I’m shocked that those were approved by the “no common sense regulation” crowd the moment any brain storming begins to occur. You can’t shut it down and explain why a specific version of this law doesn’t work while blatantly ignoring that there are multiple ways to skin a cat.

You must debate the very concept of why someone who can be proven trigger happy and inept in de-escalation during assessment should still be allowed to carry for self defense. While Police fail at this all the time, even they have to pass tests in quick reactions to carry on the force."

Even if I think the teenager could consent about 80-90% of the way I don’t think that a relationship between an adult and a teenager could ever not have a power imbalance due to the naivety of the teenager and the life experience of the adult, and I would have to say even if it’s not on purpose a relationship of that sort would always have elements and undertones of grooming. In that case, it’s pretty much impossible for the adult not to be taking advantage of the child’s naivety in some way, and I think taking advantage of a child’s naivety in that way is a morally wrong act that’s bad enough to make me believe most of the social stigma is justified. The only flaw I see in this is that all forms of trying to take advantage of someone’s naivety (seduction) could be used in this argument, but I believe it’s the level of naivety of a young teenager that distinguishes the two situations. 

Dear Reddit mods and everyone else reading, I don’t 
support the sexualization of any minor under the age of 18 and I am not here to support that kind of behavior. I personally find it disgusting to see 30-40 year old adults with any teenager and even young adults. I made a post similar to this a few days ago and Reddit removed it. I beg the Reddit gods to please not remove this post, I do this stuff when I have an opinion I recognize may be flawed and want to either rationalize the position or have it changed. So please just hear me out and don’t ban pls

Now I might personally find adults going after teenagers (13-17) socially unacceptable, but when I really think about this from a legal perspective I’m having trouble finding a justification of it being, if I’m being brutally honest, more than a petty crime and I simply can’t relate to people who see for example an adult getting caught with a 14 year old and wanting to see them rot in prison for the rest of their life, I just don’t see it as nearly as demonic as true pedophilia while most people seem to see pedophilia as only somewhat worse than hebephilia.

My reasoning for this is because while I don’t think minors can 100% consent, I think their comprehension and understanding of the world is enough to where they still need to be held mostly accountable for what they do.

Let’s say a 14 year old carjacks and robs me. While I don’t personally think a 14 year old can give full consent to what they do, because I do agree they are still growing up and learning per se, if a 14 year old does something illegal I think they should essentially be charged for that crime just like a regular adult and then at the very end be given a kind of “underage card” that gives a small amount of leniency due to their age. So say a 14 year old commits Armed Robbery and is sentenced to 10 years, and then some leniency is given due to his age, and a year or two is taken off and he’s sentenced to 8 or 9 instead.

So logically when we discuss adults with minors aged 13-17 we would just reverse the “leniency” given to a minor in court and turn that into the “harshness” of the punishment given to an adults who messes with a minor. 

And for me I think once someone has hit puberty yes they may still be immature, easily influenced, impulsive, etc, they still understand the world enough to understand what they’re doing outside of radical exceptions to the rule (don’t give some straw man about a teenager that was left in the woods and kept away from humanity for 14 years). This is also assuming the teenager was given a full sex Ed and is fully informed on sex and isn’t being coerced or groomed in any way. 

Essentially, I think a teenager isn’t a full adult but should be held responsible for what they do I’d say about 80-90% of the way. If they commit a crime, hold them accountable about 80-90%. If they consent to something, they consented to it about 80-90% of the way. I know these percentages are kind of arbitrary  and out of my ass but to put it into perspective I’d say someone who is extremely drunk could only consent like 50% max, so 80-90% is quite a bit. Therefore, I can’t logically think an adult who gets with a teenager should be charged with rape or anything more than a petty crime, maybe some probation, a fine, etc, and I can’t get behind wanting to see that person rot in jail for the rest of their life when it’s hebephilia.

0,2023-05-21,CMV: It is hypocritical to clamor for U.S. police reform while supporting the U.S. military.,u/ONLY_POSTS_BPTCG,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13o2ps2/cmv_it_is_hypocritical_to_clamor_for_us_police/,changemyview,"The U.S. military is, generally, well respected in the U.S, especially in comparison to the negative attention U.S police officers face. You have Veteran's Day and Memorial Day as regularly respected national holidays, plenty of commercial businesses offering military discounts, and ""thank you for your service"" is a common phrase received by uniformed military personnel. Yet, it is not hard to find instances of U.S. citizens clamoring for accountability of it's police forces, accusing police of human rights violations, and demanding police reform, transparency, and better trained officers. Why aren't we demanding the same for the U.S. military?

&#x200B;

Is it because non-American lives don't matter? Is it okay to kill innocent Iraqi civilians, but not okay to kill innocent American civilians?

&#x200B;

In Iraq, 280,771-315,190 Iraqi civilians were killed by direct violence since the U.S. invasion ([https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/iraqi](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/iraqi)). In Afghanistan, 70,000 Afghan and Pakistani civilians ([https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/afghan](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/afghan)).  US Drone and Air Strikes, alone, killed approximately 22,000 civilians during the war on terror.\[[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/sep/07/us-airstrikes-killed-at-least-22000-civilians-since-911-analysis-finds](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/sep/07/us-airstrikes-killed-at-least-22000-civilians-since-911-analysis-finds)\]. Nearly 700 innocent civilians were gunned down at military checkpoints \[[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2010/10/23/iraq-files-reveal-checkpoint-deaths](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2010/10/23/iraq-files-reveal-checkpoint-deaths)\], to include children and pregnant women, with 2000 wounded in such shootings. These numbers are likely higher. It is difficult to find sources and records, specifically, of how many civilians U.S. troops directly killed, especially regarding civilians killed by ground forces.

&#x200B;

That is an abomination.

&#x200B;

If that is not enough, here are some stories ([https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/world/middleeast/23casualties.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/world/middleeast/23casualties.html)) of innocent people killed by the U.S. Military, to include a friendly Iraqi interpreter shot and killed by a special operations sniper. (Link has a NYT paywall, sorry.)

&#x200B;

One example I want to highlight is, the torture and killings at Abu Gharib. Only 11 of the 17 identified members involved were charged with crimes. No officers were convicted ([https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5327137](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5327137)) and several more military personnel who were accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu\_Ghraib\_torture\_and\_prisoner\_abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse)).

&#x200B;

What happened to the soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen who killed these civilians? Who did the investigations? What was the result of the investigations? Who received criminal charges? Perhaps, this is a case of ""we investigated ourselves and found no crimes were committed"". Does that statement sound familiar in regards to police shootings?

&#x200B;

The big defense that these troops could be afforded are that they perceived a threat, we're in fear for their lives, and opened fire on a vehicle/launched a missile/shot someone ([https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/us/politics/afghanistan-drone-strike.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/us/politics/afghanistan-drone-strike.html)) . In other words, they got scared and killed someone. Does that statement sound familiar in regards to police shootings?

&#x200B;

I am unsure if the U.S. military are any better than U.S. police when it comes to killing innocent people. Perhaps the military is worse. The military totes ""rules of engagement"" yet kills tens of thousands of innocent people. And still, for the most part, we don't know what happened to the perpetrators of such violence.

&#x200B;

In closing I would like to share an excerpt from a Human Rights Watch report ([https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/01/25/lost-innocents](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/01/25/lost-innocents)) written by Sarah Yager. The report itself cites sources to claims made in the excerpt:

>In 2014, a year after I wrote my essay, a top-secret U.S. strike cell made up of special operations forces was created to go after Islamic State (also known as ISIS) targets in Syria. Over the course of five years, it struck many enemy positions. But a recent New York Times investigation revealed that it also killed an untold number of civilians—deaths that were never officially counted and have only recently been acknowledged by the Defense Department after intense media pressure. Military officials who worked with the task force told the Times that the group would often claim its actions were taken in self-defense to circumvent the rules meant to minimize civilian casualties.  
>  
>The unearthing of these strikes in Syria came only months after the U.S. military admitted that a high-profile drone strike in Afghanistan last August killed ten civilians, including seven children—and not a suspected terrorist, as the Pentagon first claimed. And in December, the Times released a trove of Defense Department documents that reveal careless targeting, years of civilian deaths, and little accountability in Washington. Together, these events underscore that the U.S. military’s overall record on civilian harm is shameful. Many of these newly revealed strikes appear to be violations of the laws of armed conflict; others represent possible war crimes. Worse yet, many of the problems now coming to light are the same ones that Human Rights Watch, where I work now, and other groups have been documenting for years—to little avail.

I am not trying to debate whether either the police or military professions are ""honorable"". My view is more to highlight the apparent hypocrisy. While I understand that it could be natural to distrust the people committing the offenses at your own home more, I think it's difficult to justify clamoring against police, yet supporting the military, without at least acknowledging that the military has done similar, if not worse, offenses against innocent human life. If you clamor for police reform, you should also be clamoring for accountability of the military, it's human rights violations, and demanding reform, transparency, and better trained troops.

30,2023-05-21,"CMV: I believe expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to $15,000 for all low-income workers would dramatically reduce poverty, government waste, and the need for most other welfare programs.",u/IndependentsModerate,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13o3att/cmv_i_believe_expanding_the_earned_income_tax/,changemyview,"&#x200B;

I am a big believer in workfare over welfare. For low-skilled workers, an expanded EITC would virtually eliminate poverty for anyone who is actually willing to work. There could still be welfare for those who are completely disabled, but welfare for able body individuals ruins their incentive to work and destroys their future prospects.  Individuals on many welfare programs are incentivized to not work, or they lose their benefits. Thus, they don't work, and miss out on learning skills and gaining experience that could lead to a much better job down the road. 

The expanded EITC seems like a much better way to combat poverty, than typical welfare programs...

&#x200B;

This concept is further expanded upon at this website.

[https://endgovernmentwaste.com/index.php/eliminate-poverty/](https://endgovernmentwaste.com/index.php/eliminate-poverty/)

The expanded EITC would incentivize people to work, because they would receive more benefits as they earned more income. One easy-to-implement, anti-poverty program could save billions of taxpayer dollars by reducing bureaucratic costs, increasing employment, and significantly reducing poverty for far less cost and with more efficiency than current government programs aimed at doing the same thing, yet failing to do so.   
Amazingly, the federal government currently spends over $1 trillion on welfare programs, an amount that mathematically should eliminate poverty; yet, poverty still exists because the current welfare programs are inefficient and contain negative incentives. Often called the “welfare trap, most welfare programs are means-tested for income and assets, which incentivize not working, not economizing, and not saving. In other words, when the government promises households significant benefits if they keep their total reported income and assets below or near the poverty line, many people will make an effort to keep their reported household assets and income below the poverty line. 

One easy-to-implement, anti-poverty program could save billions of taxpayer dollars by reducing bureaucratic costs, increasing employment, and significantly reducing poverty for far less cost and with more efficiency than current government programs aimed at doing the same thing, yet failing to do so.  
  
Replacing ineffective and inefficient programs with an expanded EITC program would save taxpayer dollars while incentivizing people to work and show income, which would drastically reduce poverty statistics in a short period of time. Further, this expanded EITC would be more effective than raising the minimum wage because a minimum wage could not raise wages of low-income workers to the income levels that the EITC could, and it would cause widespread unemployment as employers could no longer afford to pay employees. In short, as the total government-mandated employee minimum wage increases, many jobs will be eliminated or replaced by automation.  
  
An expanded EITC program is also a far better option than Universal Basic Income (UBI). UBI is the concept that the federal government should give all adult citizens a guaranteed income, with no work requirement or means test. UBI reduces the incentive to work and also reduces the overall standard of living in the country. For example, if UBI would be set at $12,000 per year, a household of three adults could receive $36,000 per year, which could drastically reduce their incentive to work and contribute to the tax base that pays for UBI. People may decide to live on UBI, not work or contribute, all at the expense of everyone else working and contributing tax dollars to UBI. A large percentage of households would be paying in taxes just to have their own money returned to them in a check from the government, which is a perfect example of bureaucratic waste. And principally, should the government be taking money from hard working Americans so that it can pay able-bodied individuals who are not required to work to receive the benefit?  
  
Combining smart economics with compassion and replacing the current welfare system by expanding the EITC promotes work ethic, personal dignity, and a healthy economy."

I am aware of this, and this is the point that is being made in Fat Head. My argument is that most people, when they eat at McDonalds, are going to eat until they feel full and as a result their calories in will be greater than their calories out.

So this is a response to the documentary Fat Head, which is itself a response to the documentary Super Size Me.

In Super Size Me a healthy adult man eats nothing but McDonalds for one month and gains a bunch of weight, and his blood tests etc. come back worse than before he started the McDonalds diet. It's intended as a demonstration of the dangers of a fast food diet, and by extension a significant portion of the American diet.

In Fat Head a man tries to debunk Super Size Me by losing weight while eating nothing but McDonalds. He does this with small portion sizes e.g. just eating a cheeseburger for a whole meal.

I would argue that this doesn't address the danger of an average fast-food-heavy diet, because the average person wouldn't just order one cheeseburger when they go to McDonalds. They'll get a combo, at the very least - personally even that isn't enough to fill me up, when I go to McDonalds I'll get a combo, some extra sides, and an extra burger or two! And I'm only 80kg, a lot of McDonalds regulars are bigger than me and need to eat a lot more to feel full.

So I would argue that most people would gain weight if they ate nothing but McDonalds, and the Fat Head documentary doesn't address the true danger of eating too much fast food, because most people aren't eating tiny portions when they get fast food."

Of course, this is not an unpopular opinion, obviously not, but I wanted someone who had a contrary opinion to change my mind.

I see many people saying, ""Oh, Steve Jobs didn't graduate and look where he is,"" and they point to people who are obviously outside the norm, who studied at highly prestigious colleges and already had middle/high-class stability.

I still believe that for poorer people, college is still the biggest means of social ascension as long as the student takes advantage of everything it has to offer. This is not what most people do. Most of them go to parties during these four years, do not specialize, or choose a major that is completely without a market and then complain that they are unemployed and in debt.

Of course, it is not a guarantee, but college, in addition to money, also develops a lot of soft skills that are necessary for the current world. Generally, people with a college degree earn more than people without one."

First off, I don't like being asked for my pronouns. For that matter, I don't like being asked for any identifiers. Age. Ethnicity. Religion. Gender. Address. I don't even like giving out my name. I don't particularly like being called by my name. And I really hate any honorifics like Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr, Professor, etc. There are probably lots of reasons for this, but mostly I don't like being put in a ""box."" I don't like people knowing much if anything about me or having a lot of preconceived notions/biases about me before we even speak to one another. I want them to come to the encounter as free of those as possible and I try to go into each new encounter the same way.

So lots of forms ask you for these things. Some workplaces now make you put pronouns in your email signature. And whenever I get asked that question in some stupid ice breaker thing or via a form my GUT tells wants to blurt out ""who/whom"" pretty much every time. It just feels right.

Why does it feel right? Maybe because no identifiers feel right to me so leaving them open, vague, or as basically an open question feels right. If anything I think the Buddhist idea of anatman, having no permanent, abiding essence is as close to a dogma of self as I'd be willing to embrace. I'm very creative and love acting and writing and can play and write from the points of view of characters who are very different from how most others would identify me just on sight. And I feel like every character I play or write is in many ways ""truly me"". And yet not.

I also tend to find most of our human existence and human categories a tad absurd. And what would be more absurd than being able to make other people refer to me with the indefinite/interrogative pronouns? Who is taking the lead on the project? Yes. Whose pencil is this? No, not whose, it's hers. What? I just love the chaos and laughter that would be caused by it.

And yet, I want this view changed because I think if I actually start doing it, it will just get me in trouble. I think people who really care about the pronoun thing are going to think I'm making fun of them or their concerns or somehow not taking it seriously. I think those who are irrationally angry about being asked for pronouns are either going to mistakenly think I'm on their side trying to expose how ridiculous it is or just ignore my request cause I couldn't seriously expect them to use THOSE pronouns. And obviously it makes communication harder, not easier because 3rd person pronouns are really for OTHER people to identify me to other other people so shouldn't they just use whatever pronouns work best to do that?

I want this view changed cause I think if I actually put this on a job application or an email signature or an audition form even that it would just be a personal detriment and serve no real purpose other than to get me ostracized by both ""sides"" of the great pronoun war and everyone who else who is sick of it at the same time.

And yet--it's the only set of pronouns that feels right to me. Has nothing to do with gender, really. And maybe I want to expand the challenge to identity even further. Maybe the point is we need to find that which is universally human if we are to reconnect one with another and stop being so lonely and at each other's throats. So ummm...yeah.

CMV: I should start saying/writing that my pronouns are who/whom/whose whenever I am given that choice to make.

**EDIT: Thanks to** u/sirlafemme **and others for a clarifying conversation below. After those conversations, want to add this edit:**

I will say that the whole thing probably makes me uncomfortable because while I'm not usually uncomfortable with gender identity per se, I have a whole lot of issues around identity more generally. My issue is mainly I don't like being asked to ""pick"" because I want to be open in some ways to becoming whatever is needed at the moment. I really do like to find out about who I am speaking with first and then I will emphasize whatever parts of my own identity I think they will feel most comfortable with. And I guess that's part people pleasing and part fear of rejection.

Which is weird because I'm not usually afraid to stand up for something. Even an unpopular something. But I'm much more comfortable with standing up for an IDEA than for my SELF. And maybe the pronoun thing makes me profoundly uncomfortable because I feel like it's throwing a question onto me about my SELF, publicly in a way I have a choice and in a way that could say something about how I view that SELF. And I'm not ready for that kind of SELF-disclosure right up front when these kinds of questions are usually asked.

Other questions bother me a little less because they could be seen as ""facts"". Like if the ice breaker is ""where were you born"" or ""where are you from/where do you live"" I'm not making a choice or saying I identify with or don't identify with the place I was born.

And lastly, when I am uncomfortable with something and don't like showing I'm uncomfortable with something my first and only remotely healthy coping mechanism is humor. Trying to be funny/absurd or trying to brush it off with an out of the box and kind of ridiculous answer is my way of deflecting and getting out of the box. But I don't want to use that if it's going to make someone else potentially feel made fun OF."

Reason 3: AI can be created by humans and improve upon themselves. So the starting point can be controlled by us humans although we'd have less control from there

~~Reason 4: Even if there's a dictatorship by AI, humans can still free themselves simply by cutting the electricity supply and internet connection if they decide it's enough. Dictatorship by humans is much harder to overthrow.~~"

Water is generally pulled from aquifers, which don't refill quickly once you use them up.

Toilets account for 30% of a home's indoor water usage.

And pee is just .... not that gross. It doesn't smell, unless it's really close. It doesn't have much bacteria. It's literally fine.

I live alone, and I just flush when I poop and at the end of the day, before I go to sleep. I keep the lid closed. ....it's fine.

Yeah, in a high-traffic, public toilet, it probably wouldn't be fine. If you didn't have AC, it might not be fine. In a home with a bunch of people, you'd probably want to flush it during the day sometimes.

But like ????? It just seems obvious to me that we should usually let it mellow. It would probably have a huge impact and cost nothing.

In general, Americans are too hung up on weird ideas of cleanliness. If you smell a smell, you won't die. If you can tell a human has been somewhere, that's not gross. My friends are always scurrying around changing their sheets before I sleep over. I don't get it."

Society does care about blind people, about deaf people, about people who need wheelchairs, but for some reason, the moment you bring up autism, is the moment people think, ""stupid people"". The only people who actually care about us are friends, family, and scientists researching it. And that's if they accept us. No one else cares. 


Let's consider anti-vaxxers. Anti-vaxxers notably rather have children with awful diseases than autistic children without awful diseases. Disregarding everything else wrong with anti-vaxxers, this stands a point as to how unwanted autistic children are.


When researching autism, the controversial group Autism Speaks is one of the first results on Google, despite the fact the community deemed it one of the worst groups that claim to support autism. Anyone researching autism do not talk or listen to actual autistic people first. 


Only about 1/3rd of autistic adults are employed. One reason why is when asked about disabilities during an interview, should the autistic person reveal their autism, their chances of getting hired significantly decreases. Why? Employers don't want autistic employees.


Celebrities have not helped improve common perception of autism. Two notable examples is William Shatner on Twitter and Sia's movie, Music, which has faced immense backlash due to its ableism. 

To the public eye, autism is making noises 'for no reason', hurting oneself, flailing limbs around, being introverted, being a 'nerd', not being able to talk, not being the child they 'should've been born as', and many other linear, underestimating things.

EDIT: I did realize that people with other disabilities don't have it easy either. Sorry about that."

The labels have nothing to do with creating a good person or even a stable relationship but more so about arbitrary behaviors that society feels a sex should do irrespective of anything else. 

For example , the cult known as the red pill community will especially make these appeals so women will be subservient slaves to them. The man must lead( make the decisions) and the woman must follow because that's what it is to be "" feminine"". It's also a cause of divorce which women report divorcing their husband's because of entitlement, lack of commitment and exhaustion. We know by studies that American women do about 60 or more of the child rearing, cooking and cleaning which puts a burden on the woman but because it's "" feminine"" roles men often feel entitled to not help as much because they make slightly more money which is considered "" masculine"". Because of this you'll see relationships in which they are financially stable but the man feels guilt making lower than the woman. The feeling of guilt will manifest quite viscerally however when it comes to child rearing and so on such guilt won't manifest in some men.

This has changed how men view women in a relationship dynamic. In no other dynamic will a individual expect someone to be submissive as if that word should be used at all . So many men don't treat women like people anymore but more so see a relationship as amoral no matter what the demand is as long as she consents. For example, leveraging your wealth to make demands you know she wouldn't agree with in order to treat her how she doesnt want to be treated if you werent wealthy deeming it non-normative. The most toxic appeal is a biological one in which young men especially by the Red Pill cult will tell women

 "" Stop fighting against your nature and behave feminine ! . Women and men are different therefore women ought to ( fill in the blank) to be feminine"" 

 These labels train men to be psychopaths when invoked/socialized by this appeal to biology/evolutionary psychology( pseudoscience) creating a cult of men who carry so much hate and vitriol for women not behaving as they believe women should. Nrvermind the is/ought problem being violated even if their descriptions were true. 

With that said, we should focus on what it means to be a good person and a good partner irrespective of any old roles , labels or even biological appeals."

10,2023-05-22,"CMV: fiction would be more usefully categorized by what it explores/addresses/its general approach (e.g. technology implications, mythical, magic-for-magic's-sake) than by the current approach of broad setting (e.g. it's in space so it's sci-fi).",u/quantum_dan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13p8jbu/cmv_fiction_would_be_more_usefully_categorized_by/,changemyview,"**Change edits (that was fast)**

* For practical purposes, a categorization system can't depend on in-depth familiarity with the book.
* More generally, this approach wouldn't scale, and it specifically doesn't fit with the large unphilosophical-fun-oriented category.
* One commenter, whom I will take to be sufficiently representative for CMV purposes, whose preferences do align more with the standard classification.

A core assumption here is that the major purpose of genre in fiction should be to categorize things to read based on interests.  (I say should be, as I don't have the formal background to say whether it is or not.  As a reader, that's what I think it should be for.)

Thus, it's not unreasonable that we currently categorize things more or less by setting.  It's plausible that someone who likes reading about Balrogs will be more interested in books with dragons than books with spaceships.

But I'd argue that's not how it actually tends to shake out.  *Lord of the Rings*, *Game of Thrones*, and *Harry Potter* are not enjoyable in the same way; even though the settings have superficial similarities, they appeal to different audiences.  I think people don't *really* read *Lord of the Rings* for the Balrog (or at least, I don't); they read it for a mythology, for its exploration of *ideas* (not means), and so on.  Therefore, the fact that *Game of Thrones* has dragons does not mean it has the same appeal - that's a political/warfare drama that happens to have dragons, and it's enjoyable in that sense, not for the dragons.

For another example, the *Culture* series is (in my reading of it) really about the implications of their particular spacecraft, and therefore has next to nothing in common with *Star Trek* (which strikes me as more similar to a lot of fantasy) or *Star Wars* (which is a Samurai/western with space wizards; that doesn't seem to be a controversial description).

If the goal is to categorize things to read, then, *Lord of the Rings* would be better compared to mythology, and *Game of Thrones* perhaps to *The Last Kingdom*.  *Dune* is more outright magical, but it's like the *Culture* series in that it explores the implications of a specific feature of the world.  And so on.

Two major areas to change my view:

* That this isn't, *and shouldn't be*, a major point of genres.  (If it currently isn't, then my argument would just be that it should be.)
* That my approach to preferences is just abnormal and people tend to define interest more by spaceships and magic."

27,2023-05-22,CMV: Bethesda RPG games have the most impressive modding community,u/burgerkinger_victor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13p9c43/cmv_bethesda_rpg_games_have_the_most_impressive/,changemyview,"First thing first, I'm counting the main line single-player 3D games made by Bethesda's creation engine, ie. Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, and 4. So, this would also include Fallout: New Vegas, despite it being developed by Obsidian, Bethesda's creation engine helped it florish in the modding scene. I mean, there are so many great mods that are being developed or were developed by the modding community. For example, New California for FO:NV, Enderal for Skyrim, and Tamriel Rebuilt for Morrowind. All of them required massive amount of coding, quest writing, level designing, and 3D modeling to generate their vision. Not only that, but the Morrowind community was able to built their own **open-sourced Morrowind**!

I just can't think of any other game franchise that can match the sheer scale of the Bethesda RPG modding community. Look at GTA, I haven't heard of any mods that includes a new city with brand new characters, missions, and activities to go along with the new settings. Unfortunately, GTA's publisher, 2K Games, is also hostile to the modding community and that honestly sucks. 

While Minecraft's modding community is impressive, I haven't seen one that really transforms the game. For example, there isn't a mod that has a hand-crafted map with plenty of quests and hand-crafted worlds for you to explore. A lot of these mods rely on procedural generation rather than hand-crafting it. A lot of Minecraft's mods add new mechanics to the game rather than completely creating a new world. 

Anyways, I hope I can find a gaming franchise that rivals those from Bethesda because I'm an avid modder. I love mods and how it gives you so much freedom to play the game the way you want to play it."

1133,2023-05-23,CMV: There should be more personal legal responsibility for executives in cases of corporate fraud or malpractice.,u/eagle_565,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13pl22a/cmv_there_should_be_more_personal_legal/,changemyview,"The current method of punishment in cases of corporate fraud or malpractice is a fine to the guilty corporation. A 2017 fine of google by the EU for anti competitive practices amounted to 2.42 billion euros, which is one of the biggest fines ever. In financial Q1 of 2021, google made 17 billion dollars in the EU alone. With yearly revenue well over 50 billion dollars, a fine of 2.42 billion every decade or so for anti competitive practices is still clearly financially viable.

In cases like this, it's clear that a few executives would have to have been well aware of these practices, but there's not much on the line for them if they're caught. In most cases, it results in them losing their job, which really isn't a massive deal for people as successful as Google executives, they're already immensely wealthy and have a lot of alternatives.

It seems to me that even a short prison sentence (say a year) for this kind of malpractice would be a much more effective deterrent than even a multibillion dollar fine to the company, because a massive fine for a company doesn't affect the lives of the people who made the immoral decisions nearly as much as some prison time would.

Of course you would need to be sure that specific executives were aware of this malpractice to charge them, but I think this would actually be possible in certain cases.

Change my view?

Edit for clarity: I don't think this should be the punishment in all cases of corporate malpractice, just in cases where there is clear evidence of executives knowingly endorsing illegal or obviously immoral practices. "

Honeybees are not native to North America. Some cities claim that honey bees are invasive and contribute to the decline of native bees. There is also the claim that native bees are better polinators. 

Since honey bees are transported for polinating large crops they must be good enough pollinators even if native honey bees are better. 

Plants need pollinators to reproduce so having honeybees in an area will produce more plants for native bees (and honey bees). 

Native bees won't live in a simple enclosure that we can place and there is no market for obtaining native bees.

You can buy honeybees and a suitable enclosure which makes honey bees much easier to keep. 

Native bees are not easy to get and keep, they don't produce honey or wax and having more polinators is better for the local ecosystem."

Geopolitical discussions of whether any given country* should *supply arms to Ukraine are best had elsewhere. I believe Ukraine has every right to continue the war as long as it wants in order to retake its internationally-recognized borders and will continue to hold that view even if convinced by this CMV that the war could end quickly.*

In the public discourse about whether or not to supply weapons to Ukraine, a number of pros and cons to the arms donations keep repeating. One of these cons which seems to keep coming up is that Western (and other international) weapons are prolonging the war by artificially propping up Ukraine, and that without these weapons Ukraine would be quickly defeated. This is a claim which I've seen repeated by everyone right across the political spectrum, including some who are firmly pro-Ukraine and pro-weapons shipments such as former EU foreign affairs minister Josep Borrell. Borrell said recently that Ukraine would surrender [""in a matter of days""](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/05/05/if-we-dont-support-ukraine-ukraine-will-fall-in-a-matter-of-days-says-josep-borrell) if weapons stopped flowing, using that claim to argue for more to be sent.

Usually this claim is just taken at face value by both sides of the debate, which is frustrating to me because I don't really understand the logic. I'd appreciate therefore if both pro- and anti-shipment individuals could explain it to me. My opposition to the claim comes on 4 points:

1. Russia failed to quickly conquer Ukraine even before large weapons shipments began
2. While Russia may be able to grind Ukraine down in a long war, it will be extraordinarily bloody
3. Any ceasefire which the West pressures Ukraine to sign with Russia will be broken by Russia
4. Even if Russia could force Ukraine to surrender quickly, a Russian occupation would be brutal

These are four points which I believe hold up to scrutiny, and which I will try to flesh out below. Obviously I could name some more reasons, but I believe these ones are the easiest to argue both for and against without retreading the same ground.

1. Russia can't quickly conquer Ukraine: Russia's best chance of quick, bloodless victory in Ukraine was in the opening few days before large amounts of Western aid began to arrive, when the Russian army launched a lightning offensive towards the capital city. Most of Ukraine's best troops were distracted in the Donbas and the offensive on Kyiv was therefore resisted in large part by territorial defence volunteers and conscripts relying mostly on old Soviet-era equipment. But Russia lost the battle of Kyiv and its military hasn't managed an offensive on the same scale since. As a result, any Russian victory would have to come as a result of slow, grinding, bloody attrition wearing down the Ukrainians until they are forced to give up months or years from now.
2. Russia can theoretically grind Ukraine down this way if Western aid (in weapons, as well as training) stops. In particular, Russia could continue [depleting Ukraine's air defence missiles](https://time.com/6271538/ukraine-air-defense-shortages-russia/) with cheap drone attacks in order to operate more freely with their air force and [run them short of artillery ammunition](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/04/08/ukraine-ammunition-shortage-shells-ration/) on the front line. But Ukrainian air defences are protecting their cities from air attack, so depleting those would mean more deaths among Ukrainian civilians. And even at the height of Russian artillery dominance (during the June battles of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk) Russia still couldn't advance quickly. This is because, for all their weapon superiority, relatively few Russians have actually volunteered to fight in the war. Russia is increasingly relying on conscripts, prisoners offered a pardon, or irregular armed groups and mercenaries who are either unmotivated or unable to conduct large scale maneuver operations and instead get used in bloody, high attrition attacks to take hundreds of metres at a time.
3. This starts to stray into geopolitics, I believe the Kremlin intended and still intends to seize all of Ukraine. This is evidenced by the opening assault on Kyiv, Putin's call on the Ukrainian military to overthrow Zelenskyy, and the stark refusal to accept ""off ramps"" which Western leaders tried to leave so that Putin could withdraw and save face. At the same time, the Kremlin has repeatedly violated ceasefires with Ukraine (Minsk I and II and other ceasefires). If Ukraine can no longer counterattack due to Western aid stopping and a ceasefire gets signed, Russia will simply use that time to prepare for another invasion in a few years. They can then use the land they currently control as a jumping-off point, same as they used Donbas and Crimea this time.
4. Even if all the above were invalid and Zelenskyy's government would collapse tomorrow without Western aid, this would still be a worse humanitarian situation than the current war because it would mean millions more Ukrainians forced to live under Russian occupation (or oppression by a Russian-backed puppet regime). It is already well known that the International Criminal Court has put out an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova over [deportations of Ukrainian children](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and), but the pattern of forced deportations and efforts to intimidate civilians into [becoming Russian or face deportation](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/05/16/russia-threatens-ukrainians-who-refuse-russian-citizenship) has been well documented at this point. This is in addition to [more sporadic acts of lawless killing by Russian troops](https://apnews.com/article/bucha-ukraine-war-cleansing-investigation-43e5a9538e9ba68a035756b05028b8b4) or affiliated mercenaries like the [Wagner Group](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/europe/wagner-commanders-russia-kill-children-intl-hnk/index.html). Subjecting all of Ukraine to the same occupation would also stretch Russian occupation forces thinner and make crushing the already-active Ukrainian resistance harder. I won't even try to imagine what such a counter-insurgency war might look like since this is already getting into extremely speculative territory, but it's impossible to ignore historical examples. All of Russia's ""successful"" puppet states established through war (South Ossetia, Transnistria, arguably Chechnya) are poor authoritarian regimes cut off from the global economy. And the unsuccessful one . . . is Afghanistan. The Soviet Union spent nine years fighting in Afghanistan before pulling out, leaving the country broken and in the hands of a nascent Taliban. Ukraine has a number of extremist anti-Russian armed groups in its borders, mostly growing in popularity following the 2014 invasion. If Russia conquered all of Ukraine their numbers would grow, and their descendants would likely end up in control of the country if the Kremlin leaves in several years.

Thanks for sticking with me to the end. I hope that this covers all the main points I have on this issue, and allows people to interrogate the weaknesses in my thinking. I personally anticipate some responses trying to argue that Russia is the good guys, and Ukrainians are being forced to fight by their Western masters. I welcome these arguments, don't think they have any merit. People looking to genuinely change my view will probably have more success if they start from the assumption that Ukrainian society wants to continue fighting the war, and will probably continue doing so as long as they are able."

0,2023-05-23,CMV: Misgendering a trans criminal is akin to referring to a black criminal by a racial slur,u/sherbetsean,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13poi9m/cmv_misgendering_a_trans_criminal_is_akin_to/,changemyview,"**WARNING: This post discusses sex crimes, transphobia, and racism.**

----

**Context:**

Recently there has been a prominent news story in the UK regarding someone charged with committing sexual abuse. I'll omit the names here, albeit they can be found with a quick Google search - the specifics are not relevant to my view; although this news story is what prompted me to think about this. It goes without saying, I condemn these crimes entirely.

The accused identifies as a trans-woman, however mainstream media organizations (e.g. Sky News) are primarily referring to them as he/him and their dead (male) name. This is not a reporting error, the news stories specifically reference that they do not identify by that name. For the purpose of this discussion I would like to focus on the case where it was intentional.

**My View:**

I am a firm ally of the trans community, and in general I consider it very disrespectful to refer to someone in a way they do not wish to be referred to. It's not that I feel an abuser is deserving of respect, but that intentionally misgendering them is disrespectful to trans people as a whole.

This is where the analogy drawn in the title comes in. I realize this is essentially a ""double standard"" argument which isn't so precise. If the criminal had been a person of color I would have been shocked to hear a news anchor refer to them as by a racial slur. I would consider this as disrespectful to people of that ethnicity as a whole.

As a reader of these new articles, the intentional misgendering of the criminal causes me two concerns:

1. The author may intend for the reader to conclude some causal link between sex abuse crimes and being transgender. This is additionally problematic given the long and difficult history of the media insinuating that LGBT people are more likely to be sex criminals. 

2. The author, and by extension the media organization, holds contempt for transgender people in general.

**Weakness in my view:**

While I feel that my analogy is strong, when it comes to the nature of the situations, the degree of them may be inequal. Perhaps it is more widely held that racial slurs are worse than purposefully misgendering someone, and that misgendering is not severe enough to be considered inappropriate language for a news organization. Personally I do not feel this way, and view both as very disrespectful.

Thanks for reading, the nature of these crimes makes this discussion quite controversial.

----

Edit:

Sky News have frequently referred to other trans people, e.g. Eliot Page, by their preferred pronouns. To me this is evidence of an intentional choice to show less respect to alleged criminals by deliberately misgendering them.

----

Edit 2:

I stand by my previous choice to not acknowledge the article that prompted this thought. Many comments are asking for it, but I don't think deconstructing a specific article is going to be constructive here. My opinion is very general, in that I feel that deliberately misgendering a trans criminal, especially in a news article, is harmful/disrespectful to trans people in general.

There are many many replies in such a short period of time. Many of them are more broadly arguing the legitimacy of preferred pronouns and offense caused by misgendering as a whole. I personally do not find this very convincing."

Lmao I don't think these people realize how hypocritical they are being, but that's what it is. Hypocrisy and complacency.

There are 4 other top leagues in the world. EPL specifically plays at a higher level throughout the league, and they actively combat racism (no they are not perfect, but they are doing infinitely better than La Liga). Anyone who continues to watch La Liga at this point, when there is another significantly less racist option that is just as accessible, must recognize their part in this and shoulder some of the blame.

Everyone is like, ""How could Tebas try to sweep this under the rug like that,"" all the while you fail to recognize your role in all of this. ESPN broadcasters are saying, ""players need to walk off the pitch, fans need to be banned, etc."" Yet ESPN continues to cover the league and broadcast the games. If fans do not stop watching and broadcasters do not stop covering, this entire controversy is  profitable to the league, as it brings tons of free press.

Governments are often inept and corrupt, why is it more moral to pay more on your taxes rather than less? -Especially if a large chunk of that money is going towards funding a military complex that has waged injustices across the world. 

As much as I want to believe that taxing Bezos or Gates  would solve the injustices of the world, I think the larger issue is that the money taken from these billionaires would never make its way into the sectors that need it most. I struggle to believe that a country that has spent trillions on military can not muster up the needed funds for basic infrastructure and resource management as well as health care. The US government is not struggling for cash. the hard truth is that taxing billionaires may not increase our standard of living even in the slightest if we are not first concerned with how society is structured, and without an equal amount of outrage being geared towards our leaders for not using the means of government to provide properly for their citizens.

The core of my view, that I'm most interested in discussing, is that a residential landlord offers exactly zero intrinsic value to society, setting rates against inelastic demand and earning money solely because they possess resources that they could not possibly use themselves but that others desperately need. Any argument for what a landlord ""does"" for a tenant ignores that the need for that service is artificially created by the landlord/tenant arrangement.

The future I imagine, generally speaking, is one in which it is illegal to own a residential property that one does not reside in for a minimum of 3 consecutive months out of the tax year. Apartments should be governed by boards made up of resident-owners. Property owners that violate these laws are given, among whatever other penalties, a window during which they must sell their property. Failure to do so results in seizure and the property being sold at auction, with earnings going to the now former owner. Any new property purchased must be resided in, for a minimum of 3 consecutive months, within a year of the purchase.

I'm certainly open to broad challenges to my uneducated legal prescription above. There could be gaps in my reasoning or obvious unintended consequences I've missed. I'm much less interested in nitpicky arguments about how we could possibly move from our current state to that one, or over whether it should be 3 months or 6, or how these laws would be enforced. What I'm getting at is that, in my view **(TLDR) we should endeavor to wield the legislature at the federal, state, and local level against landlords and create a society where no one has to pay rent to a landlord in order to have a home.**

I do not include commercial rentals, hotels, vacation rentals, and other short-to-medium term housing in my view, I think those are different scenarios feasibly accommodated within the bounds of my view.

EDIT: Delta awarded to /u/Amablue for helping me understand that landlords are (perhaps obviously) profiting from their ownership of \*land\* and not houses or apartments. I'm inclined to agree that taxing land in the way they suggest would force landlords into a position where they can only earn money on actual services rendered. This approach is elegant, far less clumsy than mine, and isn't soaked in normative propaganda. Thanks for making such compelling and researched arguments in response to me and others here.

Do something about the people calling me a ""socialist"" as if it were an insult, or implying that I have this view because I'm too poor or lazy to own anything. I have no trouble understanding that most are too far gone down the rabbit hole of how society is currently ordered to conceive of a way to order it differently. I came here looking for perspectives like /u/Amablue's - that understand my goals as a basis for explaining why my approach is wrong - and that I received only one is no fault of mine."

That is why I want my view changed.

I am first going to differentiate between de-platforming and silencing. In the United States, we have strong free speech protections. I do believe in Freedom of association and right to property so I don't think any given company should be forced to allow someone to use their platform. Free speech permits those wishing to behave intolerantly to demonstrate themselves as someone negative to associate with. I do not believe the government has any place regulating hateful speech. Furthermore, places that permit a wide range of views with very low moderation should not be demonized. I also believe freedom of speech regulations could be turned against minorities as seen in Florida. It's a dangerous thing to regulate what people can say.

One yesterday was a restaurant in which folks were taking out the furniture and signage when employees showed up for work.  Clearly the owners knew it was shutting down ahead of time and wanted to keep the employees on the hook as long as possible.

Situations like this put employees in line with other creditors for wages earned but not yet paid.  I contend that employees are *special* creditors, and are only extending ""credit"" on their work until next payday because there are no other terms available.  Further, they are the most vulnerable creditors of a failed business, and the most exploited and exploitable.

A bond in the amount of one month of wages, audited every six months, will assure the business' ability to pay out their employees if the business fails.

Bonds like this are used all over the place to assure financial responsibility, and this seems like another logical place for one."

Corpos right now go around unchecked purchasing ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS and spiking the prices by DOUBLE if not TRIPLE the purchase price and then renting them out to the commonfolk. 

Because the Middle Class no longer exists, no group of people can keep Corpos in check, meaning the inflation we have been experiencing has been Corpo created. Corpos get from their suppliers at their normal prices, but, they the spike the costs up by double the original if not triple. I understand that they are needing to make a profit, but this is genuine corpo greed at its worst. The difference between a profit and greed stems from the Hustle mindset we have been accepting for years. The removal of the middle class came with the introduction of “side hustles”, aka, part time jobs that do not work as a normal job would. Uber, Doordash, and Grubhub have set the stage for other corpos to lower outcome while maximizing their income. By finding the loophole of self employment, these corpos have mitigated the middle class simply by making Self Employment a Corporate title. 

We NEED to stop this. The only future we have if we continue to allow Corporate BS is one akin to Cyberpunk 2077, one that looks good on the surface until you actually look into the world and see the dystopia they live. Murder all over (currently happening), corporate colonialism (currently happening), Corporate controlled Government (currently happening in the shade), Corpo influenced Law Enforcement (probably happening now), and Corpo’s will be able to literally control the cities they are in. 

Think about the dystopia where you hear that a district of your city is locked down because corpo security decided to. Not because of city police, not because of anything other than Corpos. This could be tomorrow, if we do not do anything to stop it. Vote in anti-corporate legislators, return Unions to the workplace, and re-establish the middle class.  Or the fate that faces America may face the whole world."
1,2023-05-23,CMV: Outlawing exclusionary zoning is a conservative idea and any conservative who opposes it doesn't care about about the housing crisis,u/Flumberbug,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13q0yml/cmv_outlawing_exclusionary_zoning_is_a/,changemyview,"The root cause of high housing costs and and homelessness is simple: We haven't built enough homes for a growing population. It's simple supply and demand. When demand increases while supply does not, prices shoot up and many people get priced out of the market entirely.

There are left wing solutions, namely building a ton of public housing. But outlawing exclusionary zoning is not a left wing idea.

First off, what is exclusionary zoning, anyway?

For roughly a century, the norm, at least in the US and Canada, has been to set aside vast swaths of land where the only things you can legally build are single-family houses. Want to build apartments? Too bad. How about a fourplex? Get lost.

Outlawing exclusionary zoning is a type of deregulation, and deregulation is a classic right wing idea. Overregulation, conservatives argue, artificially restricts supply, which is cancer in a capitalist system. When you get rid of burdensome regulations, you unleash the power of the market to meet people's needs.

If you're a conservative and you want to preserve exclusionary zoning, you simply do not care about housing affordability or homelessness. Because there is no other policy in the right wing toolbox that has the potential to be anywhere near as effective at fixing the housing crisis.

Let's look at some counterarguments.

**Outlawing exclusionary zoning is primarily discussed in left wing circles. This shows it's a left wing idea, not a right wing idea.**

This just shows how absurdly right wing housing politics is. Lefties propose zoning reform as a compromise solution because they don't think they can muster enough political capital to use eminent domain to take over a bunch of land and build high-density public housing.

**Conservatism isn't about improving people's lives. It's just about resisting change and oppressing poor people and minorities.**

This is toxic conservatism. People who believe this aren't conservatives. They're just assholes.

**Banning exclusionary zoning is certainly *economically* right wing. But it's not socially right wing.**

The reason banning exclusionary zoning isn't a socially conservative idea is because it helps poor people and minorities more than it helps the rich. (Though it does still help the rich.) I'll say it again: If you care more about oppressing people than about improving society, you're not a conservative. You're just an asshole."

There are a million different arguments for and against veganism out there, but I want to discuss the *specific* point above.  While many people disagree with the utilitarian framing I'm using, or believe moral consideration doesn't extend to animals, for the sake of this discussion let's assume that we want to reduce suffering for sentient beings (humans and animals) as much as possible.

Some people argue that the benefits of eating animal products for humans (pleasure, comfort/ease, health) outweigh the suffering of the animals involved.  First, I will acknowledge that being vegan is not feasible for everyone based on certain monetary, situational, or health reasons.  That's fine, but for most non-impoverished people in developed countries, eating vegan (at least most of the time) is feasible and not unreasonably difficult.

I do acknowledge the downsides of being vegan though--missing out on some delicious foods, less convenience, more work needed to ensure a balanced diet, and social pressures.  Still, it's not *that* hard.  My life is mostly the same as when I was eating meat.  I do think eating animal products would make me a little happier for the reasons I mentioned earlier, but this is not nearly enough justification to me.  I wouldn't want a dog or cat to go through significant physical pain or be killed just so I could be ""a little"" happier.  In general, I don't find this line of counterargument convincing, but I am open to it if you can convince me that going vegan causes significant harm to humans.

I am more interested in arguments about the effects on animals.  Some argue that going vegan is pointless because the production of crops still harms animals: it disrupts the ecosystem, and we need to kill and keep out pests like rats.  I acknowledge this point, and I don't think eating vegan is truly ""cruelty-free.""  However, I don't see how it could possibly cause MORE suffering than eating animal products.  For one, animal suffering is inherent to meat production, but only a byproduct (that can ideally be avoided as much as possible) of crop production.  Also, most sources I've seen say that most of the crops we produce are fed to livestock, so by eating vegan you are reducing the negative impacts of crop production as well.

However, I'm no agriculture expert, so if anyone has good counterarguments or resources that quantify the argument above and make a compelling case that eating vegan does not actually lead to less suffering, I'm all ears."

So I am looking for holes in my logic below.

In the beginning of this year (2023), Russian forces started entering the Eastern side of Bakhmut. At this point in time Ukrainian forces have been (or about to be) completely pushed out of Bakhmut (based on administrative borders of the city).

There has also been an incursion into Belgorod Oblast. Such an incursion, in my view, would not happen without planning, especially since there are heavy armored vehicles (tanks) involved. They have to be fueled, ammunition stored, crews prepared, etc. There would also need to be a plan with goals/objectives. Who goes where, what building/areas to take over, what to do if something unforeseen happens, etc. Basically, this is not a spur of the moment action, this has to have been planned for some time.

Considering the poor reaction by the Russian government, they will need to scramble and perhaps pull some military units from Ukraine to reinforce their border and stop the incursion. The last part is what Ukrainian military leaders would want. This would then open up some areas of attack for Ukrainian forces in Ukraine."

Increasingly plausible, hard science fiction, but still speculative. If it's possible, which isn't quite settled, there are an infinite number of ways it could happen, and no sure way to prevent it unless a full Butlerian Jihad ten years ago is an option. 

On the other hand, for instance, GPT4 has passed the bar. It could probably do the jobs of at least some lawyers, at least passably, starting a month from now.

Given that, it seems fairly inevitable that at some point in the near future, someone will want to have an AI defend them in court, and it might not fail miserably. 

If that isn't an abject disaster, it seems fairly inevitable that some politicians will start arguing that we can save some tax dollars by deciding that an AI satisfies a person's right to an attorney. 

If society wanted to decide whether that could be done right, and if so, how, we would want maximum transparency. Everyone would need to be able to know exactly how this machine was built, what it was trained on, and how.

The legal realm is only the most extreme example of why transparency is necessary as language models are leveraged in fields such as education, journalism, medicine, etc. In order for such applications to be remotely fair, the public would need the power to know exactly how these machines were biased, at least inasmuch as any NDA-signing engineer could know such a thing. 

What's more, if we should be worried about the rogue AGI worst case scenario, the foremost problem there is predicting exactly when and how it would happen. Countermeasures formulated without that knowledge are likely to be ineffective or worse.

The more eyes are on the problem, the easier it will be to prevent catastrophe before it happens. And it would be really good if we could figure out exactly how it's likely to happen while we can narrow the people likely to create AGIs down to those who own million dollar supercomputers. The last thing we want is to find out how dangerous AIs can happen in a time when any psycho with $20,000 to blow on graphics cards can build an AGI in his garage. 

If Sam Altman were truly concerned about any such catastrophic or dystopian outcomes, he would have kept OpenAI true to its name. He isn't. What he wants is to shut out competition, protect trade secrets, avoid accountability, and maintain a sense of mystique around his product. He is using the phantom menace of AGI to distract from much more imminent ethical concerns. 

If the risks of AI are sufficient to warrant obscurantism, then they are sufficient to warrant Eliezer Yudkowsky's concerns. Otherwise, obscurantism presents the greatest risks."

Someone says, oh I'm not comfortable showing such and such aspect of my culture because I'm afraid people will judge it negatively... then someone tries to validate that person and says show off such and such thing and that not to worry about the ignorant people, it's not your responsibility to educate people about your culture.

This is a false statement. It is absolutely the responsibility of that person (or someone from that culture) to educate people who are interested in learning about it.

Say someone wears headdress, but they feel uncomfortable by people looking at them. 1) It's rude for people to stare 2) No it's not their responsibility to walk up to anyone staring and say oh it's such and such thing, but if they are tired of people looking they can just say i noticed you looking at my head wear its a ""x"" or just ignore... 3) If someone was curious because they had never seen it before and asked they can educate by stating what it is or go into a more detailed answer. Or ignore them and let people keep on being ignorant. 

It's actually very unhelpful for people to tell them it's not your job to educate people on your culture. And sure maybe not that person specifically, but if not them then who? Someone from their culture has to, so why not them?

Because how else are people going to know... you don't know what you don't know until you know.  And you will only know by being exposed to something and then the people from that culture telling you or directing you you and then what you do from there is on you.. even just stating the name of something is educating someone.

The argument that you can just Google a cultural thing, well where did that info on Google come from... people of that culture. 

Also, knowledge is power. If you want to stop something from having a stigma or from people being curious, the best way is to tell people and educate. Why do people insist on telling people to relinquish their power? 

Not educating people on stuff that is culturally different puts an even greater divide on race and cultural issues. It segregates a person even more as people dont learn and are wary of thibgs they dont know. Humans, by nature, and survival, are judgemental, our brains are wired that way.. we are constantly judging situations and our environment, that's how we stay safe... hmm that food has fuzzy stuff on it, that's not safe to eat. That is a judgement based on observation. Checking people out is considered rude, but it happens by nature.. seeing something attractive, or out of the ordinary, or to figure out of you feel safe to walk on the same side of the street as someone (let's not pretend we are all okay with having someone walk behind us at dusk on an empty road). 

Hell, we wouldn't have as many advancements in life as we do now if people just kept their knowledge to themselves... so many of our everyday things and designs are because people shared their culture (okay, maybe some was stolen, but it still comes from another culture).

It seems to me that they are a great environmentally friendly alternative for people who don't like cycling. They are simple to use, you don't get sweaty, it's easier to keep dry in rain as you aren't moving your legs, they are smaller and so easier to store, etc.

I don't understand why people are so against them, other than that they are new. I don't really see how they are different than bicycles.

Likely responses:

> they are dangerous

Far more injuries happen on bikes and if the ""injury per capita"" is higher you would still initially expect a higher injury rate while they are new and unfamiliar.

E-scooters are normally speed limited to be slower than the top speed of a bike and cause similar damage on collision

> they catch fire

So do dodgy e-bikes. However, I do think that we should mandate safety standards for sales of large batteries.

> rental escooters are left on the street

This is only applicable for rental scooters and the problem can be solved by having geofenced pickup/drop-off locations.

> people ride them on sidewalks

Give them a fine, like we do for bikes

3,2023-05-24,CMV: Social functionality level is more important than the diagnosis when applying welfare benefits and/or legal restrictions for mentally ill patients,u/ConsCom1949,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13qoksg/cmv_social_functionality_level_is_more_important/,changemyview,"Reason 1: Some people might be more or less ill than others despite the same diagnosis. I've not been significantly ill for one year, my friends can't even tell I'm mentally ill, while one of my friends is actively suicidal and lays on bed for days on end, despite both having the diagnosis of Bipolar 2 and on meds. 

Reason 2: Declining welfare to more severely influenced individuals is simply unfair. Like South Korea's conscription system classifies Major Depressive Disorder as Category 3 (with exceptions) which has to serve in the military for two years unless you're dead or amputated or such things. Bipolar 1 disorder is Category 5 which is exempt from military service. However, a well controlled Bipolar 1 case might be well functioning, with the same functional level as normal people, while a severe case of MDD can make people literally not able to move for days. Imagine barely being able to move and having to serve in the military for almost two years. 

Reason 3: Applying restrictions to less mentally ill people with a ""severe"" diagnosis is not only unfair but also leads to intentional misdiagnosis. Bipolar patients in China face a bunch of legal discriminations, like not being able to drive, not being able to stay in a hotel alone (only in some provinces), etc. So my doctor has to diagnose me as ""mood disorder with a high probability of Bipolar Disorder"" to avoid these legal restrictions. And the underdiagnosis of such severe disorders can lead to a lack of funding on the research and treatment of these illnesses. 

Reason 4: Diagnosis for most mental illnesses are largely artificial and symptoms-based. Objective signs such as blood flow patterns in the brain are often supplementary to observed symptoms. Basing your laws on such artificial boundaries doesn't make sense.

Edit: We should have a 7-tiered system for mental illnesses. A patient can be up-tiered or down-tiered if they become better or worse functional. 

Tier 1: Normal

Tier 2: Normal with some psychological problems (no benefits but recommend them to adopt lifestyle changes, see a counselor etc)

Tier 3: Very well-controlled and functional mentally ill people (no benefits but make sure they receive the right treatment, and they should recieve job assistance if necessary, and they're exempt from combat roles in the military)

Tier 4: Well-controlled severe illnesses, not very well controlled mild illnesses, generally functional with some difficulties (I'm here. Job assistance, exempt from the military unless at wartime, and if they're unemployed, unemployment benefits)

Tier 5: Not well controlled but still somewhat functional, can barely take care of themselves but poses no immediate life-threatening danger to themselves or others at the moment, can only work very basic jobs (Welfare benefits, job assistance if they decide to find a job, exempt from military even at wartime)

Tier 6: Danger to themselves or others (actively suicidal or wanting to harm others), or can't work at all, but still somewhat coherent, can talk near-normally, don't need 24/7 care (Full disability benefits)

Tier 7: Unconscious, or non-coherent, or not being able to move, or not being able to perform even simple tasks like brushing the teeth, need full time care, or just after suicide attempts or attempting to kill other people (Hospitalisation and full disability benefits with an extra amount for caretakers)"

175,2023-05-24,CMV: Asking your partner to share their location with you 24/7 implies a lack of trust and is unhealthy long-term,u/KatyRiverRoad,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13qqvy9/cmv_asking_your_partner_to_share_their_location/,changemyview,"I got into a heated debate recently about location sharing with a partner, and I'm open to changing my opinion on this but I feel very strongly about my stance on this.

Something that seems somewhat common nowadays is people sharing their locations with their partners at all times. Several friends of mine are in relationships where they and their partners are mutually sharing their locations. One of my close friends was in a relationship for a while where they were asked to share their location but their partner would not share their own location, and it was revealed that their partner was cheating on them. I've personally never been cheated on and never have cheated on anyone I've been in a relationship with, but I also haven't dated many people seriously out of avoidance of getting hurt. This is important to mention because of the logic behind my thinking.

I am naturally an anxious person, and when I was young and in relationships in high school, I could be clingy at times. I have spent years working on myself and have matured a lot, and a few people in recent years have forced me think a lot about my approach to relationships and I think I have an incredibly healthy outlook on relationships and trust nowadays. If a person that I was dating for a while (and had presumably gotten to know me and who I am as a person) asked me to share my location with them 24/7, I would be insulted that they didn't trust me. I would share my location with them because I have nothing to hide, but it would not even cross my mind to ask someone that I was dating to share their location 24/7 and I would refuse to accept their offer to reciprocate, to prove my point.

I feel like if you're dating someone seriously, there has to be a level of blind trust, otherwise the relationship is doomed. Personally, I don't even want to have the ability to know where my partner is every second of the day. I don't want to know their phone, computer, or email password. I am an incredibly independent person nowadays and don't believe in the idea of giving up your autonomy when you are in a relationship, and that goes both ways. I wouldn't want to date someone who would willingly give up their autonomy. I feel like, when in a relationship, you should be comfortable being uncomfortable. You should be able to be at work and trust that your partner isn't sleeping around. You probably won't know for certain, but I feel like all of this 21st century access we have to eachother just plays into our own insecurities. Despite my natural inclination towards neuroticism, I feel like forcing yourself to have faith and trust in your partner is so much healthier in the long run than something like sharing your location is towards building a sense of trust.

One of the reasons that was outlined from the other perspective was safety. A woman sharing her location with friends when she goes out just in case something happens, for example. I totally get that and that makes sense. As I said at the beginning, I can be talked into this. But as a guy, I feel like I'd get resentful of my partner if they asked this, because I know what they would see and know at least with my daily life, it's boring as hell. I live a very predictable life, half the time I send a picture of what I'm doing anyways out of boredom. My partner in this scenario could watch my location for a week straight and gain some peace of mind but I'd just continue to be annoyed that they didn't trust me in the first place. The person I got into the debate with tried to convince me that it would build trust and is like a security blanket, but I just don't agree with that logic.

I know it's 2023 and dating is different nowadays, expectations are different, especially in my generation that has largely grown up with technology. I'm an open-minded person, but this just goes against what I believe relationships need to work long-term. I didn't have the best role models growing up, my parents didn't trust eachother and my father cheated on my mom, but I have spent my entire life trying to build myself into a person of high character, loyalty, and integrity whose word means something, I have strived to be a different person than my parents. As an adult now, there is nothing more insulting to me than to imply you don't trust me, especially if you know me well. If you are serious about getting married to someone and spending the rest of your life together, you should have enough faith in them to not need to know where they are at 24/7 or need to see their text messages or emails.

There will probably be some good counterarguments, it felt like the real-life debate didn't allow me to fully formulate my thoughts on the matter so please, pick my logic apart now that I have."

For instance just saw target ""pull back"" from pride week in ""some locations"".

Getting involved in a social cause should not stop at the marketing department.  The company should be fully onboard, including having a game plan if there is backlash.  By backing out or scaling back, you're saying that you're only committed to a cause it it makes you look good. 

If you're not committed to a community, don't claim to be. It does more harm than good and makes your brand look weak.

There will be consequences to staying silent as well. That's just a fact of life. So if you're not committed, stay uncommitted and accept the social ramification. If you are committed then stay committed and accept the social ramification."
27,2023-05-24,CMV: You can be racist and still be a good person.,u/No_Cricket_2824,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13qrjun/cmv_you_can_be_racist_and_still_be_a_good_person/,changemyview,"I'm a black woman and recently had to think about this in length since so many of my friends are of the far left. The belief that black people can't be racist , incessantly speaking about white women or white people this or that etc has changed the way I view racism. If someone thinks I'm over exaggerating ask anyone who adopts the rhetoric above this question

"" While I agree that red lining , lack of generational wealth, lack of education,  drugs in our community etc is the reason we commit more crimes and so on - Why did why white people enslave us?  "" 

The typical response implies white people are inherently evil in virtue of their race. The prejudice, discrimination and hate is all present by the far left especially.  With that said I have to reconcile this because my friends are some of the most loving people I know. They are there in my time of need , having loving families and even have white friends though they believe white people have some inherent urge to dominate other races that they battle with. 

How many of us have older grandparents that are racist but are good people? 

My grandfather grew up in the Civil rights Era and literally considered white people the Devil. We all understood where he was coming from however he was still racist. No one called him out or even avoided him when there was a family function because though he was racist we understood why. He was still an amazing person despite that. 

When it comes to white people they don't get a reason for why they enslaved our ancestors and it almost feels as people assume that black people have never enslaved anyone around the world. White people are often seen as having some inherent evil characteristic while we have reasons as to why we commit the most crime disproportionately and what not. 

With that said, racism today is almost treated as a black and white metric of whether you are a good person or not. There's degrees of racism like anything else and I believe it's better to understand why someone is racist and observe how they treat other people around them.

Edit : Many asking what is a good person. I'll provide an example , there's people who genuinely believe that men are superior to women by an appeal to men over representation in STEM, seemingly better chess players and what not. This is clearly chauvinistic and misogynistic but then does it follow they are terrible people ? Same with people who believe in race realism . They may genuinely believe that Asians or whites are genetically superior however are they suddenly bad people because of it ? 

I agree there's degrees of racism but would it be fair to deem any racist person as a bad person ? 

I would define a good person as caring for their loved ones , friends and treating other people like you would want to be treated."

4,2023-05-24,"cmv: in the film ""Scent of a Woman"", the character of Charlie Simms isn't really an example of integrity and Frank Slade is wrong",u/act-and-grant-w,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13qs03h/cmv_in_the_film_scent_of_a_woman_the_character_of/,changemyview,"What we are make to think is that the headmaster promised Charlie to give him a recommendation to get into Harvard if he told him who were responsible for the damage to his car, since he has the authority to submit one name of a student that can't afford the tuition to get into Harvard. But Charlie felt the moral dilemma of a bribe so refused. This made colonel Slade believe that he has integrity because he won't sell out his friends to buy his future to a prestigious college.

What I think is that his friends violated the rules of the school, damaged the property of the school, humiliated the headmaster, and tarmished the reputation of the institute. What they did was wrong. Charlie's duty was to report the culprits of the crime. When Frank Slate addressed the room by stating that as a possible future leader Charlie showed honesty, what he actually said is ""our future leaders should cover their friends when they are culprit of something, disobey the rules, prefer bravado to dedication to their jobs and duties"". This is morally worse, much worse than giving up the identity of your friends who wanted to misbehave.

This is my main point. But there is a second, minor one.

I'm starting to think that Charlie wasn't going to tell the culprits because he knew that he would not have got for real any advantage. He knew that the headmaster was just lying to get what he wanted, and that he should not trust him since he was powerless in case Harvard decided anyway to reject his application. What could he do, cry that they had a deal? I too can refuse all the gold of the world if I knew I'm not going to get it anyway, that doesn't mean I'm particularly honest. It's when I can really touch the gold in exchange for something that is morally debatable, that honesty can be truly tested. It's true that the headmaster proposed to expell Charlie for not testifying, but only after he refused to do so, and Frank Slate kicked in preventing to see if Charlie could change idea."

0,2023-05-24,"CMV: We shouldn't use the word ""Capitalism"" in economic discourse because we cannot agree on what it means.",u/EasilyRekt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13qsb8t/cmv_we_shouldnt_use_the_word_capitalism_in/,changemyview,"Exactly what it says on the tin, on the rare occasions I have gotten myself into an argument concerning economics, I will put in a concerted effort to avoid the word ""***capitalism***"".

I will often dance around it by using *the free market* or *a deregulated economy* and often ask others within these discussions to refrain from using ""***capitalism***"" as well. I do this for the very simple reason, because most likely, my definition of capitalism is **very** different from yours.

I am generally a strong advocate for a free or *freer* market, so I would define as a ""***capitalist***"" society would be a society where there is minimal to no governance on trade with no state recognized publicly owned industry nor state intervention within given sectors or their industries, thus creating an economy where providing value to others and good financial practices will result in the accruement of wealth whereas social parasitism and reckless spending result in the loss of wealth. Granted this societal model does have it's clear exploits and weaknesses but that's not what I'm here to argue.

However on the other side of the argument I've heard **wildly** different ways people have define the nebulous term of ""***capitalism***"";

* some may agree,
* some say it's just whatever the US has been doing,
* some who define it within and around corporations,
* some that only think it applies to monopolies,
* some that define it based of the Marxist definition so around assets and the acquisition of such,
* some say it's anything involving a currency and a ruling class, especially dictatorships (?????)
* some have said it's literally too hard to explain or even comprehend,
* and others just use it as a catch all to put everything they don't like about their current living situation in a *box of some kind.*

The problem with this loose and fluid definition is that two people can be arguing essentially the same point but disagree solely on the pretext of what ""***capitalism***"" means to them.

The US comes to mind on this point specifically, because given that the state both recognizes and either directly or indirectly supports an entire network of publicly owned and traded companies that, in turn, secures the wealth of an oligarchy who then use *their secured* wealth to lobby for monopoly protections so they can continue to profit uncontested; when laid out like that it's hard for me to call the US a ""***capitalist***"" society; instead I tend to call the US a ***Plutocratic Social Market***.

I know that it's a lot more wordy, but I think we can all agree that a ***Plutocratic Social Market*** is an economic system that doesn't help much of anyone but we can't fix but we *cannot* aim to fix it ^(or elect corrupt public officials to promise and fail to fix it) if we *cannot* agree on the fundamental definitions of the words used to describe it. We are just going to further entrench our conviction into our own increasingly radical and shortsighted solutions because the fundamentals of communication which is responsible for disparaging stupidity is broken due to the flawed understanding that everyone shares your definition of ""***Capitalism***"".

tl;dr: I think ""***cap'sm***"" means *no* gov'n't; you think ""***cap'sm***"" means *has* gov'n't; we both dislike the current social system; but we keep framing our arguments around ""***cap'sm***""; stop using ""***cap'sm***"" >:(

^(footnotes):

* It's not just ""***capitalism***"" it's any word that we can't define with consensus.
* I know that the definitions aren't the only impasse, but in my experience, being able to fully and accurately explain your pain points with something helps tremendously with cutting away extremist ideas and creating an environment of willing compromise or even collaboration.
* I'd also encourage you try doing it yourself for a little while because, for me, it has opened so much depth within the discussions I have had, and I think it can do the same for you."

The majority of the United States is either obese, overweight, or in an okay shape (borderline overweight) . We as a nation should be pushing for a healthy fit country instead. The rise in obesity is a major hurdle for healthcare, employment, and the environment. One solution I propose is that if someone reaches certain target they should get a financial reward in the form of cash or credit when they file their taxes. There could be different ways to do this but I think quarterly examinations including drug tests with your doctor would be a great start.

It would be funded from a tax on unhealthy foods: fast food, cookie and cake-based dessert snacks, candy, etc. There already similar systems in place with sin taxes and the resulting income going towards society like free community college, road repair, infrastructure improvements. How much would vary depending on cost of living and location but for example let say $2500 for majority of the country. By making sure they stay in shape they would get rewarded with essentially free rent for a couple months. Now this is for society as a whole and not the 1% who can afford to work out all day. So there should be income limits who qualify ($500,000 + disqualifies from the program). This program would only be for 18+ (dangerous to let developing teens to try and max for income also don't want parents abusing the program with their children as tools) and the tests would be very strict and would large over sight (hefty penalties and jail time for lieing about your results). This system initially would see very few qualifying for the rewards as design because we don't want weak requirements where everyone qualifies. It's not a handout nor is it welfare. It is design to reward and incentize people to get into shape. Being apart of the tax system would also give encouragement and a yearly reminder as well. If people don't want to stay in shape that's fine they don't get the reward come tax time. Ideally this reward would also encourage others who don't try initially but seeing friends and family workout for a reward they would be encourage to try as well. Also having that motivation whether it be for rent a nice toy or even help towards a vacation would do wonders for many."

In response to criticism that he manipulates the media, Watson has stated: ""What we do is provide the media with the kind of stories they can't resist... and this is how we bring attention to what's happening to the whales, the seals, the sharks and the other marine conservation campaigns we're involved in.""

""In 2009, Paul Watson claimed the organization has sunk ten whaling ships while also destroying millions of dollars worth of equipment. Their practice of attacking and sinking other ships has led to reports of injuries to other sailors as well as the Sea Shepherd crew, including concussions and complications from chemical attacks.""

""Sea Shepherd operations have utilized direct, non-lethal tactics including scuttling and disabling whaling vessels at harbor, intervening in Canadian and Namibian seal hunts,shining laser light at whalers, throwing bottles of foul-smelling butyric acid onto vessels at sea, boarding whaling vessels to protest while at sea, and seizing and destroying drift nets at sea.""

""1994, Sea Shepherd sank an illegal Norwegian whaling vessel. However, no charges were brought as the vessel had been involved in even more illegal behavior than anticipated by the authorities.""
 
After reading all of these I started to feel they were more terrorists than activists and while I do now they often act against illegal operations but ""stealing from a thief is still stealing"" and I don't think they have any right to vandalising and destroying fishing boats and equipment doesn't seem like justice to me.
I am also quite distrustful of them as Paul Watson clearly state they lie to the media to gain attention and support.
But with all that said I recognise i don't know much about them and most of my information comes from Wikipedia so I decided to come on here and see if anyone has a point or fact I haven't seen that might change my mind."

4,2023-05-24,CMV: We probably didn’t need to hit Hiroshima or Nagasaki with atomic bombs,u/FerdinandTheGiant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13r080z/cmv_we_probably_didnt_need_to_hit_hiroshima_or/,changemyview,"I’ll start with the main premise: the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not end the war in the Pacific (though they may have been a compounding factor) and did not need to be dropped on Hiroshima, much less Nagasaki. I will obviously expand on this but it’ll probably be best to try and tackle specific points which I can do in the comments. For now, let’s start with some quotes. 

**“I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on **the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary**, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives. **It was my belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of ’face’.** The Secretary was deeply perturbed by my attitude…”
- General Dwight Eisenhower, 1963

""**It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons.""**
- Admiral William D. Leahy, 1950

""’**the first atomic bomb was an unnecessary experiment.’ The Japanese, he noted, had ‘put out a lot of peace feelers through Russia long before’ the bomb was used.”**
- Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey, 1946

“we should have went after the military in Japan. They were bad. **But to drop a bomb on women and children and the elderly, I draw a line there, and I still hold it.""**
- Sergeant Joseph O’Donnell 

“The war would have been over in two weeks… **The atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all.”**
- General Curtis LeMay, 1969

These are some high ranking military figures from the time speaking on the bomb which some of you may find surprising, was controversial since it’s deployment. This of course was because it was used on heavily populated civilian populations without warning intentionally. 

In order to properly discuss the role of the bombs on the Japanese leadership we need to establish a few things. Japan’s official strategy was known as Ketsugo and was essentially a commitment to an armistice. Their goal was to force the US to a conditional surrender through a Vietnam type situation. Essentially their goal was to intercept Downfall (the Allies invasion strategy) and throw as many lives at it as possible. It was a strategy known as “The Glorious Death of One Hundred Million"" by the Japanese. This was because the US issued an unconditional surrender which put the Emperor in jeopardy and they would not budge until the Emperor was secured (hence why it wasn’t until the Byrnes note that the Emperor surrendered and is why he was never tired for war crimes). That point is very important, but only relevant to the bombs in so far as it meant even with them they were planning to face total destruction. Some argue that it was an issue of loss of life, but as many other tend to point out, the Bombing of Tokyo killed just as many if not more civilians and they were planning on total war Vietnam style. The only things the bombs would have successfully done to the Japanese was weaken the strength of their ketsugo strategy in the eyes of the Emperor as they had no means to prevent these attacks. This however did note require a city to be hit. All it would have required was a demonstration, and if that did not work, we could have hit an Arsenal. 

It is not as though this idea was not considered. Both committees (two were made for the bombings) considered pure military targets, Truman wanted military targets, and even other officials like  Marshall sought with a meeting with the Secretary of War to prevent that. This of course went no where. 

What we should have done was alter the Potsdam Declaration to allow for imperial retention, deploy a tactical/display bombing, slow down the rate of successive bombings and at least originally deploy them on military targets. Furthermore if civilian targets must be hit, doing so after the entry of the USSR would have been preferable. 

There’s a lot I could say on the subject as it is very nuanced so just ask in the comments. I’m very open to discussion."

2,2023-05-24,"CMV: Among those who want to end tipping culture in America, people who suggest boycotting the restaurants have no right to criticize the people who suggest that we stop tipping.",u/ayyycab,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13r1j1t/cmv_among_those_who_want_to_end_tipping_culture/,changemyview,"The suggestion to boycott restaurants gets almost zero criticism while the suggestion to stop tipping gets a ton of hate and the wildly different reactions make no sense to me.

For the record, yes I acknowledge that if people stop tipping, the first people to suffer financially will absolutely be the already underpaid staff. But I think that's also true if you boycott restaurants. The truth may even be that, in the absence of a legislative solution, we just have to accept that any community action to pressure restaurants will hurt the staff in the short term but benefit them in the long term. But that's not really what I'm here to talk about.

If you say we should collectively stop tipping, the jump-down-throat response is basically:

* The staff won't be able to survive
* You're an asshole for wanting to do something that makes the staff unable to survive
* Don't eat at the restaurant if you're not going to tip

What would happen if suddenly, everybody stopped tipping at a restaurant that usually pays $2.13/hr plus tips:

1. The staff gets $0 in tips
2. By law, their base hourly wage would have to be adjusted to meet the minimum wage.
3. Most of the staff would have less take-home pay. Resignations become more likely.
4. The restaurant would spend more on payroll due to being legally compelled to adjust everyone's pay.
5. The financial difficulties would beset the restaurant and its staff, so the restaurant would either shut down and put the staff in an even more vulnerable position (a lose-lose) or adapt and pay employees fairly to keep the restaurant open (a win-win).

What would happen if suddenly, everybody stopped eating at a restaurant that usually pays $2.13/hr plus tips:

1. The staff gets $0 in tips and the restaurant gets $0 in revenue
2. By law, their base hourly wage would have to be adjusted to meet the minimum wage.
3. Most of the staff would have less take-home pay. Resignations become more likely.
4. The restaurant would spend more on payroll due to being legally compelled to adjust everyone's pay. And without any revenue, the restaurant would decline much more rapidly.
5. The financial difficulties would beset the restaurant and its staff, so the restaurant would either shut down and put the staff in an even more vulnerable position (a lose-lose) or adapt and pay employees fairly to keep the restaurant open (a win-win).

Well would you look at that, it's two slightly different paths to the same situation in the end: people are getting paid less and the restaurant might close down and force everyone to look for new jobs. So wait a minute, why isn't anyone calling the pro-boycott side assholes too? Are they not also suggesting we do all do something that would potentially starve the very workers they claim to be supporting? How do you shoot down one idea by saying the workers will starve, and then turn around and suggest starving them anyway?"
724,2023-05-24,"CMV: America is fucked for the foreseeable future-- economically, socially, politically, and existentially.",u/GalacticLabyrinth88,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13r2qor/cmv_america_is_fucked_for_the_foreseeable_future/,changemyview,"And not enough people, at least from my perception, understand the gravity of the situation this country is currently in, or are part of the problem.

Examples, just off the top of my head:

\- Extreme political polarization that is only growing worse by the day, exacerbated by social media, infotainment ""news"" channels, and nowadays AI-generated misinformation and disinformation.

\- Many Americans actually and mind-bogglingly seem to want democracy to end, or are totally fine with fascists and authoritarians (or a con man) running the government as long as their in-group assumes power, wealth, and resources at the expense of everyone else. For instance, recently there was a guy who was arrested for ramming a U-Haul truck straight into the White House fence, brandishing a Nazi flag, and threatening the President and VP. Radical ideologies have become mainstream and have bubbled up on the surface, and 1/6 could have easily resulted in a successful totalitarian coup of the American government had a few things gone slightly differently. The FBI and CIA have been warning us of the rising threat of far-right domestic terrorism, and few people seem to be taking these threats seriously, least of all members in local and state politics. Elon Musk is helping Ron DeSantis run for election in 2024, when both of them have spouted anti-Semitic, right-wing, racist, and misogynistic rhetoric because of ""free speech"". We are on the cliff's edge of Handmaid's Tale or the Man in the High Castle. Have we learned NOTHING from WWII or the horrors of the Holocaust? 

\- The US is almost only a single week away from defaulting on its massive debt, which could destroy the economy, cause teachers (like me), military personnel, police, firefighters, and other government employees to stop getting paid, and inevitably bring about both a crash in the value of the US dollar, and general societal chaos. Yes, it is highly unlikely either political party in the government will allow the default to go through, but the Republicans are not helping with proposing massive budget and spending cuts that would hurt the poorest Americans the most, and probably lead to general societal instability in the long run anyways. Their arguments reek of hypocrisy, since they had no problem raising the debt ceiling several times during Trump's term, or Reagan's term, thanks to constant tax cuts for the rich and reckless spending, but now suddenly want to present themselves as the ""party of fiscal responsibility"" the minute a Democrat is in office.

\- The student debt crisis is reaching unforgivable and insane levels (we're on the precipice of exceeding $2 trillion in debt on top of interest). Meanwhile, no one seems to have a solution to the exponentially rising cost of college (to line the pockets of college admins and fund new bullshit building/marketing projects), which is making many people reconsider higher education entirely, and the prospect of a university degree unreachable to all but the very wealthy and well-to-do. Most Americans have been blatantly lied to about the value of their degree in the workplace, or the employment prospects of their courses of study (and now with AI a lot of people are going to start losing their jobs). They have been spoon-fed feel-good bullshit about ""following your passion"" and going to your ""dream school"" at all costs, only to find out after graduation that jobs are scarce and they will most likely not be making six figures right out the gate, and they will have bills to pay. 17 to 18 year olds are simply not well equipped to make massive financial decisions like college, let alone know what they actually want to do or the reality of their jobs, yet greedy student loan companies, colleges, and high school guidance counselors encourage them to borrow unlimited loans for expensive schools for the ""prestige"" factor, and shuttle them into a field of study before they even know what it is they actually desire. Then you have results like ex-grads regretting taking on thousands in student loans to go to law school or medical school and absolutely hating their lives (while on the opposite end you have people like me who are in jobs completely unrelated to their stupid degrees).

\- The US education and healthcare systems are in freefall and on the brink of collapse due to greed, mismanagement, corruption, and unequal access to millions of people. Many schools in particular do not have the resources to ensure their students get the best quality education (thanks to lack of funding and political will). This, on top of teaching no longer being considered a desirable job, wage stagnation, entitled parents, standardized testing/NCLB, and ruthless out of control students who have been permitted to indulge in their behavior because of crappy parents and a ""social promotion"" system that no longer allows students to fail nor face real consequences for their actions, has led to a crisis in education that will probably not be solved until it starts to affect society at large, or wakes up the fucking moronic politicians who have allowed the system to decay for their benefit. After all, a stupid population is much easier to control than one capable of critical thinking!

\- Rich oligarchs and corporations murdering the middle class, cannibalizing America's wealth, and seizing property, driving up home prices to the point most young people like me can never afford them.

\- Climate change, which many politicians continue to deny, or worsen by continuing to suck the cocks of oil tycoons and billionaire petro-moguls. These people will do anything, even destroy life on planet Earth, for money and influence. Pathetic.

\- Gun violence. No place is safe in this country anymore. None. All because of some idiot delusional incels, fascists, terrorists, or mentally ill people (who never got treated because of our broken, corrupt, unequal mental health system) who have decided to take out their anger and resentment against innocent people. This country is soaked in the blood and tears of *thousands* of schoolteachers, schoolchildren, parents, and people in general. Thousands of people that did not need to die or suffer knowing their loved ones died, but whose cries for change still have not been vindicated because of, again, moronic, selfish, psychopathic politicians and elites who care more about ""keeping their guns"" and kickbacks from the NRA than life itself, who care more about politics than preventing tragedies and massacres like the ones we've seen in Uvalde, Columbine, Aurora, etc. Everyone says thoughts and prayers, and it all has to stop, but there is NO ACTION.

\- Gerrymandering, voter suppression, and other sleazy tactics being used by the GOP to effectively end democracy in some US states because they're so concerned about ""election integrity"" (oh, and Trump saying he wants to rip up the Constitution, or Fox News commentators saying ""we need a new Hitler""). The truth is staring at people right in the face, but noooo it's the so-called ""left"" or Communists trying to take over America. I have not once seen someone attempt to enter the Capitol, or circumvent an election or whatnot while waving the Soviet/Chinese flag. Have you?

Give me at least one good reason why America isn't doomed to collapse within the next 5-10 years if not sooner."

Several times in both roles, an entire class or year group was punished for poor behaviour, and every single time I’ve felt it’s been a lazy and unfair approach to discipline.

The unfairness is mostly from the fact that it is extremely rare that the entire group was responsible for the poor behaviour. Rather, usually the more boisterous or poorly behaved students will engage, and the remainder of the class try and focus on their own work or don’t interfere either out of frustration or because they don’t want to be a singular voice of dissent in a group of people they have to spend most of their time with. This should be entirely understandable for school staff and administrators - expecting students to make themselves pariahs and punishing them in an equal manner to the troublemakers if they do not is an entirely unfair decision to push onto them. 

It’s also lazy for the same reason zero-tolerance policies are. It absolves schools of any responsibility to find the actual culprits and hold them accountable, and instead lets them wash their hands of the issue with one ham fisted blow that will punish the offenders and bystanders alike. Often, teachers and students are well aware of who the problematic students are, so I can’t imagine it’s particularly difficult for administrators to isolate and punish them.

I’m looking for reasons to cmv and show me why these sorts of punishments shouldn’t just be outright banned."

Anyway, i dont really smoke anymore because i grew out of it, but the amount of people that smoke all the time and dont believe it changes them at all are just plain dumb. 

“Weed is not addicting” yet before every move they need to rip the bowl

“Weed doesnt have any side effects, unless you smoke it on your lungs” … yet a lot of these people are late to things or losing miscellaneous items all the time. 

There are so many things, but i think so many of these people drank the kool-aid that it is some picture perfect drug. 

With every drug, it effects everyone differently and i know this does nit apply to everyone, but i think most people are a little too naive when it comes to smoking weed.

However, let's dive in:

With the rise of female sexual liberation and autonomy, there has been a greater normalization of casual sex, which benefits men as they're now able to increase their number of sexual partners without any emotional responsibility. Additionally, society still judges women harshly for doing the same, creating a double standard that benefits men. This reinforces the idea that men have a ""right"" to sex with women, and they expect it.

This leads to the objectification of women, where the media propagates the idea that women are sexually free, and this benefits men who consume this content the most. The more sexually liberated women become, the happier men are as they can exercise control and dominance, making women believe that they want it and turning them into ""objects of consumption"".

In conclusion, as a man who observes society, I have noticed that it is mostly men who push the narrative that women should liberate themselves and be sexually free. I started to wonder if there is something sinister behind this narrative, and after researching, I found that many feminists have already spoken about it. Therefore, I believe that female sexual liberation has benefited men more than women. I would like women, in particular, to try to change my perspective, as I am open to  debate.

Otherwise it's too strong, and if you do milk last, it makes it go ""weird"" when it enters the water.

Dating for most people isn’t easy but it feels natural. You meet people naturally, attraction grows naturally, you don’t have to manufacture chemistry etc. This is true for a lot of people, but it’s also completely untrue for some, especially for a lot of young men. Standards for dating have changed in the last decade in a way that excludes a portion of the male population to the point where giving up is the best choice.

Attempting to date causes a lot of needless stress. Because men are pursuers, we have to be the ones to put ourselves out there and risk getting rejected. Women typically don’t have to. Even the women that most would consider unattractive still have a lot of attention that they don’t realize.

As a result men are the ones that risk the emotional pain that is associated with rejection. Constant direct rejection takes a toll on you emotionally. It causes a lack of confidence, low self esteem, self doubt, and just general sadness. Putting yourself out there and trying to get someone to like your personality or physical appearance is a huge risk, and men who have no real hope are better off just giving up.

I also want to bring up how giving up can benefit someone. In my personal case, I started attempting to date from age 14 to the beginning of my last semester in college, at which point I was so busy I didn’t have time to try to meet women. My mind was off of dating and I was distracted. Just dropping dating from my life relieved an incredible amount of stress.

I realized that I was feeling better because I had given up. I wasn’t being constantly told I’m too ugly or my personality is too repulsive to date. I wasn’t constantly changing the person I was so that I could have a good personality just to be rejected again the next week. I want spending so much money on products and clothes to look better. Thugs became simpler. 

I also was distracted with other things in life and I realized that I doing feel miserable or lonely without a partner if I’m always working. I was working 40 hours a week, taking classes,and working on projects and the loneliness just never had time to set in. This can be done with just about anything. Occupying your time with some form of important or non important distraction completely pushes loneliness and the sadness out.

So for all the young men in my position, I would 100% them to simply give up and find distractions to improve their lives and mental health."

it is extremely annoying, droning and ugly way that we organise our current society. When i walk down the street i want to enjoy the beauty and atmosphere of where i am. if theres street art, even if i dont especially appreciate it, ik that its adding value to someone elses experience, but its not jumping out at me with a fake persona trying to make me buy shit. This form of street advertising, billboards etc should be straight up banned. replace it with literally fucking anything. it adds nothing to society except add to the never ending consumerism of modern culture.  


digital advertising should be mandated in such a way that theres at the very least always a paid version (with reasonable cost) that does not have advertising.  


like how do i find out about new businesses and products then? if its important word of mouth and genuine interest will lead you there. I live in melbourne, and if im looking for new restaurants ill walk down one of our many alleyways or suburban main streets looking for places id like to be. I try pretty hard to use my small local butcher, fruit/veg, bakery, restaurants etc instead of chains, and i almost never get ads for them, i find them naturally because they are in town and i walk through town sometimes. i almost never get advertisements from new/small businesses anyway, its always an established brand reminding me they exist. 

&#x200B;

If im starting a new hobby its because im either interested enough to do private research into it, or i have good friends who are already well versed in the hobby. I dont need thousands of ads pouring over me to inform me of shit i could be doing.  


and dont even get me started on gambling, alcohol, fast food and candy ads. persuading our society to worsen their health and go into poverty is not helpful to society.   


I honestly dont know how to deal with paid reviews, but to be honest thats not really relevant, because they already exist with or without ads."

14,2023-05-25,CMV: Rucho v. Common Cause (2019) was wrongly decided,u/CandyBroker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13rk0qg/cmv_rucho_v_common_cause_2019_was_wrongly_decided/,changemyview,"This landmark case ruled thar partisan gerrymandering claims were non-justicible and beyond the reach of federal courts. The ruling was 5-4 along ideological lines. 

In the majority opinion, Chief Justice Roberts reviews how partisan gerrymandering and frustrations with it are not new, and were in fact known the to Framers and the colonists. It's true, some historians think Virginia Govorner Patrick Henry instituted a series of laws to gerrymander James Madison (a federalist who convinced VA to ratify the new Constituion) into a district that was largely anti-federalist. He ran against future president James Monroe and prevailed in the end. 

In 1812, Elbridge Gerry signed into law a gerrymander favoring the Democratic-Republican Party. What isn't mentioned is the three-judge panel that drew the map and Gerry was ambivalent about signing it. Jumping to 1842, the Whigs in Congress pass the Apportionment Act to end at large Congressional districts in certain states, with several states vowing to resist it. Ironically, the Whig law pushing for fairer representation was weaponized against them, such as the Ohio state legislature gerrymandering Whig districts for Democrat ones. 

In 1901, many states redistricting did so for the last time until the 1960s. Not until Baker v. Carr did we reapportion states with the latter half of the 20th century. The precision of gerrymandering a as poor until now, using only county lines a as district boundaries. Then in yhe 1970s, California Democrat Phil Burton amassed support to gerrymander Republicans out of CA's delegation, using a manually made map with the kind of line precision we see in modern maps. 

Thomas Hoefeller took note of Burton's work and created a computer program to copy Burton's method, which later became Project REDMAP to help the GOP kindly return the favor. And post 2010 and Holder v. Shelby County, this aggressive style of gerrymandering remains. 

So what about Rucho and why do I think its wrong? Rucho was a story of two cases, one out of North Carolina and one out of Maryland (Lamone v. Bosiek). Democratic voters in NC and Republicans in Maryland sued the state map for partisan gerrymandering. After a trial period, both the US District Court of the Middle District of NC and the US DC of Maryland district ruled that these maps violated the Equal Protection clause of the 14th amendment and had numerous 1st amendment issues of harm as well. After all, it does preclude a voters ability to vote for the candidate they choose, making it harder to fundraiser, to get volunteers and hold rallies. The entire process of running for office is affected and trickles down to voters, whose choice is hindered. 

Roberts, speaking for the majority, held that thr solution was the voters voting in better representation, using state courts (although Moore v. Harper threatens this), and that independent redistricting committees can remedy this. Roberts also challenges the political science measures of partisan advantage like mean-median differences or efficiency gaps. They are flawed and newer, this is true, but that doesn't preclude us from using them to identify partisan gerrymandering. 

Additionally, this case misses the rarity of gerrymandering in history, that Congress can and has acted to address the issue, that members of the legislature van entrench themselves and their Congressional delegation to prevent such a remedy, misses that gerrymandering is the norm and has caused real harm. 

As such, I repudiate the Rucho majority. Yes Gill v. Whitford was a disaster that laid the groundwork for Rucho. But federal courts should still hear these cases. As Rucho did not overrule Davis v. Bandemare, which held thar partisan gerrymandering claims were justifiable but the court couldn't agree on the proper method. There is a way to work around Rucho through Bandemare. 

These do present justicible claims. Yes, ideally the people vote at high levels of turnout and Congress exercises it's power to end this mess best it can. Yes, the metrics to measure partisan gerrymandering are imperfect, yes ticket-splitting exists and electoral trends and demands of the electorate change. Yes it shouldn't be the courts doing this, but the majority opinion in Rucho is so greatly niave of what gerrymandering has become. Just because the Framers did do anything about, and provided to tools to rectify it, that these claims are beyond the reach of the federal courts. I find it hard to believe that two federal general district court judges in completely different places (politically speaking) got this issue wrong but Roberts and Co somehow know better. 

This is a blind approach to an undemocratic issue and I am disturbed by both the notion that SCOTUS won't intervene (except for racial gerrymandering and one person, one vote claims) nor will a federal judge now when people living under unfair representation seek injunctive relief. 

Change my mind, as there's only one delta to give. Also, bonus round for another delta, explain to me: Why one person, one vote doesn't nullify partisan gerrymandering?"
0,2023-05-25,CMV: Chronic depression and obesity is caused by epigenetic inheritance of the fetus's nutritional and metabolic prenatal environment.,u/squeakypiston,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13rkgni/cmv_chronic_depression_and_obesity_is_caused_by/,changemyview,"In my opinion there have been a lot of pseudo-scientific, pop-med, pop-psych narratives that have worked their way throughout the medical community without sufficient evidence regarding depression and obesity. Despite what is considered ""common knowledge"" when considering the evidence you will find that exercise and diet are both largely ineffective at treating both of these conditions. This problem is further worsened by non-specific confusing definitions for conditions like depression. To be completely clear I am referring to chronic bio-chemical depression not environmentally driven feelings of sadness.  

Like a large portion of the scientific community at first glance I thought they must have a genetic or poly genetic origin. We know that both conditions are heritable and run in families. The problem is even if you consider that without natural selection some genes are able to spread unrestricted because of the homogeneity of our genome and the incidence of both conditions rising dramatically it is impossible that these conditions have a purely genetic origin. The answer must lie in epigenetics.

It is well understood that offspring of mothers that are deficient in nutrients 	have a significantly higher chance for chronic illness in their lives. At first glance one might assume that it is difficult to be nutrient deficient in the US but it's likely very common. Even worse is the fact that nutrient requirements and mechanisms aren’t well understood meaning our nutrient deficiencies may be worse than we know. Additionally we are learning that there are many mechanisms in the body that if dysfunctional will cause nutrient deficiencies even despite proper diet. 

New evidence suggests that not just lack of nutrients has lasting epigenetic detriment to a fetus. Chronic insulinogenic diets consisting of highly processed carbohydrates have been shown to have life long epigenetic effects on rats. The link between these diets and chronic disease has been growing in strength whilst the claim that meat was the source of heart disease and cancer has been repeatedly discredited. While weak, recent evidence suggests that meat based diets such as keto, carnivore, and paleo have positive impacts on health and I suspect that the impact on the fetus would remain positive. This is consistent with the fact that we evolved hunting the majority of our calories. It makes perfect sense that those metabolic pathways would be the healthiest for a fetus.

Here is an example. The mitochondria of your cells have something called the cell danger response cycle. This represents your innate immunity. If your cells get stuck in this cycle never returning to homeostasis you are likely to incur chronic health problems. I predict that we will find that this CDR genetic expression is inherited from the mothers biological environment. Not through your nuclear genes for mitochondrial genes. This is great news because hopefully we will have treatments for depression and obesity soon enough."
0,2023-05-25,CMV: private schools in the UK are completely unjust and should be abolished.,u/Ultravox147,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13rl725/cmv_private_schools_in_the_uk_are_completely/,changemyview,"It's no secret that private schools (in the UK and I suppose the US since they're relatively similar) are often filled with only the children of the upper middle classes and upper class, where students will receive a better education, contacts and reputation that give them a ridiculously unfair advantage in life compared to their publically funded peers. 

You can see this evidenced in pretty much every high-level government position, and the bias is only more pronounced the higher you go. Judges, for example, have about 70% of them being from a private school (which is shocking, since only about 7% of students nationally go to one). About 23 of our prime ministers have even been to THE SAME SCHOOL, and of the others an extremely small minority of the modern PM's are state educated. 

This represents unbearable unfairness and while being born poor will forever be a disadvantage, it needn't be so crippling. Private schools serve a crucial role in upholding the class system and preventing any upwards mobility that should be available to people, especially talented ones."
26,2023-05-25,CMV: It is logically consistent to stop boycotting an artist when they’re dead,u/El_dorado_au,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13rm9je/cmv_it_is_logically_consistent_to_stop_boycotting/,changemyview,"Content warning: sexual abuse

I started boycotting Rolf Harris’ works once I found out that there were credible allegations against him of sexual assault. He was subsequently jailed for his crimes for a few years. I assume his advanced age was a reason why the sentence was so short, but haven’t bothered checking. To my knowledge he hasn’t apologised for his crimes, apart from possibly a single letter written to one of his victims or her parents, even after his prison sentence. Now it’s been revealed that he died a few weeks ago.

I had hoped that by boycotting his works, it would have helped influence him to try to partially heal the damage he’d done to his victims. The reason that I had hope that he’d do that is that he once expressed regret about a verse of “Tie me kangaroo down, sport” which offended Aboriginals, and to a lesser extent that he seemed to be a decent person in public - I know he’d hide the fact he was a rapist or child molester, but I thought you’d still somehow be able to tell the person was somewhat horrible. Also, the social opprobrium placed on Harris wasn’t just by me but widespread - as well as being jailed he had awards taken away, memorials destroyed by their owners, his artwork was not broadcast, and subsequent media coverage primarily referred to him as a sexual abuser and only secondarily as a musician and celebrity. Since the opprobrium was widespread, my decision to boycott was part of a non-trivial reaction that’d make him consider what he ought to do.

Now that he’s dead, I regard it as futile to continue boycotting his artwork. It’s hypothetically possible to make his family or associates denounce his abuse, but I’d probably see that as just protecting their royalty income rather than something genuine. It’s possible that people who knew about Harris’s crimes but chose to be complicit may be getting royalties, but there hasn’t been any campaign to target these individuals so my boycott won’t be effective.

The view I want changed is that it’s logically consistent to have boycotted in the past but to stop boycotting now. The opposite would be that it’s only logically consistent to either never boycott (or that the boycott should have stopped at some point before he died) or boycott forever, or that only one of those two options is logical. One assumption I make is that survivors of sexual abuse or their families want the perpetrator to express remorse.

To pre-empt some points: if someone wants to argue that some of the abuses he was accused of didn’t happen, that in itself is not sufficient. I’d need convincing evidence that I should doubt that he committed any abuse at all. And to those asking if I’d view the artworks of Hitler, I’d say that Hitler’s artworks are only notable because of Hitler himself, whereas Harris’s art was notable. Also, for those arguing that Harris’s music is overly sentimental or old-fashioned or lacking in talent, I’d say that’s not a moral issue.

Change my view."
11,2023-05-25,CMV: Weapon Durability/Breaking in Zelda games (BOTW and TTOK) is functionally no different than weapon ammunition in FPS or other games.,u/Ebolinp,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13rmo9m/cmv_weapon_durabilitybreaking_in_zelda_games_botw/,changemyview,"Okay now that the latest Zelda game, TTOK is out, I have to make this CMV which I've been thinking about since BOTW.  The complaints about weapon breakage and durability are something that we saw a lot of during BOTW and it's come back in TTOK.  So I want to raise a point that I've not seen much talk about if any that counters that complaint.  I'm probably not the only person who thinks like this too so I'm not claiming some great insight but I certainly haven't seen this response anywhere to the overwhelming complaints about weapon breakage.

With that out of the way I want to emphasize that this is about ""functionality"" not about feels or how close it matches to some sort of expected reality.  If you don't like the weapon system because it ""Feels"" wrong to be in a Zelda game or you think that swords should be more durable because every other sword game is like that, that's a different argument.  What I am going to point out is that this system that Zelda uses is no different than systems gamers are already 100% comfortable and accepting of in other games, if you agree with that then maybe we can discuss why it's a good or bad system for a Zelda game.

So to refresh people in the latest Zelda games, when you pick up a weapon (Sword, Bow, spear etc.) it doesn't last forever, it will break after a certain amount of hits.  Each weapon has a certain durability (hits) before it is broken and destroyed and removed from inventory.  That means you must constantly acquire new weapons as the old ones will break.

My view is that this is functionally EXACTLY the same as a weapon ammo system in any number of FPS games.  Let's say you're playing Halo for example, and you pick up an assault rifle, that rifle will get a certain number of shots (hits) before it runs out of ammo and is completely unusable as a gun.  Now the weapon may not be ""destroyed"" as an ""ammo"" depleted sword in Zelda might be but it's just as useful, and you'll drop it very quickly if you don't find more ammo.  The only way to get more shots is to find a new weapon or more ammo.  Which is exactly what you'd do in Zelda to be able to use your sword (or every other weapon) again. This is even more apparent when we think of a plasma rifle, which when running out of ammo, can't be recharged and you must find a new one. In a way you can think of all the available weapons in Zelda as a large selection of guns which have very specific ammo.

  
What this means is that the Zelda weapon system, while different than other RPG games, is functionally no different than the plethora of FPS games out there.  Which makes the complaints about Zelda's system dumbfounding because absolutely nobody has a problem with weapon ammo systems, nobody expects unlimited shots from a plasma rifle or sniper rifle or whatever, but people overwhelmingly think that the Zelda system is bad/don't like it/doesn't make sense, is new and punishing etc.  When it's not.  It's a well used and well accepted system.

Now I don't really want to make this a debate about whether this is the right system or not to be used in Zelda.  All my point is is that it's nothing new, it's something we're used to, and understanding this and changing how we perceive it, i.e. changing the framework in which we view the game, can help us feel better about the system and not be so upset when our weapon breaks/runs out of ammunition.  Which, again, is an experience we're all quite used to and accepting of.

Or maybe not, try to CMV.

TLDR: Weapon breakage in Zelda games is functionally exactly the same as weapon ammunition in FPS and other games.  Therefore people shouldn't be so upset about it as a system since everyone should be pretty used to weapons running out of ammo and having to find new ones."

I can understand that people need a job to do, and that people shouldn't be lazy or decadent.

Then again, many aspects of Capitalist ideology lack a human-oriented foundation, and instead the foundation of Capitalist ideology is founded on heartless, cold logic and reason.

One glaring example of the heartless process of Capitalism is a mass layoff. Mass layoffs are usually based in financial origins, and even if the company itself does not condone a mass layoff, there is no stopping this process of capitalism from ruining the livelihood of all those workers.

Those workers may be strong contributing members of society, who put effort into their work to live a good life, yet it means absolutely nothing in regards to the financial processes that determine their employment. For instance, if there was a recession or depression which caused financial problems for businesses.

So, even those workers who parade their capitalist ideology could easily fall prey to those same inhuman, capitalistic processes.

I don't care about your summer home, your passive income, or your company. All I hear is someone trying to make money for doing nothing while other people are actually living in the home. If you could only own one home, the home you actually live in so many problems would be solved. Generational wealth would be forced to invest in other areas, real estate prices would plummet allowing more people to own a home instead of renting, local communities could thrive because they would encourage to settle down instead of constantly recoating to find affordable rent, etc. I have yet to hear a single reason why someone should be able to own multiple homes other than just pure greed."

34,2023-05-25,"CMV: It is morally inconsistent to be against book bannings in American Schools but support banning Salman Rushdie's ""The Satanic Verses""",u/sbennett21,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13rq3p0/cmv_it_is_morally_inconsistent_to_be_against_book/,changemyview,"My opinion is basically that of the title: If you believe all of the attempts to ban books in American schools are wrong, it is morally inconsistent to be okay with countries banning Salmon Rushdie's book ""Satanic Verses"".

Maybe no one believes that banning in the first case is wrong and the second case isn't wrong. That's not material to my point that it would be morally inconsistent for anyone to do so. My suspicion is that there are people who haven't fully thought through their positions or the moral foundations for their political positions, or only take positions because their team does, not because of consistent moral principles.

What I mean to be morally consistent is to apply the same moral principles in one situation that you apply in another equivalent situation, unless you can show that the situations are different in relevant ways. Some examples:

* If you believe that people's right to bodily autonomy justifies abortions at any point in the pregnancy, you have to believe that something is fundamentally different about the issue of vaccination to believe that bodily autonomy doesn't justify refusing vaccinations, or you are being morally inconsistent.
* If you believe that, after a mass shooting or other horrific crime by someone of X ideology, you should wait for more information and try to understand the systemic issues involved before making huge judgements, you should extend the same courtesy to crimes by people of Y ideology.
* If you preach that it is immoral for other people to have affairs, it's morally inconsistent for you to turn around and have an affair.
* Many 2nd ammendment proponents of gun rights don't support individual ownership of nuclear weapons because they believe the role of nukes is different enough that different principles should be applied.
* If you believe that a group of people in a geographic area that vote in a free and fair election to become an independent country have a right to then be a sovereign independent country, that should extend to every instance of this.
* Etc.

My focus is not on whether I agree or disagree with the positions listed above, just that I think it's important to be morally consistent. Additionally, this post isn't about whether banning books is moral or not, just about morally consistency in banning books.

The main responses I anticipate are whether or not there are valid reasons why the two situations are different in relevant ways:

""The US has free speech, the countries banning The Satanic Verses don't"" - if you believe free speech is a correct principle/human right, you should believe that other countries should respect it, too. If you believe that they can culturally reject it, see my next point.

""Different cultures have the right to treat these issues differently"" - If a country can believe that banning a religiously blasphemous book is okay, then a school board can believe that banning a religiously blasphemous book is okay, right? If being a different culture or having different beliefs makes banning books okay, then you shouldn't have an issue with people banning books in the US because they believe their children shouldn't be exposed to porn in schools, or even if their belief is just that a government conspiracy is trying to brainwash their children with certain books.

""Blasphemy is a real issue, gay panic is not"" - again back to my previous point. Both of these points rely on a priori moral statements about the world - the truth of Islam and the truth of the immorality of LGBTQ, respectively.

tl;dr: I'm open to other perspectives, but these are my thoughts: It's morally inconsistent to find it 1. immoral to ban books in the US, but 2. moral to ban The Satanic Verses in other countries. There isn't anything that justifies these being so distinct of issues as to make believing in both positions morally consistent.

Edit: My views have been changed in the following ways:

I had viewed free speech as a universal moral principle, like freedom from slavery. If you view free speech or lack thereof as a national sovereignty issue, something that can be decided by a given country, then it can be morally consistent to hold the two positions I mention.

If your views of banning books is on a book-by-book basis, and you have a reason for banning one book \[The Satanic Verses\] that doesn't apply to other books, then this can also be a morally consistent position to hold.

Clarification Edits:

A lot of people are stuck up on the word ""ban"" when applied to school libraries. I do understand that it's not the same as a legal prohibition in a country against printing or distributing a book. 

Because I think that that sort of legal prohibition is worse than removing a book from a school library, I \*do\* think you can have a morally coherent position that is the opposite of the one in my title - namely \*for\* book ""banning"" in schools, but \*against\* countries banning The Satanic Verses.  My main issue is the other way around. "

0,2023-05-25,CMV: AGI is impossible,u/BellowingOx,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13rqfpi/cmv_agi_is_impossible/,changemyview,"There is no doubt that Artificial Intelligence has begun a new technological era and that it will have dramatic consequence on human life.

However, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), as commonly defined, is an impossible fantasy.

AGI is commonly defined as *an AI agent capable of accomplishing any intellectual task that a human being can*.  What people imagine when they speak of AGI is basically another human being that they could talk to that could give them better answers to any question than any other human being.

But I believe that achieving this with a machine is impossible for two reasons.

The first reason is that artificial intelligence, no matter how advanced, is fundamentally **incapable of understanding**. AI can certainly give the appearance of understanding. But the nature of Large Language Models like ChatGPT, for example, is that they work by statistical word-by-word prediction (I am told, even letter-by-letter prediction).

This is entirely different than understanding.  Understanding has to do with grasping the first principles of knowledge. It means ""standing underneath"" the thing understood in the sense of getting to the very bottom of it. Though, it is true, there is a lot that we don't understand, we are at least capable of it. I am capable of understanding what beauty is, even if my understanding is limited.  AI may able to spit out a definition of the word ""beauty"", but that not the same as understanding what the word means.

The bizarre errors that AI currently makes demonstrates its total lack of understanding (i.e., [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13p7t41/anyone\_able\_to\_explain\_what\_happened\_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13p7t41/anyone_able_to_explain_what_happened_here/) ) AI can only approximate understanding. It cannot achieve it.

Now perhaps, someone might argue that the AI's lack of understanding is not a problem. As long as its knowledge goes deeper than a human beings knowledge in every area, it can still become better than humans at any intellectual task.

But this runs into a problem that is the second reason AGI is impossible: Namely, that **the world is infinitely, fractally complex**. This means that no AI model could ever be trained enough to make up for its lack of understanding. Sure, it can improve in its approximation of understanding, but this approximation will always contain errors that will spoil its calculations as they are extrapolated.

Because the world is infinitely complex, the complexity of the hardware and software needed to handle more and more advanced AI will increase exponentially.  There will soon come a time that the AI's ability to manage its own complexity will be an even heavier task than the tasks it was made to accomplish in the first place.  This is the same phenomenon that occurs when bureaucracies become so bloated they collapse or cease serving their purpose - they can become so complicated that just managing themselves becomes a more complicated task than solving the problems they were made to deal with.

In short, I expect AI to advance greatly, but due to the complexity of the world, AI will never be able to sufficiently compensate for its lack of understanding.  Sure, within specified, well-defined domains, it can certainly exceed human abilities in the way that a calculator exceeds my math abilities. But its lack of a grasp of first principles will prevent it from being able to integrate everything in the way that a human being is able to do.

&#x200B;

**Edit #1:** After responding to many comments, it seems clear to me now that the fundamental disagreement in this debates comes down to whether one has accepted the philosophy of materialism. Materialism says that human beings are nothing more than matter. If that is the case, then, of course, why couldn't a machine do everything a human can do and more? However, I don't accept materialism for the following reasons:

1. If humans were only matter, then what accounts for their unity of being? If I am nothing more than a heap of many atoms, then what makes me one single conscious person?
2. If humans were only matter, then what accounts for their personal continuity over time? If I my molecules change out every few years, then why do I not cease to exist after a few years?
3. If human beings were only matter, then how can they grasp universals? A particular is something here and now like ""this man."" A universal something always an everywhere like ""man"" (as in humanity).  We gain our knowledge of universals through abstracting them from particulars. However, physical molecules in the brain are finite particulars. Therefore, there needs to be an immaterial part to us to be able to grasp universals which are not particular (edit: this formerly said ""finite"" instead of ""particular"", but particular is the better word).
4. I think that good and evil, truth and falsity are not reducible to matter. Our mind can understand them. Therefore, we human beings have something immaterial to us.

Perhaps this might sound religious to some people. But what I saying right now comes from Aristotle.

It was not my intention to have a philosophical discussion like this, but the objections people are bringing seems to make it necessary.

**Edit #2**: I am a bit surprised at how unpopular my position is. I felt that I made at least a reasonable case. As of now, 9 out of 10 voters have downvoted it. (**Edit #3:** now it has an upvote rate of 31%, but reddit's upvote rate seems glitchy, so I don't know what the truth is).  Perhaps my claim is perceived as too sweeping saying that AGI is fundamentally impossible rather than saying it is nowhere near within sight. I did give a delta to the person who expressed this the best. Nevertheless, I am surprised by how many people for some reason seem repulsed by the idea that human beings could perhaps be something more than computers."

I did hear a new one today which I still disagree with but would like to see if anyone has any I haven't heard that make sense. Here are the arguments I've heard so far. :

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Argument 1: Men are physically stronger than Nonmen.**

*Counterpoint: Generally this is true but this would mean we should draft not based on gender but based on size. Statistically speaking, some races are biologically stronger than others, meaning that you would need to support  race based drafting as well, which I think most would be against. In addition to this, this would mean a couch potato man would be drafted instead of a Olympic athlete nonman who would be far more capable.*

**Argument 2: Nonmen aren't suited for combat**

*Counterpoint: Nobody is suited for combat. It's not really something you could ever prepare for and it's one of the reasons many people choose not to join or continue serving. Along with that not every job requires combat and there's so many places people could fill to support whether it be a mechanic, nurse, cook, driver, pretty much whatever job you can think of in the normal world would be needed in this situation.*

**Argument 3: Nonmen shouldn't be drafted because we would need to increase the population**

*Counterpoint: This is the new argument and this one is pretty out there. In order for this to make sense there would need to be a sort of 'baby draft' which we all likely see the issue with. And since this is in the same vein, that ""abortion rights"" argument also doesn't work because this means that if the right to abortion remains then non-men should be drafter but this doesn't alter peoples mind.*

**Argument 4: ABC doesn't have XYZ rights.**

*Counterpoint: I don't think you'll find a single group who unanimously agrees that they have all the rights they could ever want. If we were to base the draft on this then I don't think we'd be able to draft a single person.*

These are the 3 main arguments I've seen and disagree with. The reason I think everyone should be drafted is because over time people have fought for all races, sexualities and genders to be in the military with most recently transpeople not only being able to enlist, but also receive gender affirming surgery. Maybe in the past this made sense, but many of these people are thriving and having successful careers mainly due to technology now allowing for a significantly lower standard of strength and fitness needed to be of use. This is saying that nonmen should have the choice but not the obligation which I think completely goes against where our culture is headed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Tl;Dr: So long as someone is of reasonably sound body and mind, I think they should be eligible to be drafted in the event it's necessary.**

I think everybody is well aware of the horrible conditions that occur in the large corporations of the meat industry. I can see why it is hard for individual people to do anything about it. But what I don't understand is why veganism is criticized so harshly on the internet, often seen as uptight, self righteous, pushy. 

Intelligence argument: Animals are dumber than us. Therefore, their lives are worth less. But we could say same for humans with disabilities. Intelligence isn't a reliable way of deciding the value of a life. 

Nature argument: Animals eat each other in nature. They do that to survive. They don't breed animals for the sole purpose of survival. Also, we can't rely on nature as our moral compass. Animals cannibalize each other, even their own offspring sometimes. That's not moral. 

""Don't control my life"": If we can't prove that what we are doing is moral, then we can't say ""don't control my life"" when it is morality at stake. Sorry if this is an extreme example, but the only thing I can think of is slavery. Slavery was around for centuries just because people just let it be, (specifically in America), people just let it be because it benefited them, they enjoyed it, it wasn't affecting them. For a while, the north just kept pushing back the issue of slavery because it wasn't affecting them. They thought it was wrong, but the south refused to change, essentially saying ""don't control our way of life."" Even though their way of life was immoral. 

Humans and animal lives are inherently and intrinsically different: Once again going back to the slavery example, people said that white people and black people were just different. They drew the line at skin color. We draw the line at species. How do we know our current line drawn is right? We can't rely on the ""we are different"" argument since that has been used for centuries. 

Religious argument: God put animals on this earth to be eaten. But once again, religion was used as a justification for a lot of immoral things in the past. For example, the Spanish were Christian, and set up camps to convert natives to Christianity, also horribly harmed them because they thought they were inherently superior. I think that is immoral. So I don't think the religious argument can be applied here when dealing with the value of life. 

I don't think everybody should become vegan. There are people who are starving, and the only way they can get food is by raising their animals to eat. I also don't think that's fair for carnivorous pets, such as dogs, who need meat in their diet. I'm arguing purely based on the morality of breeding animals just to kill them later. 

This post is merely a thought experiment/discussion, I'm not equating eating meat to slavery, I hope that's not how it comes across."

We are bound to experience reality subjectively, and we cannot access what reality is like in an objective sense at all, since that would require us to leave our sentience behind... 

&#x200B;

I shall start with some definitions to clarify what the words mean:

&#x200B;

Sentience - The capacity to experience, to have sensations, to have feelings. 

Subjective - Influenced by personal experiences and aspects that come along with sentience (such as opinions, feelings, tastes etc.)

Objective - Not influenced by personal experiences and aspects that come along with sentience. 

&#x200B;

From these definitions I think it is fair to say that anything we can discuss or conceive is subjective in some sense. This is because...

1. We cannot access anything other than our own experiences/sentience
2. Perception is influenced by sentience, and is thus subjective experience and not a direct access to objective reality (as some people seem to think).
3. Everything we can discuss is influenced by our sentience. From the words we use and the meanings we ascribe them to the values and beliefs we hold. 

Ultimately we all start from positions of subjectivity. However, humanity is a social animal. We must agree on things to cooperate. This is where objectivity comes in. Our working towards objectivity represents our desire to establish ""facts"" about reality beyond our experiences as humans. Of course, since we use words to represent facts, they are never going to be entirely objective. Words are bathed in subjectivity, as meaning very much relies on sentience. However, through assuming a foundational principle like: ""we can trust our sense data"" or a value based principle like ""physical harm is bad"", we can 'objectively' say ""the measurement is 10cm"" or ""murder is bad"". This allows us to discuss our perceptions, our scientific theories, our moral rules/ethical theories in an objective sense.  

Additionally we are all humans, and as a result, we have relatively similar biology. From this commonality we assume that our perceptive experiences are similar, but also our values and needs in life are similar. Of course, fundamentally, perception, values and needs are subjective. But if we agree on them, we can consider them ""objective"" in a sense. This is why I believe it is okay to say ""objectively there is a table there"" when two people perceive a table. There is no such thing as a table in objective reality, but in terms of working towards being as objective as possible, we can agree that there is a table. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To me this explains why you cannot prove something like round-earth to a flat earther. A flat-earther, when shown pictures of a round earth, will say that the government is lying. If you take them out to space and show them the earth, they may claim it is a hallucination or a trick, perhaps an illusion of the telescope? How do you know your eyes aren't deceiving you? Their foundational principle that you cannot trust the government becomes more foundational then the principle that they should trust their sense data. If someone cannot accept the principle that empirical data is useful in working towards objectivity, there is essentially no way to 'objectively' prove the shape of the earth to them with physical evidence. 

Similarly, it explains why people argue so much about the objectivity of morality. Values are subjective, as they are not only influenced by our sentience, but entirely rely on it to exist. However, we may share similar lives with other humans and as a result share similar values. If we can agree on a foundational values like ""harm is bad"", ""happiness is good"", ""it is wrong to steal"", we can make 'objective' moral statements - or more accurately put - we can move towards a sense of objectivity regarding those topics. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As a result, I propose that we think of subjectivity and objectivity as ends of a scale, and not two distinct categories. Subjectivity is unavoidable as we are subjects of reality, but objectivity can be worked towards (and in turn subjectivity reduced). 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is really complicated of course, so feel free to ask questions. I am only recently forming and wording this belief, and I am posting here to I can more 'objectively' examine it (by considering the subjective opinions of others)."
512,2023-05-26,CMV: I could beat a Cheetah in a fight to the death,u/FerdinandTheGiant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13sjwyi/cmv_i_could_beat_a_cheetah_in_a_fight_to_the_death/,changemyview,"An adult cheetah weighs 46 to 160 pounds, so for my hypothetical, we’ll say the Cheetah I am fighting is on the lower end of that around 50-70 lbs standing at 4 ft tall. 

I weigh in at roughly 150 lbs (2-3x) the weight of the Cheetah, and am 6’1. 

The cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small to medium-sized prey weighing 20 to 60 kg (44 to 132 lb), but mostly less than 40 kg (88 lb) with their diet relying partially on their location. For instance, the  Asiatic Cheetah tend to eat much smaller game. Additionally, there’s no record of cheetah’s ever killing a human in the wild. To kill medium- to large-sized prey, the cheetah bites the prey's throat to strangle it, maintaining the bite for around five minutes, within which the prey succumbs to asphyxiation and stops struggling. Unfortunately for the Cheetah I know this and would not keep my neck exposed. 

Basically, Cheetah, especially a smaller one, are not used to large ~~prey~~ organisms such as myself and don’t tend to engage with humans. They also are generally very timid animals. 

While Cheetah claws are sharp, they don’t use them for combat necessarily nor would I be unable to restrict them physically (given this is a smaller cheetah). 

It is my view that I could beat it to death before it could kill me. It doesn’t have time to stalk and we both know about the other. To CMV, I would want to see some good arguments about why I or realistically any large person, couldn’t beat a smaller cheetah in a fight.

Edit 1: For some reason I’m getting notifications of comments and can see the start of them but can’t see them when I click on any of them or the post.

Edit 2: As others have pointed out, the claws will not be a threat when it comes to lethal damage. However I would give a delta to anyone who could show that cheetahs utilize their back legs while grappling.


#Edit F:

This got a lot bigger than I expected so I apologize if I did not address you. That said, ultimately I think my view has not changed much. That said, a few of you made good points that the hind claws would be an issue I wasn’t really accounting for, though as others have pointed out in support, their claws are not sharp like other large cats and generally aren’t used to cause lethal harm. Others have also pointed out that restraining it would be difficult and I agree but I think the consistent comparison to small animals is not a good way to demonstrate that. Based on my experiences, grappling large animals is much easier than small ones and while a house cat might “fuck me up”, it’s only in a superficial sense. I’m not of the opinion I could just walk away without injury, but I am still of the opinion I could kill it. I found someone who claims [he worked at a zoo](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/debm37/comment/f2u8lzg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and a 100 lb Cheetah was nearly beaten unconscious by a 6’3, 230lb man. I don’t scale to that, but neither does the cheetah. I also feel I should add, I am certainly skinny but far from the skin and bones some of y’all think. I have a fairly low body fat content and what I would consider an average to above average build. I think some of y’all overestimate Cheetah as well. This one isn’t blood lusted and while it won’t run away per say, it also isn’t throwing itself at me. I think if it was in the wild I’d actually have a better chance given they don’t have good endurance."

0,2023-05-26,CMV: Mortal Kombat's Fatalities Ruin the Narrative,u/Dawntodusk87,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13sp0hv/cmv_mortal_kombats_fatalities_ruin_the_narrative/,changemyview,"In the video game franchise, Mortal Kombat, every mainline game has finishing moves where the winner can kill the loser. When the series began, this was an effective way to stand out in the fighting game market, but it feels like a relic that is only in the series out of a sense of necessity now.

Most professional tournament players do not do fatalities at official matches because it takes too long and gets boring. If anything, it is also annoying that the game pesters you to do them for in-game rewards since it can feel tiring to see them over and over again. Most online players just shrug off the commands to ""finish him/her"" at the end because everyone has already seen them.

In addition to feeling like an outdated feature, it ruins the narrative in place. It made sense when the series first began and the set-up was just a tournament with 7 fighters with little backstory, but as the series grew more complex and added more and more lore and behind-the-scenes character interactions, being able to make anyone kill anyone else started being offputting and nonsensical. The fully cinematic storylines of the Netherealm reboot era only made this more jarring.

For example, in Mortal Kombat X, the story showcases several newcomers who are the children of previous characters. In the story, you can see Jax talk about how he would do anything to defend his only daughter from danger; in a non-story mode, you can watch Jax violently rip her head open and use it as an ashtray. MKX and MK11 also have in-game interactions; many interactions between characters who are allies have casual banter about story events or just offer a friendly challenge. Cut to gameplay and they start breaking bones, knocking out teeth, etcetera.

Without the story, Mortal Kombat is just a story of heinous people who try to kill each other all the time.

MK 11 brought back Friendships which are a way to end a match in a friendly manner which is actually my preferred choice for match-ups where the characters are allies.

MK 12 has all but confirmed that fatalities are coming back again with intense violence in its trailer. The story is always something I look forward to because I actually do find the Mortal Kombat story interesting to learn about, but being able to just off-handed make anyone kill each other ruins the character interactions the series is trying to push.

The fix for this, I suppose, would be to remove the ability to make characters kill allies or to drop fatalities entirely since they have started to become a pointless ceremony that not many people make use of. However, it seems almost certain Mortal Kombat 12 will have the same issue return."

Over the past 15 years we've had a number of people coming into the lime light preaching the benefits of keeping our silence. From Susan Cain, (who even titled her book ""Quiet."") to [Dan Lyons](https://www.amazon.com/STFU-Power-Keeping-Mouth-Endlessly/dp/B0B1KRJ6XN/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1679887254&sr=8-2), it seems that nowadays, reserve, if not encouraged, is at least being admired in many sections of western society. However, I think we may be overplaying the advantages that come through being part of the quieter crowd, especially when it comes to achieving career, business or dating success.

1. In careers, the babble hypothesis asserts that we pay attention to the most talkative people in a group and usually end up giving them [leadership positions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984320300369). Talkative people are seen as more competent and intelligent even though there is no real evidence behind this. This perception makes it easier for chatty people to rise to the top of the ladder than it would for a reserved person, especially in careers that have no objective performance metrics.
2. In business, talkative people are at an advantage. Firstly, because they like to talk a lot, they are more likely to harness the power of serendipitous encounters to find chance business opportunities. Since success in business involves a lot of chance and randomness, pointing your sails in a direction which will harvest the positive effects of randomness can only be seen as a boon. Also, thanks to all their experience with talking, they are easily more memorable with strangers. Many in the marketing world will tell you that being remembered increases your chances of getting picked. It may be no wonder why most sales people tend to be very talkative, at least in their careers.
3. In dating, many of the points I've listed for business may also apply. Talkative people usually have a larger pool of potential partners with which they can work with thanks to chance encounters, and they are also more likely to be remembered if anyone that knows them wishes to enter/re-enter the dating market. In addition to these advantages, just as in point 1, talkativeness is **often** **mistaken** to be more confident which happens to be an attractive trait to both sexes. While this may come back to haunt a talkative person in a long-term relationship, since I have restricted my argument to dating, I think the appearance of confidence and openness can suffice.

Now I do understand that reserve and talkativeness are not a binary (i.e. most people lie somewhere in between) and are also highly situational (i.e. someone who is talkative during work debates may be reserved during social interactions). However, I would argue that when it comes to the 3 aforementioned areas, if you were told to pick one extreme, talkativeness would be a better choice."

Their information density are very low. Basically only 20%~30% of the information is important and people lose patience while watching. Sure you can skip but skipping makes the information inconsistent. You can accelerate the video but if it's captionless you won't understand anything if it's 2x speed.

Reason 2: Text is more friendly to non-native speakers of that language. Most learners of a language read easier than they listen.

Reason 3: You can skim a text so the rate of absorbing information is non-linear. You can grasp the main point (aka 60% of the information) at 10~20% of the time of reading carefully. However, with video, acquirement of information is linear. You get 20% if you watch 20%.

Reason 4: Reading speed is typically faster than speaking speed so even if I read a whole text word by word without skimming it would still be faster than watching a video.

Reason 5: If you don't understand a part of the text you can just return to that page and read again, and search some key concepts. However with video you have to (with difficulty) find out where you got lost and rewatch that part, it's significantly more time-consuming."
1,2023-05-27,CMV: The people who trolled Chris Chan for years should be in jail,u/architectureHater,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13t5ajt/cmv_the_people_who_trolled_chris_chan_for_years/,changemyview,"These are just two examples of extremely mentally unwell lol cows, and I’m sure there are more but these stories are particularly famous so I’ll focus on them. I also don’t want to get into an evaluation of whether I think these people are good people, obviously Chris Chan is a mother fucking rapist and I’m not defending that, I’m taking about the trolling.

I AM ALSO NOT DOING ANY DISCOURSE ON THE GENDER IDENTITY OF CHRIS CHAN. I frankly don’t give a fuck about whether or not they’re trans. I care about the crime committed by both parties. This isn’t a post about trans people. If you are here to argue about that or argue that I’m only saying this because they’re trans, I’m not going to respond because it’s not going to change my view. This is more about a group of people intentionally abusing a significantly mentally ill person.

I think that in the case of Chris Chan and by extension Daniel Larson, the extensive amount of trolling that took place over the course of multiple years is psychological abuse if not psychological torture.

Over the from the 2000s up to the arrest Chris Chan, trolls usually make up Teri different categories. General harassers and people who tried to help. All of them are pretty shitty and with the exception of a few, they should all be in jail for this torture. 

The majority of it was harassment. This involves things like what most would call cyber bullying, which there was indeed a mass cyber bullying campaign Chris due to her art, but this didn’t extend further than just leaving mean comments and doing things to get a rise out Of her. Following that is when people began watching and tracking. This is when it gets to the illegal side of things as the extent to which people were tracking her was essentially stalking. 

After tricking her to volunteer her information, people in her area would drive by her house and post pictures of her online. They would steal documents from Chris’s trash, and use the information on her to manipulate her even further. They would record her on the streets and feed into her delusions that she was a famous artist and she had a legion of fans who want the best for her. The stalking continued, however more trolls took a new approach manipulation.

Many trolls masqueraded as celebrities and people important to Chris in order to manipulate her. This include getting Chris to do sexual things on camera, leak nude pictures and disperse them around the internet, and make videos humiliating themselves. Some trolls pretended to be women with interest in Chris. They would also convince her to do terrible things to herself, they would also get her to destroy his own property and send out money. One pretended to be her and she is again severely unwell and didn’t understand.

This is a flat out a crime. Yes you can argue that lying over the internet shouldn’t be illegal but let’s think about what’s actually happening. A large group of people knowingly decided that they would harass a severely autistic person and essentially create a Truman Show for themselves. They just wanted to see how far they could push Chris.

Chris never grew passed being a child. These trolls found a person with the mind of a child and gaslit her for years until she broke. This isn’t a normal case of freedom of speech and “you shouldn’t always believe what you see online”. This was a campaign to stalk, harass and drive a mentally ill person insane.

The people who participated should not be walking free for their actions."

This is then compared to their evaluation last year and if you've increased your net worth, you pay taxes on the difference.

If you have not gained anything or have lost worth, you don't pay anything. If you've gained far too much (eg. Doubled your worth) then you can pay the taxes over a few years (in case you got a really good deal and bought something worth a million bucks for a few dollars).

I can see there are a fair few cases where this will be harmful, though i think overall it's better for everyone than the current system.

The only real problem i can see is if everyone is living paycheck to paycheck then there will be noone to potentially collect taxes from, though total net value should still be increasing so only the rich few would pay everyone's share.

Please let me know why this system would be worse than our current one. I'm happy to hear about the edge cases where someone will be harmed by this system, though will not consider them for CMV purposes unless it affects a significant size of the population."

0,2023-05-27,CMV: sexual assault is one of the best reasons women shouldn’t be required to participate in the draft.,u/UselessTruth,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13te7sp/cmv_sexual_assault_is_one_of_the_best_reasons/,changemyview,"Edit (changes): I no longer believe it’s on of the best reasons in genral, but I still think it is a very good reason and probably the best reason that is not based in sexism or just completely ending the draft. 

Sexual assault and rape predominantly happens specifically from men raping women with all other combinations being a rarity. This is still a prevalent problem in todays society, and it is even more likely in dangerous situations like war when tensions run high. The more isolated/likely to face enemy capture/ect, the unit a women is placed into, the more she would have to worry about not just death and injury, but being target of rape. Because of this, asking a women to enlist is a much greater burden than asking men. 

It would be a very bad idea to put the average woman in a mixed gender prison just like it would be a bad idea to put the average women in a mixed race army.

Sure some women do fine in the army, but these are women who view themselves to be capable of the role they choose. They are probably much more physically capable than the average woman, and are able to choose a department that has acceptable risks for them. A daft eliminates this ability for this self selection of capability and choice of department.

Sure this could be mostly mitigated if the draft of women only forced them to participate in less dangerous roles where sexual assault and physical capability was less of a concern. But just extending the same draft to women is too extreme of a burden.

Edit: this is specifically an argument against women being required to participate in the same draft that men do with the same requirements. If their positions were limited to logistical and noncombat orientated roles, this would be mostly mitigated. However, these are already the more desirable rolls. And if a super big important war came up, I think they’d probably be enough people that wanted to contribute to the war effort, but didn’t want to face the risk of death or serious bodily injury that would easily fill these logistical roles. Considering this my argument only applies to a draft of men and women where women have the same types of participation as men."

But you can never know if you could have done otherwise because you only ever know what you have done. 

Everything we know about observable reality indicates that everything has a cause and effect. In the event that quantum mechanics suggests that there are issues with pure determinism because making perfect predictions aren't possible because etc etc etc, chaos, etc etc etc...chaos isn't freedom of choice in any meaningful sense of the word, it's just chaos. It's an explanation for why human beings can be absurd in their behaviors maybe, not much beyond that. 

Also interesting that few people will hold animals in the same regard, yet people are...animals. 

I've tried very, very hard to read the work of famous compatibilists and make sense of it all, but at the end of the day it just keeps coming back to this central idea of...if everything is determined you can't have free will and I just can't find any compelling argument against that."

7,2023-05-27,CMV: Limiting access to firearms in the United States would play a significant role in decreasing net suicide,u/FerdinandTheGiant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13thd5m/cmv_limiting_access_to_firearms_in_the_united/,changemyview,"The United States has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, with over half of those deaths being from firearms (~55%). This is despite the fact they only make up a small portion of the total suicide attempts with roughly 75% of all suicide attempts being overdoses, something effective between 1-3% of the time. The reason for this disparity between attempt and success is due to the lethality of firearms combined the ease of usage. It’s the reason men in the US have a higher suicide rate than women but less attempts. 

 Limiting access to means, also known as [means restriction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6191653/): “entails a community or societal action that (ideally) does not depend on an individual’s intention or volition. Applied to the population as a whole, it typically affects people whose suicide risk is otherwise undetected and who do not seek therapeutic assistance to prevent their crisis or for life-saving interventions when necessary. Removal or restriction of access to a lethal method changes the context of a potential suicide by precluding potentially fatal actions or forcing the use of a less lethal method. Because means restriction is broadly applied, detection of its individual- level effect is often impossible; it is best measured by aggregate findings of method-specific community rates of suicide and related self-harm injuries.”

In the case of guns, this would involve actions like enforcing gun control measures, though for this CMV I’m mainly discussing less individual laws and more the efficacy of limiting means. 

To describe the effects of mean removal, I’ll use an example that’s not firearms. 

Fatal Gas poisonings were fairly common both in the US and UK prior to laws around it and the addition catalytic converters being used in car exhausts. These limited the ability for people to commit suicide via this method and as a result, the net suicide rate dropped as a result. The same thing happened with a common pesticide used in suicide in India that was restricted leading to a decreased net suicide rate without a replacement. 

The replacement part being a major factor. Many argue that suicidal people will just find another means, so-called means substitution. While there is data supporting this and other data denying this, the means substitution ultimately would still lead to less deaths because no other suicide method common to the United States is anywhere nearly as lethal, socially considerable, or easy to access. All of which matter to someone acting in a rash decision to end their life. Switching those individuals from a 90% chance of dying to a 1-3% (assuming mean substitution went to most common method) would save lives.

When it comes to CMV, I think if anyone can demonstrate why in the US this would not be effective, I would be very interested in hearing it. That said, I don’t care much for any arguments regarding the issues of gun restriction, just their efficacy at reducing suicide."

So then what explains this beating of the odds? That of all the many many choices, God chooses the one that would allow life? You could say “God is all loving, he wanted people to exist” but he didn’t HAVE to be all loving. He didn’t have to want people to exist. Why is God “wired” (for lack of a better term) in such a way that he chooses to create life, when there are far more numerous ways he could have been wired wherein he would NOT create life?"

The more accurate our mental models, the better we can understand and predict events in the real world to our advantage. 

Self-esteem based on lies is insecure and fragile in light of the truth, and can only be sustained by further denial of reality. Maintaining a comforting false belief requires rejection of the truth when it contradicts, so each comforting lie can lead to more false beliefs. 

Choosing the truth, even when it hurts, is essential to personal integrity and to developing the ability to deal with reality. This is a healthier, more solid and secure basis for self-esteem. Our success and wellbeing depends on our beliefs being as true and accurate as possible."

If you think it's wrong, this CMV isn't for you.

For me, I cannot understand people who nod their heads along when women say they fear men. No, I am not under the impression they fear ALL men, but that they are justified in saying 'better safe than sorry'. And yet when applied to race, ethnicity or whatever you want to call it. 

Suppose I am in the town of ""Oompaloop"" filled with white people. I am a black man and I came down to the town to do business. I am staying at a hotel in the tourist core. I feel ok being the hotel. But after sunset? I don't feel great going out and about in the outskirts. Why? Because these white people aren't just white. Statistically, they hate me. ""Greenbook"" even in the modern time, is a perfectly acceptable 'book' to have. Now, flip it around. I am now a white woman. I am in the 'Ogopogo' town. I know statistically, these men in the downtown have a turf war going on. Their 'war' is only on skin colour. If you are not black, you are not welcome on their turf.

So why do we nod and say, ok, it's reasonable that women fear men in this area, because stats back it up, but if someone says 'look sorry mate, those Asians/yakuza/triad whatever in la' no thanks. Or those cartels in the south? No thanks. Now, I know you might say, but you don't know if that hispanic person is cartel or not. Does it matter? Is it so wrong to be 'better safe than sorry?'

I guess my view is, there's nothing wrong with being safe and judging people based on skin colour and avoiding them if you are in a high crime area. And I know it's not just skin colour. I think that's what people miss. Like in oompaloop town, of course my black housekeeper in the hotel isn't gonna shoot me up, but outside? Naw."
0,2023-05-27,"CMV: Even if we were to acknowledge that conservatives are right that women 'create' incels, the problem isn't women but 'simps'",u/WaterDemonPhoenix,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13tqsl2/cmv_even_if_we_were_to_acknowledge_that/,changemyview,"I personally don't care about promiscuity, however, I'm trying to see the views of these conservatives.

However, I do hear a lot of conservatives say that women being promiscuous is a problem, and most of them agree that it's women's 'fault'. I do not agree with that. 

Men often complain about how women only go for 'chads' and how lucky they are to have so many men chasing after them. It is, for one, not a problem. But even if it were, who wouldn't want many chasing after them? 

All the problems can go away if men just stop simping after someone just being a woman. Seriously. Try it. If you are complaining about not being approached, it's because other men are approaching the women. If men suddenly stopped approaching women, women would start approaching men. The men's problems lie not in women but in other men. 

And yes, I believe everyone, men and women, are lazy. I am not saying this in a bad way, but if women keeping getting men asking them out, why would they make effort to ask other men out? We don't even need alternate worlds to know that men who are popular with women get asked out a lot, and these men don't really make an effort. Why would they?"

Compare Indian Railway, China Railway and former Japan National Railway with Amtrak, Japan Railway and Taiwan Railway. Because NFP ones typically run at a loss or just make ends meet. 

Reason 2: Being not for profit can stimulate the travel industry and bring indirect economic benefits that by far outweigh the amount of state subsidy. Metro has supported the development of the real estate market, generated tax revenues, and been the key to a region's economic vitality. Railways can facilitate efficient travel of passengers and freight. Buses are convenient, high-effienciency door-to-door travel which can help people living in marginalised geographical areas travel easier.

Reason 3: Public transit is low-carbon. By encouraging it we can vastly reduce our carbon emission.

Reason 4: People using metro, trains, buses etc are typically low to medium income households, while peope using airlines, cars, taxis, or even private jets are middle to high income. It's like taxing the rich and redistributing the wealth to low income groups in the form of state subsidized travel.

Reason 5: By being not for profit, a company can extend its service to sparsely populated areas. Else, these people are gonna have no ways to travel. What for-profit company would want to run buses and trains to ""nowhere""? But these people *need* to go outside for education, medical treatment, work, travel, etc. Also sparsely populated areas tend to overlap with poor/underdeveloped ones."

Now first I’d like to say rest in piece to Chadwick Boseman he was a phenomenal actor and I miss him so much. Starting off with the fact by killing off Tchalla it’s totally disrespectful towards the performance of the late great Chadwick Boseman because all of his years of brilliant acting was axed like nothing.

Secondly there’s hardly any black male superheroes in the MCU that young black boys who are fans of the franchise can look up to.The only ones who exists are War Machine, Sam Wilson who is now Captain America and Luke Cage. I know there are other black male superheroes who will eventually come like Blue Marvel but by eliminating Tchalla is reducing the very small pool.

Tchalla is very prominent and monumental hero in the comics and has amazing stories and arcs in the comic universe that can be well adapted into the silver screen. However since Tchalla has been killed we will never see those stories and adapted it was a total slap in the face to the character.

His son who came at the end of the movie is literally gonna be a fatherless child in the MCU a lot of black children growing up as fatherless children we don’t need to see that in the movies.

It’s utter ludicrous when people say Tchalla shouldn’t be recasted when Cassie Lang in the MCU got recasted three times. 

Chadwick relatives such as his brother said that they preferred if the character was recasted. 

I genuinely believe that Tchalla should have been recasted I invite anyone to change my view."

time and time again we have companies like bethesda, ubisoft, Ea etc etc making new games and immediately the hype train starts, people excusing their past behaviour spouting that they've ""learned from their past mistakes"" and its gotten to a point where developers have made a return on investment before the product is even released, so they have no incentive to actually deliver on a decent product because people seem to NEVER learn their lesson and always buy the game without thinking.

Now i do also think that more laws should be in place to stop this from being legal in the fist place but the truth is that it IS legal for them to do this, and so as gamers we have a responsibility to stop purchasing these games if we want to see things change. if you pre-order a game you really have no right to complain when its shit. YOU are the reason its shit. when they dont have to count on people seeing the state of the game before they buy it why would they care about actually finishing their product and not putting all their money into simply marketing the game, pushing pre order bonuses etc.

and on the off chance that games do suffer backlash, the devs are forgiven if they simply ""fix"" the issues, like we saw with cyberpunk and am increasingly seeing with fallout 76, with people claiming ""this will be the next no mans sky, they're gonna turn it around!""

look no mans sky gets a pass because of its extremely unique circumstances, and even then its very very hard to justify what happened and it took hellogames many years to regain favour, we certainly shouldnt be doing this with huge corporations that should simply know better, on principle if a game launches in an absolute shitty unfinished state, im never going to buy the finished product... and neither should any of you, if you truly want to see change in the gaming industry... until people stop buying these crap products they're going to keep getting away with it.

but alas im shouting into the wind. i expect to see starfield fly off the shelves despite the clear decline of bethesda over the last 10 years and i cant wait to see people baffled when its a mess, dont get me wrong i hope its not a mess but you best believe im gonna wait to see some reviews before i come to my conclusion on when its worth buying."
36,2023-05-28,CMV: There is no argument that would convince gun control opponents that America's gun culture is a problem,u/Anonon_990,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13u71ft/cmv_there_is_no_argument_that_would_convince_gun/,changemyview,"I dont live in the US but because I live in a western, English speaking country, I see a lot of American cultural debates. Afaik, the debate around guns is almost unique because no other country has Americas gun culture. Countries in civil wars aren't as saturated with guns as America. Therefore I don't think the rules of normal debates apply to guns in America. A tweet from a few years back argued that Sandy Hook ""marked the end of the US gun control debate. Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over"". I think this is right and the ""debate"" is mostly over, if it ever really existed.

Regardless of any level of gun violence or any argument that's made, gun control opponents refuse to budge and view it as anything other than a black and white issue. Regardless of how many suicides, murders, accidental deaths or mass shootings there are, the idea that anything should change around guns in America is completely rejected.

I don't think this is the fault of gun control supporters in America. I just think that their opponents have a religious level of belief in guns and won't budge regardless of how many deaths there are.

I'll CMV if there's any real evidence of many gun control opponents changing their minds over time."

In the English spoken space, most questions get interpreted and answered most often from the US American perspective, followed by Canada and the UK.

Yet Reddit is an international social media and English is the go-to language to use internationally and the biggest subs are English speaking subs, so many non native English speakers go there (like myself).

A simple tag is a small adjustment and saves so much miscommunication. Many people aren’t for example aware that their opinion and how do they do things is very cultural and can cause misunderstandings."
65,2023-05-28,"CMV: Hard data is far superior to anecdotal evidence or experiential storytelling and if one contradicts the other, Hard Data should win every time",u/ICuriosityCatI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13uc9s8/cmv_hard_data_is_far_superior_to_anecdotal/,changemyview,"In my eyes, there are a couple of possibilities. Either anecdotal evidence matches hard data or it does not. 

If it matches hard data great, that means the hard data is more likely to be true. If there's a mismatch, it makes sense to go with the less subjective option. Which would be the hard data. 

Hard data isn't perfect, but it's supported by the scientific method and it tries to remove subjectivity. Anecdotal evidence and experiential storytelling are incredibly subjective. And studies have shown that people will often retell stories in a way that puts themselves in a good light. It's not necessarily even a conscious decision, subconsciously people put themselves in a good light. 

The view that hard data is flawed isn't wrong- of course hard data isn't perfect- but I do not understand the view that anecdotal evidence and experiential storytelling can tell us something hard data can't. Like I say, if there's a contradiction why shouldn't the hard data win? Hard data can be sexist/racist and that can mislead people. OK. And people aren't? 

In my view it makes no sense to not follow the hard data and use these other forms of data as an alternative. But I'm curious to hear other views and changing my view if my mind is changed.

EDIT: It appears the term is ""counter-storytelling"" not experiential storytelling. So that's my bad, but I am unable to change the title. My apologies."

That being a counterweight to Russian trolls on various social media platforms. Fighting fire with fire 

But fighting disinformation with disinformation just creates more chaos 

I've found that the real people ( non- affiliated with government or institutions) helping are usually people in OSINT, journalists and people who've fought or interview fighters in Ukraine e.g Faytuks on Twitter, Mathew Gault( various publications) and Willy OAM on YouTube. The last really helps because he interviews guys on the ground who explain what the war is like 

All groups are constantly attacked by NAFO 

Most OSINT on Twitter are now openly banning or calling out NAFO. Mostly due to them geo-locating APCs and and a Russian ship NAFO wanted claimed as sunk or faked. 

Let's be clear NAFO dosn't even follow what the Ukrainian government or NATO say. They create their own theories and scenarios via Memes or speculation then push this out as fact. If the official statement contradicts what they believe they somehow just act as if its Schrodinger's cat; both true and untrue E.g When the Patriot system was damaged they both claimed it wasn't and was at the same time because Ukraine said it was 

Honestly I've come to believe NAFO is run by children. Like actual teenagers who have no idea what they are doing. Which is bad because as stated they have created chaos online and made echo chambers that while on the surface appear to be good are in reality massive disinformation hubs that make it impossible for the general public to engage with what's happening 

E.g Will be called a Russian troll for even saying this


Edit: As two of the comments have accurately shown NAFO has donated and helped Ukriane with funds and in  other ways. So they have done good part has been answered 

However this dosn't adress or justify the groups action. So my opinion has changed but the issue still remains. In the context of 

Do NAFO's good actions outweigh their bad actions? 

The answer of which I think ends the debate

The 2A is obviously for national defense. It dates back to when the nascent United States did not have an army. In that situation, it relied on militias for defense.

Section 8 of the Article 1 of the constitution expands what these militias are for, when it attributes the powers of congress

“To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;

To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.”

https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-1/#article-1-section-8-clause-15

A well-regulated militia is one authorized, organized, armed, and disciplined by state governments. 

Today, this militia is the army, the national guard, and the state guards.

The DC vs Heller decision expanded the 2A interpretation to include self-defense. That’s not originalist in the least; hence, Heller should be overturned.

I am completely fine with people who were conceived by IVF. That isn't an issue at all. I don't see any moral reason for/against IVF because sex is/isn't involved. Also, I have no religion concerns at all about IVF. (I am an atheist.) 

IVF is very expensive. An average of around $40,000 for a live birth in the US. Even in countries with less expensive healthcare; it still is about an average of $24,500 in Scandinavia and Japan. I've seen many people asking for money to fund their IVF treatments because it is hard to afford. But if someone can't afford IVF, will they be able to afford actually raising a child? If the family already has any children, won't they be affected by the costs of IVF? 

Also, there is a high emotional cost to IVF, when someone is so emotionally invested in something that has a large risk of failure. There is an increased rate of depression in women after having a negative pregnancy test after getting IVF treatments. 

I see lots of different possibilities, but even being extremely generous, the greatest possible success rate I see is about 55% chance for a live birth. With age/infertility bringing down the rate by a lot. 

Why not adoption instead of IVF? Why do some people seem to need their child to be genetically ""theirs""? I know just saying to adopt isn't some cure-all, but I am actually wondering why people go though the physical process of IVF instead of working toward adoption. 

I actually see the most potential with IVF with people who are LGBT+ especially if there are laws against or if it is much tougher for them to be able to adopt. But they are not necessarily infertile, and would have a higher success rate. 

IVF can used to avoid genetic diseases/disorders, which is why I specifically called out ""infertile people"" in the title. I can understand doing IVF to limit the risk of your child getting sickle cell animia, for example. I am mainly trying to understand using IVF for other reasons than to avoid a genetic disorder. 

What medical procedures people decide to do are their own private decisions, and none of my business. I don't like being judgemental though, and I find myself feeling really judgmental when I see, read, or hear about people who do IVF. (I don't act on those judgmental feelings.) I really want to understand what motivates infertile people to go through IVF, and to be able sympathize with them.

Never even had so much as a speeding ticket, so this is not coming from a biased or jaded POV. I think that ex-cons, and people with really any criminal history are treated extremely unfairly, and I don’t think that companies should be allowed to not even to consider someone if they have any kind of criminal record at all. Of course, we don't want murderers and rapists working at our local Wendys, but Im talking about drug offenses, petty theft, vandalism, prostitution etc. My opinion on this is especially strong if these offenses were when the person was 18-25 and years later, they are trying to better their lives and be different people.   
I truly think it's unfair discrimination, and hiring should be based on interviews and current credentials and not stupid actions made YEARS ago. People DO change, and I understand there are programs to get convicts into the workforce, but they are often very low-level jobs. So many crimes are a product of circumstance and upbringing, and how can we expect as a society to bring these people up if they are excluded immediately from 95% of jobs? It is unfair. 

Please let me know your thoughts or if you have any insight on why these practices are good."

Two of the people going have said a few weeks before we go that they want to drop out. They owe £200 each. They are adamant that they shouldn’t have to pay because they’re not going anymore. However I have said they need to pay as it was there decision to not go and it’s unfair to expect everyone else pickup their slack and pay additional costs.

More deer, more wolves and the domino effect keeps going. Not to mention Krakatoa literally saved the planet. Following the Krakatoa eruption, the earth underwent global cooling by around 0.6°c offsetting the effects of human accelerated climate change. 

So my view is the longterm positive effects of volcanos outweighs the initial destruction."

Salutations. 

Most applicable knowledge for ones monetary gain would be deemed useless due to AI causing it to be unnecessary and unapplicable for most cases in the future. I believe this because most tools and practices we had in earlier history have either been entirely replaced or evolved upon so much, that we only require arbitrary knowledge of said original practice or tool to successfully apply the knowledge of the current day variant. 

Almost everything we currently deem as a high value, specialised knowledge/skill/practice, will be simply automated by AI processes. 

I've heard counterpoints from friends, using an example of an easy to foresee change that AI will make in the future, and then arguing with our core feelings of humanity such as passion. 
Example:
(Even though AI, will most likely steer the future into fully autonomous cars, it doesn't stop someone from wanting to learn and have fun, driving a car..) 

This doesn't actually counter my view at all! My view isn't that we won't want to learn things that are fun and rewarding in other ways, My argument is studying something in our present day for monetary gain is too much of a gamble?

AI genuinely feels like a light speed cataclysm of current applicable knowledge + an evolution of NEW knowledge areas w applicability in daily life... 

So, what's the point of undertaking anything for long term monetary value right now? 

We already live in a society of a highly evolving world, consistent upskilling is required yearly to stay relevant in many occupations around the world. Now imagine how AI might be a catalyst to that. 

Edit 2: after replying to some very afluent and intelligent users, I've realised that this view I have actually has another view baked into it. 

That there is a very high potential of scope that AI will be able to achieve. 

This view funnily enough I'm not even sure I necessarily agree with, and it's also almost entirely baseless and I feel kinda disgusted that it has influenced my view on learning knowledge as a whole.

Since this view has been brought to my attention by you guys, how the hell can I have this original view of the potential future when my opinion of AI is unable to be proven?

Edit 3: interesting, potentially, entry level knowledge of many or some fields will not have to be touched upon as vigorously in the future. If I may use an anology, we do learn entry level math from a very young age but eventually we just use a calculator. AI could potentially apply to this to many fields. Since we save time it may cause me, the average Joe to essentially somewhat half skip the baseline of many knowledge fields."

I’m of the opinion that movie stars, singers politicians and generally all famous people with a significant group of fans need to be held at a higher standard than those who don’t. 

No to mention with the advent of social media more and more “opinions” have a large audience. 

So cancel culture acts as a way of policing these people - even though I think it’s still not as effective as it can and should be it’s the best we got to keep nasty people at bay. 

So when I asked my friend if he could name me one person who wasn’t deserved to be cancelled he got quiet. 

Separate issue I think the right wing uses cancel culture as a way of demonizing the left but when u really think about it it’s actually a good thing

EDIT: I was proven wrong regarding that everyone who was cancelled deserved it, also I realized that there are a lot of harms associated with cancel culture"
4,2023-05-30,CMV: Affirmative Action in Education is unfair and has no good reason to exist in the way it does,u/CodEither8469,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13vu3ix/cmv_affirmative_action_in_education_is_unfair_and/,changemyview,"To be clear, I am not arguing against AA for underrepresented minorities. I understand the need for diversity. I wouldn't want to apply to a school or company that is >80% white. 

However, the part where I think is unfair, discriminatory, and racist is when you discriminate against a specific minority because there are too many of them. 

I just don't get how you could ever justify discriminating against a particular minority. Affirmative Action has its roots in antisemitism, when Harvard thought that there were too many Jewish students in their campus. 

A lot of arguments center around fixing historical inequality, but that doesn't make sense since it doesn't explain why discrimination against Asians in college admissions exist. 

Finally, the thing that makes me the most annoyed is the argument that it is beneficial and not discriminatory or racist because of historical privilege. 

Would it interest you to know that Berkeley, which doesn't have AA practices, has only a 25% white student makeup, while other prestigious institutions have a much higher percentage of white students. The truth is, that white students actually benefit from Affirmative Action. The only racial group that is losing out are Asian Americans."
0,2023-05-30,"CMV: If you were bullied in school, it's (partially) your fault",u/Visible-Row178,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13vuuus/cmv_if_you_were_bullied_in_school_its_partially/,changemyview,"I know that in certain situations, like when someone gets bullied for their skin color, religion, or disability—things they can't control—it's definitely not their fault. The bullies are just plain ignorant jerks. But what still puzzles me is how regular people, who are totally normal, end up getting bullied. I mean, are there some folks out there who are just mean for no reason other than to make someone's life miserable? I've never personally met anyone like that, and I simply don't see the logic behind that sort of behavior.

Back when I was in school, I was probably one of the most socially awkward, weird, and unlikeable people you could find. My mom even thought I might be autistic, but I didn't want to get diagnosed because I didn't want to be labeled back then. Looking back, I realize now that there's nothing wrong with having a label like that. Anyway, the point is, I was an easy target for bullies. Sometimes they would tease or mock me whenever I did something awkward. But you know what? I never let it get to me. I didn't react, and eventually, they got bored and stopped. That was in middle school. As I grew up, the number of people openly making fun of me became fewer and fewer. By the time I got to high school, nobody cared whether I was awkward or not. If someone didn't like me, they just avoided me without making a big fuss. And now that I'm in college, most people are generally nice, which makes sense since we're all adults here.

I get that every situation is different, but it's hard for me to understand when someone perfectly normal tells me they got bullied in middle or high school. I mean, couldn't they have handled it differently? Maybe the bullies would have gotten tired and moved on. Ok, individuals may vary in their sensitivity levels, and it can be more challenging for some to overlook the mockery of others. However, such is the nature of life --- you cannot anticipate everything to be effortless. The world is not obligated to conform to your expectations; rather, it is your responsibility to adapt to the environment you find yourself in. Plus, I just can't accept the idea that people are mean for no good reason. If you haven't done anything to deserve it, there's absolutely no excuse for anyone to bully you. The bullies are always in the wrong. But hey, if you find yourself being bullied, it might be worth thinking about whether there's something you unintentionally did to set them off.

I remember there was this girl in my school who always thought she was being bullied, but from where I stood, she seemed to be seeking attention. She was a total liar and had a serious inferiority complex. She would boast about her life and constantly ask people for money without ever paying them back. It's no surprise that everyone started hating her. She went and complained to the principal about being bullied because she was ""poor,"" even though I never saw anyone actually bullying her. Nobody cared about her financial situation, and it was totally her own fault, at least as far as I could see. Eventually, she ended up transferring to another school, and I never heard about her again.

I know I've rambled on for quite a bit, and I'm sure my logic has some flaws. That's why I'm actually open to changing my view on this. I just can't comprehend how some people let themselves be bullied to the point of even considering suicide. I hope my thoughts haven't offended anyone.

And the salaries they get are reasonable once you get to know more about their day-to-day responsibilities.

* These coaches work on average 70-80 hours per week. This involves meetings with their other coordinators, recruiting visits with prospective recruits, meetings with the athletic directors and university administrators and their conference coordinators, developing relationships with the team's current roster, potentially meeting with the news outlets, etc. The point is that they have a far more busy schedule week after week. Therfore, they should be paid at the current annual salary which is worth 6-7 figures.
* Coaches that work in D1 on average don't last very long at a particular D1 institution. When they found another opportunity at another D1 university, this usually requires the coach and his family to spend a hefty amount in moving expenses to go from their old workplace to their new workplace. Something that a lot of ""normies"" can relate to when moving from city to the other.
* Coaches are at the top of their profession just as a CEO is the top of their profession at the company. They're responsible for the overall strategy of their respective programs to ensure that it's in line with the university's policies and the athletic conferences' policies. Their job is to win at the highest level and play a role in doing what they can to ensure that they play at that level. This funding can also come from the university or in the form of student fees. If you don't approve, then go to another university that doesn't put in as much funding.
* There's less than 1000 positions available to work as a D1 Football or D1 Basketball Coach. Since there's a lot of money going towards their teams and all you need is a group of coaches to coordinate several kids, there's no reason to add more workers to gain a share of that pie.
* Without the coach, athletics departments are there to generate as much non-subsidized revenue as possible for the student-athletes so that they can be set up for success after college (funding that doesn't come directly from the university nor the student fees). Athletics is more than just a group of people throwing a ball around, since the chances that many of these student-athletes won't make it to the professional level, it's good to allocate a good amount of money towards academic support facilities and systems (career centers, volunteering, etc.) that cater towards their wants and needs. It's not good enough to just give them an academic support center tailored towards everyone because they have to spend around 20 hours per week for the team and balance that with a full-time load.

I think a lot of people that complain about how Athletics taking a lot of money comes from a position where they know little to nothing about college athletics in general.

TL;DR: Head coaching salaries for D1 Basketball and D1 Football Teams Area Reasonable because of the amount of roles/responsibilities they have. In fact, they spend 70-80 hours a week! They also have to spend a hefty amount of fees to move from one job to the other. The job market for D1 Coaching is really small, so there's no reason the amount of money should be allocated towards other things outside of athletics. Without the coach, they wouldn't bring in as much non-subsidized revenue as possible for their athletics program.

Why are they mixing units? Why not say: ""380 calories, including 170 protein calories"". It would make it so much simpler and easy to read. It would also make it easier to see what percentage or proportion of calories are from that macronutrient. 

The alternative would be like saying ""5 pounds of fruit including a kilogram of bananas"".  Or ""$30 of gas, and an extra gallon on top of that"". 

It does not make sense to me. I believe it would be more informative and useful if consistent units were used for all applicable measurements."

I have OCD about cleansing myself of it. Its driven me to learn more about semen or seminal fluid. Interesting facts about make reproduction, but it makes me realize how incredibly wasteful it is, even if it makes sense. 

Semen is a highly alkaline substance due to high concentrations of various sugars, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, citric acid, and even larger molecules like oxytocin and melatonin. Semen is unique as a bodily fluid for the seminal vesicles synthesizing fructose during orgasm, as it is the primary fuel for sperm motility and isn't produced in such quantity anywhere else in the body. It's also a combination of other proteins, enzymes, plasma (or serum), and mucous. 

Apparantly the alkaline content is needed to survive the acidic nature of the vaginal cavity. Makes sense right? Except, that's still a ton of nutrients we are dedication for procreation functioning. And for what? Sperm are only 1-5% of sememinal fluid, and only 14% of those (on average) are properly shaped. Meaning most sperm are mishapped. Did I also mention sperm require stem cells to grow and take 7 months to develop? All so they can wither to apoptosis after 3 days or if I put my hot laptop on my lap for a few hours. 

The male reproductive system is a disgusting mess and incredibly wasteful in terms if resources. And no, benefits of masturbation are not going to be persuasive here. The question here is ""is male reproduction wasteful in material use?"" And not ""is there a valid tradeoff for resources used?""

I also extend some of this to the vagina as well, especially on the grossness factor. Discharging mucous and blood. Did I mention this acidic mucous has glucose in it? Both male and female reproduction are disgusting. And male reproduction is wasteful"

I feel like this because if you were good enough then they would never leave you and if the person you like, you care about has already given up on you and believes that you are not worthy enough to be with them then automatically the next one who wants to be with you is not as good as the previous one.

I bought my house literally within months of the shut down. I got lucky. But I started looking for houses months before that too.I knew if I didn’t pull the trigger soon, I wouldn’t be able to afford it soon. 

I remember telling people to buy because demand was high and supply was low and that we are past the 2008 crisis. 

All I got was “nah I’m going to wait for the market to crash”. Those same people are now even less able to buy a house or even if they can, they’re able to afford less house.


And yet they’re still bitching about how the market is unfair and many are repeating their mistakes by STILL waiting for a crash.

You can blame the big corporations or investment firms but the reality of “time in the market vs timing the market  has been true for decades”. Even the stock market, which that quote is referring to has been controlled by big institutional buyers/sellers for decades."

141,2023-05-31,"CMV: Millennials haven’t really killed any business or industries. For the most part, industries kill themselves.",u/Midnightchickover,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13wndca/cmv_millennials_havent_really_killed_any_business/,changemyview,"A lot of media outlets, critics, and commentators, along with many business owners and C.E.O.s often point the blame of their failures to millennials and younger generations of people. If a business isn’t doing well, it’s because of millennials in their “so-called” unusual and fickle taste, along with their unwillingness to accept certain positions for whatever reason. People will often say millennials are “lazy and entitled,” and want too much money for any given position.  
Here’s the problem with many of these sentiments — they’ve either always existed or have been influenced by social changes and interests.   



A flawless business structure can be great in practice and application for consecutive years, if not decades. Though, each youth generation has always presented a change in the taste in some form or fashion. This process happens through technological changes; cultural influences; status of economy; class changes; and changes in personal beliefs.  




Most fads from any previous decades, simply faded away, due to the consumers from that same era no longer needing or finding use with that particular brand, item, product, or business. If a business doesn’t evolve its model, as its profit dwindles or simply doesn’t outgrow its peak production-to-profit model.  
Businesses complain about not being able to keep up with new consumers or failing to attract alternative audiences.  The consumers are not at fault in any part of this juncture. I don’t believe the customer is always right, especially in a situation where they are compensated or given much more than what is equitable. Like, if I expect $600 from a $6 purchased product that’s simply defective. I preface this as a defective product that’s not dangerous, but only inoperable or distorted to be effective.     




Consumers have no obligations to any company unless they have a contract or payment plan/agreement, but even then they don’t necessarily need to fulfill them. Granted, it could result in substantial penalties for the consumer through penalties, fines, repossession, credit inquiries, and possible lawsuits.   



Still, the consumer is not forced to cover the terms of agreements or payment expectations. It’s a free market practice of the consumer.  Consumers don’t have to buy anything, even necessities, especially if they can find alternatives at a cheaper rate with or perhaps greater efficacy.  



By default, millennials are not any more or less responsible for supporting any particular business or industry in any form or capacity.  Millennials are consumers and users, like any other consumer. Even at the opposite level, they need not to provide services or labor to any particular business or industry.   


For example, I’ll use fast-food restaurants. Millennials or any other demographic of people could suddenly stop shopping at “Wendy’s.”  We could pick any reason or circumstances that initiated the decline of the company.  It could be the food doesn’t taste as well as it once did, or is failing in areas with other options via other mass-production hamburger companies or local hamburger businesses.  
Furthermore, Wendy’s also finds difficulty in finding and keeping employees long term.  Which I could wager is the stress from fast food jobs; lower-levels pay; no to minimal benefits; required to work unusual hours, even on weekends and holidays; and the general derision of fast food workers overall.    Derision equates “anyone can flip a burger,” or “fast food workers making a livable wage is laughable.”  All of these factors effectively place these jobs at the very bottom of the list in being a viable option. The fast-food industries have not spoken out against this notion or really challenged it. Because, they benefit from it in the short term, specifically in a profit sense.  



The industries themselves are very much the source of their own problems. It simply never realized that inflation and culture can change dynamics overnight, while older populations of workers are consistently leaving the workforce as younger people have found many different ways to access income to the point that they can gain just as much as they could online in a few hours or days.    

People may criticize their work-ethic, ability to work with others, or general anti-social tendencies. These are always important factors to consider in the workplace, as well as life, however landlords, property managers, creditors, politicians (taxes), stakeholders, and other businesses value money and acquisition.  It’s not to say they don’t appreciate or consider these things on their own, because they very well could in practice. But, the value of money outweighs all of those factors.   
A landlord can kick a person out despite their hard-work, good nature, and great labor, just the same with creditors who can issue penalties and negative reports to the same person. Yet, the other person may have questionable morals, be very lazy, or lack any ambitions, but has no problems paying bills, credit, or taxes.   



Working in fast food and other similar industries can land someone in a type of financial dog house almost faster than most other professions by the way of low income, less opportunities, and less benefits. A worker has to triple their productivity to live a comfortable life or just get the bare minimum from the pot.  Just as selective as a company can be with its hiring practices and sometimes customer base, the consumer or workers can do the same thing at the opposite end.   
Again, this works heavily in a business or industry favor, as long as … demand remains high; production remains steady; and unemployment stays closer to higher levels.  When those factors decrease, a business has to make itself useful and economically viable in alternative ways. If it cannot adapt in these areas, then the question becomes should this business exist any longer or engage in unconventional and sometimes unethical practices to stay in operation."

They think Hell is okay. That it is a righteous punishment because its given from on high and the people who are there put themselves there.

An infinite punishment for finite crimes is perfectly permissible, to them. Despite the fact that God neglects us and refuses to teach us where we're wrong and how we're wrong. He simply watches and observes us in our fumbling and stumbling as we stumble our ways into Hell.

The problem I'm seeing with a lot of modern atheists is that they fail to relinquish themselves of the same exact mindset.

They yearn for harsh punishments against people despite supposedly also realizing that humans are essentially all stumbling about, sometimes with bad information and misguided belief structures that cause the stumbling to occur.

They realize this, but there's still a lot of ""Christian"" in them in terms of wanting to harshly punish and scrutinize others for their ""sins"".

Especially in the case of a religious person, whom they seem to hate on principle of being religious. 

I have a contention with this for a good number of reasons, but I'll highlight one particular one.

If God is real and he is the ultimate good as Christians claim then the Christian's answer to ""how do I be good?"" is to seek God's guidance.

Which makes logical sense. If you're having trouble figuring something out then seek an expert on the subject who ultimately knows more than you do in order to help teach you and guide you.

Of course God isn't there, an atheist would say. So you could ask him for guidance on how to be good all day long and you'll get nothing, but your own thoughts.

A fatal flaw to trust yourself so wholly in the efforts of being ""good"". Ultimately Christians would have morality that is just as subjective as the rest of us.

An atheist would argue.

But then the atheist has relinquished themselves of God in their mind, but remains Christian in their culture. And one of the markers of Christianity seems to be to name, shame, and belittle those who are ""sinful"".

And I ask, hang on a minute. If God is real then he would indeed be the ultimate arbiter of goodness. But if it is found that God is not real, then why would you immediately assert yourself to be the only necessary arbiter of goodness? You haven't replaced God with a greater sense of morality for having forgone him, you've simply removed an outside source of scrutiny. 

If God's guidance is non-real and therefore mislead by the faulty minds of the masses, then why are we returning our moral and ethical scrutiny to whatever the masses will? It was the unquestioning march of collective thought that got us into this mess of ""goodness"" to begin with. Why the hell are we listening to the whims of the masses instead of, I don't know, the professors of ethics and criminology and justice who sit around thinking about these kinds of things on very deep levels? Why do we defer it to the masses?

I'll be more direct here.

Atheists seem like they are becoming or have become as harshly critical and demanding of others as the Christians always have been in the past. If you realize that humans are so very fallible *and* you realize that they're likely to be misguided then how we can continue to argue in favor of such harsh treatment towards the people who commit themselves towards sinful behavior? Why do we return to the rituals of public shaming and torturous treatment? The Catholics used to burn people at the stake, we might be too 'civilized' for such treatment these days but we'll happily castrate a man if it makes us feel safer. 

Why? Let go of this nonsense."

It is uncivil to resort to violence to resolve differences, sure. Some people only seem to understand the language of the sword though, and “civilized” society does nothing to deter them from bad actions.

Governments should be afraid of their people, not the other way around. These days it seems like it’s gotten so bad that you can’t even express such thoughts without fear of reprimand. I may very well be banned from Reddit for making this post. However, historically, fear of the people starting a violent revolt is what has kept monarchies and dictatorships in check (in some cases, at least).

Nowadays you can tell whatever lies you want, commit fraud, deny peoples’ rights all you’d like, so long as you are rich or famous enough, and because there is virtually no risk of bodily harm as a result, there is basically no real accountability. The media can spin stories however they want. Information overload leaves the truth buried in many cases. And the whole system is geared to keep us watching each other instead of watching the ones we put in charge to look out for us.

Not aiming this at any specific person or people or political party. No, don’t kill anyone. All I’m saying that a few friendly reminders that they COULD be taken out would do a world of good.

Change my view by showing me a more effective way to get through to corrupt politicians and media moguls. These people are great at dodging the truth, so let’s see them try to dodge … a wrench.

Edit: Should clarify: I am aware that this happening won’t have a direct change in policies on either side. My desired outcome here is that it would stop so many people from platforming on extremism. 

Truth is, I think we’re going to see this happen whether it’s desired or not. I just want to see it become a deterrent to people knowingly lying to the public or inciting violence and hate.

Racists used to be afraid for awhile there, because they knew those views would likely get them beat down. Now they have become emboldened by public figures with security details that make them largely untouchable spewing the same shit and making them think it’s okay."

0,2023-05-31,CMV: US is the biggest terrorist country or organization the world has ever seen,u/cursedbones,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13x1yp3/cmv_us_is_the_biggest_terrorist_country_or/,changemyview,"In terms of spreading terror around the world US beat even Nazi Germany. There is no continent, except for Antarctica, that were spared from the ""Democracy"". Alone or with the help of NATO(another terrorist organization) they spread violence and war to innocents and criminals alike, acting like a world police that no one asked for. They invade, bomb, kill and left behind a legacy of hunger and poverty and as this is not enough they tend to embargo the shit out of their foes as well.

In North America they invaded and conquered vast mexican territories, and in LATAM they sponsored or organized coups d'état in [Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua and Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change_in_Latin_America).

In Asia, we have Vietnam, Iraq (which they invaded a sovereign nation with total made up excuse), Thailand, China, Syria and others. The world most bombed country in history is Laos which wasn't even in the war! Nixon and many US presidents should have been brought to world justice and be hanged.

In Africa we have [Libya and Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NATO_operations).

In Europe they fought in WW2, although I give a pass on this one since they were fighting Hitler.

The thing is if US doesn't agree with a sovereign country policy they historically use force to change it or opress it. 

I don't condemn the american people, they are also victims of a government that spent trillions to bombs civilians but can't give insulin to their citizens.  In resume the world be better of without the US war machine. As is it now it's a obstacle in human development as it the British Empire at it's prime."
