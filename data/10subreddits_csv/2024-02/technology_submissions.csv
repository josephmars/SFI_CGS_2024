I've learned a lot about how scams operate, how to socially engineer them into giving up valuable information, and how to make them angry!

You may know me from my fake google play store where scammers thought I was redeeming valuable gift cards and would scream ""[do not redeem](https://youtu.be/7mceb_t8EIs?si=5PqOLCRdeUL_Ggbg&t=949)"". I've spoken to thousands of scammers and have first hand experience with almost every phone or online scam you can think of. My current record is somewhere around 53 hours of phone time with the same scammer (over many weeks).

Last year we built a ""honeypot"" bitcoin website and have [trapped hundreds of scammers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWzz3NeDz3E) into an endless loop where they've wasted over 80 days of their lives waiting for money that doesn't exist. 

A few months ago, we launched [Seraph Secure](https://www.seraphsecure.com/), ""anti-scam"" software that runs in the background of your computer to stop scammers from gaining remote access to your families computers, block thousands of scam websites, and alert you if something suspicious is happening. 

We also released a [free tool to clean up computers](https://www.seraphsecure.com/scanner) for after a scammer has gained access. It's been used by various law enforcement agencies and non-profits to help dozens of victims already and I'm really excited about it!

~~I'm posting early to let some questions build up, but will be here tomorrow (2/5) @ 11am EST to start answering anything!~~

Edit: I'm starting a little early because you all have so many fun questions!

Edit 2: It's been 2.5 hours and a lot of fun but I need to take a break. May come back to answer more later or do another one of these in the future. Thank you Reddit!!"

Hi! My name is Kurt Wagner, and I’m a business and technology journalist with Bloomberg who has covered Twitter for over a decade. This week I published my first book, [*Battle for the Bird: Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk and the $44 Billion Fight for Twitter’s Soul*](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Battle-for-the-Bird/Kurt-Wagner/9781668017357)*.* It’s a story about Musk’s takeover of Twitter, but also a story about immense power, free speech, eccentric billionaires, and the many important dominoes that fell before the deal was even possible. You can read an excerpt [here for free](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-02-08/how-jack-dorsey-s-plan-for-elon-musk-to-save-twitter-failed?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcwODU0Nzg1MywiZXhwIjoxNzA5MTUyNjUzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTOElUWTFUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI5Q0I3RDdERTk3MjU0NEIzOTQ1ODc4RDlCODdFMzVBOCJ9.pTx-DO1O9yxKpIm1LKaMKZO0glycQ1qFiUTzM6DbCAw), and [read the review](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/books/review/kurt-wagner-battle-for-the-bird-zoe-schiffer-extremely-hardcore.html) in The New York Times.

Twitter has always been an anomaly as a company – its cultural influence vastly outweighs its business success, and that remains today even as [Twitter has morphed into X](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/elon-musk-s-x-looks-little-like-the-twitter-he-bought-a-year-ago?itm_source=record&itm_campaign=Elon_Musk%27s_X&itm_content=Twitter,_One_Year_Later-1&sref=xuVirdpv). A big part of the book centers of the relationship between Dorsey and Musk, and how that relationship helped change the social network forever.
