We have all heard about theory of relativity. So in that there is a thought experiment that two people are there on earth and one takes of in a spacecraft that travels at or around the speed of light.
Then a year passes for each of them at their own time and after that when the person comes back the both of the age will be fastly different with the person on earth aging by one and the person on the spacecraft using by several more years. So to test this you can launch a spacecraft from the outer space or some place where the gravitational field is very less so you can attain a fraction of the speed of light.
And we will sequentially sent the time update or a data containing a packet of time from the spacecraft to the base or Earth so they will send the data at the speed of light so we can at least see the date and analyse it and compare it to the data on so by theory of relativity we can check if the time actually dialates or a person travelling at the facts of the speed of light."

Hilarity ensues as Alfredo has to hide his little friend from the commanding officer, who's a big meanie. 

Things change when Alfredo discovers that when Remi's hiding under his helmet, he can use his ratty super-hearing to detect incoming artillery shells and bullets, and by yanking on Alfredo's hair, he can tell him which direction to dive for cover.  Remi also has to convince his cynical relatives to stop stealing rations and gnawing on wounded soldiers, and instead use their ratty hearing to help everyone dodge incoming munitions!   A happy ending, Remi and Alfredo shorten the war by a year, and the both get awarded the Croix de Guerre!"

However, in the beginning the movie lists off ways people are innovating the sardines: candied, juiced, on toast, etc. 

ON TOAST. CANDIED. They have sugar, wheat, corn syrup, yeast, etc. Nobody in the world knows Swallow Falls exists so they aren’t getting imports. This stuff is HOME GROWN. So you’re telling me that not a SINGLE person is intelligent enough to make foods out of those ingredients?! Surely they aren’t just stuck with solely sardines."

Without true conflict, we cannot grow as individuals.",u/Mooweetye,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1aoq44j/the_problem_with_being_great_at_deescalation_is/,Showerthoughts,"De-escalating conflict is a wonderful skill to learn. It is oftentimes the most mature, efficient, and appropriate way to deal with troublesome individuals. If you get good at it, you can avoid conflict altogether. But in the total absence of conflict, Doubt will begin to rear its ugly head.

When the Leviathan comes knocking and it cannot be reasoned with, The beast cannot be bought or tamed, It cannot be persuaded or charmed. It knows only hate, despair, and violence. What will you do?

Will you act? will you freeze or will you run? Keep in mind that pain and violence would feel alien to you at this point. What you don't use, you lose.

 It's been so long...

Can you still do this? 

Adrenaline and fear will rush through your system like something you've never experienced before. The problems and negative emotions that you avoided in the past, will manifest themselves in a tsunami of terror that will come crashing down on you, all at once.

We as human beings learn through experience, our hardships often define us. And if we don't experience something, we inherently become less equipped to deal with it.

That is not to say that we should escalate all conflict but rather we should open ourselves up to it when necessary so we do not fear it as we fear the unknown.

This could work for other platforms too like if youtubers look at their exact view or subscriber count.

The Empire State Building or the Taj Mahal wouldn’t have been made without thousands of workers. 

But even going beyond all of that….. imagine all the things rich people enjoy. The things they buy are a direct result of people in poverty suppling things to them. Buying a $100 Million mansion in Beverly Hills? That’s the collective work of thousands of average workers. Not just the actual construction, but the people who set up the land below the construction, the people who work in 3rd world countries to provide construction materials, etc. They way rich people MAKE their money and the way they SPEND their money are both on the backs of all the rest of us average joes.

You better believe it!,u/discodoggie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1as3lui/uk_taxed_twice_on_the_same_earnings_you_better/,Showerthoughts,"You work you pay your income tax and National Insurance. You put money into a pension, saving for a better future retirement.

You retire and when you finally receive the pension you put a share of your wages into the fund for years... You get taxed on it again as INCOME.

Surely if you paid Income Tax on that money when you earned it and set it aside, you shouldn't be paying Income Tax on it again when you get your money back.

Unfortunately my Dad has just found out this is the case.

If he hadn't bought his house, he would have to pay out for rent. But people that never saved don't. He feels totally conned.

Anyone who remembers the 80s & 90s (my Gen Xers) remember we were getting hammered with adverts to get a pension. Now we can cash it in, in our 40s and get use of it all instead of getting screwed."

Explanation: 

For any same dice to land on the same number, the odds are 1 in (value of the dice)^(amount of dice - 1) because probabilities are multiplied. The first dice doesn’t matter, and all dice other that are 1/value of dice. That is val*val*val*… or val^amount-1

For 4 d12 this is 12^3 or 1 in 1728 odds of them rolling onto the same number

For 3 d12 and 1 d4 this is a little trickier. The 1st 3 are obvious, 1/12^2 or 1/144. Adding the d4 requires those 3 dice to be on a number that the d4 can roll to. 4/12 numbers are possible to roll on a d4 and a d12, so multiply this total by 4/12, or 1/3, which gives 1/432. The odds of this being the number the d4 landed on is another 1/4 chance which gives us 1/1728

1/1728 = 1/1728 so they have the same probability"

This is not your fault, culture just develops very fast in the modern era, so while Avril Lavegne's outfit in Sk8er Boi (and the spelling of that song's name) was at one point very trendy, it is now more or less a relic of a bygone culture that doesn't exist in the same form today. Nothing she did in that video is inherently cringe, you just don't see many people with like 20 bracelets and a loose necktie over a long sleeve shirt nowadays. 

Equally, obsessing over a pet rock in the 1980's is not the fault of that generation, it was trendy to carry a rock in a box, and watching stupid videos aimed for kids on Youtube is not the fault of this generation, they're there specifically for that purpose.

**Regretting doing something/not doing something**

That's the real cringe. While some things come from a lack of social knowledge, or a lack of information, the purposefully selfish ones will sting a bit. "

Continuous Improvement (see Manufacturing 'Lean Six Sigma')

and permaculture.  
  
I was pondering over how if we shortened our commute time globally by 15 minutes how we would save a percentage of our time and gas/carbon footprint. I've recently become obsessed with commutes as a problem due to cost, then soon after realizing time... and then exactly how it's a waste if it's not necessary.  
  
My thoughts on permaculture is being observational, intentional, and sustainable/resourceful. Removing waste is what we do - although we are generally repurposing or reusing etc..."

With LLMs and things like Sora continously improving, I see a huge opportunity here in the not too distant future.

What I imagine is that you will not pick a show per say, but more of an adventure or universe. So think of picking.g something like.harry Potter world. You will be immersed in the movie and it will write itself based on your wbgagwment. Obviously the headsets will track eye movement. Blink rate, pulse, etc. To get your engagement methods. The AI will then change the story line to be much more engaging as the world plays out before your eyes. Obviously I think there will be human interaction in the story as well.
