34,2024-01-31,An Obvious Reminder that Companies who can do WFH Should.,u/DerTodwirdzudir,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1afwyi9/an_obvious_reminder_that_companies_who_can_do_wfh/,antiwork,"I, thankfully, have a position that's hybrid. When looking for a job I wasn't hellbent on WFH, mainly because I was desperate for a job. 

Now, due to the continuing surge of covid, our entire office was recently impacted by an outbreak. Out of precaution, the boss mandated everyone, positive or not, work from home. Luckily I dodged covid. The shitkicker is that my significant other may have potentially been exposed to covid recently. So, I emailed the boss and management explaining the situation. No questions asked and no resistance, they said work the remainder of the week from home.

It's so fucked up how a vast amount of companies are mandating RTO. And I for one am thankful the small company I work for maintained the means and infrastructure to allow their employees to WFH when needed. Because covid is still here. And it's a motherfucker. Companies who have the means to allow their employees to WFH should. Even if covid has ultimately winded down over the years, it's nonetheless here to stay. And allowing their employees to still work while sick allows the worker to maintain earning a wage without blowing through what little benefits they may have; and therefore allow the company to continue operating without significant disruption. 

Obvious food for thought."

Anyways before I went on sick leave, I applied for a coordinator role which is essentially a promotion in the sales department. Anyways a day after I returned to work I had a somewhat informal interview about the promotion with the senior manager and it was pleasant enough. So my manager wanted to have a meeting with me when I returned from sick leave, just a standard catch up, review if my hours are suitable etc. I’ve been back at work a week now and she has rescheduled the meeting as she said she is still awaiting an answer from the senior manager about the new job. So I’m wondering, if I haven’t got job and the job doesn’t concern me, why can’t she just have the meeting now? Does this mean I have the job? Lol what does this mean?"

&#x200B;

So I work at a big company and my boss is very high up. We are supposed to work together on projects and initiatives. The problem is whenever I am given a task, the next time we talk about it again I am given new information that makes the work I already completed mute as priorities have changed or this task was given prematurely and is no longer relevant. It has gotten so bad that whenever I am given a task, I usually do nothing for 1-2 weeks as whenever we circle back to it, I am given info that any work I have done has been rendered mute again. 

&#x200B;

It's easy money but it is so boring at work. I am usually just on reddit or online shopping. I feel like I am not learning anything or doing anything that may result in me being promoted. Should I just continue to milk it or speak up and try to get my voice heard. 

&#x200B;

Also I am a contractor and my contract is up in April and I have been told it will not be renewed. My motivation to do anything is near zero. I have been applying to jobs since August but to no avail. Not even a single interview. I do not know what to do. I wish there was a viable current alternative to capitalism. "

18,2024-01-31,The freeing sound of a resignation letter being handed in,u/TumbleWeedPasses,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1afy531/the_freeing_sound_of_a_resignation_letter_being/,antiwork,"There's no feeling quite like the weight being lifted off your shoulders as you hand in your letter of resignation. From the self doubt and nervousness beforehand, to the jelly legged relief after the ordeal and knowing it was the right choice. 

Let me share my tale of resignation relief, and the ordeals that lead me there.(I'll do it in bullet points to save this becoming an autobiography.)

* I felt job catfished. When I started I was a warehouse worker just doing basic warehouse packing. The workload was small, the team was smaller and the wage was minimum but it was close to home so I persevered. Then the boss introduced a second business which was, what I'll call 'small motorised vehicles for the vulnerable' which we were expected to run alongside our actual job. 
* The warmer months came, and both companies picked up. I became basically an unqualified technician of the small motorised vehicles, building them and repairing ones that came back busted. It was busy, and we'd often skip breaks to ensure we kept up with everything. We were also expected to wait if couriers were late, boss suggesting us to wait up to two hours. 
* The turnover was big. Time I left it was nearly all new faces. 
* Boss was away pretty much 9 months of the year, likely using the money we grafted for.
* Bonuses were big when I started. They quickly dwindled into double figures despite things being ten times busier.
* We were always promised a payrise. It did not happen. I mentioned this but was told it isn't viable yet but it will happen. This promise went on and on for a year. 
* Boss comes in one day in a particularly sour mood, and begins nit-picking at everything wrong (not swept, boxes are open, little things like that) and is told we're severely short staffed and just don't have time to do those things along with running two companies. Boss threatens to fire people. That was the moment I decided this isn't worth my time. Notice went in a week later. 
* Worked notice but with less effort. Still maintained the high safety level when building vehicles because I wasn't bringing someone innocent into my gripe but certainly stopped giving the workload my all. 
* Operations manager noticeably switched personality around me after I resigned. No more chit chat, just snaking past me quietly.  Arrived 10 minutes late once during my notice period and operations manager dramatically looked at his watch and glared at me. I bite my tongue at the hypocrisy as he was always the culprit of slinking off hours early whenever the boss wasn't in, which was a very regular occurrence.  

There's a lot I've left out just because it's not relevant to myself personally or it's just gonna turn this moan post into a moan novel. 

Moral of the story is; never give blood for a company that will give you squat.  Never give blood for a company end of. And wage quitting is definitely not a bad thing. 

&#x200B;

If anyone else wants to share a resignation story, I actively welcome it. "

As I know is happening at nearly every retailer, our weekly payroll just keeps getting less and less.

For example, next week’s hours are so low that by the time I schedule the full-timers their hours, it’s going to leave an average of TEN HOURS per part-timer (I have 10 part-timers but the real kicker is I’m SUPPOSED to have 13…).

The ten hour average is only as “good” as it is because one of our full time positions is open and another full-timer is out on medical leave. If those missing hours were in my schedule I’d have enough for exactly 2.2 hours apiece for my part-timers next week.

But, again, I’m THREE PART-TIMERS short of having a full staff.

Customers will frequently complain about us being short-staffed and say shit like “I guess nobody wants to work” and I just tell them that’s not it… Even with the crappy pay we offer, I have several employees practically begging for more hours that I just can’t give them.

Fortunately it was not physical, but there was a lot of emotional and spiritual abuse. The type of thing’s that you read about in the papers and think “wow, that priest needs to be in jail!” Well, I finally put my foot down and he fired me. This was when I went to hr, since he fired me, I didn’t have any more reason to stuff things down so I could provide for my family. Upon talking to hr, presenting evidence, such as screenshots, recordings, and emails, I was told “sorry, we can’t help you because you’re an adult male, though it sounds like you should be happy not to work there anymore!” After that I went to a legal advisor (Indiana) and he said the same thing (but in a pissed off at the law way, not a “f off” way, he’s a good man.) it turns out that, unless you are either a woman or a child, you can’t actually be abused by your boss! Who’d have thought it, I guess all his stuff was just made up in my head. 


This is all so stupid. The next logical step for me is to go public. Either that can make me seem like a bad guy for tarnishing the church, or like a victim and poster child for why the church is evil. I don’t want any of these, I just want an apology."

I worked at a nonprofit and was paid hourly.  I requested a pay revision (but let's put that aside) and to be changed from hourly to salaried.  This matters because it affects, for instance, who can go abroad on behalf of the agency and the like.  There are benefits and drawbacks to both hourly and salaried but in my particular position salaried was better.  The agency has offices in several states and I know for a fact that those in other states have both salaried and hourly workers in my same position.  

&#x200B;

My boss agreed and her boss agreed as well, and both made the request to HR.  The head of HR replied and gave a long winded explanation that translates to you must hold a master's and be licensed in the profession to be salaried; those who do not meet those requirements are hourly.  I don't meet those requirements so I'm hourly.  Ok, so far that's fair and makes sense.

The problem is that I know several of the other case managers outside of my state are salaried *despite* not meeting the criteria.  Like, I asked these folks for their whole educational background to make sure I didn't get it twisted.  They confirmed they are salaried despite the lack of a license or a master's.  

I replied to my boss and let her know that the information HR gave her was incorrect (I mean in fairness I was unnecessarily unprofessional and said that HR is either incompetent or lying and both are bad) and my boss acknowledged receipt of the email and said she'd follow up.  Later I get an email telling me that I was disrespectful and need to change my tone (which again, fair, I'll take the L on that one).   But about the discrepancy?  Crickets.  The crickets echo through the whole damn agency. Not addressed, no explanation, no remediation, nothing.

I gave Worker's Comp a statement as part of the process and they ultimately deemed it wasn't work related since I could not pinpoint the direct cause of the pain I'm feeling. I was then told to not return to work and call the insurance company that handles our FMLA and Short/Long Term Disability claims.

I saw an on-site doctor twice before this decision was made. They recommended I see a specialist and asked me to pick one. I did so, but when the claim was denied they stopped helping me. I've tried to set up an appointment with the specialist on my own and their office has told me they'd need the claim denial paperwork. Three days later and they still have not received it.

As far as I'm aware I'll be on Short Term Disability while I'm getting this resolved, but I'm still frustrated with all the hoops I'm having to jump through simply because I started hurting and tried to get help before it became something serious. I'm not even trying to get out of work, I just want to stop hurting and keep working.

I also called a Worker's Comp claim lawyer on the advice of a coworker and was told I'd have to see a doctor and have a diagnosis before they could do anything to help me.

I know I'm basically just going to have to call and harass people everyday, but I don't know what else I can be doing to get this matter handled as quickly as possible. My family relies on me to provide for them and I fear losing my job over this."

I wonder if she was hit by a car? She doesn't disclose those details. But she does say:

"" I had just started a new job and kept working until the excruciating pain in my back and down my left leg to my foot became so unbearable that I could not stand or walk and was bedridden. My foot was numb. I was let go from the job because of this. I cannot describe how bad the pain was. I was hospitalized for 23 agonizing days""

She then says she has no more family left and needs money to cover her rent. This is just so fucking terrible. How do people in this country continue to think we don't need social safety nets? Here is a prime example of someone who was working and then something ruined her health and now she's close to homelessness. Meanwhile we got fucks like Elon Musk trying to rip away what little labor laws we have. 

Anyway this is the gofundme that depressed me, in case anyone else needs some late stage capitalism depression fuel:

My Supervisor is a great guy and I get along with him fine, however he is a micromanager. For some context, I was generally left alone as I perform well, however, this current project I am on is complex and complicated.

 I noticed that my boss has micromanaged me to the point where I am getting frustrated. This is actually affecting my confidence as well.

For example, I will be working on assignments that need to get done within the day, and he will come to my desk requesting that I change how a file is labeled and set up. Then he will go on a 30 minute lecture on how I should label things..... And these small things happen multiple times a day. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I have to ask permissiom/guidance on everything so I don't have to redo stuff or get a long ass lecture.

Another example is he will ask me to send an email that I sent him and ask to resend with another person included and him again. I am unsure why he can't forward the email, but yeah....

All the things he micromanages me on are not technical in nature and are just menial unimportant tasks. E.g. how something should be said, labeled, emails, etc...

A new boss is supposed to take over soon and I am worried I have been conditioned to be micromanaged and not work autonomously. 

Has anyone had this experience, and what is your advice to gaining confidence after being micromanaged."

When COVID began, fellow employees and I were left with few options for work, as the restaurant industry was hit very hard. My boss at the time rallied their remaining employees to file for unemployment to ""save the business"" while still working full time. For a while we were given supplemental cash (an additional $300 a week) to help cover the difference in pay, but a few months on when PPP funding started coming in, and the cash was redirected toward facility improvements to ""save the business"", we continued to file with no supplemental income for over a year. The owner manipulated employee data between their two businesses. Little to none of the PPP funding went into employees pockets, while the government bankrolled the active payroll. We were told all along that it was essential to keeping the business afloat, while thousands were invested in self dealing construction projects completed by the owners family, while the employees who stayed were laid the same as anyone else sitting at home, unable to work. The issue is, if I was to report this to a state or federal agency, would I also be implicated in fraud and forced for repay my earnings to the government? What recourse would I possibly face? A quick online search shows the employer received around $250,000 total, all forgiven. Any recommendations will help."

Over a month ago, someone turned in some expensive headphones to me ($120-$200) and said they just found it in our lobby.

I properly marked it, where the person said it was found, then put it in our lost and found. That was it, it was off my mind. It sat there for a whole month until a couple of my other coworkers decided they wanted them.

Pay close attention to the following because shit gets WEIRD, and something isn’t adding up.

On Monday, the girls decided they wanted them. They had them in their hands and stated they hid them in the lost and found box. Why did they hide something that’s been there for a month? And why did they hide it when they’re the only ones thinking about them?

Tuesday, I worked. Wednesday, they asked the manager if they could have the headphones. Manager looks in the box and says they couldn’t find them. Why did they wait a day to ask the manager?

I came into work Wednesday and one of the girls told me how they were missing. There was an obvious implication that I took them. My first response was check the cameras! There’s a camera right above the lost and found box.

Thursday comes, I work again. I asked her if they checked the cameras, no she forgot to ask. So I stopped thinking about it.

A whole week later passes and I receive an update from the same girl. She says the manager found them the next day after they asked about them (so a week ago), but says they were out of the box and seemed hidden. The girl says someone must’ve put them back.

Why didn’t the manager tell anyone until today?

I worked that night, once again implying it was me who put them back. I said again they should just check the camera…

It’s also super weird how they sat there a whole month then only disappeared when those two girls touched them.

It’s annoying to come to work and be slyly accused of stealing something when if I was a lowlife like that, I could’ve taken them when they turned them in to me a month ago. And why won’t they check the cameras!!!

I barely even want to talk to people let alone have people thinking I’m a thief when it seems like I’m the only person who *didn’t* care about the headphones.

While the girl was giving me that update today, I had my letter of resignation in my backpack. Just sealed the deal for me."

I am the only teacher in this room-  I work for an early childhood education company that basically ignores my pleas and cry for help, today was the last straw. I come back from my lunch break, the person in the room got nothing done, just stood there talking, so I had to hastily get my class ready for outside but first they had to wake up, put the shoes on, put their bedding away and potty. Now the shitty part (while half that got done) I work with older kids most of whom are four but I have some in diapers in a room that has zero space (just a narrow area that can be viewed be anyone) to change them, no table nothing, just the standup method, so they needed changing. While I was about to help these students another student walked over to one that was sitting on the ground talking to friends  and she dropped kicked her on the head for zero reason then the kid started swinging at her again for zero reason. I pull her aside (my class doesn’t have a working phone nor a walkie-talkie) open the hallway door and ask for help as she needed a break from my room,my boss said I’m on the phone I’ll be there in a moment. All the while I have kids with loaded diapers needing help, another crying due to nightmares, another crying cause he wants his mom, the one who got hit is in immense pain, all the while I’m standing by this door waiting for my boss to come get her as this child is taking swings at kids coming to me for help and comfort, she stomped and punched another child…,after they backed off she tried that on me, hurt my foot fairly decent (rain boots…) and tried to bite me, so I yell for help now, my boss shrieks she’s on the phone with a parent; it took 10 min from incident to help…I hate my company, my place of work, my boss…. To add insult I got told I was being to emotional and rash to demand this child exit my room; I got sent home after filling out ten pages of incident and accident reports;  I got a call later telling me to take tomorrow off"

Assuming it causes people to walk out being right then or maybe to find another job and leave as soon as they can. That $50 flag, that 7 extra cents saved of toilet paper (average cost per square is 1 cent), etc. It actually cost the company way way way more.

The average cost of employee turnover depends on various factors, such as the level of seniority, the industry, and the location of the company. However, some estimates suggest that losing an employee can cost a company one half to two times the employee’s annual salary. This includes both tangible and intangible costs, such as recruitment, training, productivity loss, morale loss, and customer satisfaction loss.

&#x200B;

For example, if an employee earns $25,000 a year, the average cost of turnover for that position could range from $12,500 to $50,000. For hourly workers, it costs an average of $1,500 per employee. For technical positions, the cost jumps to 100 to 150 percent of salary. For C-suite positions, the cost can be as high as 213% of salary.

Even something like retail you're looking at about $3k to hire and then $1k to train the person to do their job. 

&#x200B;

Meaning that $50 flag now cost $4k+ on the low side like retail and then most other jobs tens of thousands of dollars. And that is assuming the next person will work out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is something I wish more would bring up. Like people have told bad bosses that by doing x it will cause people to walk. And the boss calls them something like a snowflake. But I wonder how the bosses with handle it if asked how much are they saving by doing x or how much did they spend on x. And then point out how doing such things actually will likely cost the company thousands to tens of thousands of dollars in getting a new person all which could've been saved if the boss showed an ounce of respect to the workers.

And if they want to argue with it. Ask them to do the math, as math doesn't lie. Like even if the % or $ is off some. The total cost is likely going to quickly make the bosses actions very obvious they shouldn't do x.

I mean some won't ever admit they are wrong. But I really would love to hear stories where people used this logic against a bad boss to see if it helps or what excuse they have."

Now, I get called out for taking 1-2 days/month work from home. No flexibility regarding childcare or personal matters, I'm met with the response to ""figure it out."" 

I'm able to get quality work done quickly, and I don't prefer to sit at the desk until 9am - 5pm. I am physically in office for 6-7 hours every day and push out all my deliverables on-time. Now, I am also getting called out for not working a full 40 hours and I need to report my working hours/report if I have a one-off situation that requires me to leave earlier than 5pm. 

This is most likely a silent layoff where they will ""ease up"" when X amount of money has been saved. However, this is driving me insane. In this economy, I'm grateful for a job that pays well but I value my time more than anything. This is not the culture that I signed up for. I'm getting nightmares about work frequently, I feel like a shell of myself at work, finding joy in the sliver of a 2-day weekend when I feel free, and just breaking down crying most nights thinking about work. I live in a high COL area & have a decent amount saved up to fall on; I haven't been at this company long so finding a remote job might be hard \[I'm not in tech btw\]. Everyone I've talked to has told me to stick it out and line up something else first. Do I comply and sit there 9am-5pm until enough people leave? Do I just adjust and comply? No one is speaking up but me. I might get fired for expressing my opinions and not abiding by the 9am-5pm window. That scares me a lot even though I'm considering leaving. 

Appreciate any words of wisdom or whip me back into shape with what the job market is looking like. (Looking to go into healthcare tech or environmental company). 

Excuse my long rant, there are many happy events happening with my family/friends so I don't want to burden them with this constant topic.

old folks and managers and suits love to complain about young people not having any work ethic. i'm 20 years old and i cannot fucking tell you how good it feels to do a job and do it well. my problem is not that i don't want to fucking work, it's that suits are greedy and want to overwork and understaff their stores as much as humanly fucking possible to keep the rest of their stupid fucking money they promised that i would be earning.

i work 5-6 days a week, and by payday, what do i have to show for it? 200 dollars that i have to use literally all of to barely survive. i'm an artist. i haven't drawn something truly meaningful or fun to me in literal months and it breaks my heart. i don't sing anymore. i don't have time or transportation to go to community choir because i'm too busy working just to be able to afford food, and not, y'know, the 125 a month bill i would be getting in the mail every month if i could afford a car. do you get what i'm saying? of course you do. you're all in the exact same fucking boat. i live in hud housing where - if i'm careful about it - my one bill is as low as 68-74 dollars a month. *and i still can't make end's meet.*

i would love to socialize and talk to customers and organize and do menial fucking tasks all goddamn day if it meant i could go home and do literally anything i wanted. hey hun, i'm home, let's go out to dinner tonight. what ever happened to that? i'll tell you what; the greedy fucking slobs at the top who think sitting on their ass all day built them their exploitative and manipulative empire.

it runs in the government too. this week i should have been paid 230-some odd dollaroos and i got 180. where's my money going? to foot the city's electric bill for the 8-billion inch flatscreens they have at the local college's football stadium. not, of course, the far less important ROTTING WATER PIPES THAT HAVE CHEMICALS AND DIRT REGULARLY PUMPED THROUGH THEM. i BURN when i leave the shower. 

but i'm not working hard enough. it's my fault. i'm not working hard enough and i don't want to work and i'm a lazy piece of shit that will never contribute anything to the fucking slave mill we call society. i have to take out a soul-sucking loan to *maybe* get a degree - thanks mental illness - that MIGHT get me a job that pays me enough to live, but never one that i enjoy doing. i like my job. i like talking to customers. i like being social. i really do feel like it's an ideal job for me. but i can't fucking work anymore. something's gotta give because i am so, so fucking tired.

wish i was the local tortured artist. painting walls and wailing sad songs and telling passerbys not to take their lives for granted. someone hire me to walk through a cemetary with a whispy white dress screaming ""MIS HIJOS! MIS HIJOS!""."

I had availability for both jobs and was being scheduled regularly at both up until recently. I was still technically present on the schedule at my second job (crocs retail), but I didn’t have any hours. At the same time, one of my supervisors at that crocs job who I am good friends with quit and gave about a week’s notice. To compensate for having minimal hours at my second job I needed to start picking up more at my first, so I admit I’d meant to get in touch with my second boss and ask him about my hours, but I’d plain forgotten. So, my friend quits, and the day after his last day he comes and tells me, “I just remembered. (Boss’s name) asked me if you still worked here yesterday and then when I said yes he told me he was terminating you and he wanted me to tell you for him. I told him to call you. He said you’re done because you’re a seasonal hire.” 

I’m not a seasonal hire. Nowhere in any of the systems was i a seasonal hire. I was never even told I was seasonal. My 1 year anniversary with the company was coming up. No one ever called to tell me I was termed and I’m honestly confused as to why I was. Is there any sort of action I can take towards this? The extra money I made at crocs was used towards my schooling so now I’m a little more screwed than I already was."

I had a 1:1 with my HR and my new leader 2 weeks ago where my new manager, an old hag, told me I've received the worst performance review imaginable and I should, among other stuff, provide a performance improvement plan within a week. After the meeting they wrote me an email where my knowledge gaps were described in only very broad terms. Very well, so I provided a PIP in equally broad strokes and I've asked for concrete examples of my knowledge gaps so that I can then provide a more specific PIP. They refused to provide examples in writing telling me I have been provided with numerous examples during the meeting.   


One of my questions however is: is it usual practice that the employee writes their own PIP?! Isn't this HR's job?? And what about the refusal to list examples of my knowledge gaps? (for which I've already documented evidence that it's complete bs). 

I have to add, I'm employed and based in Europe, but my manager and business partner HR are based in the US. 

Any ideas? "
50,2024-02-01,Vacation Games,u/Opening-Fold8325,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ag9o82/vacation_games/,antiwork,"I (50M) worked for a company that wasn't just a business; it was a family.  They provided contracted IT support to nonprofits and traded heavily on an image of ""giving back to the community"" as well as supporting our troops (several clients are veterans' organizations).

So here's how they do vacation.

You cannot go in the hole with vacation days. Vacation days are awarded at rhe biweekly paychecks.
You must submit vacation requests two weeks in advance.
Vacation days do not roll over to the new year.

This means no one ever gets to take all their vacation.  The days awarded at the December 15th paycheck could never be used, because you had to request them by 12/1, couldn't request them until they'd been awarded,  you didn't get them till 12/15, and they disappeared on 1/1.   In six years I was the first employee to mention this, or so they claimed. 

Naturally this family organization cut me loose when they found a more qualified woman they could pay less than half my salary to do the same job.  At which point I learned that accrued vacation is forfeited in a termination.  This is a policy stated nowhere except in sn email from HR dated the day after my unexplained termination.

Department of Labor got involved and directed the company to pay me for the accrued vacation (25 hours at 44.23 per).  They have 7 days left to do so.

Edited to add: I am a veteran and very proud of it.  I don't make a big deal about it but when someone wraps themselves in the flag about how much they love the troops and then steals from me, it becomes an issue. "

He seemed really nice. He had an autistic brother and I was going through my ADHD and Autism diagnosis. Nobody at my office knew because it was in the process. Didn't want to speculate. But told him because I knew for sure. I thought he'd be the only person to get me. This was 3 months into my job where I was lonely and didn't know anyone or anything. I trusted him. Turns out he was set up by my boss. He asked me questions I answered it. We discussed about a lot of things. But he recorded and edited everything out. The recordings-he sent it to my team and everyone. 

I became a ""vain, misandrist, racist, airhead with dr*g issues""

A few of these recordings are about my culture. About how I don't wanna date men of my culture because they can be misogynistic. It's a stupid exaggeration. But it's recorded and that's what I'm remembered by. Another thing that was recorded was my admission to using w**d and psychdlics.

He's also really manipulative. For instance, we were talking, he looked at a reflective window suddenly, I looked at where he was looking. He went and told everyone, while talking I kept staring at my own reflections. 

My manager and team knew every single thing. And made me jump through moral hoops. Like tried to pit me against another female coworker, to prove I'm not actually a feminist or something. I didn't fall for it.  But because I kept quiet, they wrote down my answer. The worst is my boss's boss is my race. He heard about this, wanted revenge. Pretended to like me. I eventually liked him. He made it seem like he was separated from his wife. I called him. And he mentioned his kids ages- they're very young. Things felt fishy after hearing about kids ages. it turned out he lied. This call was played out to everyone.

The funny thing is I actually went through all of the opposite. The person from my team who asked my friend to ask these questions was actually very discriminatory towards me. This co-worker itself is very inappropriate towards me. Turns out my boss and my team helped with these. I can't do anything about it.

They also went over my journal that I was keeping in my bag to write during commute and took pictures. There were some pretty intimate and controversial stuff I'd written there. Including the workplace too. 

I made mistakes:
I let a guy be way too comfortable to mess with me by not asserting my boundaries. He even explained to me his weird sexual experiences (at my team mate's ask). I should have said no. But I didn't. Could've kept quiet. But didn't.
I knew the boss was married. Could've repeated and screamed at myself that. Didn't.
Looked at myself on Teams even after I knew they were investigating my vanity because I was angry. Was unnecessary. Didn't.


I don't know how to process this. I thought it would be appropriate to post it here."

I maayyybbeee could see it for hourly wage employees, but barely. And for Salaried employees? If you are already earning a salary, but accrue your PTO hourly, and don't earn your full week's salary if you don't put 40+ hours in the system, than you are just fuckin hourly with extra steps.

I get my paid sick leave lump-sum, because the state I live in makes that the LAW. And I have worked at places that do the right thing, and give PTO lump-sum. It's just crazy when they build an entire system to calculate how much time off you have earned over the course of a year, because it means they are cautious in thinking you might take more than that and then quit. How little faith does corporate management need to have in their own fuckin company that they can't even put stock in the people they are willing to give salaried compensation to to stick around for even a full year?   
During my orientation for where I am now, they even told me, ""You can actually take your full year's PTO whenever, but if you quit and have taken more than you earned, you have to pay that back."". Like, GFTO, you can't even get through training a new employee without telling them you expect people to up and leave at the drop of a hat."

1,2024-02-01,Missing money on final paycheck,u/DeliveryAggressive81,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1agdg1r/missing_money_on_final_paycheck/,antiwork,"So long story short, I was basically forced to quit. The higher ups gave me an ultimatum stating that if I didn’t accept a payroll deduction for extenuating circumstances , work in restoration for 6+ years, left a job site with dusty shelves(my bad), literally that’s it. Homeowner was threatening to sue. They were trying to make me pay for the “professional” cleaning crew, AND to pay for mold clearance testing, even though there was zero suspected growth on the property and work areas, and everything dried out to industry standards. Homeowner signed our certificate of completion and satisfaction after walking him through the work areas. In total, it would’ve been around 3 grand coming out of my check and a final write up even though I’ve never been written up for the just under 2 years at this company. 

I refused to sign any write up or payroll deduction, except for the payroll deduction of some missing tools that I let a former coworker use (and he ended up pawning) that of course we didn’t find out about until he was terminated but I reported then (over a year ago). The cost of those tools and what I agreed with a signed form was 248 dollars. Yes I get that I messed up and take responsibility for that, but all the other math ain’t mathing right 😅 

On top of that, I was payroll deducted 400 for a certification class that I never took because they constantly rescheduled it due to us being understaffed. My next opportunity to take with would’ve been the 20th of this month. (Quit/terminated last Thursday)


Any advice?"

Both Betty and Colin reported directly to Anthony.

My job was 95% data entry, and I crushed it; I was consistently on top of my work, asking what I could do to help out when I finished everything, etc. 

I was hired on officially and shifted to Betty's team, Accounts Payable Resolution, which is basically troubleshooting when invoices aren't going through/customer service. My workload quadrupled, but Betty was an amazing supervisor and completely understanding. 

Betty has spent several months dealing with having an APR team that is half the size it ought to be because Anthony severely underestimates our workload and how long it takes to finish tasks.  Since I've been on the team we've gone from 10 people (which was already pushing it) to 6. 

Yesterday was Betty's last day (unsure if she was fired or finally fed up with the demands placed on her and our team). I'm concerned that it seems as though I'm slacking because a huge portion of my job is research, which is hard to quantify to Anthony (who is currently over our team), and I don't want to lose my job because he doesn't realize how involved it is. 

I want to request to be moved back to Colin's team. Do I go to Colin first, to Anthony first, to both of them at the same time?"

After filling out some basic paper work one of the requirements for the company was to be on webcam full time for your whole shift which seemed sus to me, as I have worked remotely before and never had to do that. So I asked the recruiter (who at this point in time was not on webcam in zoom but had a stock background with an photoshop room with their company logo on the wall) if I could ask them some questions in a breakout room which they said ok that's fine. They invited me into the room were I asked some questions regarding the pay 15$ (the new minimum wage) and what hours of operations they required which was sun-sat open availability. I told them I go to school on weekends and they said there is no guarantee that I could get them off. At this point I brought up the the being on webcam full time and asked this person why their webcam was not working correctly as myself and other were required to have it on just to be in the zoom meting itself. At this point in the they said it was not working correctly and I had enough ( the whole being on webcam 24/7 for your shift is a definite NO from me as its creepy to spy on us inside our own homes) So I told this faceless person I so the the rules don't apply to you? I'm withdrawing my application do not contact me further for any information and I left before they could say anything.

1. remote job wanted you to be on webcam for the whole shift

1,2024-02-01,🆃🅷🅴 🅵🆄🆃🆄🆁🅴,u/iwaschosenbyheaven99,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1agh0rb/_/,antiwork,"we are fucked because of AI. here's how it will play out

white collar companies see AI as a cost-saver, not an innovation. an ""agent smarter than them and makes them money"" isn't groundbreaking in their eyes because that's how they view their expensive employees already. all companies will shed *massive* amounts of jobs to replace with AI agents and their stocks will explode because of the savings. these companies will lack future innovations but it won't matter because they're rich and they'll put a moat around AI employees

what about blue collar? 

this massive unemployment of people formerly making $100,000s will echo through *everything*. this isn't just a problem for them, because these guys' paychecks were what was driving the trades and what are driving the price of houses. when these guys can't make their mortgages, there will be a housing crash and a subsequent decimation of trades work, too. on top of that, all these people formerly making $100,000 are going to flounder or re-train into less-automatable jobs, massively depressing wages everywhere else. so everyone is going to be poor except for the handful of companies running a closed AI system that they will make illegal for others to use or possess.

the result will be *extremely cheap, often skilled labor* which is going depress the value of everything that AI can't already do. this means we're all going to be hired as slaves building futuristic stuff designed by AIs and owned by the companies controlling the AIs

there will not be ""people in the streets"" because AI can ID everyone in the street, AI can suppress riots with extremely targeted violence, and the morality of our police/army won't be the final stopgap in oppression because they will be AI, too.

we are so doomed and fucked. our best case scenario is that we are left behind and ignored while we live in shantytowns made of scraps from the 0.0001%'s garbage"

Backstory: was sick all week, possibly with new COVID strain which led into the flu. I took a COVID test but it was inconclusive and went to work anyway for that week. Coworkers were worried about how I looked and if they might catch it, but I foraged ahead at my managers not so subtle prodding.

Cut to Monday, full swing flu carried through the weekend, took the day off and was told ""be sure to take PTO for your ""sick day"".

This seems like a violation? Tied in with the manager saying that salary workers must stay at work till the job is done and then can go home, but they must show up every morning at the same time on the dot. There is no overtime for salary workers nor compensation for hours exceeding the 40hr ""work week"".

Maybe it's a rant, maybe not, but it has been bothering me. I haven't seen any HR advice on it and haven't wanted to run it up the flagpole yet, just curious what I could say when I inevitably stand up to the guy.

1,2024-02-01,Are positions being eliminated a huge trend or something?!,u/Mental-Ad-8756,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aghav7/are_positions_being_eliminated_a_huge_trend_or/,antiwork,"Just need to rant a bit tbf, but really, I AM curious how many people get their work positions eliminated, it’s not a “firing”, it’s not even a “letting go” or “laying off”, it’s corporate completely getting rid of your position all together. Like straight up deleting a core position. Imagine saying that you “don’t need” a treasurer for you multi national company. Even though you hired them one a year ago, made them basically train the staff how to do you their job, so then you can go and say that bullshit and go through with it and kick you out the door. Talk about cutting costs. What’s the fucking point when your company is going to fail in the long term? Because why else would you do that? 

I’m angry rn and this didn’t even happen to me, it happened to my old man. Basically this morning his position was indeed eliminated. Out of the blue, but he could smell something coming eventually. Cause this has happened to him before. Every job he prayed for and got for only a moment of reprieve for the past 5 YEARS has done this exact thing to him. The crazy thing is that this time he gets no severance AT ALL. NONE. He was completely and utterly cut off from everything. At an EXECUTIVE position. Due to some other issues and patterns on top of this, he wants to sue. For example, they lied to his face in front of many witnesses saying his job was secure and that he was going to get a raise. And mind you, despite all the other bs, he never gave any issues and was a friendly “team player.” This was defiantly a set up plan anyway.

I guess there is something to learn here, so let us say, attention! If you are going into or are in finance, and the company you work for is only decent or worse, especially if your are in involved in making and presenting forecasts, consider a career change. It does not matter if you are merely the message man. People will be let go after YOUR reports, YOU will be fired if those statistics are bad. And you will know exactly why. NEVER have hope when your company you work for is failing. You best start job searching and applying elsewhere(don’t let them know). Secure your personal files, all that jazz. That’s probably best even if you aren’t involved in their treasury or finance team. EVERY employee under the CEOs are vulnerable. 

That’s what they do. Cut costs in many ways, milk what is left, cut their losses, sell the company and stocks, and then go on their merry way. I think everyone understands this by now, but your workplace does NOT give a flying fuck about you. But it’s ridiculous and unfair, there should be laws for this popular evil behavior in corporations. Honestly! It’s so difficult to get a job in the first place and you get one and in one way or many it sucks and doesn’t last anyway. And they want us to put up with it all until we’re 70?! When there is complete AGEISM?! My dads not fucking 70, he’s 50, yet of course that’s just worthless. They want people with decades of experience, but not anyone actually that old. Make it make sense.

But yeah I’m REALLY curious, is this just how business works? Is this relatable? What can we do about this shit? Does anyone have any advice, particularly about suing for unjust firing? We have a lawyer. I’m a dependent under my dad yet so yes this actually effects me, but I would still be upset on his behalf regardless. It’s not even our personal situation though. I’m concerned about MY future job, my siblings, my freinds, US, why is there nothing- why must it be so hopeless out here? You guys complain and rant on here just the same- but what can we ACTUALLY do?"

Don't want to,u/Maleficent_Team1002,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1agitff/today_i_was_requested_to_train_my_replacement_in/,antiwork,"Excuse my English, is not my mother tongue and can't give much detail without IDing me.  Soon to be a labrat (lab tech) in summer, now in an internship in a big R&D company since last April. I've learned a lot by my own and enjoyed the experience, even have been requested to develop and perfect an  accurate procedure that is way cheaper than the ICP-MS measurements they did before hiring me. And I did it. By my own. No one there has helped me and spent extra hours nailing  it. Should mention that this method is a core part of a big  development that would mean lots of money. Mentor is beyond delighted, and because of that he told me today that he wants me to train two new interns (they will get their bachelor's this summer, and I'm in vocational training: they should have ""more knowledge"" than me) in this method until I finish the internship (the internship is graded and mandatory if I want to be a lab tech). 

To be raging furious is an understatement: I provided a ""draft"" of the process when I started there,  but I have tweaked  it many since my mentor saw it,  hence I do the testing in autopilot mode. I'm the only one who knows how to do it properly to get consistent results . The college interns should know how to develop the same procedure without me training them. But nobody likes to do that (analytical chemistry) and I'm damn good at it because I spent the time and effort to do it. Remember: I'm an intern asked to train two other interns that should know more than me, so leaving is not feasible for me ATM. Don't want to do it, but I need to get good grades in the internship in order to get my diploma and fly from there ASAP. 

If this is not enough, I'm dealing with a crushing systemic autoimmune disorder (waiting test results) while working my ass to deliver the best of me, but now I feel like a clown and lied to. Reddit has helped me a lot before, so here is the question: What should I do, fellas?"

This is all pretty accurate.

What is also accurate is the system is now pivoting to an all encompassing ""merit"" contest for who is deserving of a title and the prize. I will make the argument that hierarchies have always been dysfunctional, full of egos and people willing to trample over others to get what they want.

This evolving ""contest logic"" seems to encourage all relationships and friendships to be transactional. There is a dollar value attached to what a person can do for another, how it impacts their reputation, how their connection may elevate their own career or status and how disposable each one of us truly are.

I believe modern feminism is a softening of outrage against establishment thinking and it really is neglecting to understand that there is no such thing as self made. This pits us all against each other. Billionaires shouldn't exist. The obsession of wealth, home ownership, status, influence and power eventually leads to a society willing to eat each other for their spot in the office."

At first when she started doing this, it seemed to pay off. Her boss noticed and they would renegotiate her salary and even offered her a promotion. Couple weeks ago though she finally had the meeting to officially do the pay increase and promotion, and her boss said ""the pay increase is off the table and the position you were getting has been given to someone else.""

So I told her, from here on out stop doing any extra work for them. Stop working weekends and don't volunteer for extra projects you're not getting paid for, etc.. I said do 40 hours of work and that's it. She countered and said if she didn't do all the extra stuff the department would fall apart as she's the one that's running the ship because her boss is an actual idiot who does nothing so she picks up the slack.

I was like let it fall apart then. I could tell she didn't like my advice but, these people are underpaying her like crazy and I just try to say keep in mind this scumbags are paying you below market rate for your position. And clearly they cant be trusted to give you any promised promotions so stop doing them any favors."

I have to get a job although there isn't a job I feel passionate about, I've worked for myself as a freelance video editor for 3 years as my first job, didn't make as much as I aspired to but was basically my own boss and as long as I deliver within the deadline I manage free time how I want.

I need to get a job but since my first experience of a job working for myself was soo flexible and in some months i made more money than others getting a regular job seems daunting, I'm from Portugal and here jobs aren't wellpaid soo just the thought of getting a job that I will most likely not be passionate about and losing about 10 hours of the day with just work and public transport makes me feel like crap

The only choice I see for me is to uninstall all video games, go to the gym early in the morning, get a job, read books in my lunchtime, get back to work, come home, study a side hustle, and invest the money from the job in stocks.

I have the dream of having geographic freedoom working for myself only a few hours a day and making at least 10k month, i'm 22 if by 30 i haven't achieved that i might as well consider myself a failure and kill myself"

Today with no notice I got fired from my first job out of college after 2 months during the probationary period. The officials reasons were that I showed up too early (about 30 minutes every day evidently) but I don’t think they ever actually gave me an official start time, and because I was asking too many simple questions during training. I only started training for what I was actually supposed to do for about 3 weeks in total so I feel like it was pretty soon to fire me for that. 

My main question is if i should put that on my resume or not. I spent well over a year looking for a job so the gap will be massive if I don’t."

Since then, I have applied everywhere with little success, regardless of my ten years of experience in my industry. The only thing that came through was a brief stint in a new position within the same industry, but I received an offer from another company for a position I'm experienced in. 

So I gave two weeks notice, which was a mistake because my resignation was made effective immediately and that's pretty much the worst thing that can happen when making cash tips. I accepted that I would only have a couple more weeks of struggling ahead, since I accepted an offer from this other company. Well, I showed up for orientation, was pulled aside and told I would have to do orientation the following week. I received an email the next morning, stating that the offer had been rescinded.

I can't even get a fucking job after it has been offered to and accepted by me, what the fuck am I supposed to do? I've been rejected so many times and had so much of my time wasted. It's starting to feel personal, to the point I'm wondering what the higher ups in this town say to each other about me. I'm out of food and behind on rent. I can't keep doing this."

33,2024-02-01,My Boss tried to fire me after I asked for a raise!!,u/Daddysgirl329,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1agrom8/my_boss_tried_to_fire_me_after_i_asked_for_a_raise/,antiwork,"As the title states, yes my boss tried to fire me after I asked for a raise recently.
For the sake of this post I won’t mention the field of work of what I do. 

However I need to mention that not only myself,  but also my other coworkers are severely underpaid compared to other people who work within our field at other companies (we’re all paid at least $30,000 less than what we should be making. 

Let’s call my boss by the name Nathan. I’ve been working with Nathan now for a year and a half. Nathan is the owner of our company. We are a small business and the team wears many hats. 

I’ve mentioned to Nathan last year that I’ve been feeling a little over loaded because he laid off an employee underneath me that would help me that would help to assist with various projects. Nathan was able to think of solutions for me to help alleviate some of the pressure I was feeling. However those solutions didn’t solve much. 

I started back at the company in July 2022 and I used July as a 1 year mark to ask for a raise. A lot of people within my circle encouraged me to ask for a raise sooner, however I wanted to wait until 1 year to make it more official. 

I asked for a raise during a regularly scheduled touch base. I also want to preface by saying my boss Nathan always cancels our touch bases any chance he gets. It’s extremely frustrating because I value the time with him to ask questions and to make sure everything he needs me to do in the week gets done correctly. Leading up to this moment for about 4 weeks in a row we’ve had our touch bases get canceled. There are many times when I think he’s canceling the touch bases with me because he simply doesn’t want to talk to me. 

Anyway, since I couldn’t get ahold of him for the past month, I was quick and direct with him when I finally had a moment to talk to him about my salary. 
Once I opened the conversation he stood still, then asked the $$ I had in mind. I gave him my salary requirement. I will say I didn’t ask for a small raise of $3-5k, however I asked for a raise that would be comparable to what other people in our field makes. I was aiming high so we can meet in the middle, and have a plan in place over the next 2 years to help me to get to my desired salary. 

I also want to state, I’m notorious for working late, skipping lunch, and ensuring that everything that I need to do gets done for the day. I’ve even gotten feedback from my family that I need to take it easy and have a better work life balance. Anyway the conversation with him lasted 10 mins. He said he would get back to me next week to see if the salary I had in mind was feasible. 

Fast forward to a few days later, my boss schedules an impromptu meeting on the calander. I didn’t think much of it. 

He starts of the meeting by saying he gave it some thought, and said he thinks that I’m selfish and full of myself for asking for a raise. He goes on to say I’m only in this for my self and not for the betterment of our small team. 
He then encourages me to look for another job and to resign because I wasn’t a good culture fit. While he’s saying all this he did mention the work that I put in was good and doesn’t have any complaintsabout the job I do, it was more around the fact that I complained about workload and supposedly never wanting to support my team. 

Meanwhile half of the projects I’m working on is supposed to be handled by another department. But since I had experience in this section of what I do prior, he wanted me to work on this particular project for the company. Now that I’m looking at it , I spend 60% of my time working on a project that is not supposed to be handled by me. No wonder why I’m feeling a lot of workload stress because I’m technically doing other peoples jobs.

Anyway there’s more to the story, but to sum it up, I’m still at this company. I don’t take him up on his offer to resign, because I didn’t have a job lined up. I have a family to feed. I’m looking for other jobs right now on the side. 
But him gaslighting me is crazy and the company is starting to feel like a cult.

Also I want to mention this happened in July last year, and I still didn’t get a raise not even a small increase. Also I have not gotten a raise since I started at this company."

So my (29M) fiancée (26F) works at a political place with HQ in DC (we live in NYC) and it’s an absolute mess. 

They have no HR department right now and recently fired their diversity department person early after they were going to get rid of her position, they LIED about the fact that was happening, and then fired her early for telling people about them lying. There was absolutely no accountability for that but my fiancée — who also briefly tried to organize a union before fizzling — led and wrote a letter to management in support of her friend keeping her position before they fired her. 

Anyway, out of the blue today — just two weeks after being told she was doing a good job — my fiancée had a meeting with her supervisor who basically gave her a three week performance plan (including a section about “bringing concerns to leadership rather than spreading dissent to others”) or she will be fired. 

Even more absurd, apparently the COO personally wanted her fired immediately, out of the blue, but her supervisor basically argued for a three-week performance plan. 

The writing is on the wall and she’s almost certainly facing an impossible climb to keep her job. And given the “dissent” comments in the performance plan — and the COO personally wanting her fired — it seems like extremely blatant retaliation for being outspoken at the company. 

The job is at-will with no union so my question is, what can we do? She’s going to document everything and ask for frequent status updates, but do we have any legal remedy whatsoever? Any protection from firing solely for being a company “troublemaker”?"

Ive had reddit for years but im new to using it.

I am looking for advice on how to be maliciously compliant. I have had a similar issue happen at other jobs (which ik it seems like a me problem but i do what everyone else does at all jobs for some reason its just an issue when its me)
I work at a correctional center, apparently a client complained that i was playing sudoku on my computer, i always make sure i have all my tasks done before i do anything like that to pass time, i do find it interesting that they cared that much when ive been doing it for months with no complaints from clients, as well as i think the main issue should be that they can see my computer which has confidential information on there. 
I am fine not playing games anymore i just yhink its hypocritical when other employees get to do things like that but its only an issue when i do. (I plan on turning my computer away from clients tho cause like i said it has confidential info they shouldnt be able to see)

I was also told a coworker complained that i act like i dont want to be there. 
I openly talk about loving that job and wishing i could work there full time and i am never mean or exclude anyone so im not sure where this is coming from. 
I do everything i was trained to do so if im not doing something the  i wasnt trained on it (not from lack of asking) which i explained to them, as well as i do things that are asked of other people because im able to help. I also go out of my way to try to make the place more fun for clients with silly things like fun facts on a board and stickers. 
I told this person that i have been being made fun of, people bring up politics, anti trans discussions, the boss talking bad about new coworkers and my coworker yelling and swearing,and my coworker and boss making jokes about the clients, yet the person i was talking to did not care about any of that. I even explained my coworkers have thrown away my things deliberately and this person did not care, they only care that im not working 24/7 with a happy happy attitude. 
The same coworker told me i didnt need to be there and he didnt want my help so i didnt help him last time and now im getting these complaints. I told the person who emailed me and all she said was my boss can find me extra tasks 

I need ideas how to be maliciously compliant preferably something that will get in their way and slow work down? I dont want to kiss their ass, im sick of things like this happening. 
I clean up, i do extra tasks, i act professional, 
 My coworker who only has this job (3hrs once a week) his wife pays the bills and he does the call ins (we get 15mins extra pay and 30 mins on sunday, i was doing it but i wanted to set a schedule seeing i have other jobs and that upset him so now he does all of them) and he constantly says he hates coming in and hates the job so i am so confused. 

Some ideas i have is cleaning that gets in the way and not talking unless its work related. And constantly asking my boss for tasks to do. Any help would be appreciated.
Im So burned out from working jobs that dont appreciate me cause im not doing something 24/7 
I stopped going above and beyond now its an issue. Thats why i had more free time for my horrible sudoku. And no this is not all because i “want to play games instead of work” its because i feel singled out."

I left the industry during the covid era out of necessity, jumped into the tech startup world, where like many I was suddenly let go due to no fault of my own after a couple years. High performer, etc. I'm back behind the bar, but I'm noticing that not only do I hear about layoffs over the bartop as a common topic of conversation across many industries, but that it's starting to have an effect on restaurants. Here in Houston, every restaurant is having a hard time getting butts in seats, with several high profile closures announced already this year. The sparkle of the trendy indie bar/restaurant has gone with the times, prices are soaring, people just aren't interested. I'm grateful to manage a bar for a Beard nominated restaurant group, I'll be fine, but I can't help but feel like I dodged a bullet. I can't imagine climbing the ranks in today's climate. It truly seems like restaurant work, with of course exceptions, has this darkness attached to it again. There's always been an unspoken gap between diners and servers, and the unlikelihood that servers could ever afford a night out at their own workplace, but it feels super real as of late. Anybody else feel this sentiment?"

The interview process was super smooth, HR seemed super excited for me to join kept reiterating that didn't want a failed hire and they really problem solve and adapt for each employees needs and they would rather help me grow vs move on.
I was pretty vocal about wanting to earn wfh ( smaller company and about 75% are fully remote or come in 1-2) I've been allowed to wfh twice due to some issues with my diabetes which I disclosed in the acceptance. I advised I pushed an appointment to accommodate their start date request and got a half day off approved (which is next week.) So far I've had hr ask me twice if I needed accommodations bc I was leaving my desk too much(not true. I proved meetings etc).
 I started a week after another person and I am consistently out performing her (mostly bc I have experience in this type of role and the industry) and hr can ask to see those metrics from my direct boss. My direct boss has given me a few pointers to help in my lower strength areas and he has told me consistently he is happy with my progress and he isn't a Micromanager. Is HR just trying to protect themselves since I'm still in my 90 day probationary? I can't get a feel for what feels like positive encouragements and ""advice"" but also criticism. 

Tl dr - direct boss is nothing but honest, upfront and kind, HR seems a bit too focused on me taking private time (less than 5 minutes) to check sugar when I am not insulin dependent and I don't need accommodations bc I am able to meet all time deadlines/etc and in these 3 weeks I've only had to check my sugar twice."

I have a bachelors and 7 years cooking experience, from line cook, to sous chef to executive chef on my resume. Two months ago, this questionable ass kisser shows up who has a little two year culinary associates from the local community college. 

He has become the first person to have no stipulated one dish/tedious prep shift a week, which, up until the past few months had also included the owner, and two grandfathered-in managers from the previous restaurant(who were just cooks in the previous restaurant). The new guy is in his 3rd week or not having to do one dish shift, while I (with a ton of kitchen and managerial experience) and the guy hired right after me (who is at his second kitchen job) still have to do the stipulated dish shift; dude in his second kitchen job has 3 out 5 in dish.

I’m feeling pretty “skipped over” obviously and it feels like a big slap in the face, and other coworkers have noticed; acknowledging my thoughts and stating their own. I’m frantically looking on Indeed for but not finding anything at all. I’m thinking about reporting this place to the Department of Labor, first of all, for owners and managers being in the tip pool when they work the line, which is a federal crime, since it seems like talking to them about it will be a waste of time, as they seem to have made their pick by trashing my seniority and favoring this hack. 

Any other tips or advice on fucking them back?"

Minimum 50 hour weeks on salary, 13 hour days including closing at 11pm and back at 7am. Every Weekend is required to be worked. A district manager that is constantly breathing down everyone’s necks (who has never worked a day in this restaurant by the way). That same manager would serve his daughter as an entree if a customer asked for it. Last straw was when the GM of my store gave me a Friday off but the DM called and told me I had to work anyway after I had already made plans. Quit with absolutely no notice and I’ve never felt more free in my life. My new job won’t pay quite as well, but I’d sacrifice anything to avoid another day in the restaurant business.

I was told I would be paid for my travel time beforehand, then found out later on that was a complete lie.

They want me to do more travelling jobs - inventory at different stores. But I'll have to use my personal time to get there and back no matter how far.

Is it normal to have to use your own vehicle and your time off to travel for a company? I am going to refuse to do these jobs but I am worried they may try to force me. 
(Seriously considering putting in my 2 weeks notice anyways, but the job market is awful here in Canada.)

I've worked here for a year now on overnights. Just like any facility I've worked at, I love my patients but hate the system. 

I have worked Healthcare most of my adult life and this is by far the most disastrous facility I've worked at. The ratio is one staff per 12 residents (who all range from what assistance they need, not one is independent completely). We have patients that run away,  that are physically aggressive, that are crippling in their own health. They vary in age, health, and capabilities. Being only one person, this ratio is unsafe. I feel like one of these times, when I'm passing all the meds at the end of my overnight shift, I'm going to accidentally give the wrong meds to the wrong person because the mornings are pure chaos. 

I apologize for the length of this post. 

There have just been so many rules broken like passing some meds on pure memory because the computer system is down and there is no back up MAR. Or finding used needles in the med box because my coworkers aren't being careful enough with the sharps container. I've reached out to the nurses about health care problems before it should be an issue and the patient(s) gets ignored and ends up in the hospital, fighting for their life. Their excuse, everytime, is we are short staffed, we are short staffed, we can't find people to work. 

I pick up shifts to help out. I work 80 hour stretches at times. I get only satisfactory in the ""helps fill open shifts"" column on my evaluation.  Currently, I'm having some health problems myself and am having an appointment everyday to monitor my condition. I reach out to my boss to call in a day (8 hours before my shift) and she gives me the backhanded treatment, letting me know we are short staffed and she will see what she can do. I can only see out of one eye, right now. Before I could call and update her on my medical, she reaches out to me, in the middle of the day when I'm usually sleeping (because fuck the overnight shift) letting me know that I need to work tonight and power through. I don't feel safe managing this level of chaos with one working eye, a mad infection, and a coming and going fever. But I showed up anyways because it was let known that my lack of health was a burden. 

I have an another appointment right after work, but because my coworker/takeover coverage shows up consistently late by half an hour without repercussions, I won't make the appointment. I have 50 hours of PTO and 30 hours of sick leave right now that I apparently can't use because we are short staffed. 

I'm so afraid, anxious, and frustrated. I can't do this anymore. Not at the cost of my health. They were short staffed before; now they are going to lose 50-60 hrs of the overnight shift."

Names have been removed as well as the spicific nature of the job. It's manufacturing, so that's enough.

Here it is: 

 I have a problem.

A long time ago, we had a conversation where you told me you don't hold grudges and want team players.

These statements were in response to me stating we got off on the wrong foot, and you got the wrong impression of me.

This was a result of me reporting you for your actions of retaliation when I tried to report an employee harassing/bullying me.

Your response was to yell at us and threaten to fire not only the person who was reported for harassment/bullying but me as well, despite me only doing my job and following the chain of command.

I have since tried to let bygones be bygones and continue to be a hard/smart worker. I try my best to be professional and respectful to people.

I believe I have since proven I am a team player. I do my job well, flex to other areas as needed, and if I see a co-worker struggling, even if it's someone I don't get along with, I still help them. I come back from break on time if not early and get to work immediately. I am a hard, smart, safe, and efficient worker.

I try to be involved in the company through the safety committee and through suggestions and ideas to improve things when I can.

I have stated numerous times that I originally held and want to resume the position/responsibility of <responsibility A> back in May, if I remember correctly. I told you of my experience in that not only did I hold this responsibility, I trained the primary <responsibility A>, <placeholder A>, before I went on medical leave. By proxy, I have trained everyone who has been and is currently a <responsibility A> on second shift aside from <placeholder B>. I asked again a few times months later. Not only did you ignore me, you trained <placeholder C> instead of giving someone with experience the responsibility.

When <placeholder A> left the company, leaving us short one <responsibility A>, I asked again to take on the responsibility. Your response was to essentially brush off my request.

Despite my experience and enthusiasm, you will not allow me to resume my role or responsibilities as a <responsibility A>.

I have also expressed my interest and experience several times in being an <responsibility B>. You once again brushed me off.

I would like to know what kind of supervisor who claims to ""want team players"" declines a worker who not only has the experience and background but has expressed that he wants more responsibility and to contribute more.

I am unsure if this is just a very thinly veiled attempt to make sure I get a lesser raise and/or bonus than I deserve when the time comes in an attempt to get me to quit out of frustration.

It's clear to me that you DO, in fact, hold grudges and are exceedingly petty.

Please explain very clearly how this is not personal or retaliation."

As I reached the edge of the property I heard some type of noise but didn’t make much of it. Then, a few seconds later I thought I heard something again. I turned down my music and focused my attention to the left, looking towards the docks scanning for anything out of place or movement, nothing…

I kept on walking and then I heard it, “help, help!”
I quickly turned around and ran for the bridge just behind me and ran out to the fuel station on the dock of the river. As I scan around I notice an overturned teal kayak coming at me from upstream. There is a houseboat parked to my right making a pretty big blind spot, but as I go down the stairs I see a gentleman up to his neck in the river with no life vest about 30 feet in front of the kayak. 

I am at the part of the dock where public has access to fuel and on both sides exist locked gates with access control. I know there is a life ring on the other side of the gate to my left. I immediately drop my phone and my radio on the dock, open the gate, grab the ring, unfurl the rope and I climb on the back of another houseboat and throw the life ring out. 

I threw this thing as perfect as I could. I lands right near his face and I yell at the man to reach up, flail his hand on the ring. I yell at him to try and get on his back, tangle on the rope, anything….

He doesnt move his arms, he doesnt reach up or go for the ring in any way. The river is moving fast, about a 3mph-4mph walking pace. I pull in the ring, run down stream a bit and throw again but this time I can see the only part of his body that is above water are his eyes. His nose is submerged and I could tell he is actively drowning. Again, no reach no grab for the ring. He is too far out from the docks. I reel in the ring a third time but as I begin to run down the docks and throw again I notice his eyes are now below the water and could only see his head and some of his back end. 

I run back and grab my radio and my phone. I call 911. I get on comms for help. I run along the docks down stream keeping him in my field of vision while trying to get any help I can. 

From the moment I saw him to the last throw was roughly 50 seconds. From the moment I saw him I got the life ring right next to him within ten seconds from reviewing the camera footage. 

A co worker ended up getting a boat out within 7 minutes and was able to catch up to him in about 10-13 minutes. First responders were out in about the same timeframe and last i heard he was in critical condition but from what I saw, this man did not make it. 

Its been a hell of a day at work. I ended up taking a long lunch but eventually went back to work and finished out the day. 

I dont know how long I can work at this job now. I watched a man die, I was the last person he saw and needed and I couldnt save him. 

I’m struggling with the concept of what do i do now? Do i just go back to work tomorrow?"

I have a coworker (lets call her Luna)who is always late. I have just seen them on time literally 3 times in the past 3 months. Now I work till 11pm somedays and I am supposed to switch with Luna at the cash.I work in fastfood. So every day I am working till 11pm I do have a bus at 11:06 ish and the bus stop is like 2 min walk. Luna comes to work at somewhere around 11:04-11:13 all the time. Now there is usually just me and 1 or 2 other kitchen staff working and they are not well trained in taking orders.
I missed my bus multiple times for which I started leaving at 11 letting the kitchen staffs to be cashiers for the time being. But most of the days, the coworkers that I have will be an old guy who doesn’t know how to ring in or take orders and doesn’t speak much English. So when Luna comes late I miss the bus. 
Now I complained this to my manager and she said she will talk to Luna. The very next day Luna is late again. No change. Still after 2 weeks they are late and its making me feel frustrated. I don’t want to sound rude but it feels like the manager doesn’t care about her being late or even give her a warning just because she is of the same racial background as her. Also Luna has a car and is still late. What should I do. Its too frustrating! Like it is too disrespectful!!Thank you for any advice!!"

After reading statements at Reddit and out in the wild that taxes will be incredibly high, if you want a social network I thought I Share the costs in Germany for you guys. Numbers are somewhat rounded to the hundreds. My taxes and payments for nursing care insurance are quite high, because I don’t have Kids.

The salary is enough to have just bought my first House.

Salary 2023: 39100€

Taxes: 4800€
Pension insurance: 3600€
Health Care: 3000€
Nursing Care insurance: 800€
Unemployment insurance: 500€

I also payed 700€ for my Companies Pension Plan.

From the taxes I will get 600€ back, because I am having quite a long commute (40min) at the moment.

What do I get for my Money (in short)? First of all, the german System isn‘t perfect, it has its flaws.

I have thirty days paid vacation, plus 9 holidays. I get six weeks per illness Full pay, after that 70% from the Health insurance for 78 weeks.

Healthcare is basically free, I do have to pay fees for some stuff extra, stuff like birth Control pills (30€/3 months), some check ups, stuff like that.

If I loose my job I get 12 months Money from the unemployment insurance (70% from my last salary), after that I would get Social welfare (Bürgergeld) at the moment 563€ plus rent and heating.

If I get a child I get 14 weeks for the birth and I can stay up to three years at home (and keep my job) from which one year is paid. 

Downside is the Pension insurance, I don’t really Plan to get any money from that in 30 years. 401k is the better system in my opinion. So I put money aside for my pension.

If you have questions, don’t hesitate to ask.

And now I ask you, are we paying „to much“?"

It’s my second week of work and the working environment is nice, all the employees are friendly and the managers are really nice.

However, there is an issue with the female locker room because there’s more female staffs on duty than the amount of lockers. So sometimes I volunteer to leave my bags outside because I don’t bring valuables and many cash with me to work instead of sharing a locker.

Yesterday during my evening shift, I went to the locker room to take my 8PM pills and I saw our supervisor in the female locker room going through my stuff. I asked him sir what are you doing here and I think he was caught off guard because he said some nonsense like, oh i was just checking whose bag this is and I’m not supposed to keep my bags outside the locker and he went out the room. 

I didn’t make a huge deal about it because nothing was missing. I just wanted to ask him what he’s doing in the female locker room in the first place and why he’s going through my stuff. But it’s my 2nd week in the job and I don’t want to cause trouble so I kept quiet instead of reporting to HR. Also because I have nothing to prove since theres no cctv near the locker room.

I still feel uncomfortable with him going through my bags because its where I keep my ids and outside clothes before I change into my uniform . Should I have said something instead?"

Thank you all so much for your support. For those who want the full context, here's the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1abxj09/fired_for_saving_a_life/).

So much has happened in the past week that I haven't really had a chance to cover everything off in an edit.

I had a visit from a couple of the local senior law enforcement officers this morning, who came to hand deliver a letter of commendation, and had told me that the man I saved was recovering well and had wanted to meet me. I'm still unsure if I want to see him but I'm considering it.

One of my old co-workers who was poached by our company's main competitor a couple months ago reached out to me. He's managed to get me an interview with the competitor early next week, so I'm hopeful I'll get that job.

I met my therapist and we had an interesting chat about this. We talked about what happens after you die, regret, work, and just random stuff. One quote did stick out to me though. ""If you had done nothing and that man had died, you would've blamed yourself for the rest of your life""

I spoke with the other news org mentioned in my previous post, and they are also refusing to do a story on me without my face and name in it.

I think this concludes this little saga, the past week has been surreal and once again I wanted to thank everyone for their support. "

This job is manual labor and a skilled trade. Since the shop got the news, two people have been deployed, one illegally fired (but settled outside of court), and another quit. This leaves my partner, the floor manager (who is now on vacation for the weekend). Now there are talks of continuing field work once the plant closes. Who is going to be doing this field work you may ask? 
Non-union workers. 
So not only are they catching heat for illegally firing one guy, but they will soon be sued if they choose to lay off all union workers to find non-union workers. 
The funniest part? My partner has been there longer than anyone aside from the shop manager. Only 2 years. All the long-standing employees found better jobs well before the union was even in talks. They cannot keep people. The shop is a OSHA violation, you don’t get proper training, no benefits, shite pay… 
Just wanted to rant because this is taking a mental toll on us, as we’re trying to figure out next steps. Obviously my partner is in talks with the union representatives, but he is worried about driving to work and the shop be locked up and he be out of a job. If anyone has gone through something similar, like a business shutting down after workers unionized, I’d love to hear stories of how it worked out."

I thought an employee was a good friend. He seemed really nice. He had an autistic brother and I was going through my ADHD and Autism diagnosis. Nobody at my office knew because it was in the process. I didn't want to seem to speculate. But told him because I knew for sure. I thought he'd be the only person to get me. This was 3 months into my job where I was lonely and didn't know anyone or anything. I trusted him. Turns out he was set up by my boss. He asked me questions I answered it. We discussed about a lot of things. But he recorded and edited everything out. The recordings-he sent it to my team and everyone.

I became a vain, misandrist, racist, airhead with dr*g issues in his narrative.

A few of these recordings are about my culture. About how I don't wanna date men of my culture because they can be misogynistic. It's a stupid exaggeration. But it's recorded and that's what I'm remembered by. Another thing that was recorded was my admission to using w**d and psychdlics.

He's also really manipulative. For instance, we were talking, he looked at a reflective window suddenly, I looked at where he was looking. He went and told everyone, while talking I kept staring at my own reflections.

My manager and team knew every single thing. And made me jump through moral hoops. Like tried to pit me against another female coworker, to prove I'm not actually a feminist or something. I didn't fall for it.  But because I kept quiet, they wrote down my answer. The worst is my boss's boss is my race. He heard about this, wanted revenge. Pretended to like me. I eventually liked him. He made it seem like he was separated from his wife. I called him. And he mentioned his kids ages- they're very young. Things felt fishy after hearing about kids ages. it turned out he lied. This call was played out to everyone.

The funny thing is I actually went through some of the opposite. The person from my team who asked my friend to ask these questions was actually very discriminatory towards me. This co-worker itself is very inappropriate towards me. Turns out my boss and my team helped with these. I can't do anything about it.

They also went over my journal that I was keeping in my bag to write during commute and took pictures. There were some pretty intimate and controversial stuff I'd written there. Including the workplace too.

I've since quit and it's been a couple months. HR is shit. I've been trying to get back my sanity again. 

It's happy job-hunt times."
3,2024-02-02,Dunkin Labor Rights Violation???,u/Longjumping-Style-72,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ah2ipp/dunkin_labor_rights_violation/,antiwork,"So I left my Dunkin today
I hadn’t even been there a week and it was enough to drive me out. The stress of a job like that aside, I truly believe this franchisee is committing several labor rights violations as well as sanitary concerns.
Basically, it was off to a bad start when, during my interview, I was told that discussing pay would result in termination, specifically because (and my Manager said this directly) I was being hired at a higher pay rate that my coworkers and he didn’t want to cause disruption in the work place.
Then, I was called at 8pm and told my first shift would be the next morning at 3am, and that my first week would consist of a full week of 9 hour shifts. As in, seven days consecutively. And that the next week I would be working Sunday, making it 8.
This was a problem for me, considering my availability, which I was clear about and my manager is supposed to adhere to, was strictly 7-7, 30 hours a week.
When I approached my manager about this, I was told that I could come in at 4am instead, but it would result in a $2 pay cut.
I asked about the closing shift that had been listed at the same pay rate I was hired for, and was told I would have to reapply for that position.
Obviously the threat of termination for wage discussion is a labor violation and I’m planning to report it to the federal labor board, but I also feel that hiring me for $16, when you’re paying people who do the exact same job and shift as me, and have been there for several years $14 may be a violation of the equal pay act, due to the “equal pay for equal work”
Also this is an aside but my manager told me I could call him “Daddy Dunkin” and is actively trying to fire the only two male employees, and the only placing any new male hires in the next towns store. My interview was over an hour, and my husbands was 15 minutes, and we both were hired.
It all just feels icky"

But the problem is my manager has been more and more bossy and controlling each time I show up. For example, he would tell me off as soon as I got to the store about how slow I am at working. But in my defence I have experienced that when I ask for more tasks he wouldn’t know and just asks me to just find stuff to tidy. Like it’s just annoying because  I don’t know how to work in his style as he always complains about every move I do even if I try to change. 

Now it’s gotten to the point where when a customer comes up to me and asks for something. He would come up to us and blurt out “she wouldn’t know” and pushes me away. 
And not only that but he is always monitoring if I am doing my work when I have never slacked off before, while some other time even he would slack off and start talking to his employees. 

How do I get him to stop thinking of me that way as a slow and slacking off worker. I have tried to work faster and asked many questions but it just seemed to make him more angry that I bothered him by asking or he doubts that I finished my work fast. 

And the ironic thing is he always asks for me to work longer and fill in for other days on really short notice which I don’t appreciate because he keeps giving me little shifts but expects me to show up on short notice for other shifts. Like should I just quit or hold it out?"

For over a year now I’ve been trying to tough it out with a coworker. She is constantly rude to me, tons of attitude, tries to micromanage me, what she tries to tell me is usually incorrect. Kicker is she came here after me…I helped train her yet she acts like she knows more. 

She just makes me miserable, I do my best to avoid and ignore her but she will always go out of her way to bark at me over minor inconveniences and mistakes.

Management doesn’t care about these personal disputes as long as the work is getting done. Plus my boss is in her office all day so never truly sees what’s going on, not to mention this coworker is always kissing up to management; the bosses like her more than me. When I expressed my grievances to my boss last year and asked for a possible shift change to get away from her, I was told: “everyone has to work with everyone and to keep killing her with kindness”

I just really don’t think I can work with this coworker anymore, lately I’ll call out sick just cause I don’t want to work with her.

I was loyal because I actually grew and promoted within the company, and I felt looked after. However, in the last couple of years, I was getting more work than I could effectively handle (because I was so great at my job!), and my salary was definitely not keeping pace.

I asked and begged for a shift in my duties or a real pay raise to reflect my efforts. I kept all of the responsibilities and got roughly 12% more for my trouble. When a bottom-rung trainee position opened at my dream job, I took the pay cut and relocated just so I could stop thinking about stepping into oncoming traffic. The change in my mental health and job satisfaction was worth the loss of income. And two years later at the new job, I'm essentially back to what I was earning and living in a lower COL area.

I still follow my old employer on socials and LinkedIn. Recently, they have listed both of my former roles (program coordinator and team manager) as two separate positions. Between those two individuals, they will be paying, at a minimum, twice what they paid me. They could have given me $20k more and kept me on and satisfied and not have to train two new hires.

I am very much enjoying the satisfaction of watching them reap the expensive ""find out"" consequences of their ""fuck around"" nonsense."

So now a little bit of important context for later. My mother has a cat that really needs to go to the vet asap and there was an appointment that got pushed and I needed to get the cat to vet because my wouldn’t have time than.

I barely call in sick. Since the past 6 months I’ve called in sick twice. And one time I called out because I had a flat tire on my bike and I couldn’t get another way to work. Once because I needed a week for my mental health and the second because I genuinely was sick. I was puking my guts out about 4 weeks ago at the building I provided the cleaning services. This was a high school. Also important context for later.

My supervisor send me home but not even 2 days later she called me to ask if I could work the next day to fill in for someone else that called in sick. Was still sick but I said I’d try. Not 5 minutes after we hung up the phone I puked all over myself and my bed. My boyfriend was at my place to take care of me and he put me in the shower and cleaned the bed and then called my supervisor to say that I wouldn’t be in for the rest of the week. She blamed me for something I didn’t know he did and went to complain to the higher ups that are in charge of hiring and firing.

After I got back to work at the school there’ve been multiple instances of her pointing out spots that I’ve missed when I know I didn’t miss anything. I’ve tested this theory a couple times by saying “okay, I’ll get to it” to get her to leave and when I was done with that section I’d go to find her so she can check. Multiple times I haven’t cleaned the spot after she pointed it out and multiple times when she went to check it was okay. 

Then last week I got pulled from the building because I didn’t have a friendly enough attitude. Which was bullshit because most people I’ve encountered in the building, mainly the teachers, I’ve had friendly interactions with from my side.

In the evenings I do the toilet rounds at a refugee center which I have 2 hours for. I’m done in 1 hour. Just a few minutes ago, one reason I’m making this post, I got pulled from there because of the thing I pointed out the previous sentence.

Now this morning, another reason I’m making this post, I was at another refugee center which I have 3 hours for and I’m not the only one there. I had about 45 minutes left and I get a call from my mom in a bit of a panic that the vet appointment got pushed and that I need to get to her house asap to get the cat to the vet. So I called my supervisor to ask if I could leave after I explained the situation. Her answer? “There’s always something with you. You need to get your act straight. I’m not letting you leave-“ and at this point I got pissed and cut in. “Now I KNOW you have it out for me. Just say no and leave it at that. I’ll call my mom to tell her to let her cat suffer a little longer.” She thanked went “that’s not how we talk to each other OP. I’m reporting this.”

All this over leaving 45 minutes out of 3 hours early. If I didn’t need the money I would’ve quit right than and there. They’re already short in workers but that wouldn’t be my problem."

2:30pm. Payday. My boss tells me he can't pay us until tuesday, essentially because the job's gone to shit (I work on site with brick layers) which means chances are he's not going to pay us at all because his jobs and his company are failing.

I loved my job but didn’t like the way I was being treated,disrespected. So they finally forced me to give in and I fucking did! Now I was so comfortable with resigning it felt odd to me like I was relieved

But I got home and my auntie wasn’t happy with what I did even though she knew about everything I had went through on the job and what happened in the meeting.

Even with my boss tampering with my time etc lying about doing certain things.

I started my very first sales role six months ago

I signed a contract affirming the 1099 status of employment but NOT affirming any details of this draw I believe.  They have given me $1500 every two weeks.  I suppose that would be a $36K draw for the year 

Many have pointed out that working a 42 hour a week set schedule on a 1099 and a draw is not legal 

At any rate, six months has not been long enough to build a recurring book of business in my industry.  I only get 2% commission on the deals that close.  Since those deals have only been five-figures thus far, I am seriously in the negative

If I leverage this experience to find a company that provides me a base plus commission as well as MUCH more training and support, do I owe the company the draw?  Or is it non-recoverable seeing as my hours were mandated as a full-time job?

This gap year is simply to make some money and pay a bit of rent as I already know the career I want to pursue.

 I've landed a job that's conveniently just 5 minutes away from home, but it requires me to work 45 hours a week. I brought up the topic with my parents but they just told me to suck it up. I also considered proposing a 4-day workweek instead of 5 to reduce the hours I work, as I still want some freedom and my employers seem flexible, but my parents reiterated that this is my new reality and I need to suck it up. I completely disagree with my parents, while this is only a gap year I cant help but feel that conforming to similar work routines as theirs is just setting me on a similar path I do not desire to live.

Regardless of their advice I will still ask for a 4 day workweek instead However, before taking any further steps, I'd appreciate some guidance on the best course of action. Do I truly need to tough it out, or are there alternative approaches that could provide a better balance for my gap year experience?

I was a meat clerk for a chain of grocery businesses and i wanted to learn to cut meat but was never given the chance at the chain.
A buddy of mine is an assistant manager for a small business and got me in at his work at good pay to learn to cut meat. 
There's very few options for meat cutting experience at the new job. The amount of cuts they provide is very few.
They kinda started dropping stuff like training me to take over the department possibly so the lead can retire. I didn't expect that at first and went with it. 
I've noticed some of there practices I find to be gross and wrong. Such as rewraping off red meats and poultry with extedned sell by dates.. Or cooking questionable poultry to sell as a cooked product. Taking browned off hamburger and making meatloaf ect. 
I'm just kinda over it and I've only been here a week. The meat lead argues with the owner constantly. I can already see the pressures about cutting costs ect. 
This is ontop of no health benefits or pto. 
I initially decided to switch over to this small business because it was closer to where I live with less commute as I recently moved and couldn't get into the chains local store. 
But after training in an actual well ran department for several years and seeing how it should be done. This store just makes me not even wanna be in grocery anymore.
I have an interview next week with a whole different line of work. Just feel shitty about leaving so soon especially when a buddy got me in. I fear it will make him look bad but idk I don't think this is for me. 
I just didn't think it was gonna be this bad before they hired me on."

I am working directly with rolls of fiberglass that I have to cut and test. My car is even covered in fiberglass sitting in the parking lot. I wear three layers of clothing and it is still getting to my skin. I am not provided a mask or eye protection because it is not “required by OSHA.” I can not stress how much fiberglass is just floating in the air everywhere.

The job description asked for a degree. I have a Bachelor’s in Science. I am working the same position as guys who do not have a high school diploma or GED. Also, I was told the shifts would be rotating 8 hours, but now the supervisor is saying it will be 12 hour shifts, 2 weeks of night shift and 1 week of day shift.

17,2024-02-02,Why do workplaces operate this way,u/GrayMatterSieve,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aha3yc/why_do_workplaces_operate_this_way/,antiwork,"In today’s installment of why workplaces are hostile to working parents in the US: 

I quit my full time job last year because my spouse has had some promotions and his workload has increased, we have young kids and no family anywhere close and my job was completely inflexible and it wasn’t working out anymore with regular occurrences like child illness and school holidays. 

My spouse is fine with me not working at all for now because I do all the kid school drop offs, pickups, extracurricular ferrying around, homework, school holidays and half days, snow days, kid illnesses….. but an old coworker told me about a “great opportunity” for parents specifically in our field who only want to work part time, and only during school hours. 

I send in my resume, I get an interview, I specifically mention that I’m looking for part time only as I just left full time, inflexible work and I can only work between the hours of 8-2pm and they ASSURE ME that those hours are perfect for me and hire me.  This is niche work and there are people with PHDs doing this, I have a master’s degree, the pay per hour is decent. I complete all the training (paid training at least), get my first schedule for my first early work week after training. They assure me they really only need about 15 hours a week of work. They assure me they have no problem with me “blocking off” days when kids have school holidays. 

It’s Friday before my first real week and they send me next week’s schedule and I am scheduled 8-4pm at a site 1 hour away from where I live, for 3 consecutive  days. So I’d be out of the house 7am-5pm.   1 day is on a day I’d already blocked off because I committed to chair a school function before I got hired for this. 

I said in the interview I’m available to work only 8-3 because of school drop off and pick up. Why do companies do this? I made it SO CLEAR all through interviews and training that I just stopped working full time because my spouses job is very demanding and I’m solely responsible for drop off and pick up and I do it all solo. 

It’s Friday after lunch, they just emailed the schedule, and it’s supposed to start Monday. Do they think babysitters appear out of thin air? Babysitters that can work both in the morning and the afternoon, that can drive kids to activities? 

I’ve already emailed to tell them the schedule doesn’t work for me, but I’m pretty baffled. Why would they spend all the time and money to train me and then immediately schedule me for times I said don’t work? 

I mean, I don’t have to work at all right now, so I can get paid for the training and just quit but it’s strange."

2,2024-02-02,"Loosing hope amidst lay offs, difficult boss, and limited opportunity for growth",u/cylogore,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ahc9uw/loosing_hope_amidst_lay_offs_difficult_boss_and/,antiwork,"I am loosing the small glimmer of hope that gets me out of bed in the morning. Any advice, words of encouragement or shared experiences are welcomed!  

TLDR: Morale is low as I will soon be the last person standing in my team, and my already difficult manager is being uncooperative following the termination of his contract, and, while understandable, it’s making me loose sight of the direction this transition will take over the next 2 months.

The climate at work is tense following the decision of our department’s exec to terminate my manager’s contract, a decision that comes as a surprise just 3 months after 25% of our whole work force was let go, or formally dubbed ‘redundant’.  

Our already small team feels isolated from the rest of the org and I feel isolated within my team because I never really saw eye to eye with my manager. My individual productivity, and the productivity of our team as a whole, suffered from micromanagement, poor task delegation, and destructive criticism. 

I have been trying to show up to work and give my 100% despite these difficulties, but I feel like my inputs are downplayed and easily dismissed. When I vocalize what is needed to perform my job function I am not supported and am asked to overcome unnecessary roadblocks, and frankly it has felt as if I am being set up for failure. 

I will soon be the last person standing in my team and while there is an angle of opportunity there, my manager, whose contract officially ends in April and has decided to stick around till then, is not making any sort of transition easy. Between denial and indifference, he is creating bottlenecks where there shouldn’t be any, by making the possible seem impossible without his lead, and simply being unresponsive to taking any sort of action that is needed for me to perform my job function. 

The mental strain of this, as well as the additional labor that goes to jumping over hoops to perform basic tasks is more than I can justify when I am also experiencing low morale and feel inches away from my colleagues fate of being let go. 

I worry that being so junior in a startup environment makes me an easy employee to keep around to pick up handover tasks as team members leave, or to jump in and out of projects as needed, without any room for professional development, career growth or pay incentive. I have an urge to bring value and make an impact, but instead I feel stuck."

In the past I always took a little time off between jobs when I quit and it was awesome. And this isn't my first time being laid off, but it is the first time I didn't have another job offer already lined up. So I'm stressed but trying not to worry.

I tried to talk to her about it and she said to ask her not to generalize if she does it again but that's me doing all the emotional work when she could literally just not do that.

My life just got a lot harder this year. I found a new job 5 months ago, with a better commute and more days away from the office with the same amount of pay, with occasional bonuses. But my job's best insurance plan is only an HDHP, and by January of this year, I've somehow dipped my toe into a lot of debt. 

If you are familiar with my history in this sub, I have multiple disorders. Thyroid cancer, sciatica, autoimmune disease, sleeping disorder, etc. 

I saw a psychologist in December to find treatment for my depression and executive dysfunction after working with someone who bailed on me during a project for a client, when I was not qualified to run it. I ended up seeing someone in my network, and got a BS test, and did not receive the treatment I was looking for, which totaled to a whopping $579. I am still considering seeing a psychiatrist, but I was told a test to get treatment for my executive function, and delayed sleep phase, might cost $3,500... And even if I accepted a payment plan, I have no clue what direction my job or this economy will take in the year, considering how unstable things have been in the past 4 years. 

Around the same time, I met my 2nd urologist for my OAB I've been dealing with for the entire year, was simply told that I was stressed out, need to exercise, and probably could benefit from religion. That was okay to me I guess, and I even hired a personal trainer per her advice. I was still experiencing symptoms, but when I asked to get placed back on a prescription, they never did. Then this year I get another bill for $400+. I probably wouldn't be so mad if I got my previous prescription and the price was a quarter of that, but I ended up dropping her and she went ballistic on me over an email. 

I went to see an ENT because I have a congestion problem I've been dealing with for years, and he performed a nasal endoscopy. I was diagnosed with a deviated septum, and I was told that surgery to correct it would cost a minimum of $5,000+ to do so. On top of that, I owe my doctor a $800+ copay for that one visit. 

I don't even want to mention how I'm treating my sciatica with $450 steroid shots, which still haven't been fixed after the 3rd round. 

It didn't help that my car needed $700+ of maintenance this month as well. 

**TL;DR**

I saw a scam artist who charged me $579 for my mental health who didn't help me; a urologist who overcharged me and didn'thelp me; need surgery for my breathing that I cannot afford; and my back still hurts; My car problems don't help: I blame my job and HDHP.

Why does all this shit cost so much? I've considered getting a 2nd job, but with the current state of the economy that's not exactly feasible. Why can't being healthy be affordable?"

He has 6 years of experience in engineering but doing something completely different. So essentially he doesn’t know how to do his job yet. He also seems lazy and I have to literally spoon feed him information because he lacks initiative to figure anything out on his own. 

I have been with the company in my engineering role for 3 years now. Since I am an engineer 1 it seems to make sense in my bosses mind that I should be training the new guy. I’m close to a promotion but I have a hard time accepting that the new guy essentially makes 10K more per year than I do and yet I know more than him and I am training him. Since our pay system is linear I will never make more than he does because all employees can get up to 2 steps per performance review. The steps are not grunted but I essentially just need to do a good job to keep getting 2 steps. 

Furthermore the new guy is not a licensed engineer whereas I just earned my EIT and I am working towards my PE

The only thing I enjoy is my coworkers and my boss. They keep me sane.

The owners are out of touch, feast on nepotism and are greedy. Just like every company it is profit profit profit, while the workers are barely surviving. I have stayed because it’s a primarily WFH job but I do go to the office once a month for a week and it’s in a different state so I am away from home for 4 nights.

My boss is getting ready to give notice and he is the only thing that has some what protected my sanity. He guards me from a lot of drama and leaves me alone to do my job. We are both considered experts in our areas, we specialize in different things within the same department. With him leaving I have to find a new job, I cannot stay under the possible bosses I may have  and I am so tired of horrible companies and expectations that don’t offer correct salary levels. 

I know I am not alone but it seems to get worse the older I get. Finding WFH used to be easy but companies are starting to push more for in office which doesn’t make sense. My productivity goes down to almost nothing when I go to the office because of constant interruptions from people who don’t know how to do their job. Not to mention recruiters, hiring managers, ridiculous job application processes and experience requirements that basically want a unicorn that can balance on a ball while putting out a forest fire.

Thanks for reading my rant. I know this is everyone on this forum."

I am on a permanent 12-1030pm so almost zero social life for me. I was originally hired to work from home but was warned that I may have to come in up to two days a week in the future once there is no overtime. Out of nowhere about a year back, they demand 3 days in office. Still at full OT completely against their word. Some of my management spoke on our behalf a couple of months ago to HR and made an argument that we should be allowed to work from home because of the OT. They agreed to it and sent out the good news. We all just had to submit our requests. Months passed with zero approval so I just started working at home again. Today I get yelled at for not being in office because the approval is not finished so I apologize and comply. Then we get a mass email stating that HR decided to roll back their decision and we all have to be in the office. They dangled a reward in front of our faces and claimed we deserved it for our hard work then just took it back last second. It would have cost them nothing but they got principled and decided to screw everyone over.  I really hope I get find a better job soon."

4,2024-02-02,Answering Emails Outside of Work,u/desertwords,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ahghj8/answering_emails_outside_of_work/,antiwork,"This is a bit less spicy than a lot of the stuff I usually see on here, but I need some advice. TLDR at the bottom.

For the most part, I really like my bosses. (I'll refer to them separately as ""supervisor"" and ""boss"".) They give me the freedom to do things my way and listen to my input. The one thing I have a big qualm with is their thing about emails/texts.

The thing about this job is that it's not as simple as just telling them that I will not answer emails/texts outside of working hours. In my industry, there are many times when a call might change, be canceled, or be added, etc. So I have to look at my work email at least a bit outside of when I'm physically there. 

However, regarding the call times, there's a spreadsheet where we're all able to see the calls and there's a protocol where we change the color of the text and make a comment if we're available. (I haven't said no to one yet, and I've been working here for almost a year.) My supervisor insists that I should also reply to the emails about calls that he sends out, even though I'm most often on top of the spreadsheet. I'm one of four permanent employees under my two bosses who are on the spreadsheet, and those emails go out to everyone on the call, including those below me. Being on those emails is helpful, but I ""respond"" by making a note on the spreadsheet. I don't know why this irks me so much, but I hate having to send one-word responses to these emails all the time. It also helps me to just look at the spreadsheet, because I use it as a reference for my google calendar. 

The other thing is this week. My boss had spoken to me during work last week about some paperwork he'd like me to do this week, even though nothing was going on for me to go in person. I agreed, and he outlined what he wanted done. Sure, no problem. This is technically a week off since there's no in-person work, but this is just some extra stuff to be paid for. I was not given a deadline beyond doing it this week, so I figured I'd get to it when I get to it, as long as it gets done this week.

I had my work email open on my computer but learned today that it was somehow not updating because I checked it on my phone and had several emails from both bosses. There were upcoming call changes, one of which was very dramatic and I did send the one-word response to that. But I also got an email from my boss basically scolding me for not replying to an email he sent earlier this week about the paperwork and how I should just send an ""ok"" at least so he knows I saw it. The thing about this that ticks me off is that this was supposed to be a week off with some paperwork sprinkled in. I was already planning on cracking down on the paperwork today. I don't think I should have to reply unless he directly asks me to, especially since I wasn't working this week. I just sent an email back saying ""I'm working on this today."" and left it at that. 

I feel like I need to draw boundaries about this though, and I don't know how to do it. There's no bad blood with my bosses, and I don't want to create a problem, but I do feel like this crosses a line. I'm not sure what exact boundaries I could even articulate, because so much in this industry is fluid, and I knew that going into it. I can't just let them think I'm at their beck and call 24/7 though. 

TLDR; I can't *not* check my email when I'm not at the office. My bosses want one-word and timely replies to all the emails they send me, and that irks me. What would you do? How do I create a boundary in this situation?"

Great. So I drove over an hour since that’s where the job is and turns out that marketing would be 30% of the job and the rest would be selling insurance and would need to get licensed for that. That was not listed on the job post. Red flag. I was kinda annoyed but was fine with that since I figured I could get more marketing experience along with sales experience. Interview went well or so I thought.

So today she calls me to let me know that I was not the right fit, I asked her why I was not the right fit and she said it was due to my work experience. I told her that she knew what my work experience was since it is listed on my resume and she just kept saying that I wasn’t the right fit then proceeds to tell me I did not provide any references. I told her she never asked for references! At that point I lost it! I told her that she made me waste my time and gas money for the interview and that she knew about my work experience since it’s on resume! Told her thanks anyway and hung up on her! Ugh I’m crying right now! Not because of this stupid job but just how frustrating looking for a new job is and I’m in so much debt and and behind on bills!

I work in corporate and something happened today that people definitely have nightmares about. I was asked to get something in earlier for a customer long story short. I had already done my job on getting it there in time, but they wanted it expedited. I did my best and let them know I can get about half in early. Minutes later I receive an email from the guy name dropping an important exec, copying my boss and emphasizing things I already know, like how important it is to meet the customer needs. Not really affected as this guy does this ALL the time, he’s done a bunch of shady stuff before that I’ve heard about. I’d usually brush this off because my boss knows I do my best. 

THEN I receive an email that definitely was not supposed to have me on it. He proceeds to email me and one other person who was on the original thread, literally saying he just sent her, meaning me, an email and “hopefully it scares her, I copied her boss too”. I’m shocked, mortified all of the above and cannot believe how fucking stupid this guy is. To put that in writing and then send it to the wrong person. I’m still shocked about it tbh. I’m the type of person who will go out of my way to help people and have done it multiple times for this guy. Unfortunately a lot of guys at this company who have been there awhile think they are untouchable. 

You won’t be shocked to learn I’m a young girl who took over a spot with little experience, a lot of odds were against me. I knew these guys didn’t respect me but apparently they think they can scare me into doing things too. I can do my job well without threats, thanks.

1,2024-02-02,Employee rights regarding gas theft?,u/Asleep_Mousse_55,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ahhhf9/employee_rights_regarding_gas_theft/,antiwork,"Ive got a question that I would like help understanding an answer to...
I work at a gas station. Our company policy is that when gas theft occurs, it comes out of the employees paycheck. I don't totally agree with this policy for a couple reasons, but it is what it is. Just don't switch on the pump unless you have payment in hand.. 
Our particular location is a little unusual in that it's rural, we have a lot of regular customers we see every day, so we don't do a strictly prepaid policy. This leaves a small margin for error- occasionally an employee may THINK it's a customer we know, but it turns out not to be, and it bites us in the ass.
What I am wondering about is this: When a drive off occurs, isn't that a crime? Shouldn't it be reported to law enforcement? Immediately? 
This is not happening. Management just makes us pay and calls it good. Do we have any rights to file police reports as employees and seek restitution if the muthafuka gets caught? I mean, if we are the ones responsible for the theft, shouldn't we have some chance of justice, as in the actual CRIMINAL pay instead of us?
I'm just so sick of being nickle and dimed to death by these people anyway...I have the ultimate dead end job- and the only benefit is I get to pay for other people's shit. Wait, that's not a benefit. It sucks 😞. They even make us sign off on overtime, no time and a half over 40 hours, just flat hourly rate of pay. If I wasn't so attached to the community I'd already be gone....tired of being poor. Really, really tired of it."

1,2024-02-02,Would you leave a full time job you hate for a contract to hire opportunity that pays more?,u/CTRL_S_Before_Render,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ahi69q/would_you_leave_a_full_time_job_you_hate_for_a/,antiwork," To keep it brief:

* I started working at my current job a month or two ago. I make a slightly lower salary than I used to, and it's proven to be an immediate toxic  environment. I do not see myself staying here longer than I have to.
* The entire time I've been here, I've been interviewing for a job that pays  more and has a lot of opportunity for bonuses & growth. It's a start  up. Loved the team interviewing me. Just feels like a fantastic fit.  The one con is that they can't hire me until they close on a large  multi-million dollar contract. The project they're hiring me to work on.
* That company has since told me I have the job along with one other  specialist and they're ready for us to start the moment they sign the  contract. Believing they would close the contract within the next few  days.
* They  met with the prospect and unfortunately they weren't able to close the  contract, but have expressed multiple times that the client was super  interested and are very likely to close next month after a budget  meeting.
* I  met with them again yesterday and they reiterated they are nearly  certain the contract will close next month and asked if I would be  interested in starting as a contractor in the meantime for a lower  hourly rate, with a hefty sign on bonus when the contract closes. I said  that sounds great without thinking too much about it. They told me they  would send the offer letter over for me to review.
* I  got the offer letter today, but after further consideration I'm worried  that the contract closing could get delayed further; despite them being  extremely confident it is going to close soon. The hourly rate alone  for the contractor work is not worth it if I don't get the sign-on bonus  + full-time salary. In fact, it's less then what I'm making now.

Essentially I have two options:

* **YOLO:**  Accept the contractor offer and leave my current job, believing they  will close contract (which is very likely), get my huge sign on bonus.  But take the risk that the contract could get delayed again or just die.
* **Decline Contractor Offer:**  I politely thank them for the offer, but opt to wait until the contract  is closed and they can offer me a full-time gig. Potentially losing the  opportunity altogether (- It's unlikely - but the other specialist will  start working immediately and might prove sufficient as a solo worker)  and making less money than I would if I had the sign-on bonus.

I'm  leaning towards YOLO. I hate my current gig, the sign on bonus will be  lovely, they're very confident the contract is going to close, it's a  90% change I will come out on top.

But  a part of me cannot get over the fact I'm leaving a (somewhat) stable  job for uncertainty. It really is weighing risk vs reward. I just need  to decide if I want to take that gamble. If they don't close that  contract I will be job-less and without the sign on bonus.

What would you do?"

THE COMPANY KNEW and didn’t turn him in. they allowed him to work and they knew he was a pedophile. not in the way where you can work if you have a record, like they knew him personally, they are friends, and knew he was a pedo. when the guy got convicted my husband and a couple of guys brought it up to management and low and behold… they’re all laid off. can’t help but think there’s a correlation between calling out the management for being involved with a pedophile and then getting laid off. 


thankfully,  my husband got a quick serving job until he becomes a full time firefighter in the spring, and he wouldn’t have stayed with them anyways after what they all found out, but damn. fucked up stuff."

6,2024-02-02,Fired from my job,u/Constant_Mud_7047,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ahiqr2/fired_from_my_job/,antiwork,"So I was fired (or rather I quit because they took me off the schedule) because of hearsay. 

Ok so for context, I was a shift manager at McDonald's, before that I was a shift manager at pizza hut, but only for 3 days. The manager at pizza hut was disgusting. Cleanliness was not a top priority for him, nor was customer comfort. It's the beginning of winter and he wouldn't turn the lobby heat up because it made the kitchen too cold. On top of his poor customer service, he was unethical and unprofessional, to the point he made my skin crawl. There was another delivery driver that worked there before me, with the same name, and he told straight up lies about them. Disgusting ones. Said they were flashing their stomach at guys at a local factory they were delivering to, and whatnot. I know this person on a personal level, and I knew everything was a lie. Even messaged them to let them know the kind of shit this man was saying ON MY FIRST DAY. So I left and went to McDonald's.  Everything was going good, I was one of the stricter managers. Always be in uniform, lobby and bathroom Cleanliness is a top priority, as they are what the customer sees first. Whatever I was good at it.

Well last week my manager informs us that she's hired a new manager. It was the same guy from pizza hut. Mind you he'd been fired from McDonald's before. He has a rather gross history with ummm, acts he's performed while on restaurant property, after close. My manager KNEW all about his past at McDonald's and what he acted like when I worked for him, and she hired him anyway. At least half the crew voiced their objections, including me. I do remember telling a coworker I might have to find a different job, but I had no intention of quitting. Well word got back to my manager that I'd said that. Big deal, I'm allowed to have my opinion, she's the one creating a hostile work environment by bringing him back. So the day after I finished my last shift, she kicked me out of our manager group chat. Saturday I went to look at the schedule and i wasn't on it.

I texted her. I texted my DM and she ghosted me. All day. Finally after getting the information I needed that she did intend to fire me. I texted her and told her I would not be back. She finally texted back the next day and said she wanted to have a face to face conversation with me to ""save my job"" and that their intentions on hiring him were good for the company as he's still fully certified. Fully certified doesn't make him any less disgusting though. He's already made the community Facebook page for how disgusting the lobby was. I know I should have let them fire me right? For the unemployed, but I wouldn't have gotten anything anyway because my state thinks I owe them for collecting when I had long covid. Also, some applications ask if you've ever been terminated, so at least I can say no on this one. They treat us like shit and then wonder why their turnover rate is so high"

My job has a high turnover rate and I’m not surprised as the job is pretty difficult. What annoys me is that managers sit around all day in climate controlled offices and speaking down on the employees that they do have. “Guys just don’t wanna work hard” is all I ever hear them say. I just don’t understand why they seem suprised that people don’t wanna work a job that pays crap, is back breaking and allows customers to verbally abuse for any reason?"

I (28) had a contract for my job for 6 months and was told they wouldn't renew it because they were not satisfied with me not being able to do the job of 4 people for the pay of one.

I was genuinely thinking of just holding on for another 6 months if they renewed the contract because this is my fourth job in a row that has been shorter than a year, and it looks really bad on my CV. I'm also really tired of changing jobs constantly.

I won't go into details about previous jobs, but they all went similarly: a lot of everything, even things outside the expected job role, and I just couldn't take the nonsense.

For the overall image, I was supposed to work in marketing and graphic design, but I was expected to clean toilets, do accounting, and other random tasks just because they had poor organization and even worse communication. However, when I refused especially demeaning tasks, they said I was being difficult.

Now, I have less than a week left working here, and they said if I have an interview or something, I can tell them and be absent for the day. As a naive person, I was honest and said I had an interview and needed an extra day off. Suddenly, there are urgent edits to be made on things that weren't in a hurry for a long time. I deeply regret not just saying I was ""sick"" and just  not showing up.

What would you do in my situation? Does anyone, especially from Europe, have any similar experiences?

I really don't want to show up, and I don't want this job to affect my performance at the interview next week.

I'm so mad at myself for not saying anything and just accepting my fate. Also, because I do various other tasks, I saw that all the other people hired in the last year got at least €300 more than me every month. So, I was the cheapest worker they hired. That really hurts, but even though I'm mad at them, I know I have myself and my self-doubt to blame."

Took 6/7 months off after Uni and chilled. Started taking weightlifting seriously, joined a powerlifting gym, worked casually. This is what life was meant to be.

Found a good job with 0 experience/0 connections because I think the guy took a liking to me & figured I was smart enough. Pay is alright. Probably ~75% of grad jobs where I am fall in the 55k-70k salary bracket (AUD) so 72k isn’t bad. Everyone says how lucky I am.

But I don’t know how anyone can be passionate about such a lifestyle. And here in Australia nobody can afford to move out and rent is crazy. I can’t do this for more than a few years without a break.

Well back in October we interviewed this coworker and agreed he'd be a good fit for the role which, without giving more detail, was a technical team lead. He joined the team in November and then today he was surprisingly let go. I can't wrap my mind around this - my boss was absolutely gushing over this guy ""we have to have him he's really going to turn this team around"" and then 3 months later the guy is let go.

So today I was checking out my phone which we need to do to clock out, I was behind a woman as she checked out her phone, keep in mind my manager can see us while we do this. 

There is a wall separating the managers desk and where you go to clock out, their is also a staircase right next to where you clock out and that’s generally how I leave. I follow the woman after we both put our phones away. The manager can see us while we put them away. The woman clocks out first turning back and walks past my manager to leave. He doesn’t say anything. Once I clock out albeit behind a wall, descending the staircase my manager calls my name and begins to tell me he’s writing me up for leaving early. 

I tell him that I thought we were finished as the other lady clocked out too, he says he didn’t see her and he’ll talk to her, but then how did he see me behind the wall, when she walked right past him. She also checked out her phone before me? He then tells me I act like i’m not apart of a team and that he thinks i do it unintentionally. Im a nervous person and really couldn’t find the words to speak back. It just feels like he’s constantly watching for a mistake I make to call me out for it.

Funnily enough he says I act as i’m not part of the team, they constantly ask me to stay later and because i’m a nervous person I find it hard to say no, and if I do they basically coerce me into staying atleast 30 more mins.

But just today after having closed for what feels like the 30th time my on shift manager told me that I’m not doing the cleaning duties?!? I’ve never been made aware of these cleaning duties before, I’ve been told there were three things I needed to do before I leave and I’ve always done those three things, then today I’m told there’s like nine other things I need to do. 

This just gets so frustrating as someone who’s on the spectrum if you do not tell me directly that I need to do it I will not do it . So sick of these managers who act like everything is so simple and obvious well guess what you’ve been at the job for three years and I just got here five weeks ago, so beg my pardon, if this shit isn’t obvious to me."

I am/was the ASM of a women's clothing retailer at our local mall. I've been on medical leave and just went back to work last week. One of our bonuses for making sales was a rewards program that provided food for the team when they met sales goals. Nothing fancy, but they would provide us with bottled water, chips, crackers, various snacks, muffins, instant soup, cases of water, soft drinks, coffee, all kinds of goodies. 

When I went back to work last week my boss bragged that they had been making sales and we had plenty of food, to help my self. We had a lot of food. I thought this was great as I'm on a very strict budget til pay day and eating at the mall is outrageous. I've been living of disability for the last few months and am broke AF. I'm struggling to make it to pay day. I'm not even sure how I'm going to get to work next week. I had planned to bring my lunch, but figured I could save my groceries and $ by just having crackers and soup for a few days for lunch. And all was good for two days. 

Well, a few days ago we were hit with the bad news that our store will close on the 22nd of this month. Bummer. I had two days off, and yesterday I went in to work and everything was gone. All the soda. All the cases of soup. All the boxes of crackers. Cookies and candy. Everything. Even the coffee pot. 

I was not prepared. I'd not brought lunch or extra cash for lunch. I was at a total loss. There's only 6 of us who work there and we don't all work all the time, so they obviously didn't consume ALL that food in two days. That also means I wasn't the only person who didn't get some.

 It turned out that they had decided to divide it up amongst themselves and take it home, which is fine, I guess. It was their bonus snacks, and I didn't really have a hand in that, but I did find it kind of thoughtless. We have two girls who only work weekends, which means they didn't get anything either, and they had a hand in meeting those goals. 

I'm just miffed, I guess. I found it quite selfish and entitled. I've been on leave for a bit, but there were plenty of times I bought my team pizza, taco bell, cinnabon, Starbucks, out of my pocket as a gesture of kindness and good will and they couldn't leave me a cup o' noodle. 

I've worked with some of these girls for 7 years, and I wasn't even an after thought."

13,2024-02-03,Is this normal? My supervisor is constantly checking up on me for updates every 30 minutes to an hour.,u/WhitePinoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ahoykg/is_this_normal_my_supervisor_is_constantly/,antiwork,"To make a long story short, I've been assigned to a new project in my firm, and I have a new supervisor who's managing the project. I only started working with him for one week, and I'm already sick of working with him.

He's been rushing me constantly, and asking me how I am doing on tasks every 30 minutes to an hour. It's been making anxious and uncomfortable, because I'm now working at a faster pace, which usually leads to me making more unintentional mistakes. Luckily so far, none of that has happened. 

In the past, one of the biggest criticisms I've received at work is that I work too fast, and leave a lot of errors that other people have to pick up. When I told him that I'm still working on the long list of tasks he assigned me, he asked another employee to come in and separate the task made for me. This made me somewhat nervous. He didn't criticise me, but since my company is ""performance based"" I'm worried he might make a comment about this to management. 

We eventually got the work done for this project in good time, but by the end of it I was exhausted. This is the first time I've truly felt burnt out at my latest company. 

Am I overreacting? I guess I have a lot of job anxiety/emotional baggage from my last job, which wasn't even half a year ago. I just don't like being checked up every hour when a lot of what I'm doing is probably 3-4 hours worth of work. He's probably wondering if I'm stuck or have a question, but I would definitely let him know if I was. I don't need someone breathing on my neck every hour. 

Maybe every 3 hours or before lunch and 3 hours before the end of the shift would be good enough to check up on me. But damn, it's triggering my PIP PTSD, and I'm worried he's trying to analyze how I work. 

**TL;DR**
I'm getting anxiety because my supervisor checks up on me too many times, and I'm worried he could lead me to getting fired if I work at my natural pace due to my past work experience with abusive management."

For 3.5 years I was doing jobs above my pay scale (significantly so) to “gain experience” (read to save my line manager’s behind). Somehow, in my idealistic view of the world, I assumed that a good hard work equals promotion. Despite claiming how  “appreciated” and “absolutely irreplaceable” I am, I was used mercilessly and at the end my manager crossed a fat line where I was doing her job for most of the day and asked to do even more overtime unpaid, while being humiliated and micromanaged from time to time,  so I said no. I went to senior management who was blissfully unaware that I did all of this throughout such a long period of time. It was against the policy. I got my line manager into trouble. I applied for promotion officially as the there was an opening. 

The situation is as follows:

1) They hired a temp to help cover my extra duties I was asked to do (and shouldn’t have been)
2) Line manager went extra polite with me, I can’t bare to look at her anymore though
3) Senior management avoids me although they will have to reply to my application. They acknowledged, but didn’t have enough decency to actually talk to me (all in writing)
4) They are wasting more money now on temp even though they could simply pay me on appropriate pay scale instead. Temp can’t do their job (not through their fault, they just can’t do it in this system). I’m just sitting watching how quality of what we do goes downhill and I don’t care anymore. 

I’m either going to get promoted or fired. Funnily how I have to tell my teenage children every day how hard work leads you to success. It doesn’t, ever. It’s my second career and it doesn’t. At least in my first career they paid me a lot despite refusing to give me “titles”. Here I don’t have either. 

I need money and I need my job. This promotion was what I was working for, blissfully unaware what’s happening. Everyone acts shocked of how they were unaware of all of this. Pathetic."

Now, they want all the workforce to show up at least 3 days a week. The area my team used to sit is shared by 3 other teams all of which have more members than we do. There's not enough room to fit all of us. 

And of course the CEO who communicated return to office has no idea about downsizing and lack of space.

Our days in the office will be tracked, of course. And they will be counted towards our performance, of course. 

Lastly, when the downsizing happened, some teams had their contracts changed to fully remote as they anticipated major exodus. Hurray for them!! However, they dont anticipate anyone else going remote. This means - come to the priso... office, and if you dont show up it's PIP and you're out.

Been here for 9 months and it is just getting worse. The union itself is questionable too. Bad politics and rampant favoritism. I refuse to kiss anyones ass.

We have been short-staffed because people are quitting (God bless them I want to do the same). So pretty much I have to do double the work I used to. Recently they have started making us work almost every Saturday and that’s where I draw the line. Fuck that I refuse to give my weekends up. It is so depressing. I become legitimately enraged over it.

When I started here I was told it would be Monday-Friday. That was the agreement right? I am young and when I see these guys that have been working here 20+ years, just the thought alone makes me feel nauseous. There is just no work/life balance here and the OGs here tell me that themselves. “This company doesn’t give a shit about your life they will slave you away” is something one of the older guys told me awhile back.

I don’t know I am just getting to that point where I am even starting to look around at other places hiring. Just wanted to vent to people that would relate.

I love that the 2008 financial crisis was so horrible because a lot of normal people who were paying mortgages basically got told go fuck yourself we are taking the house and keeping the money (literally and metaphorically). I'm not sure I've seen this comparison made yet, but in my experience the current economy has managed to gaslight everyone into now thinking that paying money for something does not mean you get anything. Like bro... The people in 2008 were basically just paying cheap ass rent for whole ass homes, yet it is still attributed as one of the most difficult financial environments for the common man in recent history. Sure no one was able to get a mortgage for a while but look the fuck around you, look at yourself, are YOU able to get a mortgage? When you think of a mortgage, do you imagine people in their early 20's getting one? Well they bloody well used to. Today it's like $2k a month for a fucking basement with a fridge. For people that already ""own"" a home, they are paying redicilous property tax that exists to cover their cities expense in getting utilities to their home. Kind of like a group effort so we can all have power and water and whatever else. Unfortunately, they seem to have forgotten this (in Canada anyways) because every one of your utility bills includes a ""delivery fee"" now. Just like Uber eats :) Oh and there's also the fun ""service fee"" and for people ""privileged enough to heat their homes with natural gas"" (like they have a fucking choice) there's now a carbon tax as well. I like to refer to these as the ""privilege tax"". I'll use my situation as an example for people who don't have to pay these bills. My house has power so I pay 50$ a month, and if I have the audacity to use said power that number increases (this is seperate from the cost of the actual power which is usually less than this privilege fee). Because my house has a gas connection - you know, so I don't freeze to death in my sleep - I pay $120 a month. The property tax on my home is nearly $400 a month (it's a starter home in the country with many. many problems). All tallied up, these privilege fees are $570 a month. For fucks sake that's what rent for a studio apartment used to be like 6 years ago. Thank god the home uses well water (that's right, $400 a month and the bastards don't even send me treated water) or there would be another set of privilege fees. We are CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING an economic environment that's SEVERAL FOLD as horrific for most people as the aftermath of 2008, but in the exact same way and nobody seems to realize that.

I'm lucky enough to have stable employment that pays enough (45% under market rate but whatever) to cover all this shit but I can't imagine what it's like for people who haven't had a substantial increase in income in the last couple of years. Not more than 6 years ago I was able to buy a car (used of course lmao) pay for school, get an apartment, and generally have no severe financial stress all on like $1500 a month. Now I make 50k a year give or take (like $30k after taxes or $24.5k for the Americans reading this, yippee) and I have to save up and budget so I can buy my wife some ice cream. I stopped considering breakfast as an option, and I usually skip lunch. Most dinners are pasta - which by the way home made sauce seems to cost nearly same as premade sauce unless less you grow the damn tomatoes yourself - and a lot of my diet now consists of rice. I'm not looking for sympathy on this, I just think it is absurd that someone who works full time in a specialized field has been brought to the level of skipping meals and eating primarily pasta and rice. Hell, I was better off when I was working part-time at a time Hortons nearly 10 years ago. Again, I can hardly imagine what it's like for people who are in a situation where working part-time at a time Hortons is all they have.

Quite frankly it's a crock of shit and I'm mad. Also it's 3am when I'm writing this and I'm hungover as shit so I don't know if I got my point across or if there even is one. Wait no, there was a point:

tl;dr
The 2008 financial crisis consisted of people paying a lot of money for something, but ending up with nothing. Now people pay even more money for the same things, but don't even expect to get anything out of it. I think the situations are hilariously similar but no one seems to have made the comparison and everything is currently so much worse than in 2008. Taxes are bullshit (who knew?????). I make substantially more money than I did less than 6 years ago yet my quality of life has done nothing but plummet - how in the fuck are people who aren't as lucky as me supposed to do anything.

Thank you for listening to my 3am hangover rant.

51,2024-02-03,Told I'm being 'let go' after calling out manager for being rude,u/Starksen,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aht5g8/told_im_being_let_go_after_calling_out_manager/,antiwork,"Hey,

Little context before I rant:

* Part-time worker at University, I'm a student there also
* Originally 6 month contract, but due to team-members quitting, my employment was lengthened during tough period and I've been there for about a year and a half.
* New, full-time worker has started this week

So my team-members all left last year- manager and two senior team members, leaving me to man the ship alone for a solid 8 months. Totally overworked, understaffed for a very stressful part of my University life.

My new manager has been part of the picture for about 8 months, and she's the worst. Confidently incompetent, makes frivolous changes to our work processes. Hasn't listened to a single bit of advice I've given, and when I've challenged her changes, she proceeds anyway. She also gives all of her instructions in short-hand, acronyms only she uses, and her comms are littered with spelling mistakes and grammar errors.

This week, she spoke to me rudely. Wasn't anything too offensive, just passive-aggressive when I was asking her to explain some of her instructions to me: ""I don't see what's so difficult about this?"" and remarking that ""much of this is common sense."" I just stated that she was being rude, which she was, and she responded that we'd ""chat on Friday"".

The chat came, and the department-manager was in too. He said there was two items on the agenda for the meeting, a space for me to talk through my issues with the manager, and a little about 'how the team would look in the future'. Instantly, I knew that was corporate for: ""It ain't looking like you're in it!"", so my willingness to discuss the topic waned.

My manager defended her word choice, reiterated that it was 'common sense' and apologised in that not-really an apology way: ""I'm sorry you felt like that"".

Afterwards, the department manager explained that due to the new-fulltime employee, the team is 'back to full capacity', and that due to the budget, it's no longer necessary for my employment.

That's the story, really- but I just wanted to rant about two key subjects that I think are absolutely disgusting about corporations like this.

1) This was just before the end of my studies at the University, and a day before a week-long holiday that is the first I've taken due to demand in a year. My reward for solely steering the ship during months of being short-staffed is being told I'm being let go DAYS after they recruit again. I think its atrocious that being understaffed is rectified so slowly, and being overstaffed is rectified at a moments notice without second thought to the people affected.

2) I realise that my contract is part-time, and is ephemeral by nature, and I've had a lot longer at the job than I would've had. But the timing of the termination is very strange: days after I call out my manager for rudeness, I receive this? I'm probably just being paranoid, but it certainly feels like retaliation, and looks like it too.

I think point 1 is something I'm much more acutely aware of now, however- the fact that, in the corporate world, martyrs and heroes aren't remembered. You are, and always will be, a unit of productivity. Nobody will remember the months of stressing to meet statutory deadlines, or know the fact I was checking my work-emails during lectures when I shouldn't have been. There truly will be no reward for doing so. 

Look out for yourself, because it is you versus them."

Yesterday I came in and was told I needed to train a new night audit employee *that shift*. I've done this before (high turnover), but I've always had notice. Tonight I come in and they're here again and they say they're here for more training. OK whatever. 

I asked them about their new schedule and they tell me 3 days a week. We are both night shift, so that's taking me down to 4 days a week. 

Before this, my boss has always been extremely nice, and I thought this was the perfect job for the time being (I'm working on writing a novel so it gives me a lot of downtime I can use to work on it). It doesn't pay a lot, but it's just enough to cover my bills.

My boss never told me about the 2nd night of training or about the schedule change, and only mentioned the first night of training less than 20 minutes before my shift started. She's usually really good at giving notice about things like this so it makes me worry that something is wrong. 

I'm mostly upset about the schedule because that puts me under my cost of living so I'll need to get either a second part-time job just to pay my bills, or just a new full-time job and quit this one. I'm extremely frustrated."

I have a slight stutter and get hung up on words. It’s been a thing for as long as I can remember. It gets worse if I’m stressed too much, or thinking too fast. I have a mental health issue that also contributes to this. 

Yesterday we were at an event and boss was asking me a series of questions, in front of staff and client. 

I was getting hung up a bit and all of a sudden he blurts out “t-t-t-today junior!” I know it’s from a scene in Billy Madison and I guess he was trying to be funny. It was embarrassing and humiliating all at the same time. When I left the event I sat in my car on the phone with my girlfriend crying. I haven’t been treated like that since high school and I don’t know what, if anything, I can do. HR is always in managements side so I fear a report would just come back against me.

Today 1 minute before my 12 hour shift ended I was suppose to bring a pallet into the back to be scanned so he could make more labels, after getting done with my box I sat down for less then 6 seconds tops to check on a family member whos hospitalized. Both of my bosses started talking about how they knew I'd sit in my ass and play on my phone and one of them used me as an example for the newer supervisor as to why you should always just do things yourself as if I haven't skipped out on my only 25 minute lunch before to do what they've asked on multiple occasions

It's always something with every employer and manager at every company or restaurant I've ever worked at. Resturants are WAY worse where instead you just have one asshole lead who thinks they are a million times better then anyone who even looks in the direction of where they work and if it doesn't done their way then it's the fucking highway

A few weeks ago they announced RTO, giving everyone only 3 weeks to relocate to their office in Northern Virginia. 

I live in NYC and was approved to move here by my manager, her manager, and the director of my department, so I submitted a case to HR detailing why I should stay here and how my role is not needed in the office (I’m a writer, for context). Yesterday I found out all cases were denied, no matter the situation. They want us to start coming in this Monday (so they gave those with cases two-day’s notice to uproot their lives), and it seems they’re not granting extensions for out-of-state employees (or anyone for that matter, including one of my coworkers undergoing chemo with stage 4 cancer, whom they told if she took PTO during these next few weeks, she might be terminated).

Has anyone ever heard of a RTO with a 3-week notice or been in a situation like this? It seems like they’re hoping people will quit. I’m not sure if I have any legal backing and am feeling stressed about being unemployed with no severance or anything, as I assume I will be getting fired next week."

She always talks about how we are such a small business to basically justify why we can’t have a present leader to help manage the whole show, but then won’t be there for us day-to-day herself. This is a physical, tangible product and we are not at the scale where we can have a leader be remote, trying to lead from a computer, which then causes over-communication and slows production down since they are never around and have to be brought up to speed via text or email. It’s exhausting and makes no sense that the rest of us have to be around while they bog us down with data and never understand why things take longer than they think they should take, but they won’t come observe how the production runs. It just feels so unfair because now they are moving away even further because they don’t see how or won’t accept how their lack of engagement has caused unwarranted pressure without proper raises to the few dedicated people that help keep the ship afloat when we are already understaffed.😫

Ranting here..I  have been tardy several times due to personal reasons, like only 10 minutes and they have talked to me about it once. This time they threatened to doc my pay if it continues. Is this legal in Virginia? ( I am an hourly employee and I still get all my work done). Anyways this does not make me like my employer, I feel very offended by these threats and I am no longer as comfortable at work. I may get another job especially if they doc my pay. My boss, the one who had stated this seems to give special treatment to another coworker who is late more than I am. Sometimes she is 30+ minutes late for 3-4x a week and I am barely late 2x a week for 10 minutes. ( They also hang out outside of work, which I feel is inappropriate). I feel as though he is giving certain employees special treatment and I will not stand for it. If they are going to threaten me I am going to continue to bring up his unequal treatment. What are y'all thoughts?  I have been treated very poorly by employers in the past and I thought I found a good place to work but I no longer feel comfortable here and am pretty bummed by this one! You get used to the disappointment am I right?!"

my manager, who is known for being nothing less than cruel, pulled me into the office yesterday after a meeting with our owner. 

side note: we just had three walk outs the other day and overall, our numbers have been down.

she told me that our owner said that she needed to be a better manager basically and that things needed to change. i guess, for her, that meant we all needed better, more positive attitudes.

she then proceeded to tell me she didn't want to hear me mention anything about my boyfriend moving forward or his death. i need to keep it bottled up for 8 hours a day, or step into her office and vent to her, but not my coworkers. i was absolutely shocked when she started ""crying"" and told me she empathized with me and knows how horrible things have been for me. 

if i were in a situation where i could depend on someone else financially, i would have walked out.

i would like to say, my boyfriend was a workers rights activist and was always educating his fellow employees/friends on the topic. he started an entire ydsa chapter on our college campus and had several open forums on workers rights. he was pro-union and was a union organizer when he worked at starbucks. i refuse to stop talking about him. fuck my manager and fuck forced positivity."

I pass through all the lobbies and come into contact with patients just passing by in the hall and sharing bathrooms. There are 6 people in my role, 3 work 8-4:30 and 3 work 8:30-5. I work 8-4:30. We just had 2 people in the 8:30-5 group quit, and it looks like the 3rd is getting ready to leave. I'm honestly terrified that I'll be forced to change my schedule because my other coworkers all have small kids they watch after school. 

The issue is that all my coworkers live within 15 minutes of the office, while I have an hour commute each way. If my schedule is changed, I'd still have to leave my house at 7 because of traffic. And I'd get home around 6:30 because of traffic. 

Another issue is that I'm having mystery health issues that make eating and drinking dangerous for me, high choking risk unless I eat/drink slowly. So meals can take 1-2 hours for me. It can also take about an hour for me to drink a glass of something. So you can see where my problem is. Changing my schedule would add at least another hour of driving to my day. I already sleep an average of 5-6 hours per night just so I have enough time to eat breakfast and supper. And changing my schedule would have me lose that hour to drink fluids. I do try drinking something while driving, but it's not much.

I'm trying to prep for what I'll say if this comes up. I am willing to change my schedule only if I'm allowed to work remotely full time, which is something they have been working on already for us. I just can't do the schedule change in person. 

We have had several outbreaks of a particular virus, enough that I wear a mask at all times and eat in my car. I don't feel comfortable even drinking anything for a second inside. I do live with several immunocompromised family members, though my only risk factor is being overweight. 

I don't know if I have a valid argument for a medical accommodation, or if I could get one of my doctors to write a letter for me. "

To make matters worse, we've got a new policy in place, and my coworker just isn't playing ball.

I've raised these concerns with management multiple times, but despite several talks with him (with translations), the behavior persists.

Now, here's the kicker: when I asked my boss why this guy still has a job despite all this, I got hit with an accusation of racism. Apparently, someone thinks I'm being racist for trying to get things done by the book and stop the guy from taking advantage of the situation.

I'm really torn right now. Should I tough it out or consider quitting? Maybe silently leave until I find something else?

I would never step back in this place it’s the big apple of Memphis I don’t give a fuck.

I have never had such an major eye opening experience sense centuries. The people that looked so happy to see me! That spoke to me! Even the head! I could feel she never liked me based on how she treated me sense the first day. Mostly everyone plotted on me besides the people that work in my area.

My manager was in on it to! He got me in more trouble for something he caused before we went into a meeting two days ago! And was smiling before we went in! LIKE BRUH WHAT THE FUCK IS FUNNY!

Moral is Don’t trust nobody
Don’t even do it a tab
Don’t even become friends with people even if it’s having open convos
I didn’t do that one but I’ve seen people who have done it. 

And the same people they have done  it with have turned on them! And later turned on me!!

That first day I decided to resign and put in a two week notice that he talked me out of ! That I kept wanting to do many times! I wish I would have done it the first time! LISTEN TO YOUR GUT OR INTUITION!

I would have never known that one day I would walk into work getting ready to do my job and be blown up on by the head. 

It really got to me and I almost started crying! I was already stressed before coming there and tired. And my body was aching. On top of that I was already being berated by some of my coworkers! And having to still do stuff for them!

But no they don’t speak just started yelling my name loud as hell telling me to come back and just starts getting on me about some RUMORS SHE HEARD! 

We didn’t talk in the room about it to hear my side or nothing!!
Just disgusting this place is also known to take rumors and run with it!

Just like a girl was accused of having a relationship with a manager! When she wasn’t! Because of a rumor someone started!!! 

I’m so sick of that place. What goes around comes around! And I really would love to say the name of the place!! BUT IM NOT BUT I REALLY WOULD LOVE TO!! 

This place has all type of problems that guest just don’t know about this place WOULDNT even be POPULAR IF IT WASNT FOR TWO THINGS!!!

And the shit I got in trouble for! Was simple shit that MANY OTHERS WERE DOING! 

Even just for my hair being down when many others have theirs down where I work! Just being picked on!!

Remember treat people how you want to be treated then she GONT mention how I blew up a lil bit. Meaning how I got stressed in the end and walked out of her office cause I was about to cry!

Like she didn’t blow up on me one day before! Yelling in my face🤷‍♀️"

Most of my students are pretty chill though, I love all my students and have poured hours upon hours of time outside of work to them.
Well how my morning works is we start at 5:30 in the morning and end up at their school at about 8:30 and then we go out and pick up a singular student at 9:00 and bring them back due to them attacking multiple people a few years ago to the point they quit or went to the hospital or both lol 
It went pretty smoothly the whole time until there were issues starting up I'm only 19 most of the people I work with are 50 and up well the student is 17 he knows we're pretty close in age well he started flirting and we talked to his dad about maybe talking him well turns out is dad has been encouraging him. And his dad has had him say some pretty nasty things to me. I brought up with my supervisor multiple times down starting to feel uncomfortable with the situation and I was pretty much told they're just messing around just deal with it it's fine.
Well on Friday yesterday while I was picking up some of the other students trash on the bus he gets out of his seat pushes me face first into a seat and trying to pull my pants down to do yk what and I held him off till we got to the school and other people could help he's a pretty big boy about 6 ft 300 lb I'm 5'2 150 lb so I'm fighting for my life to fight him off
I told my supervisor due to this event I don't want to work with this student and I was pretty much denied and told I knew what I was getting into when I got hired..."

I felt like I was starting to get to know my coworkers but the other day when my boss was showing me how to put notes into a spreadsheet she starts to type and stops and asks, “What’s your last name?”. Mine is Eastern European (husband’s family is originally from there) and when I told her she was very dismissive and said to just put my initials in the notes. She is the franchise owner and the one who hired me, so it stung a bit when she didn’t know it or seemed to want to learn it. Since then I have started looking at other part time jobs.

You can clock in early and leave late but if you are one minute late clocking in you get a 0.5 occurrence. If you miss the whole day that is 1 occurrence. You have 10 occurrences in a year you get fired: but not really because if you have 6, you get a mark on your record. If you get sick a few times and run late a few times you’re in trouble suddenly. 
To me the worst part is that it is supposed to reset every year: but it doesn’t reset in January and give you a fresh slate for the year, the occurrences “fall off” one year after they happened. So if you get sick in winter, you have all that baggage until next winter.
I know others have it worse but it’s just stressful so I want to vent. Also I should note that my job interacts with patients (chemo, transplant) so while it’s important we have staff, it also seems important to let people have sick days.

I’m at 4 right now (got Covid and flu last year) so I’m getting warned a lot by boss that I need to be careful or else I’ll get in trouble. I’m a great employee by all metrics and during all my reviews and it’s just kind of annoying that this is what they focus on? "

22,2024-02-03,I may lose a job opportunity because Shelter management is mistreating their workers by cutting hours and removing raises! Not sure what to do,u/Abakerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ai5eot/i_may_lose_a_job_opportunity_because_shelter/,antiwork,"So I've been waiting for the shelter to help me obtain work clothes for a new job I got hired for 2 weeks ago, where I have to show up to for mandatory (no flexibility) Orientation on Monday. The clothing requirements are professional (Hotel career) and around here they cost about $87 which is impossible for me to afford as someone with no income, however the shelter WAS going to take care of this as they did the phone I got recently (granted it took them 5 damn months due to red tape to get me a phone but that's another conversation).

Originally things were fine and I was taken care of. I was expecting the Shelter to help cover the cost, but that all changed when top management had decided to cut off a few workers, reduce a bunch of hours, and go back on raise promises. Which in turn meant less vetting, less maintaining, and less control over the shelter (it's poorly run but it's a small mountain town/city anyway so expected).

There has been a back and forth between shelter workers and management since, where workers decided to stop coming to work until things are made fair and right, with others only working some hours. Being in a hillside small town there isn't really anywhere else to get workers, ***putting the shelter in a corner.***

The problem is, this ***also screws with those who need assistance from the shelter***, especially since most of us don't have cars and are basically trapped in the area at the whim of whatever the shelter can help with.

Now, I want to make clear I ***get*** why there is a conflict. I fully understand ***why*** the workers are choosing to go about it this way, and **I support them** fighting against bad employers/management. But I can't pretend this does not create massive problems.

In response to this after a few days, certain benefits that were provided by the shelter have been reduced or cut. The budget that *would have* helped me obtain the clothes no longer exists as of now. Which means that I have until Monday, ***less than 3 days***, to find another way to get the clothes I need. I've already been told I can't show up without being in uniform or they'll rescind the offer.

This is especially hard when the job took me in on their terms (had to explain a 2 year gap convincingly), so they won't work with me on the uniform. Granted, the business is hospitality based so I sort of get why they are so strict about the uniform, but considering my limiting location and the fact it took months to even get an interview for this job (which I passed) this protest really puts me in a bad position.

With the workers rebelling against the managers I now have no support (no family or other orgs in the town that can replace the shelter program), and in a town where there's barely any resources. I'd be lucky to work some small jobs and even get half of what I need for the work uniform required by Monday, which is all professional. **Shirt, pants, shoes, and overcoat. 23/hr,**

Adding to the problem is it's the weekend. Limiting my options even more as the only other possible line of help, the churches, only open on weekdays (They are not Sunday churches), and even that would still be a roll of the dice, but since it's the weekend they are closed anyway.

I still want to make it clear ***I'm not saying*** that what the shelter staff are doing is wrong. But now I'm facing the possibility of losing a job opportunity that could help me rebuild my life, because of how the staff went against the Employer (Or rather how the Employer treated the staff). Unless I am somehow able to in a resource limited town, buy the clothes myself ($87), which isn't possible since I don't have income, which is why I was depending on the shelter.

It seems like I may be screwed because Management has once again screwed over their workers, but this time at an agency that has clients that **DEPEND** on it. It seems I'm about to get the short end unless another solution is found. I have until *2PM Monday* which is not long from now.

Wtf do I do,u/6SINNERS,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ai5zk8/business_owner_abuses_dogs_and_employees_wtf_do_i/,antiwork,"It’s been two years and this situation still gets my heart pounding. I’m fucking angry. I feel so powerless. Sorry if this is long, there’s just so much. Any insight would be much appreciated.

For reference, I used to work at a doggy daycare/boarding business.  I stayed for almost 2 years because I was genuinely concerned about the dogs when I wasn’t working. I eventually quit because dealing with animal neglect every day weighed on me and I kept having anxiety attacks at work and after my shifts.

Employees are trained to lie about everything going on inside of the facility. Clients are told that there’s an overnight worker on the grounds 24/7, but everyone clocks out 7pm, clock in 7am. **So 12 hours go by every night where 100+ dogs are locked in kennels with no water or staff on sight.** No working fire alarm either. They shit and piss themselves. **We had a senior dog die overnight**. More on that later.

We were told to advertise the camera feature, but they’re broken. The ""temperament tests"" are administered by unqualified children (15y/os) and often last only a minute, resulting in BAD dog fights VERY OFTEN. More on this later. Medications and food often get mixed up due to lack of organization, and SO many dogs go home unfed. If there is any mix-up or mistake, the manager refuses to remake the food bowls for dogs, so they don’t eat or get fed another dog’s specific food. (MANY dogs have allergies). One time the boss told my coworker the wrong insulin dose, would have killed the dog if coworker didn’t ask someone else (yes, 16 year old giving dogs injections). We have to lie to pet owners and say they get fed even though they don’t. It is extremely emotionally exhausting to manage all the lies told to different clients, and incredibly sad to see so much neglect and abuse happening inside the facility. This is why the employee turnover rate is SO HIGH.

Our contracted ""dog trainer"" was **caught winding her foot back and kicking a little dog on camera.** She has many other reported offenses of full blown kicking dogs (always little dogs too???). The owner fired my coworker who reported it to her even after looking at the video evidence.

Boss takes in dogs that are reactive and/or aggressive and leaves them in a room with little dogs, puppies, and everyone else. She refuses to kick dangerous dogs out. I worked there for 2 years and witnessed her ban a dog twice (both cases involved the dog repeatedly attacking other dogs resulting in blood splatters and stitches)... she let these dogs back into daycare within weeks. **One staff member is expected to manage 60+ large dogs alone (legally supposed to be 1 employee to 15 dogs)**. We had to tell clients that the facility is ""cage-free"" but the dogs are left in cages, often for 8+ hours. This applies to any dog managers find slightly annoying. They are genuinely forgotten in these cages and end up isolated, dehydrated and in covered their own shit and piss!!!! It fucking reeks!!!!

Dogs are left in kennels overnight as well. Boss instructs us to not give overnight dogs any water because “it makes a mess”. There have been many incidents where dogs have gotten their ears torn off or were badly injured (needing stitches). **One time she accepted a very sick and old dog to board and the dog DIED overnight while nobody was there. My coworker who found him was 15 years old and completely untrained in DOG DEATH!?!!! Poor dog was covered in shit and piss. Boss told us to leave the dog's body out in the sun for 4 HOURS IN 95° HEAT (and wrapped in a blanket with his own shit)** before coming to pick him up.

The facility is extremely dirty. The maximum capacity is 75 dogs (according to animal control inspection) and she often has over 100. She accepted a dog who had **worms (I LITERALLY HAD TO PULL THEM OUT OF HIS SHIT SO OTHER DOGS WOULDNT EAT THEM)  along with a dog who had LITERAL AIDS ** during Thanksgiving (100+ dogs in one room). She did not inform the owners that their dogs were in contact with a dog with AIDS until much later. A large number of dogs have no vaccines on file, or out of date vaccines. I have evidence of all of this.

She has violated many labor laws (unpaid overtime, NO LUNCHES FOR 2 YEARS, withdrawing money from bank accounts, late payroll, withholds tips, “forgets” to pay commission, etc.) and many employees have made reports to the Department of Labor as a result. Staff other than the managers are extremely underpaid.

Literally withheld all of the staff’s paychecks for a month?? Until we complained 1037382 times? Refused to give paystubs for it. I have evidence of this too. SO MUCH SHIT. And most of the employees are children and it’s their first job so they have no idea how to advocate for themself. Advertised pay as $20 and then paid minimum wage. Also tried to not pay for a full 2 “training weeks” ?!!!

I’m so upset. My heart hurts thinking about all the neglected dogs covered in shit and piss all day. All the dogs that don’t eat. All the dogs that got their ears torn off. The dog that died in the facility and laid there lifeless all night. The dogs that cry and scream for hours and hours, the dogs that bash their heads and noses against the crates bc they’ve been in there for 8 hours. All the kids that are taken advantage of and get stolen pay and stolen hours. With no lunches. Clients pay thousands of dollars a week just 4 their dogs to get neglected, starved and beat.

When I quit, I talked to all the coworkers I could. About 5 of us made a report to the department of labor. Other than that, what can  I do? I know that my ex boss just opened up a second location. I have 100s of screenshots of unvaxxed dogs on record + group chats where managers admit to dog abuse etc etc. evidence of 2 years worth of overcapacity . evidence of dirty facility too. What can I do about this?

One of my coworkers expressed feeling overworked and I offered to them if they ever needed it to take a day or two from them).

Part of the problem I have with this whole situation is I have never been written up before at work, and not to mention that the things I am being accused of everyone at that store does.

my boss isn’t working tonight, but i texted her immediately and gave her a heads up about what had happened. i still have my job, i’ll just have to take the we-card test again and will probably have a write up waiting for me when i come in on monday.

the odd thing is, there are two polices in place here. the we-card policy is “under 27”, but there is also an “under 40” policy that comes from the store itself, i believe.

this is my only source of income, i’m a full time college student, AND i’m in the process of getting into an apartment. i nearly had a panic attack, thinking i was going to be fired over this. FUCK secret shoppers."

Get more work,u/ethosorange,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aiddcy/perform_well_get_more_work_work_fast_get_more_work/,antiwork,"I've realised that working harder or faster literally has no benefits. In fact, it has backfired on me in my previous jobs, and has once again in my current job. I've been in my current job for about a year, but I was completely hyperfocused on it for the first 6-8 months - I completed major reband projects, event planning and materials, revamping paid advertising, massive website overhaul, and more - it's almost unrealistic how much work I've done in that 6-8 months. And what do I get in return? A few compliments, much higher expectations, and much more work. No word of a raise or salary review despite exceeding expectations the company hitting record profits. 

After realising this; I've been only completing my tasks on deadlines, I've been less involved in the planning, spending no extra time outside of the 9-5, and just less enthusiatic in general - basically doing the bare minimum. My manager has definitely noticed and is visibly unimpressed that I'm not offering the quality of the speed I once did. It's like she forgot about all the work in that 6-8 months. The company has been struggling with employee retention... I wonder why? I'm probably going start applying for other jobs and job hop soon. And that'll probably be the same shit again. 

The system has f'd us. Whether we work harder or faster, we're not going to be able to afford a decent house. We're better off doing the bare minimum and putting our efforts elsewhere. 

Anyone else feel the same? How do you manage? "

4,2024-02-03,How do I leave?,u/iluvdeer4218,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aied77/how_do_i_leave/,antiwork,"Hi, I work in a medical field and need to figure out a way to get out of my job. The kicker is my wife works at the same place, and is in a higher position than me, and she will be staying. The workplace is extremely toxic for both of us, but I have an easier way out because I am not under a contract - I am an hourly employee. I have already accepted a new position and my start date is February 19th. 


Notoriously, our boss will fire people on the spot when they put in two weeks notice. His reasoning is “if you don’t want to be here, then leave”. I would be totally ok not even giving two weeks notice and just leaving, but I know my wife will likely face backlash for me leaving. We love working together, but I cannot take the abuse from our boss any longer. I want to leave in a way that will make things easier on my wife. I don’t want her to face backlash, harassment, or any other negative effects, but I cannot stay. She suggests I just tell them where to stick it and leave because she knows how awful it has been for me. However, I don’t want her to face whatever those consequences would look like.

For a little more context, one of my wife’s colleagues recently lost his son. The day it happened, our boss was angrily demanding to know when he would be back to work and how much time he expects to take off. He denied him extended bereavement leave and did not close our office the day of his son’s funeral. Our boss is a mega dickwad. He talks down to my wife, second guesses her, and allows his staff to walk all over her. My wife is still finding her voice, as she’s relatively new to the field. She is not in a position to leave, as she is the breadwinner and is under contract.

TLDR: what’s the best way to leave a job my wife will be staying behind at without her facing backlash? Should I put in two weeks just to get fired? Should I lie? What would be believable?"

I work in digital marketing and after our monthly meeting with the team my boss(head of marketing) called me to stay on after. alone.

The ceo in the meeting prior was giving praises for my efforts for getting us to a ratio of 
1:13 on digital advertising for meta
And 1:15 on Google advertising. 
(For every £1 I spend I make back 13 on meta/15 on google). I am a incredible ppc specialist, I have the gift. I know it.

But when he called me up he stated his concerned and worried its not ""good enough"". 

(Mean while before I joined it was at 1:8....I've Met all prior Kpis and smashed them)

He then states it needs to be at 1:20 for google by the end of Q1 (I only have 3 months to achieve this). I feel overwhelmed and sick. The industry standard is 1:2 or good being 1:4. He has no backing of this kpi apart from he wants it. 

Moving KPIs when someone is smashing them prior is a d*ck move. It puts me in a potential position of looking less than meeting my unnatainable kpis, or puts pressure on me to achieve it which will result in burn out and ill walk out by the end of Q1.

What do I do? I know the ceo is impressed but this brown nosing head of marketing is making me sick.

You put in your two weeks notice because you found a company that respects your time, pays you a salary worthy of your experience, and gives you an opportunity to move up in your career. Attempting to maintain a relationship, you do everything by the book when putting in your two weeks notice - try not to ruffle feathers, work your time out, try your best to help and be the best employee you can be. 

The company you leave doesn't say thank you, give you a handshake, or even acknowledge that you're leaving or that you worked at their company for almost a decade. They didnt even tell the rest of the company you're quitting - you have to go from person to person to do so yourself. 

Nearly 10 years of providing growth and opportunities for an organization that shows no gratitude whatsoever. 

This is not my story, but my spouse. I am absolutely heartbroken for them. Their sacrifice was also my sacrifice due to the nature of the industry and the amount of time they spent traveling and working (often more than 60 hours a week). During the pandemic, the company cut my spouse's salary by 30k to ""keep them employed"" and promised that before they were going to hire anyone back, they would restore the salary.  They did not do that for 2 years after they hired the first person back - oh but they had enough money to add a new department to the ""company"" that no one uses and now the second owner can afford an expensive hobby now. The pandemic was especially hard on this industry  and my spouse had to cash in their 401k to survive. 

My spouse also did the work that afforded them several industry awards, gained many multi-milllion dollar clients, and worked so hard to build the company from a little company to a company that now does major business.

I finally found a job, but it's half of what I used to make and up to a 90 minute commute on crappy roads each way. The workplace is also super shady to customers and has some questionable-to-illegal stuff going on with payroll. Now, I just got a different offer, but it's contingent on a background check (which I should have no trouble passing) which won't come back for 4-6 weeks. I have enough money to last until the other role should start, but when I talked to my parents my dad was angry at the idea I would spend time not working between jobs.

I'm not sure what to do since if this other role doesn't work out for some reason and I DO quit, I would need to rely on him and my mom. But if the role DOES work, I'll have spent a ton of hours on a rough road, spending 20% of my paychecks on gas to go somewhere I'm being shamelessly exploited and which is actively harming my mental health. 

My dad has been my biggest supporter during the time I've been unemployed and I'd hate to disappoint him. But also, I'm not sure I can take this job that long and not go crazy or just cry every night. If this was it, this was the only thing I had on offer, I would suck it up and resign myself to dissociating until I could find something better. But it's not my only option and I'm not sure how to stay sane and not get the cold shoulder from my dad about it.

Boss doesn't want to pay me sick time,u/Sweaterpillows83,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aihf7f/nys_employee_boss_doesnt_want_to_pay_me_sick_time/,antiwork,"Our sick time rolls over.  I've been with this company over 10 years and have around 200 hours of sick time. 

I recently scheduled an MRI and asked the doctor for medication to keep me calm during the process. The doctor said I'd need a ride home after the MRI and said no to working afterwards. Not that it matters, but I work at a daycare. 

When I requested off, my boss asked if it was for part of the day or the whole day. I explained it was the whole day. She then told me that they'd only pay me for the time it took to have my MRI done, not the whole day. 

Since then, I contacted my doctor and asked for a doctors note, proving that I need to be out the full day. 

I have the MRI Monday. I have yet to give her the doctors note. I'm hoping upon seeing it, she'll change her tune and pay me the full day. But does anyone have any advice when I give her the letter? Either in person or via email. What should I say? 

I definitely want to hint at using a full 8 hours of sick time per my doctors note. 

New York has great sick leave laws but my job thinks they don't apply to them..."

22,2024-02-04,Fired(?),u/swampboy1312,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aik9qt/fired/,antiwork,"I got fired Monday. I think. 

This has been coming for a while. I work at a small southwest gas station, we only have about 17 stores. There has been rampant malpractice from corporate ever since I started, but I didn't pay too much mind because my manager was amazing. He managed to create a work environment that genuinely felt safe. I am on the schizophrenic spectrum, he checked in daily on my coworkers and I to make sure everything was okay. Helped get us to work when our cars wouldn't start, let us take home food when he knew we were going to go hungry that night, and took care of us all while doubling our store's profits in the year he was there. 

However, when he got fired, it all went downhill incredibly fast. He was not given a single word about being fired, just an email from Sysco saying his accounts had been deactivated. This email followed a phone call to our VP. He had gotten a well deserved promotion and was moving to a different store. He had received a call from the current manager at the new store, apologizing to him because this store now had 3 other employees besides himself because 3 had quit. Our VP had known about this for *a week and a half* prior, and did nothing. The phone call to our VP had witnesses on his end (my coworker and our sales rep), and she pretty much said she would ""figure it out"" by the end of the month. He stood his ground, said it was unacceptable to be expected for him and the 3 employees to work 60 hour weeks just because she neglected to fix this issue when it first started. She hung up. A few hours later, and his accounts were gone. She then went on to tell all of corporate that he had ""cussed her out"" on the phone and quit. 

All of my coworkers started looking for new jobs after this. Our new manager does genuinely jack shit. I had to teach him how to order chicken because he had ""never done it before"". This man has worked here 10 years. The past few months, we are constantly out of all our popular items, put of cleaning supplies, I regularly worked 55 hour weeks. I have spent so much put of my own pocket just buying bleach so I can mop the floors, seasoning for our kitchen, fucking toilet paper. Our new assistant manager loves to also call me slurs under her breath because she thinks I can't hear her? I am transgender, and corporate as well as our new managers are very open about calling me by the wrong name, and have called me ""it"" and ""shim"" on multiple occasions. My assistant manager has quite literally asked me about my genitals. 

I started to reach my breaking point when they had come out with a ""new set schedule"". This was of course the week after I had changed my availability because I went back to school, something I never thought I'd be able to do. My school is from 8am-6pm on Mondays and Wednesdays. This set schedule was:

Sunday: 10pm-6am
Monday: 10pm-6am 
Thursday, Friday, Saturday: 1pm-10pm

I was expected to pretty much stay up from 10pm on Sunday until 6am on Tuesday, not including the hour drive time between places. This lasted about two weeks before I was hallucinating so much I was yelling out loud and throwing fits without realizing. 

This is where my situation got tricky. 11pm on Sunday, I texted my assistant manager. I explained my mental state, and how I had asked our manager as well as HR *three separate times* about changing the schedule with zero response. I told her I would be closing the store at midnight, and leaving after I cleaned the store. I would be using the rest of my 40 hours of pto for the upcoming week, and returning the following week. She said this was fine. I closed at midnight, cleaned and shut down, and left at about 2am. 

The week passed. I heard no response from corporate, no text or call from managers, they did not answer my calls or texts either. Friday comes. My coworker informs me that my manager is planning to fire me without telling me if I don't come in today. I agreed to come in for a short shift, he notified assistant manager that I would only be staying for 5 hours. That is exactly what I did. I went straight to the hospital right after, this week was very hard and I was on my way to get a rape kit when I was called into work, so I just got it after I left. 

Monday came. HR called me at 11am, ""hey I've got the VP here I just wanted to discuss some things"". My stomach dropped before she even continued. ""Abandoning your post is considered voluntary termination. You have shown us that you chose to resign after you left early without informing management via telephone."" I told her my coworker had informed my assistant manager in person, HR said this was unacceptable. I pointed out I was never given access to an employee handbook, there is not a copy anywhere in our store nor online, how was i supposed to know this. She ignored my point and just asked if I had any questions. I just requested the statement in writing, and she hung up. 

I received the statement via email, describing a situation where half of it was just fabricated lies. Also a full paragraph about ""we accommodated for them regularly without documentation of a disability"". First off, never addressed me by my pronouns the whole document. Secondly, I sent my diagnoses over email on three separate occasions during this job. 

I have no clue what to do now. I have not even described 95% of the discrimination and drama and malpractice I have endured because the list is insanely long. I cannot file for unemployment because I was ""voluntarily terminated"". They literally wrote ""agreed via telephone"" where I was supposed to sign. Is there anything I can do about this? They've already done the same to my lesbian coworker, and my manager they fired was gay. I didn't think it was related until my old manager spoke to me yesterday, sharing how VP regularly called him a f*ggot. 

I feel very upset. I know my performance has gone down, I recognize that and I feel ashamed, but i felt so unsafe at that job. There was so much drama and gossip facilitated by managers that I formed genuine paranoia around anyone I worked with. 

Sorry for the long post, just seeking any advice and/or reassurance. I am honestly growing angrier by the day. I don't understand how these people in power can lose all sort of humanity. I feel incredibly fucked over and I don't think I'm being dramatic."

She's been talking to me about this issue for at least two years at this point and I said, ""Post an open letter to your manager on slack politely but firmly demanding they return the mats and tell threaten to report them to OSHA or whatever if the mats aren't returned by the start of business tomorrow. I had chatGPT draft 5 letters stating this, I even offered to send the managers on behalf of the staff. She called me a Karen but I don't care. \*\*I would not let my employer get away with failing to provide me and my coworkers ergonomic equipment that has been industry standard for over two decades.\*\* They don't have to live with arthritis in your knees that was made worse by some bullshit employer you had in your 20s, but you will, you always will.

Regarding the bullshit of Target trying to charge people to download a PDF of THEIR W2. \*\*Regardless of whether or not the company ""provided them a first copy for free"" this is an unfair labor practice.\*\* Most of us get unlimited PDF downloads of our tax documents, I can pull up every single W2 I had since I started my job. 

\*\*If 1000 Target employees filed formal complaints with the IRS, I guarantee that someone from the IRS would reach out to Target PERSONALLY and tell them to stop their bullshit because they are tired of the complaints.\*\* Is that number 100? 10? It is probably more than one. I have no idea but if I were a Target employee you best believe I would have filed a complaint with the IRS, DOL and whatever other government agency that would listen because I'm not going to let my employer treat me and my coworkers like that.

I don't know how technical you want to get, but \*\*when you file a complaint with a government agency you are the client, and their task is how well they resolve YOUR complaint.\*\* If they don't resolve it, then appeal it or file another complaint or say it is unsatisfactory, the process varies by agency. They get judged on ""unsatisfactory,"" that is a negative metric for them.  If I were the caseworker working these complaints I wouldn't take 1000 negative metrics because some bullshit company wanted to fuck their employees over for $12 a pop.

Furthermore, these agencies aren't equipped to handle 1000 extra complaints regarding Target's bullshit PDF charge because they already working on thousands of other complaints. These agencies (DOL, OSHA, IRS, etc.) don't want 1000 complaints and they aren't equipped to handle these complaints. And they certainly don't want more negative metrics.

But you have to organize! You have to file unfair labor complaints. Government agencies aren't equipped for volume complaints like this and it will get escalated and they will tell Target to stop their bullshit and apologize because they don't want any more complaints.

For the OSHA example, the first thing that the OSHA rep will do is contact the business and say, ""CAN YOU PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR EMPLOYEE WITH MATS SO THEY STOP CONTACTING US. YES OR NO CIRCLE ONE. If no why not and when is a good time to swing by to make sure everything else is in compliance?"" Doesn't matter if you're tight with management. You can't get retaliated for filing these complaints. 

Like attorneys on Reddit say, ""I am A shop steward not YOUR shop steward."" Speak out, organize, unionize. "

No thanks, I prefer the freedom to do what is in my power, 'rights' that originate with me and end with me.

Besides, what do you think you are doing, shouting loudly that we need to 'rebel', to 'fight'? There used to be a serious fight for fairness in the workplace, and this has led to a sterile liberalism where we are all perpetually unhappy and with full stomachs.
One does not attack the root of the evil, but tries to embellish the consequence.

As long as these vampires exist who feed on the labour of others, exploiting and oppressing to extend their dominance, their thirst for power unquenchable (the more you drink the more thirsty you are) then there will be no peace and you will remain unshackled, like donkeys forced to circle the millstone day and night, senseless, just to survive.

And I'll tell you one thing: the exploiters will continue to exploit, because the mass of exploited LOVES them, they want to be like them, and they fight against those poorer than them to guard the miserable property that is 'rightfully' theirs.

They (the masses of people) are selfish, ignorant, stupid, unconscious and masochistic; the mass is worse than the exploiters because the exploiter, at least, is aware of his own interest and pursues it with the means he deems right; the mass, on the other hand, is not, it loses itself in itself, and becomes the most heinous police.

So if you want to keep saying this communist university bullshit go ahead, it won't change shit anyway 

And I will be opposed, since the categorical imperative of society is optimism, even on the verge of falling into the abyss, but I don't care."

The clothing requirements are professional (Hotel career) and around here they cost about $87 which is impossible for me to afford as someone with no income, however the shelter WAS going to take care of this as they did the phone I got recently (granted it took them 5 damn months due to red tape to get me a phone but that's another conversation).(Reposting So I've been waiting for the shelter to help me obtain work clothes for a new job I got hired for 2 weeks ago, where I have to show up to for mandatory (no flexibility) Orientation on Monday.

Originally things were fine and I was taken care of. I was expecting the Shelter to help cover the cost, but that all changed when top management had decided to cut off a few workers, reduce a bunch of hours, and go back on raise promises. Which in turn meant less vetting, less maintaining, and less control over the shelter (it's poorly run but it's a small mountain town/city anyway so expected).

There has been a back and forth between shelter workers and management since, where workers decided to stop coming to work until things are made fair and right, with others only working some hours. Being in a hillside small town there isn't really anywhere else to get workers, ***putting the shelter in a corner.***

The problem is, this ***also screws with those who need assistance from the shelter***, especially since most of us don't have cars and are basically trapped in the area at the whim of whatever the shelter can help with.

Now, I want to make clear I ***get*** why there is a conflict. I fully understand ***why*** the workers are choosing to go about it this way, and **I support them** fighting against bad employers/management. But I can't pretend this does not create massive problems.

In response to this after a few days, certain benefits that were provided by the shelter have been reduced or cut. The budget that *would have* helped me obtain the clothes no longer exists as of now. Which means that I have until Monday, ***less than 2 days***, to find another way to get the clothes I need. I've already been told I can't show up without being in uniform or they'll rescind the offer.

This is especially hard when the job took me in on their terms (had to explain a 2 year gap convincingly), so they won't work with me on the uniform. Granted, the business is hospitality based so I sort of get why they are so strict about the uniform, but considering my limiting location and the fact it took months to even get an interview for this job (which I passed) this protest really puts me in a bad position.

With the workers rebelling against the managers I now have no support (no family or other orgs in the town that can replace the shelter program), and in a town where there's barely any resources. I'd be lucky to work some small jobs and even get half of what I need for the work uniform required by Monday, which is all professional. **Shirt, pants, shoes, and overcoat. 23/hr,**

Adding to the problem is it's the weekend. Limiting my options even more as the only other possible line of help, the churches, only open on weekdays (They are not Sunday churches), and even that would still be a roll of the dice, but since it's the weekend they are closed anyway.

I still want to make it clear ***I'm not saying*** that what the shelter staff are doing is wrong. I want to avoid any confusion, ***I support*** the staffs decision and reason why. But now I'm facing the possibility of losing a job opportunity that could help me rebuild my life, because of how the staff went against the Employer (Or rather how the Employer treated the staff). Unless I am somehow able to in a resource limited town, buy the clothes myself ($87), which isn't possible since I don't have income, which is why I was depending on the shelter.

It seems like I may be screwed because Management has once again screwed over their workers, but this time at an agency that has clients that **DEPEND** on it. It seems I'm about to get the short end unless another solution is found. I have until *2PM Monday* which is not long from now."

Back then, it was able for one person to feed a whole family, own a car and own a house. It was easier to go from lower class to middle class. I assume that working back then still was hard and frustrating, but atleast you knew, what you were getting for it.

They recently hired someone but she got sick so she couldn’t go to work that week and ended up getting fired without him telling her. No one knew what really happened with her until we received a call from her mom through the stores phone line stating that she’s been trying to reach out to the manager but he’s been ghosting her. She wasn’t even informed that she was fired, I had to tell her myself. I heard from other coworkers that he was considering hiring her back again and would add her to this week’s shift but didn’t. We also don’t get any benefits such as paid sick leave/time and just implemented a mandatory 10 min break for each 4 hours, and an unpaid 30 min break for more than 4 hours. I’ve also heard he doesn’t allow employees to work 8 hours simply cause they aren’t allowed to and they can’t do over time. When there is an opportunity to get an 8 hour shift or gives you one, he will tell you on the final hour to go home.I honestly think he just doesn’t want to pay employees overtime (he is in debt after purchasing the store). It honestly seems like he’s doing the bare minimum to satisfy the laws. I was wondering if there’s something I can do? Should I report him? I’ve talked to some employees and it seems like they don’t want to report him because 1. It’s a simple decent job, it’s not too hard and hs and college students can make easy money and 2. They don’t want to go through the trouble of finding another job."

The other job offer came in. They are offering about a 33% raise, better bonus, and LTI. It's an offer too good to pass up. 

I'm usually a loyal diligent worker, but can't pass up the opportunity. But as I recently learned any corporation will let you go just because of ""make up excuse here"".

Overall, I did get my raise and I was considered as “meeting expectations.” However, I learned that there were three no call no shows listed on my notes and that I was considered “disrespectful and hard to give feedback to.” When I questioned where that had come from, I was told my return to work transition had left me with three NCNS because I didn’t return to work on time and that they had left me multiple voicemails during those three days. I asked for the dates, showed them my call logs and voicemails to prove that I was not contacted and that I received no voicemails about being scheduled.
This is really disheartening because when I returned to work (I had a medical leave from august through October) they had basically not scheduled me at all and I had to call 4 times in one week to even get in contact with the scheduling manager. When I finally did get in contact with him on thursday of the week, he said my paperwork wasnt done properly and i couldnt return to work until my doctor redid my paperwork. i did not hear any kind of update until SUNDAY (4 days later) where i got a call saying i had missed my morning shift for that day. i was confused but the voicemail left then explained i was put back on the schedule and could return to work.
on thursday of the next week i returned to work and was NEVER told about the other two ""ncns"" which they are now claiming was the friday and saturday between the two phone calls. 
is there anything i can do to protect myself here? any rule about needing to be CONTACTED when schedules change within 24 hours? ive worked at this trader joes for over a year and this is the first time ever i have heard of a ncns going without a follow up for over three months. help!"

3,2024-02-04,I may lose a job opportunity because Shelter management is mistreating their workers by cutting hours and removing raises! Not sure what to do,u/Abakerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aiqmhh/i_may_lose_a_job_opportunity_because_shelter/,antiwork,"**(Reposting after site error)**

So I've been waiting for the shelter to help me obtain work clothes for a new job I got hired for 2 weeks ago, where I have to show up to for mandatory (no flexibility) Orientation on Monday. The clothing requirements are professional (Hotel career) and around here they cost about $87 which is impossible for me to afford as someone with no income, however the shelter WAS going to take care of this as they did the phone I got recently (granted it took them 5 damn months due to red tape to get me a phone but that's another conversation).

Originally things were fine and I was taken care of. I was expecting the Shelter to help cover the cost, but that all changed when top management had decided to cut off a few workers, reduce a bunch of hours, and go back on raise promises. Which in turn meant less vetting, less maintaining, and less control over the shelter (it's poorly run but it's a small mountain town/city anyway so expected).

I was expecting the Shelter to help cover the cost, but that all changed when top management had decided to cut off a few workers, reduce a bunch of hours, and go back on raise promises. Which in turn meant less vetting, less maintaining, and less control over the shelter (it's poorly run but it's a small mountain town/city anyway so expected).

There has been a back and forth between shelter workers and management since, where workers decided to stop coming to work until things are made fair and right, with others only working some hours. Being in a hillside small town there isn't really anywhere else to get workers, ***putting the shelter in a corner.***

The problem is, this ***also screws with those who need assistance from the shelter***, especially since most of us don't have cars and are basically trapped in the area at the whim of whatever the shelter can help with.

Now, I want to make clear I ***get*** why there is a conflict. I fully understand ***why*** the workers are choosing to go about it this way, and **I support them** fighting against bad employers/management. But I can't pretend this does not create massive problems.

In response to this after a few days, certain benefits that were provided by the shelter have been reduced or cut. The budget that *would have* helped me obtain the clothes no longer exists as of now. Which means that I have until Monday, ***less than 2 days***, to find another way to get the clothes I need. I've already been told I can't show up without being in uniform or they'll rescind the offer.

This is especially hard when the job took me in on their terms (had to explain a 2 year gap convincingly), so they won't work with me on the uniform. Granted, the business is hospitality based so I sort of get why they are so strict about the uniform, but considering my limiting location and the fact it took months to even get an interview for this job (which I passed) this protest really puts me in a bad position.

With the workers rebelling against the managers I now have no support (no family or other orgs in the town that can replace the shelter program), and in a town where there's barely any resources. I'd be lucky to work some small jobs and even get half of what I need for the work uniform required by Monday, which is all professional. **Shirt, pants, shoes, and overcoat. 23/hr,**

Adding to the problem is it's the weekend. Limiting my options even more as the only other possible line of help, the churches, only open on weekdays (They are not Sunday churches), and even that would still be a roll of the dice, but since it's the weekend they are closed anyway.

I still want to make it clear ***I'm not saying*** that what the shelter staff are doing is wrong. I want to avoid any confusion, ***I support*** the staffs decision and reason why. But now I'm facing the possibility of losing a job opportunity that could help me rebuild my life, because of how the staff went against the Employer (Or rather how the Employer treated the staff). Unless I am somehow able to in a resource limited town, buy the clothes myself ($87), which isn't possible since I don't have income, which is why I was depending on the shelter.

It seems like I may be screwed because Management has once again screwed over their workers, but this time at an agency that has clients that **DEPEND** on it. It seems I'm about to get the short end unless another solution is found. I have until *2PM Monday* which is not long from now."
14,2024-02-04,Missing first two paychecks,u/intimatecorndog,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aiqzdh/missing_first_two_paychecks/,antiwork,"Seeking input: I am currently missing my first two paychecks from my job at a bulk grocery store (Not Costco, but similar). After multiple visits to HR to get to the bottom of the issue, and being told it would be resolved by this last Friday, the money from the missed checks was still not there even though my most recent check was. I informed them I am refusing to work until the money is in my account. 
This morning HR called to tell me the first direct deposits were rejected by my bank because the numbers were keyed in wrong, but company policy is to not re-issue the payment to a new account until the funds are returned by the original bank. And then, it will not be sent until the following payday (next week). So basically implying it was mine and my bank's fault I hadn't been paid for those weeks, and heavily guilt tripping me into working my scheduled shifts with their assurance that I'll be paid ...soon? They mentioned my attendance record being a problem if I don't come back. 
So, I have last week's pay, but not the two weeks previous, and I'm expected to return to work because I have an email from them saying I'll be paid when they get paid, but only on their schedule. The whole situation makes me uncomfortable, and I'm looking for a new job. 

So should I work my schedule hours and just cross my fingers I'll actually be paid for them? Or stick to my guns and only come back if/when I actually see the money? This issue made me late on rent."

Granted, I really liked my team and the work I was doing. So I considered staying when my former company countered with only a 20% increase. Then, my current company offered a 60% increase for the same role and I shot out of there like a gunshot. As an added cherry on top, my former direct report reached out to me after I left and mentioned her salary to me during the call (supervisors don’t know their employee’s salary in this company). She was making more money than me with 5 years less experience since she joined during the Great Resignation (not her fault obviously). I was not a happy camper…

Now the fun part. Before I left my last company, I was full remote since most of my team lived in other states. My current company offered the same full remote position so I was happy to make the switch. After I left, a new CEO came in and made everyone hybrid 3 days a week. This was after promising he would keep full remote an option since people had already moved and rearranged their lives to reduce their cost of living. Of course, the Glassdoor reviews tanked because everyone felt deceived. A year and a half later, the reviews say they not only implemented badge scanning tracking to ensure people show up to the office, they just added Bluetooth trackers that track your location in the office for “safety” for EMTs to find you. But the kicker is all the location data is given to HR, which of course ends up in performance reviews 😬. Reviewers online have likened the workplace to both a “day care” and a “prison”. With so many people leaving for greener pastures, the workloads, quality, and company culture have gone to hell. But upper management continues on with their crazy agenda without listening to anyone. Needless to say, I’m glad I got out when I did and I’m never going back."

But I'm only 19, so I was wondering if anyone who's done this before has any advice?

Some of the ideas I hope for: 

Starting pay 18 per hour. We're minimum wage, so I think $15.5 but I heard another convenience store chain nearby starts at 17 or 18 so maybe 17 is more realistic

Right to sit, this one is so important me. I've worked so many minimum wage jobs that I could definitely do seated, and it's just a power play on the employer's end to tell employees they can't sit down for even a minute. 

One free food item per shift, we have a deli, and pretty decent sandwiches, plus plenty of places that sell food give employees a free meal per shift. 

I can't think of anything else right now but I'm talking to my coworkers.

Anyway, to reiterate, if anyone else has fought the good fight and has some advice please let me know."

During the 2 months I was there nobody told me if there was anything wrong with my content. None of the upper management even looked at my content, because the people who were supposed to train me quit and got let go. At the 2 month mark boom, i got let go because of the lack of ""management supervision"" to tell me that ""my content wasn't professional enough"". If it wasn't professional enough why did you still want to use it? Were you lying about the reasons of letting me go or are you not able to afford new people to create new content for you?

I'm busting my ass at work in a technical position that my managers and corporate bosses don't even understand but insist on meddling with, and to make things even better in my relationship with them they owe me roughly $1,300 because they made me work through half of my paternity leave because we were too short staffed for me to leave when I was supposed to.

So this happened a few months ago. Makes me ashamed to be an American that so many go through situations like this yet corporate boot lickers and the USA USA crowd take pride in our capitalistic society and makes me feel equally enraged with profit over people corporations, ceos, and mangaement. Not to mention our shit Healthcare system.

But one of my colleagues' nephews and the nephew's daughter were in a horrific rollover accident.

The daughter was in a proper car seat and only walked away with a couple of bruises and scrapes. The nephew while alive and recovering well, broke several bones, broke his back in several places, and was banged up pretty bad.

Initially couldn't move or feel his legs. But he soon started be able to move his toes and was regaining feeling and now he is walking under his own strength with a walker but only for short bursts. So thankfully he doesn't seem to be paralyzed. 

But fast forward to about 3 weeks ago. After all his PTO was used up and sick days, his company fired him the next day.  Which they were already gonna do but they couldn't because they couldn't because he was somewhat protected by small insignificant laws... that could only protect him for about 6 weeks...but absolutely no way he could fully recover in that time frame.

Though he worked for this company for several years... No compassion, no loyalty, no sense of humanity on their part. He has applied for unemployment but his medical bills and life going forward and the way he may or may not be able to make a living is gonna to be so difficult... it breaks my heart. 

Then unrelated my defend billionaires and massive corporations boomer father was going on about how company's need and deserve to make money. And how Healthcare is a privilege not a right. Left me seething as I thought about my colleagues ' nephews. 

I really hate this capitalistic society we live in....

In context my boss is a narcissistic gaslighter. I should of seen all the red flags in my interview when he was downing his wife in front of me. Or maybe it was when he said if I quit before 18 months I would have to pay them $500 to quit. At my interview. Because he told me this place was a revolving door. 

This is long. Please give me opinions/advice. 

I've been doing a lot of thinking this past week since the meeting with Brandy on Thursday, the comment that was made Friday morning, and the additional little comments I've heard since I've been out of the office. 
I'd like to thank you for the opportunity for the position, but I've decided that I will not be returning. I don't feel as though you're what I'm looking for in an employer, and clearly, you're not happy with my performance as a whole.
I've been told that it's been said I treat the place as just a job and that sucks as I feel I'm constantly trying to push myself to be the best that I can be, for you guys, and my best still isn't enough and that's okay. Because it's enough for me and I realized that it will never be for you, as that's who you are as a person. And that's okay. But hiring into this place you asked me if I had an interest in the dental field and I told you no, but I really grew to love the girls I worked with and the more I learned, I wanted to see it as a place I spent the next part of my life until I got my degree, years and years from now. But this place just isn't for me. I don't enjoy being pushed and made to feel bad if I don't do an outside thing with my co-workers, which I felt like I was attending more and more, but hey. Like I said, for some people, your best won't be enough. Or the inappropriate comments made towards people's weight, their outside lives, or my thin hair. Or just in general comments made that should of never been said in the first place. I don't know what makes you feel so comfortable to say that out loud to someone. Is it in your intentions to be helpful or hurtful?
Brandy said there is room to improve myself, but at the end of the day, there is room for improvement for how you treat your employees. You can wave your money around, give us an allowance for work outfits, but that will never be enough. It seems as if this office is a revolving door, and I've seen why after just the first two months of being there. 
Some people present their best sides first. But I am prioritizing my well-being.
I've accepted an offer with better opportunities, and that's effective immediately.
Thank you and take care."

I wish we could create a society that doesn't require us to slave away for money just to survive so we could enjoy life more.

I went from working at Jiffy Lube to becoming an apprentice mechanic to now being a diesel mechanic. I make good money but the work is long, hard, tiring, arduous, repetitive and unfulfilling. I work 10-12 hours a day, 50-60 hours a week and my bosses will not let me work less. 

I'm mentally and physically drained at the end of each day and just want to lay down and go to sleep. On my off days, I feel too burnt out to enjoy myself. I just end up thinking about the upcoming work week/clients to deal with and staring into the abyss. I have a 3 year old daughter to take care of, I'm living together with her mother in a one bedroom apartment I pay $1,664 a month for. If I quit my job/lose my income I will not be able to pay my bills. We would lose everything. My significant other works part time but it's just enough to help with food and essential expenses. I am tired of this life. I turn 36 next month. it's like I HAVE to keep working, or else. if I quit my whole life will fall apart. My SO will probably leave me as I won't be able to financially provide for her and my daughter. I feel trapped, stuck doing the same routine week after week. I feel numb and lifeless. Yeah I could take a few weeks off and go on vacation but that doesn't solve the problem of being stuck working 80% of my life. I just want to get up and not have to work and be able to enjoy myself without thinking about work. 

 I don't think I have an actual mental health condition I just think society forces us to work too much and it destroys our mental health and quality of life. The only thing keeping me going is being able to take care of my daughter and not be homeless. 

I am anti work. "

I was being treated like I stole something because I was then being told to pack my things and leave immediately. HR even took my box of belongings with her to my car. I’ve never been fired from a job before and have always quit my jobs. I felt so embarrassed.

I am being paid less than Mcdonalds wage and still taking the time to make sure the pastry case looks presentable. Openners are assigned to take photos of the pastries and email them to the regional manager for “proof” that we’re following the rules or some shit. At first, this was fine because it wasn’t a huge ask. But since everything was going too “smoothly”, my whinny regional manager decided to pick on every little thing that looks wrong to him. I get an email telling me that the pastry case looks “sad” and that some cookies were missing even though i said they were still being baked and almost going to be out.

I got into banking because I didn't go to school and it was sorta my way into making more money at the age that I was (currently 27), and I didn't really know where else to turn to, but I'm happy it did get me to where I am at the very least in the meantime, if I'm able to find something better. 

I have a manager who's constantly religious, and actually brings up religion (she's Christian, I believe) to her employees and customers quite a bit and sometimes she'll even go on tangents about religion to her employees and sometimes customers as well, which is sorta strange to me.. because, should that even be allowed in the workplace..? She's also white condescending, always seems to try and get the upper hand on topics or things spoken to her, and doesn't really care about other opinions. Recently, though..it seems to have gotten sorta better.

My assistant manager, she'll be here for two years this August. Well, no one really likes her and everyone calls her an asshole and bitch behind her back but it sorta makes sense because she really doesn't like helping customers, she'll give someone else the customers she was asked to help for example, or she won't help out her employees if needed. She's been better within the past couple of months, though, but still..kinda annoying, tbh.

My other coworkers (12 employees, including managers in the branch), always give an attitude when asked for for help, always giving an attitude when someone calls them on the phone for an override and, always giving an attitude when needing to help a customer.
And by attitude, I mean a lot of sighing, literal attitude with words, and being presently annoyed when dealing with customers. Also a lot of eye rolling, even if it's not as noticable. 

My managers also expect me to understand IRAs, and other forms of transactions even though we barely got help with it and it's a lot, and I'm tired of being expected to understand something when I've barely been trained on it. Actually, I haven't been trained with IRAs at all, now that I think about it.

One of my coworkers, or a few, snitched on me recently to my managers all because I accidentally lost my key to open my teller drawer (I dropped it in a shred bin by accident, but we found it.) I was helping out at the end of the day, like we usually do, and I dropped my key while taking shred to the shred bin, and some of my coworkers snitched on me saying that I ""froze"" while not helping, which isn't true. I was looking around my teller area, the kitchen, tables, desks and whatnot. People thought I was doing nothing, which I think was kinda petty to even tattle tale on. 

I work at a savings and loans, and I'm just tired of this everyday attitude, getting snitched on and dealing with the same thing nonstop."

Today I wanted to talk to my boss at my retail job and give her my letter of resignation, as I don't need to work there, nor do I want to since the company has gone down the shitter. It used to be great, now it's horrible.

We talked about why I was leaving, I told her my issues entirely have to do with the corporation itself and how the changes being made to save them money/lack of support from corporate make my job infinitely more difficult than it has been in the last five years. I have worked in every position other than store manager. I have been at 5 stores, closed 3 of them, and even worked at the sister brand. I've been through a lot, I've done my time, and quite frankly I am tired of the bullshit.

She said, ""I understand your frustration, and it just sounds like you're tired. We had a hard holiday season and then the allocation of payroll changing didn't help our stress last month. I know you're going on vacation in a few weeks. Why don't we only do 1 or 2 more shifts after this week before you go on vacation, then we will talk after you're back and rested.""

What the hell am I even supposed to do? I barely work as it is. I have no reason to work there anymore. I am not one to end on bad terms, as this job has been a very big part of my life and gave me what I needed to get through college and financially rough times. I do not want to burn the bridge because if I ever need money, they'll always take me back because of my tenure. It's mind boggling how a two weeks notice became ""talk to me in a month"""

I have worked on a few contracts and I'm no stranger to being paid based on ""project completion."" However, the rates are usually fair for the amount of hours to complete the project, usually coming out to about $20 per hour.

This December, I accepted another contract with a well-known practice assessment website. We'll call them buddy.bomb. The contract was to write practice questions for the teacher praxis exam. The pay was $10 per question batch; each batch had 4 questions and I estimated I could complete two or three batches per hour, so this was reasonable.

After completing the onboarding training, which was unpaid, and waiting a week, I finally got my first work assignmeng. I completed and submitted it. It got kicked back to me for some edit requests based on stylistic standards. Sure, no problem. Fixed it and resubmitted it. Then a different editor kicked it back to me with feedback on the content itself, and the edits she wanted me to make were factually wrong. I tried to compromise, rewriting the questions and answers in a way where it better matched what she wanted while still being correct. She sent it back fof even more of these factually incorrect edit requests. By factually incorrect, I mean she was arguing with me about things for which I have written research papers, or telling me to remove a period after answer choices that were ""sentence fragments"" when the answer choices were complete answers with a subject and verb, or even requesting edits that I had already fixed for her.

I had at this point sunk maybe 3 hours into onboarding and another 2 hours on this question batch alone, to be looking at a maximum of $10 when I finally make this uninformed and inexpert lady happy. So instead, I deleted all of the work I had done (they aren't going to ever pay me since in their eyes it is still ""incomplete,"" and I'll be damned if they get to keep the content I had written in thag case) and sent her a message. The message said:

""Hi *redacted*. I have now worked on this question batch for well over an hour and a half in total, making edits as indicated. Considering the edits that are being kicked my way are not correct, it is apparent to me that I will not be able to complete work to *buddy.bomb's* standard. Formatting, grammar, and skill alignment are reasonable edits to ask me to make, but I will not continue to try and make edits only to receive further incorrect suggestions for $10. Effective immediately, please remove me from the team. Thank you.""

Then I resubmitted the now deleted work. They never paid me, so it's not like I'll use them as a reference.

Don't let these companies pull this shit. If they are offering a completion pay rate that is only slightly higher than minimum wage, then their estimate of the effort and time to complete those projects should be accurate. Especially if the majority of that effort and time is appeasing the desires of managers who don't know what the fuck they're talking about."
4,2024-02-04,I am quitting this week,u/Talkingtrafficcone,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aj3zzs/i_am_quitting_this_week/,antiwork,"TL;DR worked in a bunch of fields, been an ops manager for almost 3 years, boss is shit, company is poorly organised, getting shafted on salary with maximum risk. Quitting to be a tree consultant. 

I grew up with a lot of family friends being high flying corporate individuals, and my parents always pushed for me to get a “real job” (they were farmers). I enjoyed farming, machinery, nature, property, all the usual things for a male growing up in the agricultural space. 

After school had a few different jobs, from cook, to tree surveying, to farming, enjoyed all of them, travelled a bit met some cool people. 

I dropped out of uni twice (business then finance), then studied project management. Worked as a contractor for a year for a friend as a shutdown manager at a manufacturing plant. Then Covid, but got a job at another manufacturing plant as the operations manager. Been doing that job almost 3 years now, I have three great shifts under me, with some great people onboard that have taught me a tremendous amount. I am paid below market rate, but I saved and started my own business building cars on the side which has been a networking haven, but I can’t live off that yet. 

But the problem is a few things, I have a huge amount of responsibility, the industry is a bit volatile, the fire threat is massive, our particular business is stuck between a very competitive market (for incoming product) and ONE CUSTOMER to receive our end product. My boss is very Ill, refuses to take time off work, and comes to work apocalyptically angry most days, and takes that out on myself, the maintanence manager and anyone else in the way. The micromanaging is doing my head in, every decision gets second guessed, and my dayshift supervisor is very close to quitting as my boss goes past me to order him directly on stupid things (which supervisor knows to do, but are not priority as turnaround times are crucial). I just got a new title of transport manager (we bought a fleet of trucks, even though we are not a transport company) and I have to manage everything from registering and maintaining the trucks, to scheduling and employees, the contract is 1.6mil a year, plus 150k management fee, I asked to be renegotiated and I was given a new contract stating my title and job description change, I got 3.5% increase, $4025 increase, which includes my yearly increase anyway (my boss doesn’t acknowledge CPI as it’s “not that expensive to live here”, he makes $250k plus car and super). And I got thrown under the bus on Friday as I didn’t book in a visit with him for a incoming customer, and I’m going to loose a $1m contract as he didn’t read or reply to the email train he was addressed in, and the sales guy didn’t invite him to the meeting. We aren’t loosing the contract, customer doesn’t give a shit who they see on-site, sale guy said they prefer me as I’m verbally coherent (boss is verbally incoherent at times, been getting worse). He reminds me that I’m years of training away before I can do his job, he wants me to take over from him, but then provides no training, mentoring, excludes me from meeting so I can better understand his role. 

I got a job offer to do his job (but in another state), which I’m turning down this week (almost double my pay). I applied to a few jobs in ops management locally, but the market is thin at the moment. And the risk just isn’t worth the pay and it takes years to scale that income.

My partner and I are selling our house in 2 weeks (flipper) and I have been asking around friends if anyone has any work, have had a few offers, but I’m going into consulting work, and taking over a friends business ( he is retiring soon) so I’ll be self employed!"

I work a shit job that no one else wants to do but it pays well and is putting me through university. 

We have a whiteboard in the building that everyone looks at every morning before there shift because the managers delegate our jobs and write what we are doing for the day next to our name. Simple and easy. 

If we had a meeting they used to write that next to our names as well, with the time. 
Another simple and easy process that has never been an issue.

First day back from a week of Annual Leave, my manager called me in and got mad at me because I didn't turn up to a meeting. 

I said it wasn't on the whiteboard, confused.

He said that he sent me a Teams invite to my work email during my leave and that I didn't RSVP to it. 

RSVP?? Dude are my manager your job is to delegate me tasks and I do them, I can't RSVP no? So why even ask? 

We don't have jobs that require us to be at a computer, so why on earth would you expect us to check our work emails, during my annual leave no less? 

He then said on my work phone would've reminded me. Ahhh yes the expensive waste of money they got all of us that nether I or anyone of my co workers have even needed to use on the job. Thus no one ever takes them on the job with them.

155,2024-02-04,Cover Letters Are Such an Absurdity,u/OneOnOne6211,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aj5lgk/cover_letters_are_such_an_absurdity/,antiwork,"First of all, expecting people to write cover letters is absurd to begin with.

If you have to write individual letters for every job you apply to you are going to be wasting an insane amount of time. Especially considering that getting employed is to a large extent a question of pure volume. Just trying to get out as many applications as possible.

And it's especially bad because you know these people making those decisions have about a 1% chance that they'll actually read the thing anyway. So it's probably wasted time on top of it all.

But more importantly, what the hell is a point of a cover letter?

You want to know what experience and education I have? I already sent you my resume. All the practical information is in there. So that's clearly not the main point.

So what is the point then? To have me talk about how passionate I am about applying to this job? Well, I'm fucking not. And with the exception of very few jobs almost no worker is going to be genuinely excited or passionate about applying for a whatever job it is.

Most people don't try to get a job because ""Oh, I care so much about building this company into something"" or ""I just want to be part of the amazing team at this company."" No, people try to get a job because the grocery store demands money from you if you want to eat.

Why do I want this job? Cuz I need the money. That is the answer. That is always the answer. And you cannot tell me that these recruiters don't know that. Surely, surely, these people do. Unless they're really dumb or naive they have to know that what people write in these cover letters is mostly just a bunch of fluff. And what they really are thinking is ""I just need the money.""

So basically the point of cover letters is for one person to lie to another person with that other person knowing full well that every word they're writing is a lie. And they're just trying to convince you to hire them cuz they need the money. That's literally it.

Just as a sidenote, that doesn't mean someone can't like their job or be passionate about some aspect of it. But most of what's in a cover letter is pointless fluff and bullshit. And it serves no purpose but to waste my time writing it and their time reading it (if they even do)."

I just got laid off from my job due to ""budget reasons"". I've worked for this company for 1.5 years. Here's the weird part. I was laid off on Wednesday, January 31st. However, HR said I will remain employed and need to keep working for them until March 1st. Has anyone else heard of this? How am I supposed to keep working as if it's business as usual? Also, my lay off was announced to the entire company during a townhall meeting, which was humiliating. I can't imagine their reasoning for this.

For additional info, I am split across three departments in this company. One of these departments is being shut down due to inadequate funding. There were three of us working for this department. My salary comes only 25% from this. The manager is paid 75% of their salary from this. The director is paid 100% of their salary from this. Me and the director were laid off. The manager got transitioned somehow and gets to keep their job. I asked if there was any solution to keep me on, and they told me no. I am in the lowest earning position in the company, so I don't know how they found 75% of a manager's salary, but not 25% of my low-level salary.

I'm a good employee. I've never had a write up or anything close. I get along great with all my team members and take on extra projects. I've taken training courses to be better at my job. I was told during the lay off conversation that it is ""not personal"". But I'm having a hard time believing that since they made the effort to keep on the other team member. 

For the record, I'm very happy the manager gets to keep their job. They're a wonderful human and worker. I am only salty and mad at the company, not my coworker. 

I've never lost a job before, and the way this has gone down has left me in a terrible place mentally and financially. Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you!"

One of one on shift front end production worker. So we've been down a worker almost a year and another co worker is now out of the mix as of last week.
Supposed to be a 6 person dept, and now we are at 4. Of our 6, there are 2 weekend guys, so 2 days a week and the rest of us work 5 days a week (m-f). So instead of my 40hr work week I'm doing a 60hr work week. Swing shift worker and this is my rotation onto night shift. Really haven't been feeling good all weekend and showed up to my shift with a giant bottle of pepto bismal and virtually no energy to get through. Nights are the hardest shift for me in good health (I am not a night owl type,never have been).

Do shift exchange with the co worker that is leaving gesturing to my giant pepto while explaining that's where I'm at...he kinda laughs it off and says 'yea, that ran through my house a few weeks ago' and leaves.

This guy didn't even have the courtesy to let me know he basically left me under water for my shift. He didn't even prepare me the bare minimum that we all do for each other so that we aren't scrambling the minute we walk though the door.

So I'm here, feeling like scat, already behind and got 11hrs to go on this shift and I just wanna leave, get in my car and go home. 

I really despise this system we live under, esp on a 'day' like today. In truth I don't actually blame my co worker for this scenario that has me feeling this way, it's the corporate 'culture' and it's set up to make us all be the 'fall guy'. Just disgusting.

I live in Europe. I got a job as an ad producer for biggest clothing company in my country. I make photoshoots and filmshoots happen, then I oversee the postproduction. In short I'm responsible for creating an ad and photos for the site from the very beginning to the very end - that includes casting, finding directors for the ad and the crew, overseeing the budget, paying everyone their share, negotiating, finding locations, sometimes making impossible happen etc. etc. 
The thing is: normally this amount of work would be done by 3 people but the corporation is stingy so I'm alone. Here are my problems with this employer.
1. When we were negotiating my contract I wanted higher pay, they said they can't give me anything higher than what they proposed but there is a BONUS every half a year that is equal to 3 times my base pay. - I calculated it and it was OK for me so I agreed. Well would you look at that: fast forward some time and I talk with my team and they say there was no bonus for the last 2 years and that I was lied to - Fucking lovely.
2. When I was signing the contract I wasn't informed I would have to work as 3 people for 1 person pay. This results in me working after work, and on weekends - you know your classic overtime. Except you guessed it THE COMPANY WON'T PAY FOR OVERTIME. Just in January alone I made 36h of overtime. Also working as 3 people for my pay - well I feel quite cheated so to say.
3. I had to go for sick leave - in my country sick leave is scared. You get to take as much as you needed, you are pain 80% of your rate for it and by the law your employer can't make you work. Guess who has two thumbs and had to work on her sick leave bc there is no one to cover my duties? - This girl!
I will be talking about it today with my manager but I know exactly what he will tell me: i can't get you a rise and you know how film/ad production looks like you always work overtime it is what it is. Yeah I know how it looks just not for this kind of money and this treatment. So either we will reach some conclusion or i will be parting ways with them.

Fast forward to today, I worked on my skills and put myself in a position of value and now I’m in a job I really enjoy. We get to work from home all week and I’ve only been to the office 3 times since 2019.

My advice is to put your energy into improving your skills if you’re able to. It doesn’t always need to be a degree in the area you want to work in. 

I can’t believe how much better life is when you have skills that are in high demand. My employer goes out of their way to make sure my wellbeing is good and that I am happy. 

Stay strong."

We had a new person get hired in the middle of last year. Supervisor claimed he didn’t even know the position existed (quality control inspector). I come into work for the last couple hours the store is open so I get to be with both sides of the crew (day and night)

Near the end of the year the new guys (step)daughter gets hired on (she works days and he works nights) which is alright and I thought nothing of it at the time 

Eventually the other day stockers complain that she’s lazy, hardly ever on task and does nothing but the light work. Supposedly she was written up for it but nothing really changed (quota is 160 a day or 20/hr for daystocking and she tops out at like 90. I can get 69 in 2hrs most days)

Fast forward to last month. They demote our lead (20+ years with the company) and promote the new guy to lead (less than a year with the company). This concerns us that we will be met with retaliation if we ever complain about her again

She admitted to me that he was her dad her first week and vented to me a few times how he will get on her at home (example being it was her day off and we was there until 4:30a but due to inclement weather earlier that week we got a massive load that day)

Here’s the kicker: Two people separately questioned the supervisor if they was related in some way. He told one of them that she is the guys “friends kid”. He told the other that “they only know each other from meeting here”

I guess this is mostly a vent post but it’s been irritating the crap out of me. I respected our original lead and feel bad for him (can only imagine what that demotion changed for his pension)

On a few occasions I heard/seen the new lead takes credit for what I’ve done (asks me to do something then says he did it). I’ve been thinking about anonymously reporting it (the nepotism and the crew is becoming disgruntled) but I doubt it’d really change anything. I know if things don’t change soon they’re looking at losing about half of the current crew

I don’t think they are ready to pick up my slack when I leave and I’m already looking for a new job. 

Anyone else experience something similar, if so how did it play out?"

3. Each individual housed in these tent would be provided with disposal bag and bottles for bodily waste.
4. There would be a small opening in the tent where a power socket could go
5. I'd also abolish minimum size for new builds and consolidate the housing code into a small magazine and cap rent for a studio at 33% of the weekly full-time minimum wage."

My job is customer service representative. I specifically avoid sales jobs because while I am good at it, I hate sales. Well couple of weeks ago my boss came to me and said “I want you to call these customers and try to get them to order”

Now, had I known this was going to have calling customers to get sales, I would have never accepted. It was outlined like an inbound customer service type job. Taking and placing orders etc. 

I went to look at the job description, to let them know I didn’t sign up for a sales job only to realize technically it’s in the job description. The way it’s described on the job description I didn’t take it as basically cold calling (the customers he wants me to call are people who haven’t ordered in years so it’s basically cold calls at this point) it says “you will provide sales support to existing accounts and obtain new orders” 

Honestly it’s on me for how I interpreted the description, but either way I’m irritated. 

Luckily he doesn’t expect me to do this during all my free time. He only wants me to call 2 a day. Which is fairly reasonable. Just irritated because I didn’t wanna do sales. We have a sales rep who gets commission, even when I place the orders.

Always loads of “overtime” (paid at base rate). Anyway all of a sudden manager goes sorry but I’ve had to amend your rotas, everybody is down to contracted hours only.

My first thought ok it’s a bit quiet but ok we’ll deal with it for a couple weeks, but then I see it’s for the foreseeable, just looks like they have increased the hourly rate but dropped the hours so pay remains the same. Not once while I’ve worked here have they dropped it before April by this much. 

So my take home is going to half along with everyone else either losing the same or similar amounts , while all the managers and upwards within the company will no doubt still be ful hours (salary paid), yearly pay rise and bonuses as usual and they expect you to work harder.

No miracle will happen, even th emost goodhearted businessperson out there (if they exist) can't change the way their business works or they'll immediately get beaten in the competitive market, outscaled and ultimately left back in the dust. The system relies on exploitation and continues to push its boundaries to produce more, exploit more, grow more.We either fight, force a change and make the difference or give up, but complaining won't matter, because it will achieve nothing. Not even politicians can cause important changes, especially because their economies would collapse if considered in the global market.. you can't let your country fall behind or become poor, the majority will not tolerate that.

Take AI, or automation, why should companies keep expensive workers who fight for their rights when they are replaceable? It makes sense to ditch them for better ""tools"". If a nation forces a comany to keep human workers while the rest of the world changes, such companies will either leave the country or fall behind anyway. These are major issues that need a system change, not smaller ones..

Not only we must push for change, we must push for changes at a global level AND push for smaller changes that work within the system until the global level is met.

It's in our hands, it's up to us who understand to decide where to go and if needed, to step up and take the place of those unable to fight the system they either thrive in or are trapped in.

I want to take it down, i want to beat it and change of the world turns and revolves. It isn't easy, but it is possible."

I can’t take it",u/gtck11,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ajktij/snapped_on_my_horrible_boss_finally_unsure_whats/,antiwork,"I finally had it. After 11 years in my career I snapped at work on my boss today. I’ve been yelled at, cussed out, talked down to, all sorts of things in my career but today finally made me snap. Fully expecting a black mark on my review, a note from HR, or to be put on a PIP. I feel so upset, sad, frustrated, and defeated that I let my AH of a boss get to me like this and I took the bait. Let me set the stage and history here. 

Corporate supply chain manager at this company since 2017. 2022 I get passed for promotion in my team, and have a new boss who barely has any experience, and is at least 6-8 years younger than me. I'm a permanent remote worker so I’m ticked off but OK given that I have remote work freedom. 2 months after this I am forced back into the office part time, and my new boss is a menace. Mansplains to me constantly to the point it’s insulting, micromanages, calls me multiple times a day in and out of the office, pings me nonstop, calls me if I don’t respond to a ping within 1 minute, and on top of that he’s an idiot. He also keeps encouraging me to move states (which would cause me to get fired, and he does this frequently). He has 0 experience with what my team manages and he will point blank shove work on me saying “idk how to do this you go figure it out”. I also find out he is MAGA, Qanon, and antivaxxer (and I am immunocompromised. Lucky me) He has gone behind my back and asked coworkers if they really believe I have immune system, and if I’m actually sick. He also refuses to give me sick days and will try to call me and force me to talk to him when I take them (unlimited sick time here FYI). 

All of my performance reviews have been stellar to this point and talked about what a great smart wonderful amazing employee I am and my critiques have been minor things such as “I want to see gtck11 have more leadership presence in meetings” stuff like that, nothing damaging to my intellect or ability. First performance review by him with only 4 months under, he tears me to shreds and put career ending comments ensuring I will never get promoted again. My former boss agrees this is shocking, not good, and not OK at all what he’s doing. Has a talk with him about how to treat me, trust me, hypes up my intellect and what fantastic work I do, things improve for about 3 months before back to how they started. I decide at this point I have to leave and I am done giving corporations my all, but due to the remote job market here I am still. 

I snapped on him today. I’m not proud of it but I can’t handle it anymore. We went on a work trip together a few weeks ago where he really ramped up encouraging me to quit, tried to get me drunk which made me severely uncomfortable around him, and kept saying stuff trying to get me to kiss his ass and he kept bragging about how rich he was. It was an awful trip. I wouldn’t bite and the above behavior has severely escalated since the trip. Today he pulls me into a room for a 1-1 and is talking down to me like I’m dumb, giving me step by step instructions on how to do my week and run a basic meeting. My blood is starting to boil slowly from the intensive mansplaining and micromanaging, he’s literally speaking to me like I’m a dumb child. Then he drops on me that I have to fill out a formal corrective action because of a failure to renew a contract on time (contract did get renewed on time FYI). I SNAPPED. I went off on why I didn’t see it, people going to the wrong people, and XYZ that happened and why it is not my failure. I didn’t yell but I was close, I definitely was visibly and audibly pissed that both him and the director are point blank pinning a service failure on me. For context - I was gone the entire month of November in Japan and racked up 1000+ emails. He was my vacation coverage and that was explicit on my OOO. Someone asked to renew a contract, and either he did nothing with it, or they never forwarded it to him per my OOO. I finally saw the email from a follow up late Dec and got the ball rolling on it. 

I can’t stand it here. I’m certain some type of action is going to come out of today. I’m upset I let myself show I was pissed but I can’t handle his condescending nature and blaming me anymore where I’ve given so much to this company. My boss is toxic, this company is toxic. I hate myself for ever going into the corporate world and not doing something I loved in school. On top of this I have an autoimmune disease, immune issues, and am going through some cancer scares right now.   I’ve been applying to remote jobs since last year and still don’t have one. I apply to 100-300 per week. I just need to vent I guess. Anyone else have toxic managers? Has anyone else ever lost their cool on a horrible manager and did you ever recover from it? I just want to sit in my car and cry from the exhaustion of months of this, the sum of everything with my health, and that I let this sorry excuse of a man get to me today and fulfill the emotional woman worker stereotype."

Lied to clients and raises prices because they feel like it. Called instead of text or email so there wouldn’t be records. 

I recently took a new job that I start in 2 weeks. I went ahead and put in for my PTO with some excuse. I know that if I give proper 2 weeks notice, boss will rescind PTO even after approving or try to sabotage me somehow. They’re that bad of an employer. So instead, I’m taking all my personal office supplies and notes with me on Friday, taking my MUCH EARNED PTO, and disappearing into the night. Also taking my name off any corporate documents so they can’t pin anything on me anymore.

1,2024-02-05,I can’t with my manager,u/areyousrrious,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ajlzbo/i_cant_with_my_manager/,antiwork,"I’m not sure if it’s me overthinking things or if he’s really this petty. 
I (30F) had been promoted from a sales tax representative (glorified customer service rep if you ask me) to a tax analyst (glorified assistant imo) and work under my manager, the tax director. I knew from the moment he interviewed me that I wasn’t going to like him. He has no filter, is a narcissist, sexist, and racist. He also has a drinking problem and comes to work drunk a lot and frequently gets high at work, which would ordinarily not bother me, but it causes everyone in my department to walk on egg shells around him whenever he comes to work like that because he becomes very moody. Other people from other departments often tell me, when they talk to him, they don’t know how he got his job. 
Recently we had to complete a registration application for a business license in another state. It took about a week and a half just to complete the form because it was difficult to speak to a state rep. Then we found out we needed to pay a $30 registration fee and the application could only be mailed out, so we submitted a request to have a check cut but it took another week for accounting to find the request. They also wouldn’t have found it, had I not gone to them to ask about it. When I did, they said the check would take another week because they just finished their check run for the week. So I told my manager and he was upset so I urged them to have to check cut by tomorrow. Tomorrow comes and I get an email at 4 pm saying the check was cut. I immediately go pick it and went to my manager to find out where the envelopes are. Unfortunately he was in a meeting and it lasted the hour. I had to leave at 5 pm but I knew he’d be in the office until 6 like the rest of our department. Therefore I asked my coworker if she could let him know that I have the check and he just has to mail it. She said she’ll tell him, but she doesn’t think he’ll mail it. I was puzzled by this, she said it was because he “doesn’t mail shit”. I couldn’t understand that, but I needed to go because I had a class I needed to attend. The next day I saw the check still on my next and my coworker said she told our manager and as she expected, he refused to mail it. He had taken the day off so I couldn’t ask him in person what to do with the check and application. According to my coworker, he had known the check was cut at 3 and was upset I hadn’t mailed out the check in that time frame. Meaning he was aware the check was ready before I did and he was the one that wanted this done asap, but deliberately left the check with accounting because it was something I was suppose to do??? I get the task was assigned to me but if it was really so urgent and no one informed me, why not help out? He’s aware the company is really bad at communicating and not only is he not helping the situation, he’s making it worse"

Then a year ago they started  asking managers to come back to the office if they're local.  
While the rest of our employees that report to us is fully remote because we hire across all states.

Now,  it's 3 days a week, next thing I know it'll be 5 days a week. Their reason? More collaboration which we all know is bs. It's mostly  about utilizing the office space since they have a lease that's not up  for like 5-10yrs.

I'm inside the 50 mile radius, what are my options besides looking for a new job that's fully remote?

**What  happens if I change my address in the portal to an address that's  outside the 50 mile radius ...like put down a family/friend's address?  Does it really matter if it's the same STATE?**   
**Wouldn't the address be updated everywhere else so like my pay stubs and W2? And wouldn't that cause other issues?**

We get our W2 electronically so mail wise, there's nothing to really care about.

The  market is so hard right now, I've polished up my resume and have been  looking for over a year, got interviews here and there but there's  always a better candidate it seems, I get 2nd place which may even be a  lie.

When we're close, we don't get paid for the day, but it would have been nice to not worry about getting to and from work in the rain, and have a safe and cozy day indoors instead.

But instead they decided to try and operate as normal... for about two hours, and then made the decision to close down. Luckily if we work less than four hours in a day, we get paid for four hours, so at least we got something out of it, but it just felt totally silly and unnecessary for all of us to come in and try to run things as normal, only to then shut down almost immediately. We're in a union but our first contract is still under negotiation so I'm not sure if this will play out differently once that's done. Personally I think if you're scheduled for a day, you should get paid for the whole day.

The funny part is they're probably going to give refunds to almost everyone anyway, so the company actually would have saved a chunk of money by just doing the smart thing in the first place."

I work for a small business (so no corporate bullshit), they gave me plenty of time off, and I really enjoy what I do. However, they fired one of my co-workers recently, and I'm incredibly upset about it.

This guy was one of the top salespeople in 2023. He was incredibly knowledgeable, always volunteered to do the tasks nobody wanted to do, and knew how to work multiple departments in the store.

They fired him after a customer, who was known for leaving multiple bad reviews and being hard to please, complained about the state of an area of his workstation he can't control. Customer claims he said ""management won't fix it because we're still making money off of it,"" and that was that. No warning, no disciplinary action, just straight out the door.

He found a new job pretty quickly, but he messaged me last night saying that even with his new job, he probably won't be able to pay the bills. He had stability where he was, and now it is gone. He feels betrayed.

I go into work now, and I am so, so angry. Whenever my mind isn't occupied, it goes straight to thinking about that. I can't look at my boss the same, and I find myself more irritated with tasks that didn't bother me before. I know I can't really afford to quit, especially because I'm trying to move in the next few months, but how can I stay in a place that did this to my friend?

Create a paper trail.,u/Ravidial,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ajq1fu/know_the_laws_create_a_paper_trail/,antiwork,"So last year I had a job working for a small city government. Standard 9-5, nothing special. They decided to expand my office by 1 person. No biggie, we were pretty busy so what could it hurt? 

Before the new guy got hired, my boss calls the employees into the office and shuts the door. Goes into a big lecture about us not discussing wages with the new guy. Threw in all the standard cliches “he’ll be making way less than you guys!” “We don’t want to scare him off cuz we are getting him for so cheap” blah blah blah. I regretted not having my phone in the office to record it. 

As soon as we left I sent an email to another supervisor on the same level as my boss letting them know the situation. 

Then he did it again a week before the new guy started. Again I created a paper trail, both text and email. 

The day the new guy started, like any reasonable person who had been told multiple times not to do something, I asked him what he made. Turns out Mr. underpaid New guy, was making the exact same as me. Despite years of experience, and me having a half dozen more licenses and certifications. Boss guy saw me discussing this with the new guy, and I made it clear to everyone around us as well. 

So I fire off an email to the boss, saying I want a review and a raise. I don’t mention that I’d asked the new guy, but he knew. I get back the standard bullshit line of “we will look into it, I’ll run it up the chain” etc etc. also known as “no”. 

I knew as soon as I got the answer that I was done working there. 

Fast forward 2 weeks and there was a horrible ice storm, followed by about a foot of snow. Every school, most businesses, and every OTHER government building, including parts of our own campus, closed for the day. But not ours. We were by no means essential, and there was absolutely no reason for us to have been there. 

So I sent an email to the half dozen people responsible for keeping us open that day, and endangering the lives of every employee that came in. The response was faster than anything I’ve ever seen. Within minutes I was cleaning out my desk under the supervision of a cop, and was put on paid administrative leave, effective immediately. 

Being a government agency, they had rules in place, and I was given what was basically an exit interview, and told it was to “argue my side”. The HR lady made it very clear my boss was very set on firing me, but it couldn’t hurt to make my case. It would be the HR lady, some lawyers, and my boss on the zoom call.  Layers eh? Let’s go. 

During the meeting I called out a laundry list of illegal or unethical things my boss ordered me to do while employed under him, as well as him on multiple occasions ordering us not to discuss wages. 

To end the meeting I just said “this weak argument of firing me for expressing concern for myself and my fellow coworkers about unsafe working conditions is nothing more than a smokescreen. The reason he wants to fire me is in retaliation for discussing wages with my fellow employees after he directly ordered us not to.”

Next morning after the exit interview, I get a call asking if I’d be willing to resign if they pay me full wages and benefits for the next few months in exchange for not suing. 

Long story short, Know the rules, and keep track of anytime they’re broken in case you ever need it in defense of yourself. I had multiple verifiable chains of evidence to back up every claim I made and probably could have done quite well in front of a courtroom, but I was ready to be done with that job anyways, and it was a hell of a goin away present."

We used to have control of our space heater and one night one of my coworkers accidentally left it on. Instead of not allowing her to use it or making some sort of rules around it, they just don’t let us have it anymore.

My cash desk is right in front of a huge window spanning the height of the walls so there’s no sort of cold shield. It’s winter in Canada so of course it’s freezing. 

I asked the manager on duty if I could have the heater for a bit and all he did was repeat my question then walk away, I thought he was getting it for me but it’s been an hour. I’m also the only cashier on for the moment so I can’t walk around like the guys on the floor can to stay warm.

This job has been absolutely horrible for me lately as well, they refuse to give me my days off that I rarely ask for and “promoted” one of my coworkers at the same time as me (I was trying to become a manager so I could get full time hours instead of the 38/week in Mmm getting). They made us both key holders and held off giving us a pay raise for two months. I’ve been trying to get transferred to a different location for a while and my managers are of course dragging their feet, I decided to take my resume to the place I want to get transferred to as well as a few other places. So hopefully I’m leaving soon but I don’t want my coworkers to still not have a heater when I leave.

Should I send an email to hr for poor working conditions? That the only way I can think to get it through to the managers that it seriously is freezing up front."

My boss the CM is trash, because she was trash me and my partner were very open about the lackluster training and lack of development and direction from the CM. This had been going on sometime so my partner went to the Regional and HR to complain. Last week they had a complaint that there was time missing from an employee paycheck that caused them to do an investigation. During the investigation they found that I gave employees 182 minutes that they did not work and I stole 110 minutes from employee’s. 

During my last day there me and the other AM were at work and we were both terminated for this. I explained that the process at the center was that an employee says hey my time is wrong we fix it. If I had taken time frame employees it was a mistake not malicious intent. They terminated me and told me I should have been keeping records or checked the camera. I informed them that my CM trained me on the system and she never expressed that. My DM told me that I didn’t follow the process. When I asked to be provided the SOP on the process he said there was not one. Both AM’s were fired the same day for the same thing. 

I get that stealing from employees and the company is wrong. I’m just lost on the fact I was terminated. The above numbers were over a 5 month period with numerous employees. I was never written up or coached, I have never done anything wrong. I’m going to contact a lawyer I just like to know your thoughts."

1,2024-02-05,Overtime Question,u/punytomatoes,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ajs769/overtime_question/,antiwork,"Hello!

TLDR:
Husband's boss is trying to guilt him into doing overtime after repeatedly saying he has commitments that keep him from doing so. Seemingly with no basis in his contract. Are we in the wrong for saying no to OT?

My DH l, electrical engineer works for an engineering consulting firm, his position was salary turned hourly due to his company being acquired by one of the biggest there is. His regular work hours listed in the ADP equivalent are 40h a week. During the acquisition, he got a new offer from the acquiring company that was standard benefits and such but no mentions of overtime (mandatory or otherwise).

He's consulting currently for one of the big 3 auto makers doing documentation of some kind.

Their project is woefully behind schedule, and he's been working with Supervisor on the day to day things, no issues. Supervisor mentioned last Friday at like 3pm (2 hours until work ends) essentially something to the effect of:
S:
 'We need to get this done ASAP, I'll be on all weekend working. I'll talk to you tomorrow (Saturday)'. With both zero notice, no mention of mandatory overtime, and the fact that we had plans.

DH said ""sorry I have commitments outside of work this weekend"".

 S: ""family comes first, no worries"" and that was that.

Fast forward to today, Project Manager (PM) messages DH saying ""Hey DH make sure you're supporting the team. We were working this weekend and you weren't there.""

DH: ""I spoke with Supervisor Friday"" and sent a screen cap of their conversation

PM: ""I understand. As long as you are aligned I am fine. But sometimes that extra work is needed to meet the deadlines.""

Important to note, Supervisor and PM are related to the project only. Organization wise, they are not his actual managers.

Is it unreasonable to be saying no to OT? He was given like 3 business hours notice to work an entire weekend, with no prior discussion about it, never having worked OT for this company before (been there for two ish years now). It's hard to feel like you can stand your ground when a higher up is being so gross about the situation.

I personally very strongly believe in a good work life balance and I push my husband to maintain boundaries with work so neither of us end up working ridiculous hours.

Also maybe important note? This is in the USA but PM and most of the team is from/works in India and the work cultures appear to be very different.

This end here is more of a rant but I'm just fucking exhausted with working. We've only been out of college for like four years working in industry but god damn office politics fucking suck. I'm so tired of all this already. How do I not work for the rest of my life???"

I recently was awarded my new payletter for the year and there was some highlights but when I compared to my last year payletter (because the new one does not compare with old one), I realized my raise was only a half percentage point. I work in an industry where what your compagny defines as Compensation is your Base Take Home Cash pay, your profit sharing bonus and your equity grant. Now all three work off your base take home as a base meaning that your profit sharing will X% of your base take home as well as your equity grant. My company had a rough year in 2023 and had to implement a paycut and benefit cut which effectively ended up being a 5-8% impact, survived the various layoffs and got some enhanced bonus during the year based off performance which are were peanuts due to being tied to profit sharing which was basically none.   


During this exact same year the company adjusted the job definition and compensation for next year. I was unfortunately told I would move to a different classification and that it would be good for my career, not like I could do anything against it since it was not up to me but my manager. Fast Forward to now and my equity portion due to the classification change declined nearly 3/4 and even though my boss gave me an above average raise, above average profit sharing and nearly twice the amount my new target for equity, it still ended up being basically flat total comp. I know he knows this is really bad and he wants to fix it, not sure how other than reclassifying me but it means I effectively will miss an entire year in the difference. With the cuts in 2023 (and no raises) and this, I felt being an achiever means nothing in the face of Corporate plans.  


They have normalize this so much for folks now, that I am unsure anyone feels empowered to achieve."

(I work for county goverment.) Then, when the PH emergency declaration was lifted, they ordered us all back to the office full-time, effective immediately. No advance notice whatsoever. Just an email telling his to start reporting to the office.(A lot of folks just quit because you can't arrange stuff like child care on a minute's notice.) 

The reasoning from upper management was that because we didn't have an official telework policy, no teleworking at of any kind was allowed. (Mind you, for decades prior to COVID, telework was allowed on as requested  basis as long as feasible.) Cue a nearly 6month long battle between the union reps, HR, and upper management to agree on a policy. (Apparently our county administration is just adamantly opposed to telework.)

Y'all. The final policy allowed for two days per week (Monday or Friday but both) and included a request form to be filled out by all employees wishing to work remotely. This form not only requires us to state which specific room in our homes we'd be working in, but the find print also stipulated that county could make unannounced house calls/inspections to verify the agreed arrangement. I'm pretty sure it's legal, but legal or not - it just feels hella invasive. Like someone from the county could just show up at my door and inspect my home."

-I showed up 2 min late for a few days and they acted like I was dragging things behind or something

-I did all my projects well, did more than I was asked, and completed everything, yet I showed up a few minutes late the last week and they came in my office to have a one-on-one and said they were “concerned about me” because I “seemed distant in meetings” or (here’s my favorite part) “Asked a lot of questions, some that had already been answered sometimes” 

I think the craziest thing to me was personally texting me if it just turned 8:30 and I wasn’t sitting in my chair. Like relax I didn’t die."

I’ve also had good managers that are encouraging and supportive. Which one would motivate you more?

The past two interviews I’ve had I was told they wouldn’t hire a woman because they’re too sensitive. Well, guess what? I’m sensitive as well. I’m also very detail oriented and loyal when treated well. If I’m not, I’ll walk out the door as I did last February. 

I assume with the unemployment rate so low that employers believe they can be picky and say whatever they want. 

I’m also in a very conservative area and state so the patriarchy is strong here. They can get away with a lot. 

You can read my comment history to see there’s more about my story, including depression and abuse while working for my father. Some of my choices have been my own, but I’ve also had a lot of bad luck. 

Be careful out there ladies of the workforce. Well, anyone. No one should tolerate abuse."

My job (I work in the nonprofit sector and drive a lot to meet clients or take them places) recently changed our mileage reimbursement from the federal rate to the ""nonprofit"" rate. We're talking like a 85% difference. It just dawned on me that I've missed out on ~$300 worth of reimbursement due to this change. 

I know other coworkers aren't happy with it either. I'm also considering no longer driving clients around or assisting admin staff with errand running. 

Would I be out of line for refusing to drive clients? How can I air my grievance in an email?"

This screen went viral alongside polish leftists lastly. The original text is from some ""Research"" institue from one of polish banks.  
Translation (loosely, sorry for my bad english):

""Let us assume that switching to 4-dat work week is possible.

What are you afraid of the most?

1. That you couldn't do all the work that was splited earlier for 5 days?  

2. That additional free from work day equals need for more money for extra spending for for example entertainment and recreation?  

3. That this free time will be hard to manage and you will be frustated because of time loss. To put it another way - boredom.  

4. That it will be no possibility to get in tune with your family, because the rest of family will have standard work week.  
""  


As I've said top cringey non-sense arguments - the capitalist just giving you a favor for putting you into labour and ofc there is no other way to spend a day than just increasing capitalist consumption .

14,2024-02-05,HR took away my sick time,u/RenValdivia,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ajtojv/hr_took_away_my_sick_time/,antiwork,"Hi I wanted opinions on this because it seems like I just got screwed over.

I was told by my supervisor that when the Year begins (Jan 1st) all of my sick hours reset. So I planned accordingly and used them when I got sick this month as well as for an emergency important doctors appointment. I could not request PTO because I am still under the 3 month new hire period. 

So I requested the sick time 3 weeks before the appointment. And to my surprise, I am getting denied that sick time AFTER the pay period ended and will take a smaller check this week. EVEN THOUGH, I was never notified of this change of the policy. It is not even written in the employee handbook.

I also now have a balance of negative sick hours, no idea what that means.

What IS written though is a paragraph that states “We, the company, reserve all the right to change, amend, alter policies or anything written in the employee handbook” (not verbatim)

Basically, they made an error and instead of honoring my hours they are hiding behind this one sentence in the handbook and screwed over not just me but other people in my department who used their sick time.

Is this normal? This is my first company with an HR department."

13,2024-02-05,"Got promoted without any contract or pay change, company now says they won't be paying me for the work that was being done or not even when my contract does change.",u/ironicpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ajufic/got_promoted_without_any_contract_or_pay_change/,antiwork,"So I started a new office admin/pa job 9-10 months ago; given certain confidentiality reasons I would rather not say the industry.   
It was all going so great and I was going above and beyond with the job. I don't want to brag exactly but I was fixing problems before anyone else had to even think about them. I became the point of contact for pretty much all staff members for all questions. Eventually I had a meeting with the office manager and the company manager wherein we discussed me getting a promotion. The promotion was set up that I would begin training and we would review salary and contracts after we find a replacement for my current position. This first conversation was about 5 months ago. Weeks and weeks went past and there were a couple interviews but for one reason or another they didn't work out. Management saw that I was getting bored with my current position so started giving me extra responsibilities here and there. From a meeting I had with them yesterday, they had said ""we saw you were eager so wanted to keep giving you breadcrumbs to keep you eager"" so from their own admittance they were leading me on this whole time. 

Fast forward some more and for the past month and a half I have effectively been in the new position. Because management didn't want to introduce me to our clients as their point of contact yet, I have been doing the position in full just signing off all emails with a different name. When calls come through I would have to awkward go ""hmm yeah that person isn't available now, but maybe I can help you"" because they were asking to speak with the person doing all this work for them and sending these emails which was signed off as someone else but all done by me. 

Anyway, so I'm working entirely in this new position for close to two months, entirely independantly. I sit in my office doing all the work, asking for help when needed, but will otherwise be unmonitered and tackling the entire workload. I have been getting agitated with the situation and managements condendending attitudes so yesterday I had another meeting with both of them where I said that I need a set timeline and appropriate renumeration. They kept going in circles about how they need a replacement before I can move forward; I rebutted saying that would be fine if it was the case but instead I've moved forward without my replacement first. I said that that part is on them and no matter how unconventional it is, this is the situation we're in. I pulled out a signed agreement that said once I was available for that department full time I would recieve new documentation with contracts and salary and they said that technically I'm not full time in the position. 

What do you mean by that my dude. 

They started listing off every single task and responsibility that's part of the job asking if I know how to do it and I kept saying yes yes yes. I know and I can. But then they would turn it around and say ""just because you've been shown how to do it once or twice doesn't mean you actually can do it. And if you do remember the steps to do it yourself that doesn't mean you actually understand exactly what you're doing and why"" at one point they said point blank ""well do you think you are ready for this position?"" and I said that if I say no that's proving every side remark they're making but if I say yes they'll shut it down and say I'm being overzealous so there's no right way to answer it. Eventually we got back to my pay and I said that I should be backpaid for the weeks of full time work I've been doing in the position, they said no. I said that once there is a replacement can we finally review my pay, they said no. They said no because then *technically* would be when my formal training begins and so why should they pay me extra for me sitting back and learning to do a job I'm not doing yet. **NEVER MIND THE FACT I HAVE LITERALLY BEEN DOING IT FOR MONTHS??!**

They also mentioned that training for the last person took a whole year took a full year so the fact that we are rushing into things is unconventional. Even though it's working out? But then they also said at one point that it's silly to introduce myself as the point of contact for our client this early so we should at least wait until I have 12 months under my belt so that it comes off with a better image.   
So admittance that they have been lying and leading me on for MONTHS with no renumeration or thanks and that IF anything happens it still won't be for another lot of months, as opposed to what they initially promised and signed. Fuck these guys.

In the I said that I'm going to the absolute bare bones of my actual contracted job and not going to be giving a single ounce of effort for anything other than that. This went in circles and they even asked if that's what I actually want and if I'm comfortable going back but I told them that there's no point in doing anything else and nothing else is happening to what's the point. 

&#x200B;

Needless to say my Seek profile has been polished to perfection, I actually have an interview in a few days. An interview where I would only be on a 3 days a week contract but still be getting paid so much more then what I am now, this place has suddenly become a huge joke. I just don't care anymore and don't know what to do. Just frusturated all around and don't know how to feel.

&#x200B;

TLDR: employer lied to me about promotion, I moved to the new position without any pay and they're so belittiling and digging their heels in not to pay more or change contract. Feel stuck. "

He says he ""does not accept"" that resignation or the resignation letter I gave last week. I'm in NY, an At-Will state. There's even an At-Will clause in my contract. He says he's going to sue me. Does he have a leg to stand on legally? I have record of submission of both notices.

A lot of times when there’s a problem, Im the go to person to ask for advice on how to fix it, despite me not being IT, Tech Support or Engineer.  

When there’s new people, I get set up to help the on-rolling process and in some cases, their training, despite not being a production trainer or supervisor. 

I integrated a document system that made it easier to keep track of production and record keeping.

I improved a system that reduced the cost of materials by 33%, when they where scrambling and panicking cause the material used on the machine where on back-up order/on-hold for like 3 months, and thanks to my improvement they managed to hold on.

But despite all of these, they said “I haven’t done anything significant that would justify a raise”.

And I know what all you are thinking…. Why don’t I just quit?

Well I can’t quit this job until I find another one..  and I can’t quit right now since I just got hit with a $3,000 medical bill (after insurance) from my yearly test on my ongoing condition.

Not only that medical its going to drain me financially, I also got hit with a plumbing bill since a pipe burst at my home and that another financial burden I got to deal with.

And well reasons like this are why people don’t want to work…. Your hard efforts / work are never rewarded.  I’m just so stressed and depressed with all of this, and for them to suggest this its just a plain insult to me and shows how delusional the people in management positions are."

We don’t get a ton of PTO, and it’s the type that doesn’t differentiate between sick time or just plain time off. 

I get that as a manager it can be frustrating when someone calls out or leaves early on short notice, but I also think it’s my right as an employee and it’s part of the purpose of PTO to begin with.

I make an hourly wage $13.48/hr and commission on top for items sold and delivered. My company is based out of Maryland and I WFH in New Jersey.  


At the start of the new year I know MD minimum wage was raised to $15.00. I brought this up to my manager who brought it to her boss. I then got a teams call with my manager and the boss. Boss explained that since the company did not do well last year nobody is getting raises(Never asked for a raise). Due to this they will be adding $132 to my hourly paycheck, but then deducting the same amount from my commission paycheck. I then am told that I should be receiving a letter from HR regarding this.   


Below is the contents of the HR letter:  
\--------------------------------------------------------  
*As you may be aware, your state’s minimum wage recently increased. In order to ensure you are*  
*receiving minimum wage with every pay, effective with next week’s pay, pay date January 12,*  
*2024, on the pay dates that you are not scheduled to receive your earned commission pay, you*  
*will receive an additional flat rate of $132, otherwise known as a draw against your commission.*  
*The “draw” will be deducted from your earned commission pay on the next pay date in which you*  
*are scheduled to receive it.*  
*Below is a summary of the $132 flat rate that you will receive:*  
*New Jersey wage is now $15.13/hour*  
*Your base hourly rate is $13.48/hour*  
*The difference is $1.65. $1.65 times 80 hours (40 hours/week) = $132*  
\--------------------------------------------------------  
Not sure what to do here. HR is talking from a position that they have to follow NJ minimum wage, but I believe they have to follow the MD minimum wage since they are based in MD. If this is the case, I have been working under minimum wage for all of 2023. To make matters even worse my pay stub haven't even shown the extra $132. How do I respond? I'm afraid that if this goes to a labor board and they got audited the whole company may shut down. "

7,2024-02-05,Since I Left my Job,u/MediocreGenius69,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ajyfp1/since_i_left_my_job/,antiwork,"OK, so, like most of you probably, I am not against work as such but against many of the working conditions that seem to prevail nowadays. I actually love working but, that said, I quit my job in December because the company environment was doing my head in. These guys wouldn't let me work from home at all and there was no privacy in the office at all. My boss was sitting like 1.5 metres from me all day, and I could see his head right in the corner of my eye, plus it was 9-6 and their was basically no natural light. It was wild and it sucked but I have already done about 50 posts on that.

&#x200B;

Anyway, since I quit and started doing freelance work at home I have noticed a few things about my thinking and my headspace, etc. I feel way more relaxed and not constantly looking at the time. Just not having content time pressure and a rigid structure means I am sleeping properly (7-10 hours a night instead of 5-7) and the sleep is high quality. I feel more mellow, have better concentration, and don't get angry anywhere near as quickly.

&#x200B;

I feel like being in an office and using all those Excel/Word/PowerPoint things that corporate losers love forcing you to look at was actually dementing me into an uptight chaircrow (that's a word I just made up that is similar to scarecrow but describes someone who is made to be in the same f\*cking chair all day without being allowed to wander around, just for the sake of appearances).

&#x200B;

Just the entire structure of my consciousness is less stressful to exist inside now. Everyone tells me I look relaxed and happy . The sad thing is that I LIKE WORKING. I would have been cool with even going to an office if the office had maybe been less bright and had privacy and we were allowed to walk about outside or maybe do Flexi-time or any of that shit. Just some small concession might have kept me there, but NO. They wouldn't budge a single inch so I had to leave. I did ten years in that dump and it feels like I just get let out of Guantanamo Bay. I'm not even being all that dramatic.

&#x200B;

All these companies that force people to endure shitty working conditions would make MORE MONEY if they relented slightly in their ardent quest to make everything as miserable as possible. They would INCREASE productivity if they treated people like human beings instead of computer cattle. I thought the entire point of a company in a capitalist economic system was to generate as much profit as possible but I suppose pissing employees off is more important to our overlords for some reason and that's why we have to work in a strip lit, stuffy, airless giant dumpster with constant, irritating ambient machine noises and other people yawning, sneezing, chewing and coughing all day long.

It's the carbohydrates in the food: Grain, bread, rice, pasta.

It's cheap, it's filling, and it's mass-produced. Poor people eat lots of it.

It causes their blood sugar to rise. 

There's sugar in everything. A can of coke has 40g of sugar. 

Then there's high-fructose corn syrup. It's cheaper sugar, made from corn. 

Carbs and sugar causes blood sugar to rise.

Then you become pre-diabetic. Then you develop diabetes.

Unless you take insulin to lower blood sugar, you will die.

The price of insulin costs over $400 in America. It costs less than $1 to produce.

The pharmaceutical companies are obscenely rich and corrupt. They bleed you for your money.

You cannot afford insulin, so you die of diabetes, after your kidneys fail, and you're on dialysis.

You owe the doctors and hospitals thousands of dollars.

Do you have insurance? Can you afford insurance? Does your work provide insurance? 

You do you qualify for Medicare or Medicaid?

No, you're poor. 

And now you are even poorer, because you owe thousands of dollars of medical debt.

Then you must resort to take out loans with high interest rates to repay your medical debt.

*This* is the modern-day slavery in Capitalist America. 

You're a *wage-slave* to pay off your debts to your owners. Or whoever you owe money to.

The Capitalists are the new Ruling Class in the U.S.A.

We do not believe in Monarchies.

But Politics does not truly matter. It's a mere diversion. A debate; arguments to distract from the REAL problems.

It's not Democrats vs. Republicans.

It's the Class divide:

The Wealthy vs. The Poor.

It has always been this way."

I was hired through an employment company that worked with the attorney in getting employees. I interviewed directly with the attorney who told me they were looking for somebody to stay with them for a long time. Eventually they extended a job offer and I accepted. 

My first week there, everything is just fine. They set me up with an email. They set up my desk. They begin giving me tasks to do, all of which I do in a timely manner. I get along with everybody since there’s only 3 people there and it seems great. 

Today was the beginning of my second week and as I leave my job I get a phone call from the employment office informing me that the attorney wanted to let go of the employees he hired because “there isn’t enough work” for me to do. 

I understand that companies are liars and will do anything for themselves and not care about their employees, but it seems very suspicious to me. The attorney kept insisting he wanted to grow his business, we have gotten numerous calls from potential clients this last week, I’ve been told I’m doing a good job, only to be let go of today. 

I just don’t understand why a company would act so odd and throw up all these lies for no reason. Why not be upfront and say that job is extremely temporary? 

And to be completely honest, the tasks they gave me were not difficult. I was able to complete them relatively quickly. So I don’t believe that they hired somebody for a week just to get 4-5 measly tasks done."

I gave manager the note  (manager is also HR for some reason with 0 training) and now they want a meeting to discuss if there’s anyway to provide modifications to keep me in office 5 days a week 
Please note I have things to keep me busy and be productive while at home, I do this when I have appointments now and it’s a non issue relating to work performance. 

Anyway I dont know what to say in this meeting honestly. I dont want to say too much and get accused of being rude or give them more ammunition to hold against me, there’s really no other work modifications that can be realistically done to help with this issue either.

I got laid off from the contract when the contract ended. I was living in a small town no work to be found. Moved family lock, stock and barrell back to the city. . Needless to say, the move was not cheap so I needed to make this job work. 

On the role, I have entered hell on earth on  Earth.  The boss utilized belittlement. Made seasoned nurses cry, filled me with anxiety, realized fear as a supervising mechanism. This was her first go round in a managerial role. And of course there’s more angst and anxiety to the story, but for time here’s the condensed version. 

Caused physical symptoms because of the anxiety. I didn’t make it my full 90 days. I ended up walking out on the job that day. She asked for a letter of resignation I provided it.

I begin to claim unemployment. Instantly denied because I quit. The week before I would’ve immediately gotten my unemployment, I received a letter from the UI department, saying I was dissatisfied with my job was not a sufficient reason to leave my job. In my letters and documentation to UI never did I claim I was dissatisfied with my job. As if I was distsatisfied with a meal I got at a restaurant something to that effect.

I filed an appeal on the UI decision. Now, I have to cote my case with a UI Administrative Law Judge.  And I know the odds are in the favor of the employer.

I'm 35 years old and have bounced from shitty job to shitty job since I was a teen. I have a very fun combo of bipolar disorder and adhd, which means that stimulants, the things I need in order to do any job properly, make me crazy. This is why I have a useless degree (BA in communication) and a low GPA. 
I typically get jobs that do mass hiring. My current job is a claim handler position at an insurance company with high turnover. The workload is insane, and there are literally thousands of rules and regulations that could apply to any one claim. 
My manager has recently threatened to put me on a PIP because I'm understandably not doing well. 

I need a new job, asap, but I'm stuck. I don't have the resources to go back to school. I've done customer service for a long time and been cussed out, sexually harassed and threatened due to low numbers of sales. I also am a small woman (5'0"") with a bad shoulder, so trades are not for me. 

I'm honestly just wondering, if you do nothing all day, please tell me 1. What you do, 2. How you got the job, and 3. What the environment is like? For instance, if you got a do-nothing job in the middle of nowhere, in small town with 3000 people, (and your family hooked you up) that's going to be a lot different than me. I live in a huge city with no family nearby.  If you have a job that requires 2 hours of work and you didn't need nepotism to get it, I'm interested. 

Tl:dnr- if you do nothing (meaning not slammed with work all day) and want to help others, please let me know."

The thing is, when I'm the only one on register, I'm often waiting 5-10 minutes for the next person to come take over in the middle of the day. What gets me is this ""crack down"" only applies to the opening cashiers. 

What I want to do is clock out directly at the time I'm scheduled to clock out. But I'm scared of the back lash. I also cannot leave the keys unattended, so I'd have to hand them to my boss.

When I got the job, it was 25 minutes from my house. The business relocated, and I, stupidly, went with. My job is now an hour commute one way. I’ve put in almost 4 years here, and haven’t had a raise in about 18 months. Boss is a complete narcissist with no business owning a business, & we are hemorrhaging money. Honestly, I don’t even know how doors are open. They take vacations and write them off as “business expenses” but I get screamed at if I take more than 2 days off at a time. 
Every day, it seems as though I accumulate at least 3 new tasks that are my duty to maintain. Any time I have brought up being stressed, my boss tells me to “delegate” more. When I delegate, I’m criticized for not being able to handle it. I’m then punished by being what I call “iced out”. (She ignores me and refuses to help with anything whatsoever)
A month ago I was forced to work in a horrible storm, and ended up totaling my car in the snow. Almost all of my savings went just to buying a new car.  I have virtually nothing at this point. And now, my insurance is going up 🥲 Between all my monthly bills at this point, I won’t be saving hardly anything.  I have so much resentment going in to work that I can’t even properly get my tasks done because being there just makes me want to puke from anxiety. I cry my whole drive there because I absolutely dread the fact that I know I’m going to be screamed at, and picked apart for 8 hours. I could write a book about all of the insane things I’ve been put through. 
I’ve been looking and applying to just about any place that’s on indeed with no luck at all. So many people are complaining of that in my area, so I’m assured knowing it’s not just me. I just feel so trapped. I need the money after putting my savings into this car. The 2 hours daily drive is taking a toll on me. And really, I feel like I just wasted all of my 20s in this nightmare.

In 2021 I realized i wouldn't be fulfilled or happy working the majority of jobs, so i researched jobs where I'd have the ability to sit down and work on my business for the majority of my shifts, the two jobs i was getting recommended most consistently was overnight security jobs at a site that only needs u for assurance purposes,  that was the main one, and in second place was night auditor at a hotel. Last year i graduated from a trade school as a certified protection officer, so i have a nationwide CPO certificate, i have my FEMA, OSHA, I'm CPR certified, and i have a resume tailored toward security gigs that they helped me make. The only thing I'm missing from my knowledge as far as being able to get the kind of gig i want in any state is, i know in some states u need a state specific security license, like in Florida and Georgia u need to either have a G or D license to get a lot of security jobs, and the other thing u need sometimes is a drivers license for that specific state, that's how u secure them jobs where u can just sit in the security vehicle all night. i have a Georgia driver license currently.  


As far my location situation. I'm currently in the sticks in Vermont, and i have an employee living situation so i don't have to pay many bills. If it wasn't for that i'd struggle like shit here cause it's mad expensive! a vehicle, and a lot of basic shit like that, that's important to most ppl, does not feel affordable even with my situation.   


I came here from my trade school in Brunswick Georgia, and b4 that i was staying wit my folks in the subrubs of Jacksonville FL, my parents was in the burbs tho so i was stuck there wit no way to the city where all the jobs was at, and i needed to be 21 to secure the jobs like i'm describing around my school   


I'm okay to have roomates and shi, and just like rent a room, as long as i can use the appliances in the crib and the roomates or landlord chill. Like rn i got a room to myself, share the unit with two brothers, the be out in the living room, we share the bathroom and the kitchen, the chill asf, we get along well.  


Also, i know not everyone believes in or is familiar with MBTI,  but my personality type is ENFP, it is unrealistic for us to be able to manage are money like normal ppl can. So any job or service or recommendations for help relocating would be great, i can stress abt that more and find loopholes for that once i know where to go, but i wanted to put that out there since it's definitely a concern  


a few things to mention. So my priority as far as where i move is to be able to secure  a chill Overnight security jobs, or another chill overnight job because i'm a night owl, i have so much more energy at night, night jobs usually require way less of u, and i need to be spending my time doing my personal work on the job.   
That's number one priority, however there are a few other things I'd like to mention that'll definitly have an effect on my quality of life and wellbering that would be appreciated if i'm recommended a place that is overall most compatible with me  


\- accessibility to city shit, ppl, and lit shit (i'm and extrovert so this would be nice, i can do without it, my girl wanna go where i go, and ima be very busy and social online, but i thrive when i can talk to ppl, hence why i'm talking abt this shit on reddit, i've been doing my own research on this shit like crazy but there's hella ppl all across the country that have way more knowledge and experience then me, and i'm not an isolated, thrive by being extremely logical kinda person, i get better results when socializing, expressing my needs relating and connecting with others and that's how i get by and enjoy the journey toward my future!)  


\- Has cool ppl/cool community   


\- Cost of car related shit (Like bro, i wanted to move to Denver cause it's just like my vibe, but it's stupid expensive shit their, like u gotta pay more for car expenses cause there roads are smoother, that makes sense, but i don't give a fuck, i drive to safe to be paying extra for smooth rose, that's not a priority, lol.  


\- places to get tatts and buy clothes (as part of my personal career, i need to be investing a lot in my aesthetic, i'm in the entertainment industry, so it'd be nice to have locations near where i move that'll help me do this)  


\- I have a skin condition where humidity/combination of heat and moisture make me itch uncontrollably so somewhere, where it's not humid would be appreciated, i can still get by if my job allows me to sit in AC, or i can buy a cooling vest for when i need to be outside, but like i said, it'd be appreciated if the weather was dry or not humid, i don't do great with cold weather either, warm weather with low to no humidity seems like where i feel best.   


A note. DO NOT REPLY TO THIS telling me to man and work hard, or just anything that's basically treating me like i'm living life wrong, i know myself, i know my limits, my personality type, i know what i need, i'm just trying to figure out how ima get it, so if u can give me advice, input, point me in the right direction, that'd mean the world to me. But please don't try to change me. Thank you (:

Due to this I had to use some of my tax money (I used to be self employed) in order to pay my bills (I was desperately trying not to move back in with my toxic family). 

I had to move back in with my parents and I have to pay them $50 a month plus the internet bill and my phone bill. I was jobless for a bit due to everyone not hiring despite having signs saying that they are hiring. I applied to Burger King and they gave me the job after an interview, I told them that I can start next week for day shift hours. She then tells me on text that suddenly everyone asked her for day hours and that she can’t promise me many hours, okay that’s whatever I’ll take what I can get.

2 weeks pass by, silence. I text multiple times and I don’t get a response. I call her (the district manager) and it goes straight to voicemail (indicating that I was blocked) so to make sure I did the *67 method to check if I was blocked, the phone rang and she picked up.

This means that she DID in fact block my number.

I asked her if I was fired and she said that I wasn’t and that she just couldn’t give me the hours and yet she blocked my number.

1,2024-02-06,Why I'm not working very hard to fill open positions,u/middleupperdog,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ak3z0z/why_im_not_working_very_hard_to_fill_open/,antiwork,"I saw some videos and posts talking about how it feels hard to get a job even though companies have lots of job openings right now and I wanted to give a perspective from being on the other side of it.

Credibility statement: I'm now in a position where I do job interviews; I'm the person that actually can tell if a person would know what they are doing or not, and I report directly to the company CEO although I'm not in the C-suite.  When the CEO hires someone directly by bypassing me, it has not worked out, while the people that I approve have been very successful.  We have national competitions and the people I hire and am in charge of win regularly.  

Basically my company is explosively successful but still having difficulty expanding due to market headwinds, most other companies shrank from 2020-2023 in our industry and we basically ate their lunch.  But now the market is coming back and the owners/managers have a problem.  When the market is down and lots of people are trying to get a job, its easier to hire people on a lower salary.  But between inflation and a competitor rebound, the wage expectation is going up.  

From the owner's perspective, they want to avoid wage expectation growth, not just wage growth.  Say person A and person B are both in sales.  A is a sales leader and beating the market, handling a larger number of customers and is a stand out rockstar performer that will probably move up in the company over time.  B is doing about as well as any other competent sales person but doesn't stand out.  If you give a raise to person A, person B would want to know why they can't get the same wage increase.  Now here's the part that is behind-the-curtain: its a lose-lose situation for the owner.  If you show person B the stats show they aren't that special or good, B realizes their potential within the company is much lower over the long term and they are incentivized to leave the company and find another place to work where they have that hope for moving up in the future.  Otherwise you end up overpaying for person B relative to what they bring into the company, and it would make sense to just hire a new sales person with equivalent sales but at the lower salary.  So the owner sees it as lose-lose and thinks thats why people should just not discuss salaries, because they feel like they can't pay relative to results otherwise.

However, it usually doesn't work out this way.  Even when you show the owner the numbers of your sales and your work and that it makes sense to give you higher pay, the owner balks.  They tell themselves its lose-lose, that they can find another rockstar like person A since they found A once already, and that you might stick around anyways.  All these informal self-delusions convince them to not even give the rockstars corresponding pay.  Most companies exist in this grey area between formally tracking the data and making rational compensation decisions and keeping things more informal and vibes-instincts based.  The former is generally better for A-types and the latter is better for B-types.  No one wants to feel like they are underperforming relative to their peers or not that special in general, and not measuring the data protects us from that.  The owner then oscillates self-servingly, talking about data to person-B but then making the less formal arguments to person-A, so that way overall they can avoid wage growth in general.

So then we get to hiring.  Person A can go to a new company and present them the data and show that they deserve higher pay and get it, because hiring a rockstar at higher pay doesn't have the same effect on internal employee culture unless they share their pay, which most new hires won't do out of fear about not wanting to mess up a good thing.  Person B also can go to a new company to catch the rising tide of regular wage growth on COLAs and get the hope of future progression they may not have at their old company.  An owner sees it as stealing a rockstar from a competitor or just hiring a normal employee at a normal wage to recruit either group, and that's why you can get pay increases easier through getting a new job than through raises at your workplace.

But there is a problem.  Above person A and person B is a manager.  The manager assumedly is getting paid more than person A and person B, but the same resistance to raises applies to them too.  As their wage gets sticky and doesn't go up, you can't expect them to raise their wage expectations for the people underneath them.  A manager would be pissed if the new subordinate is making as much as them, let alone more.  So the expectation for new starting wages gets weighed down: the manager's stuck wage acts as a cap on how much the employee underneath them can get.  

That's what I think the majority of people experience when they go through the hiring process, the expected wage is X, but then they end up with an offer for less than X late in the game.  Basically picture wage expectation as a pressure at the bottom of the pyramid and willingness-to-pay as something lifting the top of the pyramid and stretching it above the bottom.  That stretch starts with the CEO allowing pay increases for people near the top of the company (like me) where literally a whole branch, maybe more aptly a limb of the company would collapse if they walked.  Then, because their pay is higher, the pay that can be approved for the people beneath them goes up as well while preserving the status distribution.  Then those middle managers can higher people at higher wages because their status is preserved.  When your expected wage suddenly gets pushed down late in the hiring process, what's happening is that some middle manager above your position's wage would be too close to your wage, so it upsets the status system and they are unwilling to raise wages for you.

So then you get situations where the market has moved to where to hire a new person (you don't know if they are A or B usually until they prove themselves) the starting wage is too close to or maybe even above the manager's they would report to.  So the job is offered at a lower wage based on the old, stuck pay structure.  This persists until the system unsticks itself by radical correction, either by having a series of wage increases down the levels of the company, or by the stuck middle of the pyramid all churning out for new people and the owner concedes to the market's push for higher wages to refill the branch.  Right now I have multiple job positions open where I know the salary offer is too low, but when I showed this with data to the owner he just wants to hold out for someone to take the lower salary.  Eventually, I and the other manager below me will leave, he'll have to restaff the branch and then he'll concede to a big step in the salary bracket to get back in line with the market.  

But then while I'm here, why would I bother aggressively trying to fill the positions when I know that we can't at the stuck wage rates?  We were explosively successful during a few years but that doesn't mean we don't need to change with the market.  I think a lot of companies find themselves in that position: where they aren't allowed to raise wages within the company to match the market and as a result the whole market becomes structured around churn and career people having to leave and go somewhere new to escape sclerosis self-imposed by owners that don't want to adapt to the times.  For them they are already making money hand over fist, there's no cost to servicing their own delusions, and once there is a real cost they adapt.  

This is a weird problem for capitalism: the owner class is already so successful they **aren't** incentivized to make more money.  They don't really need to, and the feeling that they can beat the market is more valuable to them and their sense of status than just doing what the market says.  I've worked my way up from the bottom quintile all through my 20's to now spending most of my time around rich people (although I'm not rich myself, my end of the year pay is still 5-figures) and its been really illuminating to how they just live in a different world from the rest of us and they indulge in decadence; detachment from reality that increases their own pride.  

**TL:DR;** to raise the wage of the lowest level workers, you often need to raise the wages of the people above those workers first and most companies don't want to.  That's why the internal career track is fubar."

How would you all feel if you were sent something like this? I’ve considered it, but I keep feeling “agh” about it. The pay is good, but the whole point of entrepreneurship was for me to have more freedom and explore creative ventures. I’m not rich yet, but sometime soon I know it’ll happen."

Pick up a component. Put it in. Repeat.

The floor has a crew of seven. Conny, the operator. John, the all-in-all. Four assembly workers: me, Carl, Peter, and Ron. And the storage chief, Dimitri.

Then there’s Alice.

She works in the office, deciding what we produce and in what quantities.

She works closely with the manager. Sleazy bastard, the way he looks at her. He’s never done an honest day’s work in his life. He doesn’t go on the floor — afraid to get his hands dirty.

Those half knots are all the same.

“More coffee?” says Alice.

“Oh. Yes, please.”

The dimly lit coffee room. Two ancient microwaves, a sink, and some tables. Few places on Earth, except the factory floor, were less inspirational.

“Remind me, when will you get me out of here?” She sits down by the table and hangs her purse on the backrest. Its red color cuts through the beige and grey.

“I’m working on it, honey.” I take a sip. “What’s up on your end?”

“I think tomorrow will be a change of priorities. Got a big order coming in.”

“What does the suit say?”

“Nothing yet, but he’s predictable enough. You’re not fair to him, you know. He’s not as bad as you think.”

“Maybe. Maybe not. Just don’t let him get too close.”

--------------------

The next day, Alice’s prediction comes true. She gathers the crew and shares the news and the new directives.

Conny recalibrates the machines, Dimitri takes out the circuit boards and components, and we, the assemblers, prep the tables. We could do it blindfolded.

I grab a box and walk toward the assembly line. Suddenly, the lights turn off, and I drop the box. The lights come back on, and thousands of components are on the floor.

I sigh.

John comes over to help. “You all right, Robbie?”

“Yeah, I’m fine.” I crouch down and start picking. “You know what I think? I think I died long ago, and this place is my eternal punishment.” 
  
He chuckles. “I’m the one being punished. And you’re not exactly helping.”  
  
I smile. Sarcasm — the bread and butter of the crew.

--------------------

Later that night, I work on the project. I usually cut the sleeping hours short, crashing at the factory.

The new machine is almost ready. Conny will help me test it — and then we’ll create a patent. I can almost taste the freedom.

Unfortunately, I can only push so many nights in a row. Eventually, there’s no output. The brain has to rest.

--------------------

“Any progress?” asks Alice, pouring a cup.  
  
“We’re testing it on Monday. If all goes well, we’re in business.” I take a sip. The coffee is more sour than usual.  
  
“You’ve said that before, honey. I’m keeping my hopes low.”

I pour the coffee into the sink. “Well, tenth time’s the charm,” I grin. “You know, I’m gonna march straight into his office. He’ll never see it comin’. How much I wanna see the look on his face.”  
  
“Fingers crossed,” she takes my hand and smiles. “Just so you know — I believe in you, and I’m with you no matter what.”

--------------------

Tuesday morning. I’ve spent the night in the factory again.

But was it worth it! The tests were successful. Even Conny was impressed, which itself is impressive. Freedom, here we come.

*I’ll get you out, Alice*. I pinch my arm. *For real, this time*.

I survive until lunch break and enter the coffee room. Conny gives a discrete smile and raises his cup from the corner table. 

I look around, but she isn’t there.

“Anyone seen Alice today?”  
  
“No, sorry,” says Carl.  
  
“I’ve been in and out of the office all day — haven’t seen her,” says John. “Maybe she’s sick?”  
  
“All right, thanks.” *The bastard should know*.

I walk through the floor and enter the door to the office space. Her desk is empty; her monitor and computer off. Otherwise, it looks as usual — sterile, except for our photo frame.

Down the corridor, his door is closed. I walk over and grab the handle. I pause — there’s a voice.

“… tried the usual. Yes, I tried that, but I can’t fix this. I… What? Look, you better send someone to take care of this. If she’s gone for too long… Yes, I know it’s bad, goddammit! You don’t have to… Yeah. Yeah, she’s in the back. Room 404. So, will… Well, she’s heavy, all right! I hid her as best I could! Just get your guys over here.”

*Enough*. I turn the handle and fling the door open. He’s holding a phone.  
  
“You!” he says. “I’m busy, dammit! Haven’t you heard of knocking!”  
  
I clench my fists. “Where’s Alice, Tom?”  
  
“She’s home — she’s sick. Now get out! Whatever you want, it’ll have to wait.” He hangs up the phone and walks around the desk. He gets stuck on something, which falls to the floor.

A red purse.  
  
“You fucking sleazy bastard.” I barge out of the room and pass her desk. *I’m coming, Alice!*  
  
“Robbie, wait! Stop!”

I run out of the office space and across the factory. I tackle the backdoor and run down the white corridor. Footsteps echo, and white lights pass by above.

Room 391, 392, 393…

“No! Stop! No further!” says an echo from behind.

Room 404. I kick the door open.

She lies on the table. Her head and left leg separate from her body.

I stagger backward.

*Alice…*

Tom advances, slowing to a walk in the distance.

“What have you done… I’ll… I’ll kill you… I’ll fucking kill you!”

Tom holds his hands in front of him. “Calm down, Robbie — Alice is fine. Everything will be fine. Just calm down.”

“You lie! You always lie. This place is a hellhole, and you are its steward! And now you’ve killed Alice. You’ll pay for this!”

I charge towards him.

Tom sighs. “Why does it always come to this…” He claps his hands in a peculiar rhythm. His suit instantly changes into an overall, and the corridor goes from white to dirty green.

*What…?* I stagger to a halt and raise my fists. My hands… they’re shiny — as if made from metal.

“What did you…” I stumble backward. Something tugs at the back of my head, tilting it downward. Trembling, I lift my hands. There is something — something protruding from my head. A rod… a solid rod.

“What is this… what did you…”

He sighs. “Take it easy, Robbie. You won’t believe me unless you come with me. Let’s go to a mirror. I’ll lead the way — no tricks.”

I look up. The bright lamps are gone. Instead, a metal beam runs along the ceiling. It has a thick wire attached, running down behind me. I move my head to the side and the wire moves in the same direction.

“What… is that…?”

“Just come with me, Robbie. No one means you any harm.” He turns around and walks back the way he came.

I look at his overall. And the corridor. And my hands.

I follow.

He opens the door to room 399 and goes in. He holds the door open.

I peek inside, left and right. No one except Tom. There’s a mirror on the wall. I look back down the corridor. No one — completely empty.

“Come now, Robbie. The mirror is right here.”

I go inside and walk up to the mirror. I look into it.

A red-eyed metallic monster stares back.

I gasp and throw myself backward, holding an arm in front of me. I stumble and fall. I look again — it’s gone — nowhere to be found.

“Holy… What was that…? That horrible… “

“That — is you.”

“Me… What are you…” I look at Tom and feel the tug at the back of my head. I look up — the beam is still there. I touch the rod and lift my other hand in front of me. It looks like a skeleton, a metal skeleton.

“Me…?”

“Yes, Robbie.”

I get on my feet and approach the mirror. The red eyes stare back. I touch my face, and so does the monster.

“That… is… that is me…?”

“Yes.”

“Who… what… what am I?”

“You are ROBI — Robot Operator for Business and Industry. An android that can handle everything from innovation to industrial production. And I am your overseer.”

“Android…”

“Unfortunately, your level of sophistication requires some psychological trickery. Normally, there aren’t any problems — but every time Alice malfunctions…”

“Alice!” I storm out of the room and down the corridor. Mechanical thudding echoes down the hall.

I kick the door open. She’s no longer there — a metal beast has taken her place. I look under the table and behind the door. I look at the room number — 404. Inside, the beast isn’t moving — its head and leg are detached.

Tom jogs to a halt.

“What have you done with Alice. She was right here, dammit. Where is she!”

“She’s still there, right in front of you.”

“What? No…” My shoulders slump.

“She is ALIC — Autonomous Logistics and Industrial Companion. You two make a good team, but she’s also a necessary psychological component. Especially for innovation.”

“No… No! You lie! I’m… I’m going to get you arrested. I’ll tell everyone!”

I shove him aside and run down the corridor toward the factory. I slam the door open. “HELP! HE…” The floor is empty. Not a single person in sight.

I run through the factory. “HELP! ANYONE!” I jump over conveyors and into the coffee room. “HELP!”

No one.

The coffee machine is gone. And so are the microwaves, the sink, the shelves, and the tables. Only some boxes and some tools lie along the walls and corners.

“What happened… Where is everyone…” I slump down on the floor. “What’s going on…”

Tom walks up from behind.

“Where is everyone…?”

“Robbie… They never existed. There is, and always has been, only you, me, and Alice.”

“Alice… I love you… I…” I wipe my face, but there are no tears. “I… I want to live my life with you… I just… I’ll get you out of here…”

“Robbie. I know this is hard on you — if you’ll just let me… Everything will go back to normal.”

“Back to normal…” I clench my teeth and fists. “I’ll kill you… I’ll fucking kill you!”

I jump on my feet and charge toward him.

Everything turns black.

-------------------------

A microwave dings. Peter takes out his meal, and Ron puts his in and turns the knob.

“Coffee?” she asks.

“Yes, please,” I say. She fills my cup and sits down.

“So, how’d it go? Did it work?”

“It works, Alice. For once, it actually works. And the only thing remaining is the patent.”

“That’s fantastic, Robbie! That’s… Oh, that’s so wonderful.”

“We’re getting out of here, honey — we really are. No more slavery — no more monotony. We’ll be free.”

She walks over and embraces me. “I love you, Robbie.”

“I love you too, Alice. More than you’ll ever know.”"

I have a coworker who is an idiot. Not too sure whether they are malicious about it or if they're just so self centered they genuinely don't know what effect they have on others.

I got online to work from home today (Tuesday) to find that a series of emails were exchanged the day before. Without going into detail, the system my team use to do a lot of our data work is down for maintenance. There is a secondary system we can use that is less accurate, one that dumbass coworker specialises in. The Monday email exchange instructed me to take a number of records from the primary system so they could be compared to the secondary system today... which would mean the whole team has work to do today.

Small issue is that I don't work on Mondays. I pointed this out to management when I started work and found these emails today and was told ro just get on with what I could... which is nothing.

So in summary: I was given a task on a day I don't work to ensure that my whole team had work to do today. Management told us to proceed anyway and now we have to show that we have completed our data processing tasks without data"

Previously I was crashing with people for the better part of two years, bar eight months I was at Polytech.

Not related to her job, but it was obvious to her coworkers that she was suddenly, mentally, very very unwell, and could barely function. They let her leave IN HER CAR and called another family member who was NOT her emergency contact. 
After that person called me, I called my mom who was driving in circles, screaming and crying, lost, on a very familiar highway. I had to call the police to get to her until I got there and ems assessed that her vitals were fine. 

Of course that meant some communication with her job and mine about the situation, which I did. I was out of my job for half a day on Monday to deal with the initial issue, and the full day on Thursday to take my mom to get scans and tests done as she was still completely out of it. I kept my boss updated and each time I only received “ok” as a reply. Not a word about what was going on or if either of us were okay. I knew right then that this situation was NOT going to end well. 

Friday I log on to my meeting with my boss, they are incredibly late (10-15 min plus) as usual. They then log on, don’t ask or say a word about my mom, then read me a termination letter word for word from ChatGPT. (I know because they had literally just asked for the ChatGPT log in.) Great, I don’t have a job now and my mom is losing her mind. 

My mom at this point is not improving in any way (with medical intervention) and her HR rep starts asking when she will be back. They need a solid return date for her to go on temporary disability. The doctor can not give me a return date because my mom is so unwell. She also doesn’t qualify for government disability as it is a mental issue that would require some years of observation before a doctor will say, yes, she is forever disabled and can never work. So mom gets fired as well because I can’t force a doctor to give a return to work date. 

That leaves us to today, my mom will never be the same and I have had to move her into an assisted living facility as she was starting to leave the house at night. I’m an only child so I’m doing everything on my own while trying to job hunt. 

Just your daily reminder that companies do not care about you, regardless of their size. My mom worked at a corporation and I worked for a small business that was supposedly centered around helping people in their time of need.

Also, call your mom, she’s a nice lady who tried her best when things were hard. One day she won’t be there for you to share your day with, complain about work to, or to tell you what ingredient you’re missing from her special recipe."

The short job turned into two days of hard labor, estimated at 9 hours. The wife kept saying “we will make this right” and they are very with pay fair normally.  
Today I was paid and my check was quite a bit less than normal. I fear I was shorted the day my husband and I swapped and my extra hours were missed. I messaged my boss that my check seemed short, so we will look at it shortly. How do I address the labor swap and shortage situation???"

6,2024-02-06,Food Lion ex-employee,u/coreybhrea,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1akc1w7/food_lion_exemployee/,antiwork,"I worked for my local Food Lion and was employed there almost 7 years. There have been a number of incidents that led to my decision to quit, and here's a few. I'm interested in what people think of my decision, and if there was a better way of handling it? I'm currently still out of a job and desperately looking to make extra cash, but my past experiences at Food Lion have given me a lot of anxiety and apprehension about working in a similarly dangerous environment. So here goes.

We had a new hire in our department that lasted a little over 6 months. He had a real attitude on him, always talking down to our manager (female), constantly boasting how he was keeping our department afloat (he never did his job), and if anyone tried to give him constructive (mind you respectfully) criticism or feedback, he'd get pissed, start throwing things in the back and yelling. They allegedly ""documented"" every situation we raised to management, and it felt like this guy was untouchable by their so called 3 strikes rule. He would constantly show up drunk and smelling like alcohol, and even berating customers and making them uncomfortable, to the point where THEY reported him too. It came to a head when one day while working in the back, he was talking back to the assistant manager (female), and said he ""just wanted to have a little chat in the back hallway."" As I turn to look at him, he's brandishing one of the knives we use for cutting up produce. We de-escalated the confrontation, and reported it.He was finally put on leave, and eventually let go. Since then, it's been a revolving door of shitty hires, and this is where I come to the incident that made me quit. 

Our newest hire, is in a word, a raging, geriatric, misogynistic prick who can't be told anything unless it's from a man, literally. Our entire department is female, and he has caused problems with every single one of us. He constantly starts fights with the assistant manager, and then acts all rosy when the manager is there, immediately shit talks her when she leaves, and talks down to all of us when we don't agree with whatever crap he's spewing. One day, him and the assistant manager were arguing, and he yells ""do you really wanna do it this way?"", while turning toward her while her back was turned and lunging for her. I got in between him and told him to get out, to which he responded by shoving me backward and cussing me out. I stepped forward and basically walked him out of our back room, until he stormed out, cussing a blue streak, crying, and screaming obscenities. I thought for sure he'd be canned because of camera footage, and having two witnesses to the event. But lo and behold, management said ""the camera angle was just right, so you can't tell what he's doing, and neither witness statement other than mine notes that he shoved me, so if they fire him, and he tries to sue, they're in hot water. 

This is the point where I lost it. My safety and the safety of my coworkers has been threatened countless times, and management has consistently shown a lack of preemptive action. I wanted to call the cops after this last incident because he PUT HIS HANDS ON ME WHILE AT WORK, but I didn't out of respect for the company. Now I feel that was one of my biggest mistakes, and feel like he would've been let go if I had pursued that avenue. Is this irrational? Has anyone else been put in similar situations at their workplace? Is this common, or did I just win the retail nightmare lottery? Is there anything I could've done differently?

As an aside, while working there, I also noted their unsafe work practices like stacking trash in our backroom right up against where I cut fresh produce (think rotting meat, bad produce, and storewide trash surrounding my workspace on the regular. I think they also were committing some sort of tax fraud, because when we would scan inventory out for being ""out of date"" or bad, they would tag it under the code for the food bank, even though it would just end up in the dumpster. When I asked upper management about why they didn't have a code for throwing out food, he literally said ""I plead the fifth."" and walked out. Is this tax fraud? I know they get a certain amount of money back from ""donating"" out of date items, so it makes sense why they do this, but fundamentally they're lying,, so is this fraud? I don't know enough about the inner politics of retail and would love to hear others' perspectives and insights. 

Sorry for the length! Let me know what you think, and I hope you have a great day! <3  "

My journey into the corporate world started early at 14 due to personal circumstances; I had to grow up quickly after my mother passed away. Over the past few years, I've witnessed the ugly of corporate culture, but this year has been a turning point. I've come to realize the depth of the fakeness and corruption within the business world.

Initially, I was brought on board by my mentor, who happens to be the owner of the company. She is a prominent figure in the real estate industry, making millions annually. However, amidst the growth of the company and the increasing number of agents under her (over 220), I've found myself gradually forgotten. While I was always busy during the first 2 years, the dynamics shifted as the focus shifted towards expanding the team.

Now, my days seem to follow a monotonous pattern that's driving me crazy. I walk into our beautiful office, equipped with top-of-the-line computers and all the amenities one could ask for, but it's empty—no one works there. For months, I've been sitting idly, with no tasks unless I actively seek them out from my boss. However, approaching her seems futile given the circumstances. I get paid the same so might as well watch YouTube or post here….

I've been contemplating quitting, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm in a unique position to be ""on the clock"" in two places at once. With three years of experience in marketing and administration, I'm at a crossroads. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this far."

I applied for unemployment the following week (the waiting week) on Monday 1/22, when I was made eligible for benefits. I filled the claim out completely and accurately. After submitting it on the same day, I waited for my former employer to respond to the Department of Unemployment’s “request for confirmation” to confirm my past wages and separation information. 

After the waiting week, I applied for my first week (week of 1/29). On 1/30, I email my former employer’s HR department to ask if the request from the DUA has been received. No response.

I email and call them the morning of 2/2. Still nothing. I email my former manager later in the day to escalate. They pass along my request to HR. HR says that the person who handles unemployment will address the issue on Monday, 2/5…when they are back from vacation.

On 2/5, I email the HR department first thing in the morning for an update. They reply almost immediately, claiming that they have not received any paperwork from the UO. They complained that the window seems tight for them to respond. I responded back, showing them that the “determination of eligibility” was pending something on their end. No response. 

I called the DUA this morning to get a straight answer. After being on hold for half an hour, I get through. The person on the call confirms that my former employer did indeed get paperwork sent to them and they did not respond within the ten day window. At that point, they change the “pending” claim status to “approved”, stating that when an employer fails to respond, they approve and process the claim. They also said it’s a “bad look” on the employer to not confirm or deny if my separation information is accurate or not.

Now I don’t know if the DUA sent the information to the wrong address or what. I also don’t know if my former employer actually  lied about not receiving anything. I was not given a full reason as to why I was fired. I was on review once, but since then I was told my performance had improved. The only reason given for my termination was that a small quote I worked on did not win business (I priced products, but I wasn’t a salesperson). In my claim I stated this, and also stated that my former employer did not provide me with a tools or help I needed to succeed. I had no direct manager for months. My team and I were not properly trained how to use their complicated pricing systems. I was told on the day I was canned that the call was a Corrective Action Preventative Action (CAPA) call, but didn’t specify for what. So we correct the action, and learn how to improve moving forward? Nope. I join the call and my manager invites HR to discuss my termination. I stated these concerns on the call and they acknowledged them. I restated them in the claim. Only the truth.

Has anyone else had a similar experience dealing with this? I should note that I am a lot happier being out of that job."

I work in a small office, there's just 4 of us. Me, my two coworkers (who are in their 50s and 60s) and my supervisor who is a child-free woman in her 40s. I am the only person, at 24 who has a kid and makes the least amount of money. This job was supposed to be my foot in the door and help me get ""ahead"" so to speak.

I graduated with my associate's degree last May and I've been with this job for a year next month. It seems like every month there is some sort of celebration that everyone must contribute to and I told my supervisor that I just can't do it anymore. I can't contribute money to a forty dollar publix cake when I am putting my last ten bucks in gas to get me back and forth to work this week before payday. I make a little less than $2200 a month and on the rare months when my child's fathers' checks are garnish and I see that measly $120 a month I'm supposed to get, it makes such a huge difference

Yesterday it was my coworker who is in her 60s birthday celebration because she will be out of the office on her actual birthday. I didn't participate in the celebration, didn't get any cake, but I did sign their card. Today, it is my coworker in his 50s birthday and we had his celebration too. I will not be participating and instead I'll keep the office open and continue to work.

My supervisor told me I am not being a team player and I looked her dead in the face and said I don't get paid enough to really be a team player. Her response was I should be ""thankful"" that I make what I do an hour and it ""could be worse"". My supervisor drives a brand new car and is taking a 2 week vacation to Hawaii for her birthday. My request to take my own birthday off was denied because that will be when my supervisor is taking her vacation. My two other coworkers have adult children and make at least 60, possibly 70k a year. My coworker in his 50s constantly spouts about how I make ""good money"" and I ""don't know how good I have it"" and how I shouldn't expect to make more than what I do now right out of college and he has even cracked jokes about how I shop at Aldi for groceries and has even asked why don't I drive a newer car. Never mind the fact he also receives veterans compensation as well.

I come in early, I've stayed late when asked, I never take time off (because it's been consistently denied by my supervisor for her vacations/other coworkers time off) I have gone above and beyond for our office and the community we serve but after my boss pretty much making me feel like the shit on the bottom of her shoe for not being able to contribute not one, but two coworkers cakes/celebrations/gifts, I am just over it. I feel the burnout hard and dream of the day where I can make it from paycheck to paycheck without worrying about how I'm going to pay for gas, make sure my kid has enough to eat and make sure our bills are paid. This is such bullshit in the year 2024 that I am getting such flack from my place of employment."

I have been there for the better part of 5 years, I have run both buildings that house my department. I do paperwork, logging, high priority orders, am trained on every aspect of my job down to the last detail and have worked multiple positions including being cross trained in other departments within the buildings. Along with this, I have written a 58 page training manual with government level educational information and regulations, and am going to be certified in my field. I work 8 hours a day, five days a week, not to mention the hundreds of hours I have put in off the clock to further my knowledge and study my profession, attending classes, studying different procedures, and so on.

You would think that I would have a good position by now, right? No, I am in the same position I was when I started, and not only this, but have been alienated from my coworkers, and removed from my duties. Why? Because of new supervisors deciding to put their relatives in charge because of my age, not to mention the constant harassment I get over everything from my gender, to my age, to my sexuality, and everything in-between.

I have had to train every member of staff currently here along with my own boss, not to mention she WAS my trainee before getting promoted not once, but twice over me with less than a year's experience. On the note of less than a year's experience, my supervisor has their daughter take my position, and then my manager has their niece take over as well, effectively cutting me off from all of my responsibilities, and I started being cut off after I flat out asked for a raise being as I was doing more than my own supervisor.

I am treated like shit, and after a YEAR of fighting back, I am told that everyone is going to be on a points system to determine who gets promoted. Are you fucking kidding me?! I'm reduced to points when I am the one who has kept this place functioning. It doesn't matter what I prove, or what I do. And I don't even get a yes or no about my promotion, I am ignored and pushed aside, my own managers going so far as to avoid me because they don't want to listen to me. I can not tell you how many times I have had to go over everyone's head just to report a breach in safety just because no one takes me seriously anymore.

It sucks when you're passionate about your profession and you're treated like a grunt because of it. Five years of experience, all to be given a pat on the head and essentially told ""good boy"" while I'm reduced to obeying family members and people who could cause serious harm on a town-wide scale because they don't understand the true gravity of what they do and think this is a game. This job isn't a normal job, there is a reason why we have international inspectors.

Again, I can't give specifics of my profession. But I have gone from someone who enjoyed coming to work and wanting to grow, to someone who would rather kill time and pray I go home without being treated like a worthless piece of trash that day for no reason.

It doesn't matter who you work for, everywhere is fucked up, and for me to be in a profession such as mine and see such unprofessionalism, targeting, nepotism, and just genuinely irresponsibility and lack of care is disheartening and worrying. To know that I spent five years of my life for nothing is even more so."

I felt something in my back when carrying it but no pain, days later I was given a task where I had to drill some stuff and be bending over for over an hour non stop at work, after that I started feeling back pain. 2 days later the back pain got so bad I reported it to work. I was told to fill a form and explained to the lady from Risk that I was drilling and that my back hurted after that, but also told her about the 12th since in the forms it said that any fraud would have consequences, I was going to say the 16th since that is when the pain started but she told me even if I said the 12th is fine since is inside the building and it counts as workers compensation, which was false. I was going to say the 16th of the month happened, but since this lady told me the 12th was okay I reported the injury as the 12th. Again it would count as two separate insidents, still and now the company has the report of the 12th which of course got denied, so I did the report of the 16th and got denied as well since they believe the cause of the 16 is due to the 12, all because of this lady. Not they are denying me workers compensation, and not sure why since it could potentially be 2 separate incidents!

Being a firm believer since birth that work in the 21st century is often equivalent to giving away one's ass for free, I embarked on a project to create a space where everyone would be free to share an idea close to their heart, let the community vote for the most interesting idea, and where the winning idea would receive a cash prize.

Here's a draft of the pitch:

Do you have great ideas every day that could change the world... if only you could get started?

Do you have big dreams that seem overwhelming and you don't know where to begin? Are you afraid of crowdfunding platforms?

Come share your ideas and find a community on our platform!

Here, there's no pressure to achieve a result, no strings attached. You come to explain your vision and meet people who share it. And who knows, if you manage to convince enough people with your idea, you could even win a cash prize to bring your ideas to life... or not?

The goal is to offer something different from the usual crowdfunding platforms, where expectations of results can be intimidating.

On our platform, you'll be able to express yourself and defend your ideas away from the toxicity of traditional social networks.

The concept is simple: Post an idea, vote for an idea, win.

We'll implement a filtering and moderation system to prevent spam and trolls.

There you have it 😁 If you have any feedback, positive or negative, don't hesitate to share!

Have a great day 🚀✨"

* Consumerism
* Alienation
* Atomization
* Destruction of any community
* False myth of meritocracy
* Disrespect for those below you, and peasant-like awe for those above you in the hierarchy
* Environmental problems that, de-facto, no one is allowed to address
* Self-entitlement
* Lack of any non-transactional conversations and the wrong expectation that your spouse must be your personal psychotherapist (this is more applicable to men than to women, but works both ways)
* Commodification of everything
* Lack of any true sense of human equality in a sense that people don't really believe that they are of equal worth as a human being when compared to a janitor.

&#x200B;

Even just one example: anytime a worker and a boss have to negotiate for a wage, is this not a tragedy by itself that is being reproduced throughout the whole society? Why does the worker always want a higher wage, while the boss wants to pay them less?

This moment of pure and irresolvable conflict, why does it even have to happen? Why can't a society be based on co-operation instead of conflict and competition?

The best thing about this whole arrangement is that you really can't even work to help someone or help environment without discovering that in the end the problem exists due to someone having a lot of net profits to gain from it:

* High social safety net is a massive attack on all profit margins
* Jobs programs would be the same thing
* Food stamps also make people less likely to agree to work for poverty wages
* Environmental pollution can't be solved without making some chemical plant decrease their profit margins since they would have to now somehow safely depose of the waste
* Even if you would try to stop the people who are hunting the endangered animal species, in the end you will also face opposition since they do it all for profits as well.
* Social housing also makes it so that people will demand higher wages
* Housing for homeless makes those homeless more picky about their jobs, they also stop terrorizing the working people by reminding them that they could be next
* Feeding the homeless also does the same since they now have a choice between working and starving
* Even if you would promote any type of communal programs that are supposed to make people happier/more involved in their community, if implemented on a national scale will also cause you to collide with business interests since any type of socially cohesive and united front of the population who cares about each other is a massive problem
* etc

Basically, if you think about it, any problem you can think of that people have - to truly resolve it, you will first have to research a lot and figure out that the **problem** from your POV is **not a problem** at all from someone else's POV. In fact it's a **blessing** for them. This someone else is almost always a person who can materially benefit from this problem existing.

Think about - that person most likely already has enough money for generations to come, yet, they keep those problems alive since they want **MORE**. 

Directly benefiting from societal problems only because you want to make money - making it so that some random family would have arguments due to financial problems, making them stressed and insecure, telling them constantly that they are not happy and can only be if they buy some product, effectively forcing them to constantly stress themselves about the looming danger of homelessness and starvation, teaching that their low financial security is just the result that they are inherently ""bad people"" and just ""deserve"" to be ""poor"", etc.

Now, let's just go back to what happens if you try to help people: you sure will be allowed to do something small, promote a bit of social cohesion here, help someone in need there, 

**HOWEVER** if you start identifying the key issue behind all of this, that's where you will get in trouble because you can't solve any of the issues presented above. You just **can't**. They will exist because the system itself requires for all of that to self-reproduce.

This is the ***biggest*** **tragedy** of this whole situation in my opinion - once you understand how it works on a system-wide level, it would be similar to what a non-sociopathic person would feel when exposed to slavery in modern days.

You know slavery is wrong, **YET** if you continue to do nothing about it and you see slaves in the fields everyday, then wouldn't you at least feel bad about yourself for not acting?

Trying to tackle other issue now seem like you advocating for less whipping or banning the ability of slave-owners to freely shoot any slave they want. It would be like you saying that, perhaps, we should make whipping limited to 1 time a year or slave-owner shouldn't actually be able to perform any sexual acts on the slave, etc. 

You get the point, it's not the whipping or the conditions of the house where slaves live. It's not about how much taxes the slave owners pay or if they address the slave by their name or their number. It's not any of that - it's about slavery itself.

So, yeah... **Society** itself then becomes just **one big tragedy** that self-reproduces itself every day, made possible by **lies** on the one hand and **tears** on the other."

We will both be getting about 2 percent raises and both of our bonuses will be cut for a third year in a row. All while there are ""record profits"" according to all the pep rally calls. At some point, I really think they will be phasing out bonuses for good, and they will go the way of the pension. 

Neither of our pay packages are now keeping up with inflation, and we've both started ""quiet quitting"" over the last year because it's all just theater for the middle managers and executives anyway. What's honestly the point of ""exceeding expectations"" when ""meets expectations"" only gets you 0.5% less of a raise? "

In some ways I'm lucky, because it's the ONLY high paying manufacturing company in the area.  

Average per capita income in my zip code is $21k.  I make $65k with no OT.  If I *wanted* to work more hours (I don't), I could be hitting $80-90k.  

So I'm actually living a pretty decent life in my area at the moment.  I shouldn't complain.  

But I just fucking hate my job and the control they want over employees.  


I load and unload 8 machines on a line.  My job description is literally: ""Press button to open, take out product, insert new product, press button to close, press button to start cycle, put completed product on a cart for a person in another position to take away.  

These machines have an 16 minute cycle.  It takes me 4 minutes to unload and reload them.  

That leaves me with 12 minutes of downtime.  


What am I allowed to do in that time?  I have a chair that I can sit in.  That's it.  I can sit there and look at the wall for 12 minutes.  

Can I go on my phone?  No.  Can I read a book or magazine?  No.  Can I doodle/draw on paper?  No.  Can I walk to another area and speak with a co-worker?  No.  

All of those things will result in a write-up/suspension if I'm caught.  

Look, I understand certain restrictions for safety.  This is a manufacturing company that's very busy in other areas.  I understand not having your phone or a book out when ""walking the floor"" in fork lift lanes.....that's a recipe for disaster.  

But I'm allowed to sit in a chair for 12 minutes at a time waiting for my machines.  

Why can't I read a fucking book?  Why can't I answer a text message?

I've asked management about this and their only response has been, ""Well you always reach your quota and maybe you would too if we allowed you to do those things, but others may become too complacent and leave the machines stopped because they're too distracted.""

What a stupid fucking answer.  

If I did that, or if someone else did that, fucking reprimand us!  

The real answer is control.  

Control, control, control.  

The peons, the proletariat, the working class, whatever you want to call them have to be ""kept in line"", and any type of leeway can't be given to them.....even by supervisors who are only making $2-5 more an hour.  

It's a fucking joke of a system."

10,2024-02-06,Not Eligible for Short Term Disability because of ONE DAY,u/Ashstone24,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aknpq5/not_eligible_for_short_term_disability_because_of/,antiwork,"Warning: TFMR, Loss of Baby, Language

So our lives got turned upside down on January 23rd when we went in for my ultrasound appointment. I was 20 weeks pregnant and this was the big appointment where they can really start to see some details of how the baby is doing.

All of our previous appointments and tests had gone great, so we were very excited. When the doctor sat us down and told us that our son was incompatible with life due to a rare genetic malformation called Meckel-Gruber syndrome...well you can imagine our grief. There was no saving him.

I immediately reached out to my employer letting them know I wouldn't be coming back for a while. They told me what to do and I submitted a claim for short term disability.

I had my D&E procedure last Tuesday at 21 weeks. Although I'm pretty well recovered physically, I'm still mentally fucked. Of course I took this week off.

We were hoping that short term disability leave would cover this week. I was told today that I had been denied because I hadn't worked for the company for 6 months....and that I was ONE DAY SHORT of the 6th month mark.

I asked if I could use PTO for that one day so that I would qualify, nope. It was just a nice ""fuck you"" after everything I've gone through."

2,2024-02-06,Very stressful with workers compensation need advice,u/SrZiino,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aknwmm/very_stressful_with_workers_compensation_need/,antiwork,"Hello, I need some help. Let me explain what happened. I injured myself at work the 16th a couple months ago. After bending over and drilling some stuff for a long time. I reported the injury the 18th, the pain started after finishing the drilling job, but got really bad the 18th, two days later. That day I reported it to risk and they told me to fill some forms, they asked me if I had done anything else and told them I was shopping on the 12th in the store and lifted a box and that’s about it. The lady told me to report that in that form, and said that even if that was the case that it happened due to the 12th (which is unrelated) I would qualify for workers compensation, even if I was not on the clock. Due to this the claim got denied, I believe since they linked the 12th and 16th which are unrelated. I re applied, and even HR and risk sent me to a doctor, but this time without making the mistake of mentioning the 12th like the lady told me, since it is unrelated. I went to the doctor and she put me off work for 2 weeks, I went again and she put me in leave another 2 weeks, then I notice I don’t hear anything from WC or my employer, I through my second case was denied as well and I was angry because it was a work, I called WC and to my surprise my employer never sent the documentation of my injury of the 16th, and that they had no idea of that. I can’t believe it, I been waiting a month to hear back and they never sent it and have no idea who is covering the doctors costs, that’s why WC is confused why they getting calls. What now, I’m stressed, should I file again? Waiting this long and they never sent it, do I just apply again and report the 16th again just make sure they send it?"

So about a year ago my work started to require MFA(multi-factor authentication) for certain programs including our access to Salesforce.  

Since this would be on our personal phones(all work calls are VOIP on a computer app so no work phones provided), I chose to us the Microsoft app (since it works for lots of sign ins/accounts including personal ones) rather than the Salesforce authenticator app. 

I just purchased a new phone this weekend and found out yesterday that our profile access in Salesforce did NOT include the option to change the existing MFA app.  

I opened a ticket for support yesterday morning and got contacted this afternoon.  
The agent said that if I had used the proprietary Salesforce authentication app my issue would not have happened.  
They said I should set it up now.

I told them I was NOT putting that app on my personal phone and would 100% be using the Microsoft app again.  

They revoked access for the old app, so I was prompted to set up the new one. 

Everything is working now,  but really, if someone didn't use a proprietary app originally, why the hell would they switch to it now."

Ok before any or all of you say, get out of retail-its always like this, I literally don’t have a choice but to work here as there is next to no jobs where I live and things aren’t great financially for me right now. 

Ok so I above and beyond where I work, despite my health deteriorating and having to take 2 weeks sick leave, since I’ve come back I do my absolute best to be efficient, organised and keep our department tidy. Everything I do gets overlooked, my manager asked me for feedback as apparently her managers asked her to ask me. So I said that I would go a whole lot further if I had feedback or even just recognition now and again, I’m not asking for a whole lot or a song and dance for doing my job. But I am beyond efficient and try my absolute best to keep on top of everything- which i do successfully. I also try to make life easier for my colleagues- with checklists, organising labels, displays- literally everything. And even since her asking for my feedback, I get no recognition, reward or praise. Nothing! I am so beyond feeling this way, I’m trying to get a promotion and I’m waiting to hear who has the job and I’m thinking is this all a test??? If it is then I’m beyond pissed, I’m expected to do my best always in this thankless soul destroying job and for what 😭😭😭😭"

4,2024-02-06,HR at my last job booked me to share a hotel room with a paroled Sex Offender,u/Kingofcryo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1akoqdg/hr_at_my_last_job_booked_me_to_share_a_hotel_room/,antiwork,"Our project coordinator texted me about what I wanted her to do about my upcoming jobs that were scheduled to be done while I was away at a training conference to become a licensed HAZMAT Tanker Truck Inspector?

""What training?"" They booked me for an out of town training and didn't even tell me. No per diem, no vehicle provided for the 5 hour drive, two days notice and I had never been asked or required to do any over night trips. It wasn't part of the job description to travel. 

After I got over the shock of being expected to drive my 45 year old vehicle to another state and pay for all of my expenses, to be reimbursed later, allegedly, I called my wife and gave her the news. Just by chance she was already booked to go back east to see her family at the same time. That meant we had nobody to watch our dogs and cats. I was supposed to be going to this training seminar on Sunday afternoon, spending the night on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, and driving home on Wednesday. 

After a TON of back and forth my job agreed to cover the $40 a day to have someone watch our pets. They were pissed about it but they had already paid a $1500 non-refundable class for me so they didn't much of a choice. 

The trip had three people booked. Our Safety Manager, me, and another service tech that had only been with us a few months. The other tech and I didn't want to ride with the manager because he's a total rah-rah company man with a tiny little car. The other tech and I are both over 6ft tall and wanted to have some leg room and definitely didn't want to be in the same car as the Safety Manager. HR didn't want to pay for gas in two vehicles, of course. So we had another little battle over that. Fine! We'll do it, they said. 

The drive was uneventful but as soon as we got to the hotel we saw the ""Manager"" was already there and sitting at the bar. We shot the shit for a minute while he bragged about drinking on the company dime. Meanwhile, we couldn't even get a $20 per diem for meals! 

We went to the front desk, they asked for our ID'S and credit cards. I had to use my debit card for incidentals which incurred a $75 hold on my account. Great. They never asked for the other guys credit card but they handed us keys and we went up the elevator, got off on the same floor, walked down the hall and arrived at THE SAME ROOM! They booked us to share a room? I'm a 50 year old man, I don't want to live in a dorm! 

A quick call to HR, and they confirmed we were expected to share a room. Wonderful, I can get to know my coworker and, whatever. We're here. Let's go eat. During dinner he explained how grateful he was to have this job, get this training, etc... because it has been hard to catch a break since he was released from prison. 

For what, you ask? Sexual assault. Sentenced to 5 years to life for rape. 

My roommate, the felon. Sexual predator, 6' 3"" black guy who just got out of prison on parole after 6 years.

Another call to HR. ""What the actual fuck?""

""Don't worry, he was accused of raping his step-daughter. It wasn't anything with a guy."" An actual fucking quote from my HR rep. 

I flipped out and was screaming at her until they agreed to get him another room. I worked there for another four days. As soon as I got home I submitted expense reports for my mileage, my pet sitter, my meals, and for four days of ""Danger Pay"", I called it. Double time for the hourly pay X 24hrs per day X 4 days. 

They laughed and disputed it until I told them that I quit and they would be hearing from my lawyer. I got all I asked for plus my 7 weeks of accumulated vacation and sick time. I insisted on a check before I left the building. 

It turned out the owner of the company was the primary driving force behind this guy getting out of prison. He saw how much this guy loved Jesus and couldn't wait for him to be my roommate."

A lot of “I don’t mean to be racist or anything but” and “This is gonna sound racist but” and I was the one person of color in the office and was treated terribly. My coworkers talked down to me and treated me like I was an idiot. My old white boss has yelled at me more than once, she called me “Shirley Temple trying to be hood” during my annual review, and she put a bunch of things about my personality in my annual review that have nothing to do with my work ethic and then gave her boss something different than what she gave me. 

I reported the issues and it made things worse. A lot worse. I was put on administrative leave while things were investigated, and the whole time I thought I would be getting fired. Anyway, the whole thing was very traumatic, and I recently went to a psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with PTSD because of this. She also put me on a medication to help with nightmares because I have nightmares at my job, and she’s looking into prescribing me something for anxiety. 

I know lawyers and will be speaking to them about this, so I’m not looking for legal advice. I’m just curious if anybody has sued over something similar and won? I don’t think emotional distress cases are easy to win. I want to see how worth it is to really look into this. TIA"

1,2024-02-06,A bloomig community,u/AdventurerOfTheStars,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1akqk1o/a_bloomig_community/,antiwork,"Hello everyone! i know it's been a while, but i have returned! Not with a story, or interactive post, but to ask if you would be interested in joining a small community in need of members.You may be asking yourself ""What is this community?"" Or  ""What does it stand for?"" And maybe even ""Why should i join? ""Well, fear not, for i will answer these hypothetical questions!

&#x200B;

Firstly..

&#x200B;

*What is this Community?*

Well, to put it simply, we are a group that would like to achieve a people-centric space traveling reality. Now i know that's ambitious, and possibly even impossible. But we will never know until we try! and, we have several other steps before we get there.

**Step 1)** Create a safe community, ideally with 500-1000+ members

**Step 2)** Acquire land to build or renovate homes and shelters for our members, creating a 'headquarters '/commune

**Step 3)**  Become self sufficient with our own economy, governing system, and industry

**Step 4)** begin research into technologies that may allow us space travel

&#x200B;

Those are just some of the steps, though they are a work in progress. We are a pretty young community, but already have several skilled people working together. Mostly engineers, but i myself am in the space industry , as well as having several members of differing skillsets.

&#x200B;

*What do we stand for?*

We stand for the equal treatment of every member of our community. Stopping corruption where we can, and getting humanity into space without secondary ideals. Mostly, we're trying to avoid mega corporations controlling even more than they already do. Tell me, what happens when Elon, or Jeff Bezos make it to space? You might hear things like this-

""Please replenish your subscription to Amazon/Tesla Air, you have 60 second remaining""

Or charging you out the wazoo for food and supplies absolutely necessary to your survival. If not that, extreme price gouging.And, if space isn't your thing, we want to create a society of people that wouldn't need to worry about where their next meal comes from, or if they will have to live on the street, freezing to death.Our members believe that food, water, and shelter are human rights, that shouldn't be sold to you so you can survive. Does that mean we want you to have five star meals for free? no, of course not.

We simply think that a basic amount of food to keep starvation at bay is what everyone deserves. A basic home, where you will not freeze to death or die of heat exhaustion. Not needing to stay at your parent's until you can find rent you can afford.Again, ambitious? Certainly. Perhaps doomed to fail? Maybe, but we have to try. I'm not the only one sick of the rat race, scurrying around making some billionaire richer while we sit here in threadbare clothes, wondering if we will manage to pay rent this month.

*Why should I join?*

Well, here's the toughest part. The why. Well, honestly? If you want a future- even one that may be a pipe dream- that doesn't involve being crushed under the boot of the oligarchy... i suggest joining.

I'm not saying we're the only group out there, oh no haha. But, we would very much like to make this into a reality. And even if we don't make it to space, and just manage to create something here on earth worth our blood sweat and tears? I'd consider that worth it. Something that would keep our future safe, our children and grandchildren, from needing to suffer under the boots of tyrants or corrupt governments. Not needing to worry about starvation anymore, if we can help it. And, if we do manage to get to space, we might be able to make humanity into a space faring civilization. Though that wouldn't be for a very long time.

So please, join us! Anyone and everyone is welcome. Engineer? Hop right in. Agriculturist? We welcome you with open arms. Simply someone who want to join and help any way you can? We'll take you too. No one is unwelcome- Except a select few- (Racists, homophobes', Nazi's, etc.)

So, if any of this even interested you, come on in and see for yourself if you are interested. I will warn you, we are a very young group, so many of our projects are a work in progress(especially documemts). and all input is welcome!

Feel free to comment if you wish to join, or have criticism. I know this may be rambling, a pipe dream, or perhaps foolhardy but hey. Gotta try!

***Red or Blue, it doesn't matter who. We just 
want a crew!***

1,2024-02-06,Should I apologize to my boss for making her feel uncomfortable?,u/MyBelovedASMR,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aks32k/should_i_apologize_to_my_boss_for_making_her_feel/,antiwork,"I have a crush on my boss and I know she knows. I know nothing will happen between us and I’m okay with that. I never admitted my feeling to her directly but I’m so terrible at lying that she has a vibe I like her.

I believe I made her feel uncomfortable because she thought I was checking her out when she was leaving my office which wasn’t the case. I was looking at a paper on my desk but the angle made it look like it was checking her out. Since then she’s went through the door in a weird way and I know it’s because she thought I was checking her out because it’s never happened before then. I now try to make a point of not looking at the door when she leaves.

I’m getting a surgery soon so I was going to blame my apology on the drugs. I was thinking about texting her,
“I noticed you seem uncomfortable around me lately and I believe I know why… (I would talk about the situation where it looked like I was checking her out but I wasn’t checking her out. And some other situations that I haven’t mentioned to remain anonymous). I wouldn’t admit my feelings I would just tell her I wanted to be her friend but I didn’t know how considering our relationship and I’m terrible at making friends.”

I’m hoping she takes it well… but I’m having second thoughts as maybe it would be too awkward around the workplace. She’s very kind and smart… and pretty. I think she would try to take it well but with everything that’s happened I can’t be sure.

What do you think should I apologize to her?"

I (F) have been working at a company for over 5 years. Whenever I get sick, it usually happens quickly, but I never take off more than 2 days unless medically necessary (I.E. I am severely ill or had surgery) and usually work through my illness at home. I work on a fairly small team consisting of myself, my boss, and 2 other coworkers, one local to my area and the other who mostly works from home and goes in the office about once a week in a different state. Out of state coworker has a tendency to pick up work orders and tasks but never gets them done. He just assigns them to himself and leaves it in the queue until I or my colleague ends up doing it for him. We do have external resources for my job for heavy workloads and more complicated tasks.
 
Recently I got extremely ill. I'm talking a once every 10 years or so I get this sick. Fever, aches, chills, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, dizziness. Basically flu-like.
 I took two days off, going to urgent care the first day where the doctor told me to stay home the next day, then I worked from home on the third day. But I was not feeling any better on my work from home day. In fact, I felt worse, and had to call out again the next two days. On the fifth day I finally got to go see my primary care doctor who did the swab and found I had a really bad case of the Flu. (I'm thankful it wasn't COVID)

After about a week and a half of being sick, I was finally well enough to try to work from home again. Throughout the whole time I was sick, I kept my boss informed of how I was feeling, if I needed more time off or not. I stressed how guilty I felt for getting so sick all of a sudden and let him know I am aware of how it impacts the team and how much I appreciated everyone picking up the slack when I was out. I made sure to thank my teammates when I logged in, as well.

I asked for one more work from home day (as I still have a really bad cough, no voice, and a lot of mucus and don't want to bother my office mates with my gross phlegm filled hacking)  and my boss responds with
""How many more 'one more days' are there going to be?""
He then tells me how my not being in the office is slowing down the team. I offered to come in the office anyway. He let me know he told my coworker to fill in my spot tomorrow and to just work from home.

I'm just really frustrated because I have given this company so much of myself these past 5 years, they always tell me how good of a job I'm doing and how I'm the most trustworthy member of the team who always gets things done and how much they value me at this company.

But when I genuinely need the time off for a seriously bad case of the flu, it gets thrown in my face how I am the one slowing down the team for missing work when the person who is always NEVER doing his work gets away with actually slowing down the team. It's leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

How do I properly air my grievances with my boss without coming off rude? I like my boss, we get along really well but this just feels like some double standard BS."

I feel like I could easily just set up camp in here for like an hour at a time, here and there.

I work night shift IT Helpdesk - It *can* get busy, but most nights are pretty slow. I am sitting in an open-floor, windowless, empty office, with cleaning staff and security walking past my area every 40 minutes. 

Sitting in this empty room, on a couch, with the lights off, looking out the window while I browse Reddit and ""wait for calls to come in"" sounds way better than standing at my desk all night. It just feels like the only place in the building I'm not being watched. 

IDK - is there anything WRONG with just hanging out in this room every single night? I'm doing exactly what I would be doing at my desk, but it feels strange to just lock myself in a room like this for more than 20 minutes."

And even now, if my work is stressful enough and everything goes tits up, I still have moments, even days sometim3s that it's alright. 

Bad news is that's it mundane and boring to me now most of the time. Its a really bummer cause if they just had room to progress a little or have more variety then I'd last a lot longer, but it's just lots of the same easy stuff now. 

I'm studying math cause I'm awful at it and next year going to start an engineering apprenticeship. I'm pretty late considering I'm 24 but oh well. I'd also be dropping a pretty good career for one I could be terrible at, but im at the start of my career so worst case scenario I'm just behind a few years. Very annoying but it's okay, hopefully I'm not too dumb and anxiety ridden to be an engineer.

Gonna be rough working away from the dogs 5 days a week though. Yeesh. I work hybrid the now. God I wish I could be an engineer apprentice and have my dogs with me, I feel sick just thinking about leaving them for that long. Will just need to spend lots of money on getting them big walks when I'm away.

But anyways. Hooray! Normally it takes me around 3 months to get bored and 6 months to start feeling hopeless in life. I don't feel hopeless at all yet, nor do I dread work each day. It's still the beat place I've worked. It's just a lot of boring admin processing and not much goes wrong to make it interesting lol."

I've always had anxiety around starting new jobs but never this severe, I nearly threw up at the cash register multiple times, I could barely eat on my break which is very unlike me.

I would ask her questions and she would look at me and say ""okay??"" with the body language and facial expression saying ""what do you want me to do about it?"". In the interview she asked me what kind of manager I want her to be and I said I need her to be supportive and encouraging and she's the opposite. My training consists of being thrown right into serving customers and watching online videos/reading. 

Online I see things like ""talk to your manager"". How am I meant to do that when she's the problem??? I just hate it. Like so much. Thinking about going back gives me such bad anxiety that I almost faint. 

The main kicker of this situation though? I'm moving in less than a month and am a bridesmaid at a wedding in the same week; on one hand, I'm already under so much stress I don't need this on top, but on the other hand I need the money for two very expensive days! I receive a benefit every week so it's not like I'd be completely without money but the extra money would still help. My parents' advice will always just be to wait it out but I physically don't think I can. It gets to a point where I start to consider 1njuring myself or getting sick to not go. Lol.

1,2024-02-07,Change the environment!!!!,u/mangojuicepapi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aky55s/change_the_environment/,antiwork,"Firstly, I agree with many of you and am always shocked by the testimonials you describe.

What I ask myself is how do we organise ourselves to make a change? After all, we are the majority. 

It often seems to me that many here are just looking for moral support but lack the energy to change. 

I can understand that, I too am trapped in the matrix and work hard to barely make ends meet every month. However, I don't just want to moan, I want to change something, but how?"
2,2024-02-07,Mobile phone monitoring,u/Wide_Sense5114,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aky5kf/mobile_phone_monitoring/,antiwork,"Sorry this is a bit long - I searched the Sub for this monitoring app and there were no results, but surely my employer isn’t the only one looking at this. 

So, for some background, I’m Australian and have spent most of my career working for large Australian companies - these employers provided me a phone as part of my job, and I always managed with just the one phone, paid for by my employer, which was used for work and personal purposes.  

For the last couple of years, whilst still living in Australia, I’m now working for an American company. I took the same position of just using the one phone, but have come to learn that the company is looking to roll out a mandatory app that will monitor all communication- even if using personal or allegedly encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp or Signal - currently being trialed by a pilot team. 

They probably would’ve preferred for us to not know, if they weren’t required by law to provide prior notice of being monitored (and I assume they will need to ask us to install the app?). 
I’m not sure if my US colleagues will be notified, but that may depend on whether employers are required to provide prior notice in the US or other countries.  I hope they are, as I don’t want our US colleagues to have another reason to hate us down here - it’s bad enough we get about twice the annual leave which doesn’t expire, but instead accumulates and is paid out when we leave. 

But, considering there were no hits in the sub about this app, it does make me wonder? 

I recommend you check whether prior notice of monitoring is a requirement for your country. If it isn’t, you should probably just assume you’re being monitored. 

I’ve ended up getting a separate personal phone and, anecdotally, I can instantly see this is a worse position for my employer- with the one phone, if I had an urgent email come through now whilst I’m on Reddit, I would’ve seen the notification and been able to respond. Now, I put the work phone down when I get home and don’t look at it again until I leave for work the next day. 
If they didn’t feel the need to monitor us, they would’ve been getting more free work out of people. 
Although, they also seem unable to see that forcing people to work in the office full time is also providing them with worse productivity than they’d get if they offered more flexibility, so I shouldn’t be surprised. 

One of the apps being mentioned is [LeapXpert](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/29/leapxpert-raises-22m-to-monitor-employee-chats-for-compliance/), which claims that it:

> “promises to avoid capturing private and personal messages by siloing communications, enabling employees to have an independent messaging profile for personal use”

However, according to people who have been on the trial team for my employer, that is not true - it recorded test private messages and photos, both sent and received. 

I personally haven’t yet used the monitoring app, so I can’t be certain if there’s any workaround, but would be curious if anyone else has experience with it?

Anyway, it got me curious -
- How common is it becoming for employers to monitor us? 
- Is your employer monitoring you? 
- Do they have any legal obligation to tell you if they are?
- Will any potential benefit from the monitoring offset the likely decreased productivity due to employees not needing to keep as close to their work phones as they have a separate device?
- How will employers manage risks around the personal and sensitive information they may get access to? Eg. text messages received from your doctor asking to call to get your STI test results, photo of your baby in the bath you send to the other parent, photo of your passport, angry messages from your abusive partner. 
- if the purpose is compliance - surely any employee who was thinking of doing the wrong thing like insider trading, wouldn’t have been using their work devices for that anyway… and now you’re essentially encouraging them to have a separate device for doing their shady business? And because everyone now has 2 devices, it’s not likely to be a potential indicator of suspicious behaviour. 
- is this something that’s only being explored by US companies? Or is it globally that employers are wanting to spy on us?"

I would say around 5 Million net worth when he was a kid. 

Hes pretty stupid and imcompetent. He has a PhD in Economics - but I didnt believe that he was capable of writing a thesis because hes so damn stupid. When I checked it in the Uni library it turned out that like 2/3 of ""his"" thesis were plagiarised. So I reported this to University - but thats another story. 

This guy openen a business - which he financed mostly from his parents money. He then made bad decision after bad decision - but because he could throw money at the problems they eventually disappeared.

Once he lost half a million because of an obviously bad decision that was 100% avoidable. But because he had money - he just shrugged it off and continued.

After like 10 almost failures that were always compensated by him having money, he managed to make his business profitable. And now he barely works. He has people 10x smarter and more capable than him running his company and paying them peanuts. When he comes in he bascially only makes a decision which other are expected to turn into reality and hes on vaccation like 10x a year.

100% of his success is based on having more resources than the average Joe. This allowed him to invest and start a business. And allowed him to eventually make it profitable by enabling him to shrug off several bad decisions. Money compensated for his lack of ability.

Meanwhile someone 10x smarter and more capable who would have made all the right decisions - who lacks the resources to invest or start a business or stomach just one almost failure - will never even own 1/10 of what this guy owns.

Thats the reason why I dont want to work. If the rich can succeed despite being sub standard - if they dont have to work just because they had the resources to start and carry something - resources that compensated for their incompetence - why should the rest of us have to work?

We had yearly reviews a few weeks ago, which were literally 5 minutes long. He told me over and over (unprompted) that the maximum raise he was allowed to give was 2%. I tried to ask about goals for the year, things to improve on, and promotion opportunities. There was no feedback, except that of course, a promotion was possible. Oh, and please don’t discuss raises with your coworkers because not everyone got the same raise.

So naturally, having zero trust in him, I asked a few coworkers and we were all told we were getting the max, all with different numbers. I also know he cannot afford to lose me, because I am essentially the whole team for what I do. So I don’t believe for a second that a promotion is on the horizon.

I admit I have trouble with knowing where each project is as the PM team has multiple variations of the same project timeline which I mentioned several times. I have also been excluded from client meetings and emails so when the client responds, I do not have the latest update.

This poor performance review contains a blatant lie; that I do not have any projects assigned to me as a result of my poor performance. I DO have a project assigned to me, it’s on hold as a result of the industry backache. Regardless, I was told that things are just slow and that when they pick up again, supposedly end of this week, that I would be given additional projects.

The performance review mentions that I have two weeks to improve before my performance is revisited. Is this even enough time to improve? The exact terminology used is, “within the next two weeks we look for areas of improvements in the following areas…”

I am writing to HR in the morning and very disappointed in my managers. I will request to be moved to a different team.

We questioned the employer and they said it was part of the Policies and Procedures she signed.  They claim the $13/hour includes the credit card tips, as it exceeds the state minimum of $12/hour, so the employer is keeping the credit card tips and then allegedly passing it along to the employee as an extra $1/hour.  They allege they are running at a deficit on the $1/hour subsidy, but, obviously, there is no way to know if that is true.

I checked with the VA DOLI and they said that as long as the employer was meeting or exceeding the $12/hour minimum, then that is ""fair"".

I asked around people at work and pretty much everyone assumed the tips paid on the credit card at the point of sale were being passed along to employees.

Before I left, I tried to do a LOA, so I didn’t *have* to leave, but I had no idea how much worse that decision was. The LOA company my job went through was MetLife. I’m convinced they picked them specifically because nobody I talked to there could give me consistent information. I was constantly given the run around, or provided with incorrect information. Of course, during all of this shit show, my manager was completely radio silent despite “promising” she’d support me through it. So I was flying in the dark with no idea how to navigate the LOA. 

After TWO months (unpaid mind you), I finally got fed up and just decided to go back to work. That’s when the real hell started. Immediately my hours were cut to just barely above part time. I was given the worst position practically every day I worked, and all of the previous friendly management became cold towards me. I was already really struggling with my health as is, so this was all the straw that broke the camel’s back which led to me quitting. 

Fast forward to the end of last month, I received a tax document detailing a check for $400 I should have received from MetLife for the time I missed work on my LOA. I never received it. I reached out to MetLife to see if it was perhaps sent back to them, but they tried to LIE to me, and say the check was only supposed to be $320. I told them I had THEIR document right in front of me specifically stating it was for $400. The person I was talking to said that had to be taken up with the employer, not them. Bullshit. 

I went to the bank I had at the time, and got my statement from the month the check was supposedly sent to me. I also got two months before and after just to be thorough. There was no check deposited for that amount, and no cash withdrawn at that amount. In other words, I did not receive money that I should have gotten almost 6 months ago. 

I’m really not sure what to do at this point. I’m already in the process of getting on disability with a lawyer, and I’d really like to try to not have to have a SECOND lawyer to pay to fix this. I’m hoping some of you have some insight for actions I can take before I result to a lawyer, but if that’s my only choice, I’d like to know that too. $400 is a lot of money to me right now, and I can’t help but feel like that job is taking one last opportunity to kick me in the balls. The whole situation is really upsetting, and I don’t know if I could mentally handle another legal battle."

I have been working my ass in this company for years. When I compare the amount of work I do, I am always above average. I have been working here for a long period, so I know much of the operation and processes, therefore I am often required to cover for colleagues’ days off, sometimes with little advance.

Next week I am leaving on a three-day vacation I had planned for a long time, so I need someone to cover my beats. Turns out everyone is too busy, and if I want to take the days off, I will need to get all the work done in advance.

I am not irreplaceable, but I feel that today I am essential to the company, but this is not being valued. Instead, they take all my work for granted, and no one gives a damn about what I do, as long as deliveries continue normally. I became a task executor that is always doing a lot of work without anyone noticing. 

To make matters worse, everyone is being asked to launch new products, and we need to do this on our own without team support, just because the company wants to show shareholders some nice growth figures. This means more workload with same pay, and all we already do is downplayed. 

I am not the only one in this situation. I think there are some people in the company who are reliable, and they treat us like worker ants. "

- Find an idea to make money.

You might have noticed that i need to learn deeper in coding to do at least one of these options BUT i dont want to. I just cant find the motivation to do that everytime i start to learn it, im imagining myself in a desk with tie and shirt, and those $$$$ in twitter are overrating to work in a 9/5 job just like it is some good thing lol. And for the other option i dont know and couldnt find an idea yet. I want to use my code experience to make an app to make an idea real. Well until then it is not a problem to work in a 9/5 job tho but it’s salaries are so low (3-5 year experience = 3x - 5x minimum wage price, idk about US tho). I can do both but it has to be worth it. Soo i dont know what to do really."

This happened after drilling and having to bend over a lot of times while moving some furniture. I went the 18th to Risk to let them know since that day the pain was horrible. They told me to fill for workers compensation and asked me if I had done something besides that and told them I carried a box on the 12th at work off shift but that’s it, and that I felt something in my back. They told me to write that down on the form, since it didn’t matter I was off the clock since it would still qualify me for workers compensation. I initially was not going to mention that since it is irrelevant to the 16. Guess what just for saying that they linked the 12th event to the 16th and denied me workers comp. HR advices me to reapply but just mentioning the 16th because I was given wrong information by Risk. I reapplied, and went to the doctor the 10th of the month after, the first time they didn’t send me to the doctor because a lady from HR told me it was not sure about something and had to investigate. The second time I filled the form they sent me to the doctor finally, which told me to take a month off. Yesterday I called because I had not heard from HR or WC, guess what my employer never sent the second WC form, and who knows who’s been paying the doctors visits because WC they did not since they were not aware, now not sure if they will charge me now all because my employer did not report it. Should I reapply or should I take legal action now, since I been struggling and surviving thanks to help from my parents. Waited a month and nothing since they did not send it."

The owner, Adam, is about 45 years old and is married. Adam’s wife doesn’t come to the office often but “helps” out with social media when she does come in. Adam has a clear favorite in the office, Mary. Mary is a college student, who started with us an about year ago as a receptionist but now handles our accounting, since that’s what she is studying. When Adam comes or leaves the office, one of his first stops is Mary’s desk. 

None of us suspects anything has ever happened between Mary and Adam. Adam typically works and goes home to his wife and kids, most of the time cutting the day short. Mary stays in office late to use the internet for her classes. Despite this Mary is not a great student. She openly talks about failing her classes and not understanding the material. I’ve personally tried to help her out but it’s rough. Knowing this Adam recently presented Mary with a new name plate with the title “Senior Financial Analyst”. While I cannot speak on her job duties, I know for sure 2 months isn’t enough for “senior” and someone failing to understand stats, might not be a great analyst. 

This obviously leads to some talks in the office. My boss and I included. The subject went from Mary to myself where I am thinking of applying to grad school. I mentioned Haas school of business as one of my top choices. He gives this blank look, so I said “your Alma mater! Berkeley!” He then says “Haas? I can’t say I’m familiar. Is it a new program?” In my head I’m thinking if you graduated from Berkeley with a business major, you surely went to UC Berkeley Haas. I was maybe expecting him to correct me by saying “we call it Berkeley Haas” or something of sorts, but he was absolute serious. This had me thinking about the time People’s park (a park located right next to the campus made famous in the 60s for being a center for protesters) made the news and he didn’t know where people’s park was despite attending Berkeley in the 70s. I got major Mike Ross vibes after that."

This might be more of a rant but a reminder to look out for yourself, companies will do anything to save a buck and dont feel bad about saying no.

Before Christmas, my coworkers and I got notified that our contract was being canceled. They didn't give an end date but we were told to reapply for different jobs within the main company or take severence when its all over. They just told us on Monday that they want us gone by Friday.

The main company is located an 1hr 30 min away and they contract employees out to other companies to help maintain their equipment. These are long term contracts, like years long contracts so people move to be closer to the place they are contracted to or already live nearby.

I have been with the main company for 5 years but only been contracted since July. I had to move because of health and family reasons and since they needed a team lead I accepted the position.

When the contract was canceled years earlier then expected I was told to reapply for my old position at the main building and if I was hired back into it I would have to take a 20% pay cut because I would be starting over. Notice I said if. It wasn't guaranteed that I would even get my old position. 

Then they came back to me and said, ""Actually, they want one person to stay onsite to watch the equipment while its being taken out...how about you stay on and be on call for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? You can clock for only 40 hr a week but dont worry...if they call you, you can claim up to 4 hrs of OT. 

No relief and no replacement for months. I wouldn't be able to look for a new job, see family or friends and god forbid I had a doctor's appointment. I had to be close at all times and be ready to come in and work...while still loosing 20% of my pay because since ""i won't be doing anything most of the time so we are not going to pay you your 2nd shift team lead pay.""

I professionally told them to fuck off and give me my severence. They are currently scrambling to find someone because they waited so long to give us the end date that most of them found new jobs. The only person they have left besides me is a guy who is known to turn his phone off and not respond to work calls. 

Good fucking riddance to them"

For context: I work at a dog boarding, daycare and grooming facility. All of the employees are paid minimum wage regardless of tips, and tips are just bonuses on top of that.

1) Can my boss withhold tips from employees for poor performance? If yes, can he withhold tips from all employees as collective punishment for the bad performance of a few?

2) Even if he isn’t allowed to without tips normally, if an employee signs a contract saying he can with hold tips is he allowed to?

3) Can my boss only give tips to certain types of employees (like managers and room attendants) and not others (like receptionists)? Even if customers explicitly ask to tip the receptionists as well, or receptionists are doing pet care and grooming work like managers and room attendants?

Also, not exactly tips, but if a customer buys gifts for the employees (such as a box of candy or donuts) can my boss just take it for himself?"

The school has struggled to find new teachers and have now resorted to getting teachers to teach on zoom. The school has outsourced the labor of a math teacher to a teacher in the Philippines as to not pay proper wage to a teacher. No one in class learns, it is impossible to do math from a teacher over zoom, if this trend continues we will have a country of people who don't know math, and I know it won't stop at learning math. This system has driven away teachers from wanting a teaching job, it needs to be fixed. Teachers in the United States have the most power to change it. People aren't wanting to teach and this will have consequences, teachers need to go on a strike to make teaching a livable job, otherwise the United States will suffer."

You know the kind, they call themselves Christians. yet they probably have more skeletons in the closet than the local graveyard.   
After the last meeting fiasco, they had a meeting/screaming match with the ladies from HR about enforcing the mandatory church attendance/ contribution mandate and they eventually backed off after HR quoted directly from the state and federal regulations that said that they could not enforce that rule and the companies own attorney point blank told them NO.   


This lead to them having a meeting afterhours and drafting a bunch of company policies that they want to institute of which I posted a partial list of below  


1. Alcohol consumption (On duty and off duty) is STRONGLY discouraged. This includes partaking of  alcohol while at establishments such as Bars, Taverns and Nightclubs or at social events such as parties, weddings, etc. The company reserves the right to mandate drug and alcohol tests on individuals who are suspecting of having consumed alcohol at anytime during their employment  

2. Drugs are strictly prohibited at any time, this includes recreational drugs such as marijuana  

3. All employees are required to dress modestly at all times, no unnecessary skin exposure  


They also are floating the idea that in order to be promoted within the company, you must be a member of their church and actively tithe to said church via payroll contributions. They are also strongly pushing for us to contribute 10% of our weekly pay as a tithe to the church.    


These policies have already started costing us employees who don't want their lives dictated by these people. They even stated that if we do not give a proper two week notice, we then forfeit our final paychecks as a consequence.

While labeled as a contractor, I was truly a W-2 employee of the agency and not self-employed. This could be considered a temporary position. The role was extended three times, with me being told in December that I was essential to the team and would continue for at least three more months. 

In early January, while working on one of my reports, I was asked to pause work while the client's budget was confirmed and new deadlines could be set. Days went by with no updates, until weeks had passed without communication. I nearly missed the January 15th pay-day by less than five minutes as no one provided me an updated timesheet code to bill my hours when my original code expired.

I even do a happy dance when I find out. LMAO!

I am currently a FT corporate recruiter and a FT Master’s student in a clinical counseling program. For our Master’s program we have to complete a clinical internship. When I first joined the practice I am
at (will refer to as TPS) the team
of supervisors was aware that I work
fulltime and were willing to work with my schedule and things started off great. A couple to few months into internship my original clinical supervisor (will call him J) and the owner of TPS made some uncomfortable and alarming comments to me during a supervision call. 

He essentially was angry about another situation and took his feelings out on me stating “You have a fuck you face on and I’m going to need you to fix your face right now.” To which I replied, shocked and uncomfortable, that I wasn’t trying to have a fuck you face and just listening to him intently. This caused a rupture in our supervisor-supervisee relationship basically since then. I reported the incident to
my school supervisors, my
secondary supervisor at the practice, and then his HR manager (who is also his wife) had to get involved. We came
up with a plan to resolve the issue and I was sent that via email.

However, he did not abide by that plan and continued to be rude to
me during supervision, calling me names, speaking over me, raising his voice, etc. I had an additional two meetings with our HR manager about this. Finally, they hired an additional licensed supervisor and transferred me to her. A few weeks go by and I’m thinking everything is fine. Then I am told by one of the secondary supervisors (we will call her D) that J was telling everyone during an all supervisors meeting that I am the one that was causing trouble, swearing, not listening, not putting enough hours in, etc and that I am getting put on a PIP.

Is this grounds for a retaliation case? What do I need to do to get ahead of it? I really need help."

These people never answered my calls so I just didn't go in. Well of course I came in the next day and I was written up for a no call no show (fare enough I thought). 

I completed my day like another day, no hard feelings, or so I thought. The day when I was written up I came into the building with my hoodie on (it was pouring rain outside and I walk to work) and a supervisor told me to remove it, before heading to my locker. Like I said normal day was completed. The day after my write up, I came to work and was called into the office immediately. So I go in and that same supervisor that told me to remove my hoodie was there a wrote my ass up! (I guess wearing a hoodie in the first two minutes of my shift is a safety issue) I questioned why I was written up for this and not just given a verbal warning, they told me ""safety is the reason why!""

I was so devastated that I had to go home... This place is the worst, for more context, I've been here for about 5 months and they STILL haven't set up my direct deposit after two requests from me to do so, I was in an accident there due to my supervisor micromanaging me and looking over my every move (that wasn't a safety issue, but I wasn't ""officially trained"" how to use their equipment) I was just sent to do a clinic visit for the accident. I've had coworkers talk shit about me behind my back, because they thought I was a piece of shit, because I come in a do minimal socializing so I can complete my job and go home. I've been to HR regarding these issues, but as we all know HR isn't going to be on my side. There has been more bullshit that has happened to me here but it'll be too long to write out.

End of the day I'm just DONE working here, and by Monday hopefully I'll have a new job and I'll never go back to this place. I'm currently omw to this hell job and coming in 15 minutes late so I'll probably be called into the office AGAIN for a ""meeting"" and I dread everything about it, I honestly just want to be left alone so I can finish my days work but IDK if I'll be fired or mentally able to complete the day 🤷🏾‍♂️

Just had to vent thank u and go about having a good day."

Just saw on r/coolguides a chart of things Americans find unacceptable in virtual meetings.

Recently went through a situation where I was just started contracting and I was in a virtual meeting that was specifically for me to meet the individual who had half of my role prior, to ask them questions. One of the directors was there too. They didn’t contribute much conversationally because they didn’t know anything about the role. At one point they started vaping and then told us to continue chatting, that they were just getting up to replace their battery. 

Again, the director wasn’t saying much but they were moving around a lot. All while unmuted. I just decided to tune them out and continue with my meeting. But now I see them in their car, driving, shutting off their engine, what looked like they were now texting, to hear them turning on their engine again, car doors slamming, adult kids and grandkids in toll, banter from the other passengers in the car, and the director waited until the end of the call to bark at me “Don’t you ever cut me off again!” and “That was just rude. I don’t like being interrupted when I’m speaking. We don’t do that in my culture.” 

Eyebrow raised and slightly taken aback. But in a “Are you seriously talking about interruptions right now?” I was going to point out how disruptive they were but decided to apologize for unintentionally interrupting them but may I ask for clarification about when this cut off may have occurred. 

I straight up named the whole car scene to them and mentioned that I heard a significant amount of mic feedback but I was unclear that they were speaking to us in the meeting. The former contractor sort of pursed/bit their lips. I think they didn’t think I’d be so direct about it. The director responded yes, that it was when they were picking up their kids and grandkids.

Then there was another time this same director was picking up her sister, whose car had died on the side of the road in -5 F degree weather. I said “Oh no, would you like to leave to take care of that?” To which the director said “No, I’m good.” 

I remember hearing somewhere along the lines “There is no such thing as multitasking. You either are doing one thing really well or doing everything poorly.”

I didn’t stay very long with this organization. They had other issues. My friend who worked there that had recommended me to the role, was very disappointed in me leaving before completing the projects that had hard deadlines. He has a self-sacrifice mindset. He couldn’t believe that I could just up and leave without at least completing the work. I was only there technically for about 2 weeks. About 20 hours of work. I did not have a proper contract. I noped out of there after many failed attempts at clarity and communication.

Well, at least I won’t be interrupting anyone any time soon.

TL;DR: Left organization that had unprofessional virtual meeting etiquette and poor organizational structure but somehow I was the rude one. Friend disappointed I left unfinished work."

They patronize me, constantly bring up how much “younger” I am than the vast majority of the staff, and have made so many offensive comments about my work ethic and hobbies.

It’s so weird. Then when they realized that I show up every day, I’m willing to come early and stay late, and I’m a hard worker…they suddenly DON’T want me to leave. But they can also sense that I am on my way out the door. People keep asking me if I’m going to stay, and an HR lady who was initially rude and nasty to me was interrogating me about it today. She told me “don’t give up yet” and was weirdly nice to me. 

It’s just strange how they want to retain me as an employee, yet my coworkers barely train me and I still experience reverse age discrimination and random insults from staff. My manager has recently been nicer to me, since he realizes that I always show ip and am willing to work hard. But it doesn’t really make up for him treating me like a loser and a burden for an entire month. 

Seriously, how can they treat me like an incompetent bimbo or like gum on the bottom of their shoe…yet get visibly frustrated and annoyed when I seem to want to leave. 

With the way I was treated, I really believed they wanted me to bow out. But the HR lady got all offended and asked me for my orientation folder back (which no employees are asked to return) after I met with her today. She clearly thinks I’m going to abandon them and was basically begging me to keep going and to stay. But I guess I wasn’t enthusiastic enough for her. 

It’s so weird. Like, what did you expect after treating me with zero respect for over a month? And now you suddenly want me to stay lol. They will probably find a way to force me out, since they seem convinced I am going to quit"

Currently I work with a company that has a contract with a staffing agency.  The agency employees are referred to as ambassadors.  In my department we have a nosy lead who leaves his projects to nose in on the projects of other leads.  If an ambassador is not performing to his satisfaction he will shake their chairs and mockingly say ""ambassador!"". He is also very liberal with the write-ups.  If he writes up an ambassador he will laugh at them.

We have issues with some of the other employees who catch other people's mistakes.  Again if a company employee makes a mistake it is put on display and the employee is laughed at for working like an ambassador.

Last night the manager rewarded my attendance with an attempt to train me on a label machine.  She promised that an experienced mechanic would take care of me.  He gave me a brief, and maybe incomplete, explanation of everything.  While the machine was running he stepped away letting another mechanic take over.  The second mechanic criticized everything and changed all the settings.  The lead in charge and the second mechanic complained about me not knowing anything.  Another lead came by to laugh at all the ""ambassadors"" messing around.

Thank G*d that the nosy lead was moved to a building on the other side of the facility yesterday.  His presence would have led to me getting a write-up.    I am going to have a few things to say to management when my shift begins today."

Im working through a temp agency and they told me my schedule would be from 6am to 4:30pm Monday through Thursday with occasional mandatory overtime when needed.

Today I found out that is not quite the case.

My supervisor held a meeting for my team and told us that we would all be required to come in Friday. Well shit, that sucks but alright, fair enough. A few minutes later, I also found out that our team is divided up into three groups. A,B, and C. These three groups would have to work one day (rotating) every single week during the three day off period. Group A was supposed to come in Friday, but now that it's mandatory for everyone, it doesn't make a difference. I'm in group C and now I also have to come in on Sunday. On top of that, those weekend shifts begin at 5am. I will now be working 50+ hours every single week.

Somehow I went from 3 days off to 1 day off and then working 6 straight.

Pretty frustrating to say the least.

She received a message in the group chat that one of the places has been infested with bedbugs. On a side note my friend has had red bumps appearing all over her body thought it was acne so she was trying everything to make it go away which now makes sense why it didn't. So obviously we prison searched our apartment and luckily don't have them as she washed all her clothes and bathed everyday trying to get rid of the ""acne"" 
So now to the current issue obviously she doesn't want to go back to that house and told her manager as much but was told she has no choice and they need people there. I told her to report them and get a doctors note stating you can't be in that house which she's in the middle of doing. 
My question is if they fire her is she able to do anything legally or is it even legal to force disabled people to endure the bugs? My friend only sat on the couch in the daytime so the infestation has to be pretty bad and we're worried for the clients as they don't even leave the house except for doctor appointments and sometimes grocery shopping so they obviously didn't give it to themselves we suspect one of the morning crew has it and gave it to them. 
Her job also has her work doubles occasionally which means she would go from the infested house to a clean house right after the other with no way of cleaning themselves or their clothes beforehand so obviously it's going to spread and they don't care. Her manager even accused us of having them which is outrageous and why would we be fighting so hard not to go back if we didn't already have it.
Sorry just rambling and looking for options or guidance."

I currently have a part time job that pays $25.80/hr 12hrs a week. I can’t figure out if I should get an additional part time job or get a full time job with benefits.

The hours aren’t guaranteed sometimes I work more hours and sometimes less with no PTO or paid holidays. These full time jobs have 1hr lunches as well so it’s really like a 45hr work week vs 30/35hrs a week. But hours would be stable.

5,2024-02-07,My toxic boss remains protected and I don't know if I should open up an HR case of my own against her,u/Medium-Lettuce6584,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1alipwr/my_toxic_boss_remains_protected_and_i_dont_know/,antiwork,"My coworker got PIP'd completely wrongly because our boss wanted to have more evidence to terminate her employment. Due to my urging, my coworker sent an email to our boss' boss letting him know that she'd like to work on a different team and that she didn't expect to be laid off since every meeting during her PIP period was concluded with good feedback from our boss. He forwarded this email to HR (mind you, we work in TA, a sub-branch of HR), and they opened an investigation where my coworker was able to tell them all the horrible things our boss has done and they also followed up with me and I was able to provide my info as well.
Our boss has straight-up, called a previous worker stupid, said she lied on her resume, and bullied her relentlessly. Instead of this going to HR, our boss' boss handled the issue himself and switch me and the other girl so that I ended up on my current team. Our boss is also a notorious micromanager to the point she has destroyed my confidence because I have to do my job (which I just got promoted for doing so well) exactly how she tells me to do it, right down to titling meeting invites exactly what she wants them titled. Being puppeteers by her has also destroyed my memory because I have to do things in the way that she thinks, I'm not allowed to do my job the way I would normally do my job. I also want to add that I have worked this same position under other managers and was never treated like this, always received good feedback, always felt like I wanted to grow in what I do, so it's not me, it's because she wants to control. Other managers outside of our team have also apologized to other for her behavior and no one wants to work with her. 
With everything I divulged to HR *in writing* I really don't think they did an actual investigation. Since my coworkers PIP wasn't officially closed out for almost a month because they were busy ""investigating"" the allegations,  she finally had a meeting with them today and they said they investigated her claims about the PIP being retaliatory, which neither she nor I complained about, and that she would be moved to another team. When the investigation started, they had a convo with me as well, I sent them a long email about an instance that occurred afterward, and I also sent a 4 page document detailing how she has affected me and made my life hell (but worded much more eloquently), so I think they are sweeping this under the rug by gaslighting my coworker into saying that the investigation was something else and not about our actual manager, all so they can keep her here. 

Should I keep my head down or open up my own case with HR? They said time and time again that retaliation is against our values and our manager has retaliated a lot to us, she hates my coworker for no actual reason and was initially planning on training her to take over our department. My coworker performs well and my Manager has confided in my some pretty nasty things about her thoughts on my coworker, so I know that this isn't fair. This is a very large, global company and I don't see any reason that they can't separate someone that creates a hostile environment and makes every person working under her move to a different team or department. I am in the midst of getting my degree but I fear that if I open a case or prod this further, they will let me go because they're clearly protecting her for some reason.

Is this type of shit acceptable? Is it okay that I cry at work and I'm so mentally taxed at the end of each day that I can't live my life or study? Is there any reason this wouldn't be taken seriously?
I study HR and I'm being mentored by one of our HR Directors, so I'm just very confused why she hasn't been terminated for all of this."

2,2024-02-07,Confusing HR situation,u/OnyxField,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1alki0w/confusing_hr_situation/,antiwork,"Made a post to legal advice because an admin at my first job recommended it and I've made a previous post on here about it. I'll try and edit and add the links in a bit. When I went to post an update for more advice, mods said there wasn't anything the sub could advise on so I wanna post on here to try and get some insight or see what I can do because it just feels weird. 

TL:DR of first post:
One of my bosses reported me to HR as having an injury without my knowledge and forced me out of work until I could get a doctor's note. Even after clearing up the misunderstanding with HR, they still required the note.

TL;DR of legal post:
HR recently gave me an ultimatum of resigning or providing a doctor's note to return to work. They didn't want any sort of compromise on the situation and wouldn't reimburse even with documentation that it would be extremely difficult for me to get the note. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do legally to stay employed or if there was any wrongdoing on their part.

The update and where things stand now:
After the HR representative gave me the ultimatum, I emailed back asking for specific clarification on each point made that led to the ultimatum and it resulted in two very firm choices: provide a doctor's note quickly or resigning in good standing and reapplying at the end of the month when the situation is more favorable. 

With my situation as it was, reapplying wouldn't really make much sense for me since I'm in the process of restructuring a lot of things in my life and the company hasn't really treated me well work wise in the past (i.e. Notifying me an hour after my start time that my clients weren't coming in, constant lack of communication and consequences for client no shows, and lack of pay for the lost appointment times.) Overall, I was making maybe $50 max a week with all the shenanigans going on but stuck around because 1. I always feel bad about jumping ship really soon after getting a job and 2. Because I was constantly told it would get better.

With all that said, I chose to resign in good standing and asked that the ongoing project I had going on be completed by someone in the company if they wouldn't allow me to come in to complete it (literally just had to slap a label on a package and ship it). After I replied, I got radio silence for a whole day. Afterwards, I got an email from HR asking that I fill out some ADA paperwork in order to return (they said the paperwork could be filled out at most places without getting examined, so it would be free). 

I'm now confused and kinda sketched out. On one side of the aisle, I'm told that they initiated something without input/consent from me and made unreasonable demands surrounding it, and on the other side, I'm told that this is normal for HR and they should've just dropped me awhile ago! If all of this is fine and we could've parted ways, why wouldn't they just let me resign? And if they wanted to work with me, why didn't they offer this mysterious paperwork in the first place and not when I'm agreeing to resign??

My social worker commented on the situation that the company is maybe backtracking due to the potential of being sued...but if that's the case, what am I legally missing??!?

I'm sincerely confused..."
1,2024-02-07,"I’m tired of blaming people for classism, Hear me out",u/MayUrShitsHavAntlers,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1alkjus/im_tired_of_blaming_people_for_classism_hear_me/,antiwork,"I’m a socialist. Let’s get that out there. I believe Marx was god present on Earth for us mortals to try and comprehend. I am not a capitalist apologist and I am, if you look at my post history, further to the left than most in this sub. Now….what I propose is this. 

Class warfare isn’t a personal thing.

What I mean by that is that the people who have money, the billionaires, the trust fund babies, alt-right politicians aren’t the cause of our problems. These people are simply living life to benefit themselves and I’d ask each and every one of you to look into your souls and decide whether or not yourself and your family would come before our movement. I’ll tell you right now that my personal interest and even before that my families interest would come before my allegiance to socialism. I’m an atheist, we have 80 or so years on this Earth, I wanna do good but I also don’t want to waste it. 

If the “enemy” isn’t the cause of our problems what is? It’s the system. It’s capitalism. For most of you this won’t come as a surprise. BUT for most of you, and myself until about 6 months ago, I focused my hatred in the wrong direction. I focused my irritation at a peon in the class warfare system, the billionaire and so on. They are peons just like us they are just the lucky ones. They have no more control over the system than we do, they just use it to the best of their advantage just as we would.

I’ll give you an example. Bezos. We love to hate him. It’s a public company, why in the shit are we putting Amazon’s failures at his feet? In the system as it is, he’s going to buck it and commit illegal acts to give the lowest guy a $5/hr bump at the expense of the stockholders? No, he isn’t and it doesn’t matter if he wanted to, he can’t.

Occupy WallStreet is another example. I was huge into it at the time. But again, the enemy isn’t real. Wall Street isn’t a thing. It is a conglomeration of people. All of those people are for the most part decent people who are trying to provide for themselves and their families. Making “Wall Street” into a physical being that we could hate was stupid in retrospect. It was always capitalism that we hated. Wall Street and the people who trade on it are a product of capitalism not the creators of it just like Bezos is a product. 

Any time I get into an argument here it is almost always about this point. We need to stop blaming humans for the ills of society because humans are predictable. We will always be self-serving. We need to start blaming capitalism and focus our energy on this much much more difficult goal of creating a metaphysical enemy out of an idea. If we can’t we will just be grinding tires into mud because anyone who says they won’t look after themselves and their own first is lying. "

I've covered during phases where basically my whole team got sick (especially in-between Christmas and New Years) and every single vacation (1 in Sept, 1 in January) I've asked off was planned before I got hired at this job in August. I negotiated getting those planned days off as part of me accepting the job offer.

They respected those, but I have not asked for any additional time off since. They were generous enough to give me a 3 day weekend for Christmas even if I had to leave and come home early on Christmas day so I could go to work on the 26th. I don't have PTO, and I'm now the only one at my job that doesn't get 2 consecutive days off. I'm also the newest hire, and the youngest. I'm trying my best to leave this job for something better, but in the meantime my friends really want to take a trip in March. March is basically a forbidden time to ask off in my industry because it deals with plants, and spring is when it's busiest, like a Walmart at Christmas.

Well, I figure if my coworkers can take a week off between Christmas and New Years by being sick (and whether or not it was legitimate, I don't know and don't care), then I can fall ill for 3 days in the spring. I'm not even going to bother asking for it, because I know they won't give it to me, and I'm not missing out on spending time with my friends.

383,2024-02-07,Low-Paying Job Asked Me To Drop Out of Harvard “to be available for them at all times”,u/AbigailWilliams1692,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1alnppd/lowpaying_job_asked_me_to_drop_out_of_harvard_to/,antiwork,"I was just offered a position (that is not a standard 9 to 5) at a major airline that pays under $40,000 a year - and that’s with an MBA - in a city with one of the highest costs of living in the world. I only have 5 hours total out of every week that I have a prior commitment, and that prior commitment ends in May. That prior commitment is a graduate degree in progress at Harvard University. 

This is my last semester of synchronous courses, and they are online. Today, I was told if I want to keep my job, they expect me to drop out of Harvard University. For a company that claims to care about the well-being and education of their employees, they are certainly eager for me to destroy everything I’ve worked so hard for in the name of earning less a month (before taxes) than the average cost of studio apartment rent in my city. 

Hilariously, they baited me into attending orientation a three hour flight away from where I live by pretending I could talk to the staff there about my existing commitments and have my schedule adjusted accordingly, only for that same person to then tell me upon arrival that it was them or Harvard. They proceeded to give us a manipulative speech about how it was harder to get a job with them than to be accepted to Harvard and how this airline would help “open doors to where we want to be.” 

On one hand, it’s insane that they think they can reasonably demand I give up a graduate degree at Harvard to make less than $40,000 a year before taxes. On the other hand, I have been living in poverty as a student and at times facing starvation, and the job market is so miserable that I have to genuinely consider it if I want to survive. 

I just hate that they put me in this situation, because I thought I was finally going to have a decent quality of life, the opportunity to see the world, and maybe even the chance to eventually become a pilot. Now I am potentially going to be blacklisted from the industry and not be able to afford to keep a roof over my head this month unless I give up on my academic future and dreams of going on to medical school (my current degree program would work well with a medical degree in certain positions)."

The company seems great; the recruiter has been very communicative. I had my final interview, told me as a “culture fit” interview.

Everything went fine, lasted about 45 minutes with most of the talk being anecdotes and stories from a C-level.

I have no bargaining power as I’ve been unemployed for a while now (6+ months).

Abruptly I was told the job became a 3 month contract to hire.

While this isn’t a huge deal, this was never discussed with either side; ie the recruiter or the company.

I asked what would happen to my insurance if I ever wanted to take time off/ got sick where I wouldn’t work 40 hrs or more a week. they told me “we’ll have to discuss that if it happens”. the district manager told me to my face that the company couldn’t afford to give all full time workers health insurance so the ones who seemed most “committed” or valuable would get it.

I quit, told all my coworkers why, and send them a document of their workers rights in CA.

I’ve been around my industry, and specifically my job long enough to know when I’m being lied to, or when code words are being used so they don’t get caught out telling the truth accidentally. This is a short story about one of those times. 

Last year there was looking to be, a “well considered readjusting of resources”, aka roster changes. In the 20 years I’ve been in this particular site they’ve adjusted the roster after creating it originally, 2 times. This would be the 3rd. 

It happened at a meeting around September where all staff were advised to make time to attend, even on their day off (you’d be paid for the length of the meeting, I live very close by so I attended on my day off) when I arrived I saw staff were outnumbered by management and representatives 2 to 1. 

This in itself isn’t really a concern, whenever we have meetings it’s always top heavy. What was of interest was there was a union representative as well, (someone you’d assume would be on our side)

The set up was a little shall we say, confrontational. The staff were on one side of the table, all the management were on the other. 

We got down to business. At this point we had not been told the purpose of the meeting. That’s a red flag. 
They announced the meeting was part of the consultation process to look at restructuring the roster. 

I stopped them right there. (Well, maybe after another sentence or two) and got out my wallet (yes I’m old) took out a $50 note (I know, cash, how quaint) and said (I’m paraphrasing from memory) 

“I bet you $50 this isn’t a consultation. I’m putting money on the table to say what ever you tell us is the plan you’re “looking at doing”, will, irrespective of any and all issue, concern or complaint we make, will be implemented at its future date completely exactly as it’s being presented today. 
You won’t change a thing, because this isn’t about consultation it’s about preparing us for change you intend on implementing”

There was a few embarrassed looks and more than a little ‘no no you’ve got it wrong’ and ‘this is a transparent process’ but what was more concerning was the look from the union rep. They didn’t make eye contact and just looked down. 

When our worksite was set up the roster was implemented specifically to service how it would run, what was needed and providing the best service to the client. 
About 10 years in they slid the start time back an hour and a half, causing a considerable change to what each shift would be responsible. (The reasoning for this was to make the start and finish times more attractive to staff, the attrition rate is high) 

5 or so years later they the slid the start time back another hour, again, changing responsibilities and routines. (The reasoning this time was to bring us into alignment with other sites so as to make it more uniform and easier to manage) 

This time, the change, as it turned out, was reducing additional hours that were currently in place to provide specific services. Those services would end. 

The meeting went for an hour or so. Any time a staff member came up with a particularly good point as to why X was a bad idea, or offered Y as an alternative, I waved my $50 note and said ‘any takers?’  

Well, fast forward to this week there was an email. 

The changes will take place in March. 

Exactly as they were presented in September 

Lesson: the bookie won’t take your bet if you’re putting money on a fixed result."

I called off and my manager himself is really nice and told me to come back when I'm feeling better, it's the company policy itself that I hate.

A new group recently bought our company so they are making bunch of changes. Before if you called off you'd get an attendance point that would fall off after a month. So for me I got 3 points for each day, so each point would've fallen off after a month and I'd be at 0 points after 3 months.

The new company made it so now instead of 1 point a month, all of your points fall off after a whole year. Basically have perfect attendance for a whole year. Ohh also you can't be late cuz getting even half a point will reset the timer.

So let's say you're 8 months in and for some reason you arrive a minute late and get a point, your timer for all the previous points will reset as well, better be perfect the next year now.

Having perfect attendance isn't an issue for me, it's the fact that I have 3 points and god forbid if I have an emergency and need to call off, one more point and it's a write up. It's extremely nerve racking because a year is a long time. My friend says it's their way of getting rid of people without having to fire them."

It cost them thousands.",u/collector-x,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1alqy96/got_fired_but_the_company_did_not_have_my_final/,antiwork,"This happened 8 years ago. No names will be used as it could still come back on me.  Also, I am very aware of my states employee rights policies, as I had to help write an employee manual at a previous job, a few years earlier.

Onto the story.

I now work for a national craft store chain.  The department I was in had regional managers (RM) over this particular department.  We had an inspection and I was told certain policies were going to be changing.  I told the RM this was a bad idea as it concerned customers items that could be damaged and gave an example of this very situation that had occured the previous week. RM did not like her instructions challenged and was pissed that I would dare question her.  

A week later, 2nd week of the month, 3pm on a Thursday, I get pulled into the store manager's (SM) office along with store assistant manager and corporate HR on speaker phone. I am informed that I am being let go for not following directions & push back on company policy.  They have a paper for me to sign, listing out the discretions.  They are all true.  I try to explain my actions to SM & HR  explaining that compliance with the new policy, which  I tried to explain to the RM as well, could open company to lawsuits for damage to customer's personal items.  

Apparently, the RM is the one that forced SM to fire me because RM doesn't like to be questioned.  

Fine, so i sign paper and ask for my final check.  SM, tells me it will be issued at the end of the month along with everyone else's. I point out that this is against state law and I want my check now.  (~ $1200). SM seems confused and corporate HR says company policy is all checks, regardless of state policy will be paid at end of the month which is the next pay period. I just say OK and walk out the doors. 

As soon as i get home, i contact a wage attorney, explain what happened and he says he will email me a packet to look over and sign giving him permission to initiate the lawsuit.  Disclaimer, which I think every attorney has, is that if my side loses, I will have to pay his fees.  They are $400/hr.  

In my state, if your final check is not given to you at the time of termination, then for every day it's late, the terminated employee is owed 8 hours of pay.  For reference, if the company waits till the end of the month, that's 15 days of extra pay they will owe me.  

My attorney tells me to go no contact with the company.  Do not answer any calls, let all calls go to voicemail, forward them along with any emails directly to him if they try to contact me.  He just tells me what I already know, that the longer they take, the more money i will get.  

Two weeks later, my attorney calls me and says they have settled and company will be sending him my final paycheck with 15 additional days of pay included. It was settled with gross pay, but they didn't want any tax liability issues, and so i agreed to withholdings so everything would be kosher on my W2. 

I get a Next Day FedEx delivery with my check along with some paperwork i have to sign and a statement showing the attorneys fees as well.  

I got my full pay, including the extra days which was about $3,000.  My attorney's fees were close to $9,000 and the company's attorney fees were $7000.

My attorney explains that I am entitled to a statement because the fees are part of the settlement and have to be disclosed per state law.  

In the end, because the company didn't cut me a $1200 check, it cost them about $19,000.  

The funny part in all this is that as part of the settlement, if I want to, i can still reapply to the company for any qualified open position. I laughed at that thinking, ""Yeah right. They're gonna rehire me if i apply"".  I doubt it."

This homeless guy would come in everyday and during my shifts- I would give him my free meals. I would ring myself food up and then give it to him since he was hungry. He said he didn’t have a name, so one day when ringing up his food- I put “ HG” short for homeless guy. Turns out, one of the new employees had been discriminated against ( at his last job and school for being both black and gay) and took it very offensively when I told him HG stood for homeless guy. Before I had a chance to explain- he told the shift lead, who walked me out for the day.. without even hearing me out. Am I in the wrong ? ( personally I think not- bc they didn’t even let me explain) plus the homeless guy seemed pretty pissed at the other employee when I told him what happened."

As soon as I wanted to use it I come back from break seeing that my desk was gone. I took matters into my own hands to get my desk back and now I have to wait weeks maybe months to get my standing desk again. Manager told me it’s better to have them keep it. And now I’m without a standing desk. This is bullshit. Wouldn’t it be better to let them wait for their proper desk and my desk come back to me? Thought about involving HR but it looks like they ordered me a new desk. No telling when it’s going to come. I’m furious. And my upper back is killing me.

Y'all's just people like the rest of us. 

For context, I work in IT. And let me tell ya, tech illiteracy is absolutely shocking. I could be so fucking lazy and dismissive at work and it wouldn't matter.This company NEEDS to use computers and no one seems to know how to except for 8 nerdy dudes that just end up playing chess or something all day. 

But like.. seriously how do some of these people continue to actually have a job? It's 2024. People have been born, lived relatively full lives, and died since home computers have been a thing. They're not really ""new"" to anyone anymore. And there's very standard operation across even different operating systems most time. 

But daily I run into people who, and I mean literally, do not know how to copy and paste. Additionally, they hostily refuse to learn how. And they talk to their bosses with this.hostility as well. 

""Well I don't wanna think about all this stuff."" Buddy i wish I got to pick and choose which parts of my job I got to give a fuck about. But you're a modern, professional office worker. You absolutely NEED to know how to operate a computer proficiently, and it wouldn't hurt to know some basic troubleshooting. These are qualifications. Expectations. Every position has them and if you can't fulfill them, for your own good and the companies, you should seek other work if possible. 

But no, they come in daily, call IT to get something done, then complain how hard their job is. I watch them walk around the office hanging out with their buddies and stuff. Goofing off having a great time while just an hour ago they were ""needing to get this done right now but don't know how!!"" 

Idk. The degree of ""I know I don't have to care because history says I don't get any form of consequence for being a moron"" is very, very out of hand in workplace culture. I don't know how these people stay employed. I'd be fired in a heartbeat, or at best put on a pip if told my boss ""no"" for nearly any reason. When he says jump I say how high, and I still don't feel like I do enough. I hate it here. It genuinely feels like the workplace is just a club for boomers to hang out at. I don't think they come here with the intent to put any effort in to begin with. 

Anyways there's my anti work post lol. Complaining about how coworkers who all happen to be above a certain age tend to get away with shit no one else would, and it's excessively unfair."
26,2024-02-08,How AntiWork Helped Me Gain a Healthy Relationship with Work,u/thecarpetfibers,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aluakn/how_antiwork_helped_me_gain_a_healthy/,antiwork,"A year and a half after I left what I now know to be an extremely toxic and unhealthy work environment, I'm writing to share both my gratitude and story, hoping that it can help someone much like this subreddit has helped me these past 18 months. Forgive the length, this feels almost like a testimonial.

TLDR: 

Antiwork's many commentors and posters have helped me understand that my relationship with work is not a relationship, it should be viewed as a transaction-- and that this transactional perspective is in fact very healthy. One might have relationships with peers and bosses, but be practical and skeptical in your trust-- and this, too, is healthy. You, your life, your family-- these are the things the deserve your commitment, heart, and passion. Your company has its own perogative, and your place in that machine is one easily replaced. Keep it transactional, keep it healthy.

A (long) story:

I used to hold a leadership position that I worked my way into over the course of a decade, overseeing a team of around seven supervisors and their 60 or so direct reports. I really loved my team; I had hired most of them-- and having done their jobs (and to a degree still doing them), I deeply empathized with the challenges and stresses it came with. Because I had moved up internally, I was doing far more than just my role, and due to the gradual departure of fellow leads, I eventually became the key knowledge holder for most of the sophisticated systems my department oversaw.

It made for a lot of stress, work, and hours, most of which I didn't fully realize because it was also mentally invigorating and satisfying. Two years before I left, the department began a massive multi-year transition of its financial systems, and even though my director was the workstream lead, I ultimately was pulled in to attend all of her meetings, because I was the knowledge holder. As time continued, I ended up taking on the defacto PM role for the project for my department on top of all of my leadership duties and day-to-day.

By the time a year had passed, my job had morphed into levels of stress that had me on blood pressure medication. My doctor had a very candid conversation with me, and so I finally sat down with my director and chief and asked to step down from my senior manager role and into an individual contributor position. I explained the impact on my health, the fact my husband and I were going to start IVF treatments in the next few months, and that ultimately, I could not carry on with the full load of both of these tremendous responsibilities.

They said they understood and supported me, and that they would begin the job hunt for my role's replacement, but that they didn't want me to lose my seniority-- that they would create a new role for me. I was so excited and touched. I now understand I was very naive. Had I the perspective I have now, I'd have realized it was lip service to stretch me out as long as it was helpful to them. Because that's what happened.

As stress levels in the department increased, and as my time got more and more wrapped up in the project, my director began to involve herself far more directly into daily operations and conversations. I'm sure she meant to help-- she often started from a place of wanting to be a hero, but her ineptitude and lack of knowledge meant she would invariably ruin things and then throw tantrums over it. My supervisors began quitting. Shortly before Christmas, I had three walk out in one go, all citing the director as their reason-- they put in their exit interviews they had only stayed because of me, and if I wasn't going to be their manager, then it wasn't worth it. Turns out that my director read those comments-- that might have been when she began to pivot from simply taking advantage of me to full on targeting me.

The teams that reported to those supervisors suddenly were assigned to me. I now had over 20 direct reports plus the entire department's operations and the giant project. I began having panic attacks. I started to document and raise my risk concerns about the lack of shadowing or redundancy around my responsibilities. I escalated these concerns to the project owners after both my director and chief ignored me for months. 

After the project owner talked down my director, my director gave me yet more work. I didn't realize it then, but I understand now that this was a tactic. I've also learned that she began citing me as the reason for certain blockers or project problems to anyone who didn't work with me directly, effectively creating an air of concern around stakeholders within the project who wouldn't have first hand knowledge of the reality. It was around this time that I also reached out for mental help through EAP and began meeting with a therapist. My therapist pointed out the toxic nature of my relationship with my director-- how much of her behavior tracked with the emotional abuse I grew up with from my mother. Therapy helped me realize that the only way things would change would be if I left.

Finally, over the summer, with the supposed go-live date scheduled for that August, I shared my notice, that once the go-live was successful, I would be leaving. I cited the ongoing health problems, the lack of support or risk mitigation, the impact on my mental health, as well as the upcoming IVF treatments-- that I had to make a change in order to reprioritize and that my current job place couldn't provide for that. I shared this with HR as well, as it was a soft-notice.

A few weeks later the go-live was pushed to the following year, and so I put in my proper notice, giving six weeks so that I could transition project responsibilities and everything else. Without any coordination between us, the other senior manager in the department also put in her notice, with her last day a week before mine. She was older than me and definitely wiser; she opted to not do the exit interview. I did, and I shared a full documentation of all of the bad acts and behavior I had witnessed over the years from my director, including several specific incidents that would put the firm at potential risk for a law suit from an employee.

A few of the project leads met with me directly, to try and convince me to stay, and to ask questions. I was candid across the board. Again, I naively thought that my reputation and hard work over the years would mean I was protected from retaliation. I was stupidly, stupidly wrong.

The day after I turned in a fifty page transition document, I was pulled into a morning call with HR and my director. They had a 'present' for me-- today was my last day (a week early), and that they would pay me for my remaining week.

It was, honestly, devastating for me. My department felt deeply personal, and in not being able to say good-bye to my coworkers (a fully remote team) and wish them well, it hurt alot. In addition, I had been part of leadership-- I knew why we pulled resignations early. We did this when someone was disgruntled or might create harm to the firm. It felt like a punch in the gut.

A week later, we learned that our IVF treatments had worked; we were finally pregnant. I had another job lined up, more of the same, but at a much lesser scale, and in a moment of what felt like craziness, I withdrew my acceptance. I wanted to wait until after the first trimester. I had almost three months of saved PTO being paid out to me, plus savings, and my husband's government job meant that we could cover COBRA during that time. We were incredibly priviliged-- I know. 

But taking those two months and change off was the best thing I ever did in my professional life. My brother recommended this subreddit to me; he said, ""They're a bit rowdy, but I think it'll help you."" He was right. I began reading posts here daily, scrolling through in between morning sickness bouts, and slowly evolving from 'that's so radical' to 'you're absolutely right!' in my headspace.

Those two months of reading this subreddit helped me deprogram. I had effectively left a cult, and my mindspace was still primed for indoctrination. The timing of those two months meant that I made another crazy decision. With a handful of offers from a lateral field, I chose the one based on the impression my potential future boss left me with. Antiwork helped me make the right decision.

A year and a half later, my relationship with my job is healthy. I have firm boundaries for myself that I respect and protect. I no longer feel ashamed or anxious any time I think about my former job or boss-- instead, after the anger passed, I feel properly ambivalent. I also have a lovely nine month old daughter, and I am happily present with her, both physically and mentally.

I also recommend r/antiwork to all of my former employees who reach out to me, asking for guidance because they're finally ready to leave.

So thank you r/antiwork. You kind of saved me."

9,2024-02-08,How to explain “gap in my resume” where I was actually working hard as hell?,u/verythrowawaywoww,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1alv1pw/how_to_explain_gap_in_my_resume_where_i_was/,antiwork,"So in July of last year, two trees hit my house and caused significant damage. That same week, my boss tried to “renegotiate” my contract to be $5 per hour less than minimum wage, believing I needed the money so badly that I’d accept. I did not. Long story short because she did some shady shit, I ALSO wasn’t able to collect unemployment.

When all of this happened, my partner and I decided that he should become the primary breadwinner and I should become a stay-at-home partner and deal with the insurance stuff, renovations, etc. to overall increase our quality of life.

Well that has turned into an almost year-long ordeal of trying to get my insurance to comply and getting the house fixed. I’m applying for jobs again now because I’m going a bit stir crazy. Every job I interview with asks about the “gap in my resume”, and I briefly explain that after declining an illegal contract re-negotiation, I took that opportunity to spend time using my trades experience to restore my home. Multiple places have cited my “gap in marketing experience” as the reason they’re not moving forward with my application.

It’s not like I’ve been sitting on my ass for 6 months, I’ve been working my ass off doing hard mental and manual labor every damn day. It’s just not something I could list on my resume like a “normal” job. 

Any suggestions for either something to put on my resume during this gap or how better to explain “yeah I wasn’t coding 8 hours per day for the past 6 months but I also wasn’t just sitting on my ass”?

If it matters, I usually work in marketing, development, and programming."

Then I had to send in writing samples of what I'd previously done. Yesterday, I get an e-mail saying they want to schedule me for a 2 HOUR interview: 30 min would be performing a task in front of them, 30 min would be them reviewing it while I wait. Followed by an hour long board-style interview. Absolutely not.

Who knows how many candidates they're interviewing like this, but it not only completely wastes our time and is degrading to have to jump through so many hoops, but this is a PART TIME gig!

We do however do a sort of yearly goal setting, with your desired compensation is one of the goals you set.

I’ve heard through the grapevine that upper management is only giving raises to those, “that deserve it, that they’ve been meaning to give raises to others” — I guess ppl are in the pay bump backlog. I’ve also heard that any new considerations for pay increases would have to be around Q3 due to this backlog.

I’m pretty new in my career, how common is this? Is this common corporate bs to delay payment as long as possible?

Or am I wrong is this totally normal, give it time, raises are typically once a year anyways— better later in the year than never at all?

For context, this province was just hit with very significant snowfall, and employees working on snow removal were putting in very long days as expected.

One of these employees who was monitoring their hours noticed that they were shorted eight 1/2 hour periods on their cheque. The employer is pushing back saying it's been their policy (unbeknownst to the staff, including some management) to claw back lunch break time if the employee doesn't take their lunch break.

Worked at the company prior to this stores opening, day one employee. She was on GM number 3 or 4, we'll call him ""jag off"". She advanced to the highest level that still received tips, but refused salaried management. The old GM had her locked in on the schedule with plenty of overtime.

So when jag off takes over the store, first thing to go is the hours. But he cant cut them on the weeks where ""no one wants to work"", which, nobody wants to work there. So, most weeks. Well, jag off is highly discriminatory against older women and he gets a chance to fire wifey's bestie. So now hours are cut and her best friend is fired. She said some racist shit though, so that's that.

So now he tries to cut hours again. The GM prior to him had moved on to RD at another local place, and bestie was his AGM. Wifey gets hired there so that jag off can't call her in when it gets busy anymore. She also did it because upper management loves her, and someone with hundreds of regulars moonlighting over 10 hours a week is bad PR.

So jag off decides to call the ethics committee on my wife over comments made to another barista. It's clear cut discrimination by now, but we don't have the money for a lawyer for that kind of thing. People were already offering her jobs at her job, so she took an interview for an administrative assistant. Ok here comes the fun part.

Wifey puts in one weeks notice to jag off. Jag off does not work his scheduled hours, so he doesn't find out until 2 days later. He can't fire her for the other bullshit, so he fabricates a write up. The manager text chain on my wife's phone goes silent. The other managers snitch on him & tell her about the setup she's walking into. At this point, the other job's start day is secure and she's just going to hand the keys over and bail. She said she heard a song on the radio that pumped her up, IDK. She went for the jugular. He tried to write her up for a shitty close, left coffee in the urn and the drive through unlocked. 

She looks right at him (he is training another manager at the time, this started as a this is how you fire someone lesson) and says ""You wanna do this? Lets go. The drive through has a failsafe on it that wont allow the alarm to be set if its unlocked. If you actually did your fucking job and closed once in a while you would know that. I'm not signing shit, and if you ask me to I'll call corporate to review the tape, and we both know what's on the tape."" 

She started her new job yesterday, the owner gave her a dollar raise for handling it so well. I wrote the verbiage on the one weeks notice, made sure to use words that would trigger an HR exit interview. That would be the lady who is on vacation and already has to review the fabricated ethics bullshit."

They have a W-4 from me in which I told them to withhold the maximum amount. I can only assume that they were trying to avoid withholding until an employee made about the standard deduction? But to my understanding employers are required to withhold from the first paycheck. 

I owe around $600 which is manageable but not something I’m going to enjoy paying. I plan on calling the main office and seeing if I can figure out why they didn’t withhold. 

They did some shady shit so I am not terribly shocked. But I am interested in knowing how something like this can just happen? Do I have any sort of recourse here, besides just paying what I owe?"

This is mostly a vent post (also english isn't my first language, so apologies in advance).

I'm 38 and have been working in tech for 15 years now, I was content with work most of the time (even though I'm really not passionate about it). But I'm finding myself in a situation where I'm feeling my mental going down day after day.

For context, I'm looking to move from the big city to a smaller big city that would give me the possibility to live in a house with my family (3 young children and my wife), but for a number of reasons we have to wait for july before doing it.  
I wouldn't mind the wait but for one thing.. in april of last year I have been move to another team (against my will) after 6 years in my previous one (where I was confortable, efficient and had great collegues). The new team in smaller, waaayyyy less organised and above all, working on things that really don't interest me.  
It's been fine for some months but since december I can't bring myself to be interested about it, so I work slower, I can't stay focused... and the thought of having to keep doing that for 4 months (while still having to ""prove"" every day during daily meetings that I'm working) is really getting to me.

Now, I know 4 months isn't that much, and it will probably go by fast, but man, the day to day is hard to manage.

(Also, bonus point, my company that was giving remote contracts to people moving from the big city during/after covid is gradually shifting back to in office/hybrid mindset, so my plan to keep my work while moving is f\*cked, adding to my mental baggage since I'm the main provider..)"

When I first started working from home (during Covid), I got permission from my company to do personal business on my work computer. I store anything personal on my private cloud drive (MS OneDrive), and work stuff on my company's cloud drive. The reason I did this was because my home desk doesnt fit my work computer and monitors, and also my home computer and monitors, and I just thought it would be more efficient to just use the one computer and send anything personal to my cloud. I dont watch porn or visit sketchy websites on my company laptop, so I dont get into that kind of trouble. Its mostly things like checking my bank balances and paying bills online, booking personal travel, checking personal email, etc.  


Yesterday I bought a mouse jiggler. It works like a dream, but I wondered: does even the existence of a mouse jiggler indicate nefarious intent? Would I get into trouble at work for even having one on my company computer? (The drivers show up as ""USB Generic Device."")  I am salaried, and I work daily until my work is done, and often work more than 40 hours per week (for which I dont get paid OT).

Second manager was a die hard ass kissing type of individual who was simply insane- multiple people went on leave of absence because of their existence as a human. Third manager is the most cringiest, micromanager to simply exist on planet earth. Third manager existence truly taught me the definition of “middle management”, where they use corporate language excuses from whatever they’re told from the man upstairs, makes empty promises to make you think they’re protecting you, to then CONSTANTLY ping you and everyone else individually for any and all dumb reasons, so at the end of the day, they can “look” like the best fucking manager! When in actuality, they’ve done completely nothing to benefit our teams life, yet they think it’s sunshine and rainbows on their team. 

Third manager doesn’t have any voice at the company to give us raises, but constantly tells us how fucking great of a job we’re always doing. The only thing they can do for us is give us one of those award certificates and fake medal THAT YOU GET IN GRADE SCHOOL. What a fucking joke of a manager to ever exist.

It’s a depressing thought that our society has equated the word “job” with everything we could possibly want to do. Examples include how everything now needs to generate revenue, everyone needs a side hustle, and the only reason why you should buy anything is because it is or might become an “investment”/“asset”.

Whatever happened to hobbies? What happened to toys, playthings, collectibles that you had because you just thought they were cool? Everything nowadays needs to be for a reason, a scheme. I miss being a kid and just thinking about toys and tech as cool shit, not as production equipment or investments. Biggest example for me right now is GPUs and houses. Used to be that you bought a GPU for $500 because you wanted to game. Now we’re figuring out cost/return metrics in terms of bitcoin mined vs electricity spend or how much time is saved on your renders and how that’ll affect how many you put out for a client. Houses are now commodities that you should buy or sell to generate revenue or as an investment for a 3% average return over 20 years.

Hi all, 

UPDATE: Fiancée just got fired one week into a three-week PIP that she was put on for “spreading dissent,” including potentially trying to form a union and organizing a letter on behalf of a department head who was being laid off.  

The company provided no justification for her firing — they wouldn’t tell her why — and that the PIP actually wasn’t agreed upon or an official PIP. Her computer access was immediately revoked. 

This isn’t the first time this self-labeled “progressive polling firm” has retaliated like this. They are at-will but surely there’s some legal remedy for us here? Job is based on DC, we live in NYC. 


Original post:  

So my (29M) fiancée (26F) works at a political place with HQ in DC (we live in NYC) and it’s an absolute mess. 

They have no HR department right now and recently fired their diversity department person early after they were going to get rid of her position, they LIED about the fact that was happening, and then fired her early for telling people about them lying. There was absolutely no accountability for that but my fiancée — who also briefly tried to organize a union before fizzling — led and wrote a letter to management in support of her friend keeping her position before they fired her. 

Anyway, out of the blue today — just two weeks after being told she was doing a good job — my fiancée had a meeting with her supervisor who basically gave her a three week performance plan (including a section about “bringing concerns to leadership rather than spreading dissent to others”) or she will be fired. 

Even more absurd, apparently the COO personally wanted her fired immediately, out of the blue, but her supervisor basically argued for a three-week performance plan. 

The writing is on the wall and she’s almost certainly facing an impossible climb to keep her job. And given the “dissent” comments in the performance plan — and the COO personally wanting her fired — it seems like extremely blatant retaliation for being outspoken at the company. 

The job is at-will with no union so my question is, what can we do? She’s going to document everything and ask for frequent status updates, but do we have any legal remedy whatsoever? Any protection from firing solely for being a company “troublemaker”?"

Just a little rant about my current job: I left my 3-year comfortable job for a position with more challenges, a higher salary, and work-from-home benefits. Little did I know that communication would be one of the challenges. 

Three weeks in, and I already felt the tension due to the stress of working in a much smaller company. My previous company was larger, and tasks were more evenly distributed, so you could say I came from a corporate background, lol. 

I am currently in the creative industry, yet I find myself packing in the warehouse and doing retail for at least a few days since I started my new job. My colleagues (if you can even count them, there are only two) haven't been supportive and basically threw me into the ocean to swim. Despite being able to fully work from home, I was expected to learn about the products, retail, run around to meetings and stores, and meet a few super tight deadlines of my normal job scopes, all within the first 3 weeks. 

Never in my life have I thought of quitting within 3 weeks of starting a new job - until this one! 

My bosses said they are too busy and to consult my colleagues, yet my colleagues are unresponsive when it comes to asking for help, leading me to also manage the communication between vendors for unrelated stuff. One of them even said something very annoying: basically, I asked how do I know how I am performing since I am unfamiliar with the bosses, as previously in my ex-company, my boss would say something like ""good job"" or ""nice work,"" but it isn't oftenly used in this company, and she asked me a question: ""Is it because I need the validation?""

I am being asked to run silly errands by the same colleagues who can't even take time to answer my questions. 

Boss recently left a feedback saying my designs should be more thoughtful, which is basically not even a constructive feedback. I don't have time to go through the tasks as I am given such a tight timeline for everything. 

I am at my wits' end. Am I overreacting or is it time to leave? I broke down today while working from home because I only left my desk thrice - for toilet breaks and lunch. I was sitting the whole day and barely moving. Even though I stopped myself from doing overtime but i still feel like shit."

Now HR is telling her that they can only offer 10% now and the remaining 10% in a few months time (by the way even after the 20% raise she was still close to the bottom 25th percentile of salary for her role. 

Is there anything she can do?"

So if I had a few days off sick, I'd be stressed to hell thinking how I'd pay my bills. While my managers and Ceo's could have weeks or even months off and not have to worry about their bills. 

How do they control us working class to live the same day over and over and generally most people don't question it? 

I'd actually love working if I knew the work I did benefited my own people, instead I get exploited for being paid the minimum and the company that brought something from the company I work for also got exploited because of the huge climb in cost they had to pay for the product. Why have people allowed this to continue? 

Any system has to be better than this one?
The people are divided and it's such a shame, the only place people actually seem to tell the truth is on the Internet.. it's sad af!"

I have been leading the classroom, doing all of the organization and cleaning, leading the kids and discipline, doing all of the actual teaching and learning. I am the one that plans and prepares activities and things. I am doing a lead job as a TA, and I’m so sick of being taken advantage of. I have literally put my blood, sweat, and tears into my kids and the classroom.

I love the lead as a friend, but in a work environment I am being very taken advantage of. How can I go about this professionally?

I think I just need to vent. I told my supervisor hesitantly a couple weeks ago that I was pregnant with my first child (I was about 5 months at the time) and planning to take 12 weeks of maternity leave. I am a therapist with a case load and wanted to give her time to plan for someone to take over my cases while I was gone. 

The company I worked for is a large-ish non-profit agency that has a lot of government grants and contracts. Yesterday morning I attempted to log into my email and was unable to. I called my supervisor who was confused and told me she’d talk to her supervisor and get back to me. Last night she sent me a text letting me know there were several other employees this happened to, and to call the front office to get a to get a ticket from IT. 

This morning I get a call from our VP, who’s only been working there for about 2 months. I’ve never spoken to him before. He says something to the effect of “I tried to put a meeting on your calendar in Teams, but I was told you couldn’t assess it”. I then spend the next 5 minutes on the phone where him and HR rep recite some bullshit to me about “comapny restructuring” and “loss of grant funding”.  I was blindsided. I’m due in 3 months and desperately need this insurance!! 

I worked as a therapist at this company for about two years. I think what is most upsetting is that they just hired three new therapist to our team. If we were lacking money, why lay me off and not a newer person? Why hire people at all? I’m almost positive it’s because I just told my supervisor about a month ago that I was pregnant and planning to take 12 weeks of maternity leave. I asked the HR rep if their reasoning was performance based and she assured me that it was not.  

Company’s don’t care about you at all. They don’t care that my family needs health insurance or that this is a huge stressor during my pregnancy. I don’t think I can prove that the lay off was due to my pregnancy, but is there anything I can do? Thanks for reading!"

I got an email from IT saying they are refusing to purchase the automatic transcription because the license for the software expires soon. They want me to MANUALLY transcribe all my audio. I did the math, it would take me nearly a month of full-time hours to transcribe the amount of audio I have by hand. So they want me to use the remaining time I have on that license to transcribe by hand, when I could use that time to analyze the data, since I need the software for data analysis too? Makes no sense. I could have this project done before the license expires if I use automatic transcription.

I previously asked if I could use a different, cheaper software to transcribe and they said no. 

I wouldn’t be in this predicament if they installed the software months ago when I originally asked for it."

Society determines which individuals have a large friend group and gets to be successful dating while determining who gets to be isolated, ostracized, and shunned. Society determines which individuals get to be wealthy while others starve to death. For people who thinks this isn’t eugenics, keep in mind Stanford University was founded upon the idea of eugenics in determining which kids are worth giving a valuable education while ignoring others.

She told me it's different than when she had covid before because it's worse?? I'm just. I'm at a loss. She said the expired test she took said she was negative but that doesn't mean anything! Does it? 

I don't know. I work in a restaurant, this is so ridiculous. She should be sent home. She wanted to go home. The GM said there's no one to cover her though for the single hour before close when she'll be alone, even though he didn't even try to ask people.

What can I realistically do, outside of just leaving? I only get paid 12 per hour for being a host this is not worth it. I'm honestly considering it, god I wish I brought my mask today."

2,2024-02-08,Mandatory overtime isn't enough apparently,u/MSRcap,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1am91yx/mandatory_overtime_isnt_enough_apparently/,antiwork,"I'm going to preface this rant by saying my boss is a good person; I was homeless for four months and he let my family stay in his RV on site till we got things figured out, but when it comes to work stuff he is a corporate line tower and seems to be completely clueless as to how things actually work. Today was the third time in two months I have had to let my blood pressure skyrocket to resist getting in a screaming match with him. 

So we are already scheduled 9 hours a day 5 times a week. In the time since I transfered to this facility our volume has trippled and we have added one person, but everyone in the shop with the exception of myself is regularly being sent out on the road and we are down one person as well. All of us have been staying 1-2 extra hours every day for months completely out of courtesy. 

My boss came up to me today, complaining that one of our machines was not loaded on Tuesday. Which was a little surprising because I saw he and sent someone to load machines that are always last priority. So I asked him about that and he said we didn't have what we needed to load these machines at the time. Which means the truck I was helping unload right up until 5 minutes past the end of my shift had what that machine needed. 

Now I felt like garbage that day and had no intention of staying late at all but the next driver is a personal friend so when she asked me to stay and help her unload I did. I didn't even realize a machine wasnt loaded and if she hadn't asked I wouldn't have stayed late enough to load it anyway. But he was mad that he, a salaried manager that has told us before ""my salary is for 7a-4p, had to come back in and load the machine. He said that if anything in the shop is not done at 4 he expects us to be willing to stay till at least 5 to do it. 

He does not seem to understand that our obligation ends at 4. He is the one who is responsible for making sure we meet our numbers and he is the only one who gets bonuses from that happening. I cannot fathom why he thinks we should give two craps if the company can't figure out how to get that done in the time we agreed to be there."

212,2024-02-08,I had a manager ruin a charity event I organized in honor of a coworker dying of pancreatic cancer by purposefully giving me a massive allergic reaction the day before.,u/thecodemachine,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1amanuh/i_had_a_manager_ruin_a_charity_event_i_organized/,antiwork,"At my last job, I worked hard, but I had a bit of an allergy to a coworkers perfume, and since that woman wouldn't stop, I was forced to make the office fragrance free.  It shouldn't be a big deal right?  Most people were accommodating (most people aren't spoiled toddlers), except management.  The VP of HR threw a hissy fit like she was a toddler (this was a fortune 500 company by the way), and started dowsing herself in more and more perfume to force me to quit.  Since I had a girlfriend who was a manager before, I knew that her actions were considered an illegal constructive dismissal, I reported it, and saved copies of emails, took pictures of hives, etc.  I knew that I was on the chopping block, one thing I learned is that executives are the most petty people you will ever meet.    


At the same time, I the person who sat next to me in the office was slowly losing weight and missing work.  He, got a diagnosis and announced at a meeting that he had terminal cancer, but he will be working to finish his project.  While I should have been focused on finding another job, I just wanted to help finish everything before he died.  I'm an athletic but older guy, and I do a lot of charity bike rides raising money, so I signed up for a 75 mile bike with Bicycling Battling Cancer, and gave $500, and got an extra $500 from my team.  I trained for a few months to prepare, which was extra hard because everyone was doing extra work to finish their job when we were down a person.    


When the weekend came up to actually do the 75 mile ride, I was there after 5 on a Friday and most people have gone home, a manager decided it was his chance to pull his prank.  He poured perfume in the bathroom, doused himself and went over to my cubicle, all the way pouring the stuff on the carpet.  I had it all over me, it was in my nose on my clothes, in my hair, and I immediately started getting hives and having asthma.  After that, he knew he fucked up, I just stared at him, and he tried scooting away.  I immediately sent an email to the entire HR staff, in hopes somebody was there, I told them I had an allergy and that it was caused by him, I have legal proof, and since this is a repeat offence by the company, that the company is liable for a toxic workplace, and I had the right to sue.    


I took enough Benadryl to put a horse to sleep, and I work up the next day at 5 a.m. still covered in hives, I put on cream to stop it.  I wrote on a paper that I was riding for my coworker, and just did it, very uncomfortably.  Hell, I trained for months to do this and people raised money for it, I didn't want an asshole to take all the hard work away.    


Who the F#@K, sabotages a charity event, over not being to wear as much perfume as you want.  3 months later, my coworker dies, leaving his two kids without a father.  And for the record, he hated the obsessive perfume too, people who do chemo develop an intense hatred for smells and tastes when going through it, SO STOP WEARING SO MUCH PERFUME, it isn't personal!    


I talked to HR about the issue later.  A lot of people were put on ""special assignment"", people were a lot nicer to me.  What I should have done was quit and sue, it was obviously a toxic work environment, but I just started coming into work at 11am, and not responding to emails and just doing nothing unless I was told, for a few month.  I was there, but you couldn't pay me to care.  I took every second of sick, vacation and  personal time to start traveling.  I went to 4 continents that first year.  You don't know what is going to happen, see the world when you get the chance!   After a few years I was laid off, and I was probably the only person they ever seen who was overjoyed to be laid off they had ever seen.    


If any hiring managers see this and judge me for quiet quitting after going through this, what is wrong with you.  Would you me rather start a lawsuit, with the closing arguments saying you harassed a chemo patient because we hire childish morons to run the company?  I am at a new company working 50-60 hour weeks, like a moron again, but at least my new employer respects their employees.  "

If you need more info please ask me it's just so much to explain I'm gonna try keep the post as simple as possible. 
My mom and I work(ed) for the same cleaning company, this company is run by a lazy nepo baby who never had us do any onboarding paperwork besides signing up to Gusto payroll. 
I worked there a few months more than my mom, and at that time my mom was in need of an advance and had been working for probably a month there. This would have been an advance on Hours Already Worked, it just wasn't quite payday yet. On Whatsapp she asked him in writing (he insisted on only communicating on Whatsapp) if she could have a 350$ advance on hours she had already worked. He said yes, sent it (days later because he's never known what it's like to need money) and said he would deduct it from her upcoming check and she agreed over Whatsapp text. She remembers her check that week being appropriately small in accordance to the advance as it was supposed to be a pretty sizable check, she's in the process of going back thru the gusto records to make sure and I will update this when I find out from her. It's been a good six months since then, she voiced her concerns about his management style a few times and I had the same problems with him as her none of it was unfounded complaining. After she voiced thise initial concerns he ignored us both for a week, then messaged her saying ""I need that 350$ I loaned you back soon."" It wasn't really a loan. She said that he was supposed to have taken it out of her check that same week six months or so ago and he claims he forgot to do that. She said shes pretty sure he did but that she will pay it back as she can (she is working on getting a place to live during a financial and medical crisis) just to be done with it and get him off her back. A bit later, maybe two weeks ago, she voiced more concerns and complaints about his unprofessional and exploitative management style because of something else that happened and he ignored her again. She just got paid (she gets her pay a day early with Gusto's program) and it was missing the 350$ he said she owed him. He never told her he would take it from this check and she never agreed to it being taken from this one as it's been months and months since the advance of already worked hours. My question is, is that legal, especially since he never had a policy for anything and if he didnt take it from that check following the advance that's his mistake and he should have got in writing with her which check he would take it from. She now can't pay her bills until her tax return comes in the mail as she expected this paycheck to be what she worked foe. Does this qualify as illegal deduction or wage theft? I'm sorry if this is a lot, I'm just fired up because hes been using us to death for a year and we are still somehow part time employees. We work every single day almost with no way to know when we will get a day off. He is constantly calling and messaging me about unimportant work things after hours. Quitting on the spot tomorrow morning, I already have a new job lined up and cant wait to be done with this fucker. I'll post a longer post tomorrow including my petty revenge. Thanks to anyone that can give me some advice or opinion on this. Hate seeing my mom be ripped around in difficult time."

Old boss (family friend) hired me with a verbal agreement through multiple people that my salary would be a specific number and I would have specific roles. I was doing contract work with him prior to this for the agreed upon amount and was being paid what was promised.

When signing employment paperwork, he left those spots blank because “we had already agreed on numbers and roles and it was quicker to just do it like that”. This is my fault I should have realized what was going on.

Started employment and he went against his agreement and payed me 10k less salary than what was agreed upon. I told him to fix it for weeks and it never got resolved so I stopped doing anything extra for him and leaving exactly at close and coming in a bit late to account for missing wages.

He got mad at that and had the audacity to accuse me of slacking off my entire employment because projects that needed his approval to progress did not get finished (he had multiple projects on his desk waiting for his input and he never got around to it) despite the fact that many times before this I was working from home after work an extra 2-3 hours to try to fix stuff for him. He even pulled my remote login logs to ask me what I was doing with all that time. Like really dude? All those extra hours trying to get shit done for you and you’re interrogating me about them?

So I left right then and there after telling him he doesn’t pay me to attend work after closing for “performance interrogations” nor does he pay my full salary.

This is a family friend so I’m trying to be nice to him and help him finish projects I was working on (under contracting at full pay) but all he wants to do is threaten me with legal action any time I go to help him. He keeps saying I violated my contract but upon requesting the contract be mailed to me and sent digitally as well for review, I have not received it in weeks. I would have already dropped this bs already if it weren’t for him blowing up my step dads phone talking about “oh I’m so lost I don’t know how to do all this stuff can you please convince him to come back and help me”. Which I knew would happen since he has no idea how much work I was actually doing or how anything works up there.

I feel like my family and I are being held hostage and he’s harassing me and my parents over a single supposed contract breach that he won’t send to me so I can review it despite me trying to be nice and help. I’d rather not have his and my parents friendship be jeopardized due to this as I would be hurting my parents.

Does anyone have any suggestions?"

I have a bachelor's and lots of experience in accounting. I needed something temporary and randomly applied to this Office assistant job ($8-10). They actually called me right away for an interview. They mentioned free lunches for everyone as a perk. Everyone is impressed by me and they want to hire me on spot. $10/hour.

I then regretted going there, since I'm getting more interviews later that week. I call and say that I got a better offer somewhere. The boss says he really wants someone with experience and that he can counter-match whatever the offer is (and move me to accounting). I said $14 and then he offered that as well. He also told me more about his perks like life insurance, blabla. I told him I needed a few days to think about it, he said sure.

Two days pass and he calls me again! And he says he really needs the help asap. He's offering $1000 sign in bonus and $15. So I just accept because honestly, I liked the company, close to home, and free lunch perk lol.

On my first day, I'm doing receptionist work (as they hire someone for this role, and then they move me to the accounting). I didn't bring lunch, and part of my duty was actually ordering the lunch for everyone. At lunch break, someone comes to me and tells me that they're tyring to cut costs and I'm not included in the free lunch perk!! It seems so obvious they're trying to get me for the $1000 sign in bonus. I almost walked out.

But why would they want me so bad?? They can just open another job position for accounting if they needed someone. It almost felt like they were trying to catch me before I left for another company. My resume aint that impressive either! I dont even know how to use quickbooks.

I received the bonus and obviously I can't quit, right?"

I am in college for accounting and trying to pursue my masters in accounting and hopefully obtain a CPA. I’ve never been the best student, but I work my a** off and have gotten deans list every semester. However, it takes a lot of effort and time to get the grades I get on top of that I work. I try to see my boyfriend as much as possible (at this point I basically live with him). He’s starting to get upset with my work hours and saying I’m working too much. I really don’t have any other options though as I am paying for myself and going through college. He always expects me to clean the house and do extra chores. Now he does give me a little bit of money here and there and wants me to move in with him (he would be paying the rent). I could see him paying rent as a fair trade off to me doing chores. However, I just don’t have the time constantly studying and working. He doesn’t have a job because he is also in college and his parents provide for him. Do you think it’s fair for him to expect me to do all the house chores ? Also, I don’t think he realizes how much work I’ll be doing once I start auditing. Should I break up with him to give him a fair chance to find a less working girl. I wish I could work less, but unfortunately that’s my reality and I’ve seen too many woman in my life get burnt being dependent on a man. I really do love him, it just seems like his complaints are leading to him wanting a more traditional woman."

It’s been a pivot to my career that I ended up taking after moving to give end of life care to a family member for a few years. Looking back I don’t know why I ever took it. I wasn’t hired the first time after being told HR would be reaching out with onboarding. Phone calls went unanswered when trying to ask if I was still coming onboard. Second time they told me they didn’t like my availability. That’s fine, I was open to negotiating that if I’d have been told. 

Since then I became the ASM’s right hand learning how to do things most didn’t. After a few months I found out I was making less than new hires, I asked for a raise and a bump given my learned auxiliary tasks. I had to remind him two weeks later then I was able to be matched to base pay. Which is still some of the lowest in the area, there are fast food locations making more…

Recently a management position opened up and waited for it to be posted, weeks later in the beginning of January I asked and was told that they were waiting on someone to ask. Why? Then I found out it was pointless because I have to apply and compete against outside hires. It’s February now and it’s still not posted. 

I’ve since found a company building a location 30 minutes away. I’ve had a phone interview for half an hour and just had an in person interview for over an hour so I feel it’s very promising. Close to triple pay since I won’t be capped at 30 hours. And the manager and I are both interested in me starting as a team lead and training to be ASM of a store that will be opening in my current town. I’m very excited as it’s a store that would be perfect for me with my love of products they sell and lifestyle they embody."

I was working at an inbound call center, the program I was in charge of was Mediacom cable, we took new customers info, set up appointments, trouble calls, pretty much anything you'd call you cable companies customer service for. Since we didn't work directly for Mediacom, rather a contracted call center to handle their overflow of call volume, the trainings for this gig were 35 hours and you were threw on the phones. I was given Mediacoms training material for us, mind you, a full four weeks of training material. I condensed it to 1 week, 35  hour training. It was not easy, but surprisingly I did it well enough that new hire hit the floor running. 

This was a corporate job, so corporate shit happened. I forgot to mention, I am the only trainer for this program, and I am in possession of all the training materials. They called me in one day, said changes were happening around the office, older managers than me were moving in to my department, and I would need to be demoted to the phones, not before I train my replacements for week. 

That did not sit well with me. At all. I said cool, went back to my desk to think about. It took maybe 5 minutes for me to grab every bit of training material, clock out, leave, and tell no one. This was Friday evening. Monday I was a no show. They were calling me panicking. I never looked back and reached back out, they know what they did. And I know from friends who still worked there just how fucked they were when I did that.

It felt so good to get the last fuck you in."

I was working in a big construction site, and was in charge of a pretty significant part of the project, but it was literally just me, and another person.

I had to commute roughly 2h each way, plus 10h a day there.

I literally did the work of 4 or 5 people. 

I had to take a day off work because I had to take my grandmother to the hospital. My boss said I couldn’t do that, because I was needed there.

The reason I was doing the job of 4 or 5 people, was because the company refused to contact anyone else, they said 2 people were enough… Sure, I was being well compensated for the job, plus benefits like a company vehicle, but I was very overworked and stressed out. I was dying…

Like I was saying, I needed to take my grandmother to the doctor, and my boss was saying that I could not take a day off.

Before comunicating this to my boss, I had that day work done in advance. He started to scream at me saying that he was the boss, I was the employee, and I should know my place, and that I was just a overpriced construction worker, and that an ape could do my job. Well, that didn’t sit well with me. All I said after the screaming was: “tomorrow I’ll send my resignation letter, and I will go to the hospital with my grandmother” and hang up. He tried to call me again multiple times. He sent me a message saying I was fired for insubordination and abandonment of the workplace, and to return the vehicle, computer and cellphone. All I did was send a pin with the location of the vehicle, and told him to pick it up himself.

He refused to pay me for firing me, kept saying I was insubordinate and left the work place. We went to court. He had to pay me WAAAAY more than my settlement was supposed to be, and the best part was that he lost the contract with that construction firm! Not just that! They had several HUGE contracts with them, and they lost them. My coworker told me that firing me was devastating for my boss, because the owner of the construction site liked me and my work, and didn’t like that our crew was just 2 people when it should be 6, plus my boss filled in for me and he was a disaster!

After all this, I now work for the construction site owner, get payed 60% more, and we always have acomodations close to the construction sites, plus a company 4x4."

So, i have to retrain for the job ive been doing for 6 months or i will be fired. This is coming from my manager. The deadline for me to be retrained and certified is February 22nd. They have yet to retrain me which is supposedly going to consist of shadowing the manager for an entire shift, then having the manager shadow me for an entire shift, probably a test, then they sign off on it. However i dont see that happening as the manager couldnt possibly shadow me for a full shift let alone half a shift. I asked the manager last night and they thanked me for reminding them that i and my coworkers need to be retrained. They are not on top of it at all and i feel kinda blindsided and betrayed that this is all happening. Its probably naive of me to think they would possibly make an exception for me.

It’s my first time posting here, but I recently I got fired from my security job. So I started there about 2weeks ago. They told me I needed to buy new shoes and a belt, they wanted me to cover my hand tattoos, which I wore bandaids or gloves and told them once I get my paycheck I’ll buy proper attire that wasn’t provided. This is important to the situation later. 

So the day this happened it was myself and one other worker at a post working graveyard. My girlfriend called me and told me she was locked out of the house and I had the key. It was pouring rain outside to the point the freeway was flooded, we also have no awning to our apartment. She came back from a wedding so she didn’t have car keys either (went with family and took an Uber back), was in a dress, and had no umbrella. She called me and asked if my mom had a key or if she could help her get in. 

Anyway, that didn’t work so I had to leave work and drive down to help her in. Before leaving I contacted my supervisor multiple times, calls went to voicemail and texts were ignored. He told me before he was 24hr available for any calls or concerns. I had to leave since my supervisor was not getting back to me and I couldn’t leave her out there in the rain; also our dog and cat were inside without food or water. 

They suspended me for leaving and said they would contact me in two days. When I called my supervisor two days later after not hearing back, he told me I was fired. I asked him why and he tried to say I left my post unattended and had issues covering my tattoos. I asked him what I should’ve done differently in the situation since he did not answer. He said it was still wrong to leave my post but he doesn’t know but I and said I can talk to hr about it. 

I’m wondering if in California I have a case for wrongful termination? Or anything at all I can do? I’m going to HR tomorrow to talk to them but I want to feel prepared."

Then I was told that half of the tips go to the club. I asked my coworkers why and nobody knew and some said they questioned management but they were being vague. 

I live in California, is this supposed to be legal?"

Recently, I used one of my sick days to take a mental health day and was reprimanded that I should have planned it and that I better make sure to report it to HR. Yes, I know the process of reporting to HR and yes, mind your own business (mental health and sick days can be unplanned).

I rent my home from a family friend. I called to let them know that I had been let go and might need an extension on the bills while I look for another job.

I’ve been working at a paint store for about 6 months now. I’m 21 and part time. My new manager just yesterday pulled me aside and said I got a really bad review. How I didn’t know what I was doing/didn’t have product knowledge. I remember the lady, she was asking about how two primers were different. I tried my best to help by reading the labels, but ultimately couldn’t give her a proper answer. My new manager then told me that I hadn’t done all my tests. I was confused. My old manager had printed out a sheet of paper with mandatory tests on it. I completed those. I then noticed the other tests and asked him about those. He essentially told me to “not worry about it.” I thought I was being trained hands on, that I would learn product knowledge as I encountered it more. Or that someone would verbally explain what the product was to me. No. I was never trained. I’ve been here six months and never was trained on any of the products. I’ve learned the hard way, by listening, taking notes, repeating what my manager and assistant manager say. I thought that was how I was supposed to learn. No. I have 100+ tests about products. That I was never told to do. Never got checked on. I’ve learned the bare minimum, I understand interior paints. Ask me about what an enamel is? I DONT KNOW? I was literally thrown into a job, told not to worry about the other tests and just check out customers. I just feel embarrassed, ashamed even? Like I should have known better. My new manager is completely understanding and is mad at my old manager. I just feel like I could’ve been helping a lot more people and not look like a stumbling buffoon at my workplace if someone told me those tests were training videos/information."

i took 2 years doing nothing, then finally decided to join a job agency where i would get temporary part time jobs.  last one of these i had was last year in the fall. haven't applied to any jobs from the agency's website since. 

for context, i still live at home with my parents and i don't pay rent (obviously; how would i? i don't have a stable job and im lucky my parents are not that cruel).

it's gotten to a point where my parents have sort of stopped bugging me to get a job, so the main reason im posting is to ask this community this: am i right or wrong for not wanting to work AT ALL? 

is it right or wrong for me to continue to mooch off my parents? we're pretty well off, i'd say? both my parents r retired and i dont ever overhear them talk about struggles. plus, my dad is retired military (civil) and he gets all kinds of benefits and retirement stuff still to this day. and because of my situation of struggling to find a job i actually wanna do, my parents pay for my medical insurance.

im basically 26 years old with no knowledge of how adult stuff works, so im just here mooching off my parents. 

my line of thinking is...why should i work? yeah, it'd be nice to  have some kind of income so i can have constant flow of money so i can buy stuff i want without feeling guilty for spending money (i've always been this way, even when i had temp jobs. i hate spending money for myself).

but it's pointless to join in the work force and slave my life away by this point, right? everything in american society rn is messed up and expensive, so why should i join in? i know i'll have to do taxes this year bc i had temp jobs last year, but thats about it. 

is it worth joining in on this kind of life? one where i have to slave away at a job just to feel like im no longer a mooch? 

i dont know what to do anymore. i've been anti-work in mentality for years before discovering this sub reddit. 

why even bother? i'll never be able to move out even if i do get a job and somehow save money for a rent place. things r too expensive and not once in my 26 years of life so far have i ever lived on my own, so there's that too. just feels like i'm doomed no matter what i choose to do. either i join in on slaving my life and money away for reasons out of my control, or i end up homeless once my parents pass away and i dont have a place to live anymore.

When I showed up they had the wrong time listed for my interview. The manager was not even in the office. They called him and we spoke over speaker phone. They didn’t really ask me questions about my experience or about myself. They had a page with 10 questions and put up a folder fort to block their pages they were writing my answers down on. They basically gave me a test and had me do it as the interview. It was semi humiliating. I have never felt like I failed an interview before. This is hard to me to comprehend. I feel really down about it. The whole thing was undoubtedly weird.

I work for one building, sort of a “trash man”, and pick up from another building. This goes on forever. As this type of trash is inevitable in this field. 

For the past two years I’ve relied on a company vehicle and company card to do my job. I’d clock in, go do what I needed to do, park the car and leave my receipts, and go home. Simple.

Manager has big man complex. “Follow chain of command, read my mind, if I get chewed out you get it worse” type BS. Calls me “bud” and “boy”. Talks down to me. I’ve already told management. Around the time my irritation was getting stronger, I put in a vacation for a few months in the future. 

I realized I’d put in an entire 9 day vacation in just last week for the next week. 

Company vehicle was impounded cause it’s old. Owners don’t want to purchase another one. I’ve relied on the owner’s vehicles to do my job for weeks now. Using my car on odd ends to help. 

Imagine asking your employer for permission to do your job everyday. Doing it for two years perfectly, and still being chewed out on shit. I’ve had one evaluation. First words of it being “we don’t know what you do all day” 

I had to type up an entire schedule of my day. “Here daddy, here’s my contribution” type BS. I needed to pay bills so. 

So, considering no one knows how to do my job that isn’t old and retired… I took my vacation. 


FIVE DAYS LATER

I get a message from the other building I pick up from. They’ve had several managers trying to handle ONE pick up. The three others I’d had trying to cover for me failed. They had to use employer vehicles. Still messed it up. AN ENTIRE DAY SOENT ON THREE ITEMS TO PICK UP. Ten minutes away from the main building. 

They had to call the retired, previous guy to come in and fix things up. 

My job is falling apart without me. 

And I FUCKING LOVE IT 

If they truly were struggling they would’ve called me. They ARE struggling, and haven’t called me. They’re eating their words. 

Two years of making me feel replaceable. Of me having to beg to do my work. 

I’m glad they got to see how easy it is to fall behind. I’m glad they can see that I’m not just a number. 

You bet your ass I’ll be coming back Monday with a neatly ironed uniform, smug smile on my face, and my head held high…. Because I’m quitting in another month or so… 

And they’ll have to deal with this all over again. 

Fuck em all."

She joined after a hiatus a few weeks ago. Ever since she's arrived, things have been easier for me but there's a lot of bad data I inherited that I had to clean up. 

Because of that, my normal work got delayed. It's been 6 months in this company and I'm severely overloaded because I didn't have a manager in my country for the entire period. I did all my tasks as best as I could and put up with everyone's comments about how I should be working, what I shouldn't be saying, so on and so forth. 

This week, I completed many major tasks after jumping through major hoops for approvals. I'm almost done with the backlog too. I was finally feeling better about my work now that I'd have time to plan ahead. 

However, my manager informed me that I have to speak up more about the work that I do because people in the team have been talking behind my back saying I don't do enough work. She said she understands the volume of work I do because she's been in my position before but this one colleague of mine goes around badmouthing me when I'm not around. 

I know this is true because another colleague of mine has also said the same about the insecure gossip mongerer. My manager suggested that I present a report every week during the standup of things that I've done. 

I work in sales but a lot of the work I do now cannot be quantified in terms of numbers because I'm still setting up processes. I usually work silently because I feel that my team is not friendly and sometimes, they're even hostile and unkind. 

How do I talk more openly about the things I do so that I show people the amount of work I do? I hate thinking about work this way. But I have to do it now. Any advice is appreciated."

7,2024-02-09,The amount of work,u/spookybuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ammpnc/the_amount_of_work/,antiwork,"It really pisses me off when people say the rich ""work more"" than others, when that is clearly a lie. I think people make a lot of confusion using the same name ""work"" for different activities.

For example, if you spend 2 hours cleaning someone else's home, that's a particular kind of activity. If you spend 2 hours cleaning your own home, that's a different activity. And specially, if you spend 2 hours looking at other people cleaning your own home, that's a third kind of activity.

Consider these quotes from the book Three Men in a Boat:

""That’s Harris all over—so ready to take the burden of everything himself, and put it on the backs of other people.""

""It is not that I object to the work, mind you; I like work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.""

This is supposed to be a comedy book, but in recent economics it has become technical lingo to claim rich people work more than other people.

If you can get in or leave the office at any time you want, and you're dealing with your own stuff, concerning your own possessions, making a lot of money mainly WATCHING OTHERS solve your problems for you, that's not ""work"". At least not the same kind of work the others around you are doing.

It doesn't matter if you spend a lot of hours watching other people solving your problems for you. You're not ""working"" at all.

If you get stressed by watching the others, this simply means that you are frail and dumb. It doesn't mean you are working."

Lately, I've been facing a significant reduction in my shifts, down to just two per week from four. The explanation given is a decline in trade, affecting everyone's schedule, starting in January. If it matters, I was able to get an interview because I know someone who knows someone who knows operational management personnel, or the ‘’higher-ups,’’ rather. 

What's puzzling to me is that all of my coworkers seem to have four to five shifts, and despite confronting my manager about this more than twice, I've only received vague or evasive answers. I've been a reliable and dedicated team member, and I have positive relationships with my coworkers — they value my input, seek my guidance, and we share banter and inside jokes. The chefs praise my efforts, and I've built a good rapport with the customers. 

During my conversations with the manager, he mentioned, ""I'll understand if you leave, and I’ll write you a reference."" When I pointed out, ""You know I'm a longstanding employee,"" his response was simply, ""Yeah, I know...''

Notably, there is a rotation of managers handling shifts, and in the past, when I requested more work, the other managers obliged accordingly. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you navigate through it? Despite positive feedback and strong relationships within the team, I'm struggling to understand the shift reduction. Additionally, has anyone ever felt that being with a company for a long time might lead to situations like these? Employees can be expendable, or easily replaced, rather, but are there any circumstances where it becomes unsustainable to keep specific work personnel on payroll?"

No zero days - daily job applications, gym and exercise, quality time with my kids, preparation for interviews, reaching out to my network, catching up with old friends, doing a project around the house, finding ways to cut back expenses.

Don’t get me wrong, I still wake up with a wide range of emotions - fear, anger, hopelessness, you name it. But I remind myself that everything will be ok as long as I stay focused and continue making daily progress. 

To all of you out there who are going through a layoff or other challenges in life - don’t give up, don’t blame yourself, and remember that you are not alone. Use this as an opportunity to grow, to reflect and appreciate what really matters in life, to connect with people you care about, and to come out as a better person in the end."

Service Coordinator positions requiring degrees? $17/hr. Technical Support roles requiring degrees? $14/hr. Hell, licensed medical professionals? $16/hr.

What bootstraps can we even pull ourselves up by if everything is more expensive and we make half of what we were 2 years ago? This is sincerely out of hand. I work at one of the most ""succesful"" manufacturers in the world. 65% of the employees here are contractors with no benefits and half the pay of company employees. They do not hore directly from outside, you have to contract first. What is even the point if the most profitable companies won't even throw us a bone? Where do we even go from here?"

Starting Saturday, I noticed that I'm being clocked out with neither my knowledge or consent; and I stay for 20-30 minutes after being clocked out each time. I don't want to bring it up cause I'm worried they'll retaliate, but is this normal? Is that just a chicken express thing or is this a crime??

Edit: I also forgot to clock in one day, and a manager (who I like) added my time, and had me clock in and out to get my proper time. After clocking out, I assumed I was supposed to leave cause not on clock anymore. Next day, they tell me I'm supposed to stay until a manager checks me and says I can go (it was the days following I noticed the clocking out thing, but I don't think the events are related.) "

I have 12 years' experience, a past director-level role, colleagues all say my resume and portfolio look great but it's going nowhere.

This week I got a next-day auto-rejection from a job I know I would have been great at. The rejection email was written in an oddly personal way from a no-reply inbox, sent at 4:30 AM and closed with ""If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out"" but no contact info was given. Something about that made me want to reach out to them, even though I'm 100% sure they don't genuinely want me to. 

I'm so sick of sending my resume into black holes or getting ghosted by recruiters that reached out to ME. I've applied for hundreds of jobs and gotten 2 interviews.

So yesterday I was like, I guess I'll try Boomer advice now. I followed up on a LinkedIn Easy Apply for a different job by emailing my resume to the CEO (for an 8-person org and the role reports to the CEO). 

She replied about an hour later (after hours) asking me to apply online so HR could screen me. At least a human replied and the email sounded friendly enough. 🥲 But I discovered that the role actually wasn't listed on that org's website but on their parent org's site, so I applied there. 

I have seen mixed advice on these tactics. Some say, don't do it, you'll annoy them. Others say it shows initiative and will make you stand out. I've been doing it the first way for long enough. Honestly, I don't give a shit anymore. I'm emailing, sending LinkedIn DMs, who cares. If they'd reject me anyway it literally doesn't matter. 

If this goes on long enough I might start marching into offices in a suit with a printed resume. Fuck it."

My boss is not abusive but she does have some bad habits of 1. Being condescending, and 2. Making assumptions rather than asking questions, which emboldens her being condescending since she’s “right” in her mind so often.

I have a made a friend in another department, we’ll call her Tina, and she has done quite well. So well in fact that she’s in charge of this monthly meeting and project we’re working on as a smaller team of us. My boss tried to bulldoze a bunch of my ideas and dismissed my concern over another topic. Now, I’m not in a position to talk back to her, nor do I really care to a lot of times. I’ve learned with people like my boss it’s best to let them shoot themselves in the foot if they’re not open to help or ideas from others. Tina however, can talk back and has the authority to do so as the project manager. Tina did it with such directness too, it wasn’t rude, it’s was simply a “No, it’s not like that. I agree too with Fuzzy Redwood’s idea to make these two separate things instead of combining them. Especially since one of them is essentially done already, let’s not hold up the work”. Logical, effective, and not unkind, basically good leadership. 

It was really nice to be heard and I am going to learn a lot from Tina about how to assert yourself politely. Gotta celebrate the small victories."

Thing is, I’ve been working on my mental health recently and realised that being happy is way more important than a job, I no longer get the dark thoughts and am much more pleasant to be around. 

These sort of reviews are designed to mess that up though, nitpicking every aspect of your personality, everything you’ve done wrong put under a microscope, and everything you’ve done well ignored. I think the key is to stop caring.

So what yous reckon? Do I go in all aggressive and explain that I don’t really care, that I’m happier in myself now and will find another job, or do I grovel?"

Or whatever this is. I don’t know. A cry for help? There’s nothing i  can do. I’ve been thinking about everything in the past several months that’s put me in the position I’m in now and I can’t help thinking  that honestly I want to kill myself. Let me preface this, I am NOT a nurse, or in a respectable allied health position like respiratory, radiology, etc.) so I do not have the abundant job opportunities to hop to new places if one is bad in town (no hate to nurses or other qualified health professionals, I just honestly hate my profession in particular in my area.. for that limitation alone). I am just a mere sterile processing tech. I help prepare/process  sterile instruments for surgery. Actually, I want to go to school for radiology tech. Don’t know if I’ll ever be able to achieve that considering how fucked I am in my current position. So we’ll see! Hahaha……..

Anyways, so last year, I decided to leave one toxic department thinking this new department would be better. Even one of my coworkers (who also left the same place) got me in there through their recommendation. Little did we both know, fast forward 2 months, I would receive the most asinine mistreatment from the manager and her 2 little favorites and quite frankly defamation of my work ethic by all 3 of them, eventually ending up in me getting fired out of nowhere by the manager. (Which by now I’ve been thinking, I don’t know why this manager hired me in the first place. She wasted my time and just mistreated me and left me almost homeless in the end. I don’t think she ever liked me.) There are witnesses to my mistreatment, including that coworker, she feels really bad about what happened to me. I have good references, we’ve reported to HR, we’ve done everything. It doesn’t matter. I worked my ass off in orientation those 2 months, there’s PROOF I finished my competencies for orientation, I honestly never said anything that should set anyone off, I tried to be nice, i tried to be cordial, it doesn’t matter. The witnesses to my mistreatment are other coworkers on all shifts who have also faced toxicity from the manager and her 2 cronies. That manager just gets to fire whoever she wants just because she fucking feels like it. If you’re not besties with her then good fucking luck. Consider yourself unemployed because she’ll fuck you over like she fucked me. I am not the first one. And it looks like I wasn’t the last one either, talking to people that are still there now. Plus, that manager has patient safety issues rolling against her too, I don’t know what happened with that, because she still has a fucking job. We even anonymously called Joint Commission on her (with evidence). But I guess profit and keeping your best friends close is the only thing that matters at this hospital. Who am I fucking kidding. I feel bad for all the children that have to get surgery at that fucking dump. Jesus Christ. It’s a children’s trauma hospital for fuck’s sake.

So during that torturous unemployed month, scrambling for jobs, racking up credit cards because I lost my job, I finally landed a travel job (for those who don’t know, it’s to get paid twice as a regular staff employee to be an out of state contractor helping out hospitals across the country, depending on your profession. You’ve probably heard of ‘travel nursing’, it’s that.) On the one hand yeah, i get paid better than a staff sterile processing tech back home. The downside is that i have to work out of state for about 3 months at a time, i have to pay 2 rents so the IRS doesn’t fuck me for being a contract worker. Not to mention unfortunately for MY profession, sterile processing techs, we don’t have an abundance of openings wherever we want. I wanted to stay in the states close to me. Instead all i could land were positions 6+ hours away. And our travel rates are not NEARLY as close to nurses and etc., so traveling for us is a little bit harder. It’s still good money, but obviously not as bountiful as the money I’m sure you have seen travel nurses make. (I’ve seen the rates drop for you all though, you guys should be getting paid WAY more. When you guys get paid like shit, the little guys like us get paid even shittier.) Such is the way of life with healthcare huh. These hospitals still wanna be stingy with their money.  Even though we’re all busting ass for making them  millions.

I say all that to say this. I really don’t know what the fuck I’m doing. Like yes I’m traveling and yes I’m a sterile processing tech and YES I actually LOVE doing my job. I love treating patients behind the scenes and the fact that the shit i do matters. Unfortunately, in my job market back home, a lot of my hospitals are toxic. And the good ones are either not hiring because they’re fully staffed or they also don’t want to work with someone who will eventually need a college schedule (rad tech program). 


The WORST part is, the first place i worked.. the one i left, it USED to be SUCH a good place to work. I also got to work my dream schedule, 3-12s at night with the option to switch it up for flexibility. I was planning on staying for college. The manager was wonderful and highly respected, unfortunately she retired. Ever since then, the place has become unbearable. People have either left because of it (like me), gotten fired, or quit the profession entirely. People with decades of experience jumped ship.

It breaks my heart thinking about what happened there. I feel bad for everyone that’s still there. But I can’t help but feel envious of them too. Had I stayed, I wouldn’t have to worry about finding a job in this profession to accommodate college. Maybe i should’ve endured the prolonged suffering. I wouldn’t have been subjected to the mistreatment at that other hospital. 

Now I’m stuck 7 hours away from home, making good money but working way too fucking much, 5-6 days a week, I’m BARELY making it through online school at the moment. I’m alone. Myfamily, my friends, are all back home. I’m in a city I don’t fucking know.  I hate myself because I should be grateful and ecstatic that I’m “traveling” and I get to experience new places and make all this money. Not really in my fucking profession. 

Unfortunately this is one of the few healthcare jobs that wants to still keep 5-8s. I’m gonna be honest working these 5-8s make me wanna fucking kill myself. I spend every waking minute when I get off hating myself for wasting time because I’m behind on schoolwork or whether I should pick up overtime because honestly why the fuck am I out here if I’m not doing overtime? I’m here to make money right?"

I made the decision to go back to college in August. A few days later, my dad gets diagnosed with cancer. I request off with this psychotic manager because I need to take him to a doctor’s appointment. She agrees and lo and fucking behold here comes the day off. She fucking calls me telling me uhhhh actually I’m gonna point you for today. That point automatically means I get to let you go from orientation. Fuck you. Fuck you so much. I have fucking proof you gave me that off day. And yet that doesn’t fucking matter. This is all I can think about. I can’t get a job back home because of you and the fact you’re friends with too many other managers in the sterile processing space. You told me I’d be fine working there during college.

Now I live in a state where lunch breaks aren’t required to be taken, and I’m a big kid who can make it 8 hours without eating. honestly I feel more productive if I don’t eat while trying to work a fairly physical job. I also put early in quotations because it’s an hourly position. We are all still clocking in for our 8 hours, and we’re not eating on the clock, we’re simply choosing not to take an un-paid break midway through the day.

9,2024-02-09,Update to my last post months ago (acting team lead while they search for someone),u/inb4likely,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1amrrlm/update_to_my_last_post_months_ago_acting_team/,antiwork,"My previous post: https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/16qn7to/i_feel_for_the_we_hear_you_we_want_to_change_thing/

So they hired the team lead after being silent the last few months on it (even though I knew they chose someone else because big boss blurted it out in a meeting in September). The guy is on it, is immediately getting overloaded with stuff that I didn't do before, and has to pick up a lot of the stuff I was doing. Meanwhile, I dared to take a week off for my birthday, someone from my team complained that they cannot do my job. That is correct, I never asked them to do my job and they literally cannot do it. Their management (because they work for a different company) sent dozens of emails stating essentially that I was holding up the project and they begged the customer to postpone it. Turns out the customer never changed the dates (even though we discussed that I was gone) and if that other company had just kept their mouths shut they wouldnt look like clowns in front of everyone. In those emails, they were really quick to point out what my job is (which is like 95% less than what I do). I pointed out to my boss that since I should have only been doing 5%, that's what I'm doing going forward. These last few weeks of just doing my job have been amazing. I also told management that the week off was good for the rest of the team as they had to figure things out without me.  To top it off, the person that they hired to take the team lead probably makes less than me since our job titles are in the same bracket. If they chose me to be the lead, I would have demanded the next bracket."

Out-of-hours messages from the boss could soon be a thing of the past in Australia, which has granted employees the ‘right to disconnect’.  

On Thursday, senators approved a bill that gives Australians the right to ignore messages from their employers when they’re off the clock. Controversially, criminal penalties may apply to bosses who breach the rule. 

Spain and France are among the countries that already have ‘right to disconnect’ legislation. Australia’s bill includes other provisions to boost employee rights, such as minimum standards in the gig economy and for truck drivers.

Corporations have criticised the measures, claiming they are an overreach by government and will impact competitiveness.

I was one of three teenage boys hired at the start of the summer season, and the first time there was a mad rush, we naturally made a game of it, determined to prove that we were the very best and most heroic dishwashers of all time, pulling together into a machine of lightning efficiency, producing a vast and sparkling pile of dishes in record time. We then kicked back, proud of what we had accomplished, pausing perhaps to smoke a cigarette or scarf ourselves a scampi - until, of course, the boss showed up to ask us what the hell we were doing just lounging around.

""I don't care if there are no more dishes coming in right now, you're on my time! You can goof around on your own time. Get back to work!""
""So what are we supposed to do?""
""Get some steel wool. You can scour the baseboards.""
""But we already scoured the baseboards.""
""Then get busy scouring the baseboards again!""

Of course, we learned our lesson: if you're on the clock, do not be too efficient. You will not be rewarded, not even by a gruff nod of acknowledgment (which is all we were really expecting). Instead, you'll be punished with meaningless busywork. And being forced to pretend to work, we discovered, was the most absolute indignity - because it was impossible to pretend it was anything but what it was: pure degradation, a sheer exercise of the boss's power for its own sake. It didn't matter that we were only pretending to scrub the baseboard. Every moment spent pretending to scour the baseboard felt like some schoolyard bully gloating at us over our shoulders — except, of course, this time, the bully had the full force of law and custom on his side.
So the next time a big rush came, we made sure to take our sweet time.

I work for a lefty organization, however since we started we have never been employees, but are ""contractors"" for a non-profit fund of another organization. They're not even our fiscal sponsor because technically we're not even a formal organization ourselves. That made sense at the beginning, when were a staff of one or two people and it was unsure how long the project would last. Four years later though we have a budget that supports 6 full time staff and 3 part time. We're still ""contractors"" and don't receive pto, retirement, sick days, and we only get a limited healthcare stipend. I'm down for the movement so I was/am fine with this, but as I've done more research I'm worried that this is actually very illegal, since we pay no payroll taxes or do anything else required of an employer. Should we be concerned? What kind of liability does this open us up to? To be clear, I don't think there is any argument for us being considered contractors - we only work for the org, work the same hours, have the same coworkers, I have a job description, etc etc. Curious what others think! Should we become an employer, become fiscally sponsored? Is there any option to stay contractors (even though that's clearly what we are not)"

And after that, I'd also like to ask, how could we ensure that our governments now holding this money to distribute don't become corrupt. How we as people can really change this system considering how lack of education and infighting makes us hate eachother so much that we forget about the real exploiters?

A little over 2 years and 3 months ago, I took on a job that, at the time, seemed like a solid deal. It involved supervising young adults four days a week in a residential setting with three days off and on a salary that, at the time, was a pay increase compared to the place I had just left. For a few months, it was mostly okay, but what wasn’t explained to me until after I got hired was that I had to sleep on site for those four nights, and that I couldn’t get overtime. Exactly why was never explained to me back then, but by the end of my first year, the entire team I worked with were up in arms over the lack of compensation for the extra hours we found ourselves constantly working. Other problems had surfaced over that time, too - the communication between different divisions that on paper all dealt with the same people I did was terrible, and we were constantly being blindsided with issues that one division knew about but didn’t do anything about. During all of this, a number of different divisions, ours included, started seeing budget cuts, followed rapidly by an increase in the amount of marketing being done, plus expansions into other cities at a rapid pace.

This was followed up by a 2% increase to my and others’ pay, with the announcement that we were being moved to hourly just barely a month before a scheduled $5,000 yearly increase to our salary under state law. The first tip off here was that they moved us from exempt to non-exempt in doing so. During all of this, they had brought in someone who myself and others found was extremely careless in a number of our job duties, and despite reporting what we were seeing multiple times, there was never any kind of investigation done. This continued on through the summer with little to no follow up done by my own direct supervisors, who were either constantly out of state or at another location in the state. By late last summer, a group of us finally had enough and banded together to demand our collective issues be addressed, with the pay being one of the biggest - everyone by that point had seen their cost of living balloon to far beyond what they were paying us, and all while the company was holding quarterly report meetings that made it clear it was in a strong position for quite some time.

We initially pushed the CEO himself hard, openly telling him of the numerous problems we saw and the glaring lack of support for front line support staff and the difficulties we were encountering in trying to trying to stay afloat. He deflected everything back at us and gaslit us on how if we even wanted a pay increase, we would have to make significant sacrifices. We attempted again just a week later when several people from HR visited with no success. Two weeks went by without a word and out of nowhere, I got placed on a performance improvement plan for two medication issues, one of which I was previously cleared on and another where I reported them with no follow up. The others in this group? One moved to doing virtual work with no explanation, another given extra job duties with no prior explanation as to why they were justified or needed, another forced out after being left isolated for extended periods of time and another dismissed for “business purposes”. In hindsight, this was the first instance of retaliation I had gone through.

During the course of these events, I contacted a non profit labor law group I was familiar with, as by then I was concerned there was some form of wage theft happening. While I waited several weeks on them to review my case, I got through the period the performance improvement plan had specified with no issues, but I didn’t receive any extra training as it stated I should have, and I was left in the dark on the full medication policy. I never even received a written notice showing I completed the period either. Shortly after it ended in late November, I was finally referred out to one of the attorneys affiliated with the earlier mentioned group. After reviewing all of my documentation, plus what he’s been able to find, it turns out there was a second set of job duties they had put in with my documents that I previously was not aware of - they had all of us in my entire division assigned to do administrative tasks that none of us were previously aware of, trained for or carried out, thus the reason they had us classified as exempt on salary. He also found a loophole that mandates an express agreement for being on site overnight without pay. Since then?

Multiple demand letters that resulted in a weeklong unpaid suspension for bullshit excuses, culminated by a firing that, when combined, just scream retaliation. And all for speaking out when I first realized we all were getting fucked over in the name of ever more riches for a hypocritical few. There’s holes in their arguments, and every sign so far suggests they’re willing to go to court. I for the meantime did at least apply for unemployment, and have been looking for other jobs since this all started. No matter how I view it, this was an awful experience from the very beginning."

I was bored out of my mind because since I couldn't just find work myself as I had no guidance, my coworkers assumed I was useless and stopped giving me tasks altogether as well. I've never been so happy to quit a job and I've worked at MCDONALDS. 

New job, my boss is the nicest person I've ever met, gives me set tasks as well as general goals to work toward so I can put in initiative but don't feel lost on what to do, actually appreciates the work I do which encourages me to work harder, and most importantly, actually pays ABOVE market value for my position unlike my previous job which underpaid me.

They also keep bringing up that Im not supposed to review their work due to union differences, and so on. Anything can set them off. 

After a few months, I had leadership training and it was basically, watch your tone, soften your language when reaching out to team members, if you take too long to respond they’ll think they can take long to respond, too. She’s pretty much letting them run the show. And then making subtle comments about how I didn’t connect with them right away and that’s why they won’t want to engage with me. I’ve tried to meet with them but some flat out refuse. I’ve asked for more technical training from the manager, who told me to go ask the team. 

I feel extremely bad that I didn’t reach out to them sooner to connect and now I’m behind in my training because I’m too scared to reach out. I also feel like I should try to find a new job since I feel like their behavior is so disruptive. I’m quite introverted so trying to talk to them is really hard.

When a job gets back to me, I tend to find it’s a scam, where the job posting doesn’t match the real job. Flooding my job market as well are positions that tout dreams of wealth but preface with that they’re commission only positions. This has happened numerous times.

I really have wanted to do IT/computer science / programming my whole life but never strived for that path as I feared the math, justly so as I barely passed Algebra 2.

Texas. Things changed in the company very recently bc they were non compliant with exempt vs non exempt and not paying OT.  So for years they were scheduling salary laborers in excess of 40, not paying them OT but we also used a time clock and would get hounded for punches 1 minute, 3 minutes after start of our scheduled shifts counting as tardy.  It was a huge mess they even tried to retroactively change our payplans to hourly (bc if you send a salary employee home you can’t deduct wages, which would have shorted me $600 on that payperiod I already worked but hasn’t been paid yet). 

but now we’re all only scheduled 40hrs, and much happier and more productive.  We all are also secretly filing for unpaid OT with DOL… it amounts to about 30k unpaid OT per employee over last 2 years.

The handbook states we must be ready to begin work at the start of the scheduled shift.  I have to be standing in my workstation ready to go.  No punch grace period is defined.

So this week is the first of converting everyone from salary to hourly and only scheduling 40 hrs.

Bc 1-3 minutes was late enough to get chastised and threatened with write up in the past, and handbook backing this up w/ no defined grace period.  I’ve been arriving early as requested and clocking in 2-5 minutes prior so I am ready to hit the ground running right at 8 like they said I had to be.  If I’m required to be at work, I’m fickibg going to be clocked in. My line of work (skilled trades) requires some minor staging tasks prior to beginning. This result in 15 minutes of potential OT for the week which today I was confronted about and told to watch my hours, OT must be authorized beforehand and I may have to take a longer lunch so I don’t go over 40.. I don’t trust them to exist that again “you were 15 minutes late from lunch that’s a write up”.

Man I am so confused.  How do I ask HR to clarify what the policies are regarding tardiness.  As currently set up, they could fire me for misconduct for clocking in 1 minute after punches and this state Unemployment office would rule in their favor bc it’s late and an attendance policy violation according to the employee handbook."
1,2024-02-09,Scapegoating for what?,u/BatBetter2619,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1amwnwz/scapegoating_for_what/,antiwork,"I have had a lot of crazy things happen to me over the past decade that I’ve been working, but this one by far takes the cake over anything I’ve ever experienced before. Even though this situation happened months ago (and I am no longer employed at this company) - it’s something I recall often and continuously seethe over.

At the beginning of the year, I had chosen to move cross-country by car. I gave plenty of notice to my job, and they were incredibly accommodating. I had taken a week off so that I could complete the move, so it was quite obvious that I would not be available. Around this same time, our company held an annual meeting which I was unable to attend because of the move.

During day 2 of my move (which was also the last day of the meeting), I received a call from my boss approximately 2.5 hours into my drive from Nashville to Dallas. I hesitantly answered the phone, and was prompted with “Do you have a moment to talk?” - in hindsight, I should’ve left it there. But with no context, I just took the call anyways.

Some background information. I worked as a developer at this company, and recently finished work on a punch-clock system which required us to view documents regarding vacation time per employee. In this same document, employee salaries were disclosed in a separate sheet. I didn’t know whether this was intentional or not since we were handling HR information (and to be quite honest, I was disgusted by the salary gaps between me and my coworkers — which were promised to be shared publicly in brackets, but never were) - so I didn’t bring it up to management and just simply mentioned it to other teammates on the same project. 

Apparently at the meeting, a coworker on my team mentioned the sheet containing employee salaries to a facilitator (product owner), who then brought it to my bosses attention. Meanwhile, back on the phone during my drive from Nashville to Dallas, my boss began to accuse me of sharing the document and exposing salaries to other employees, and blamed me for not bringing it to managements attention. I was furious at this accusation, and firmly replied that it wasn’t my fault, since I mentioned the document to my team, and they all had access to it (and downloaded it on their own from our system.) I was immediately interrupted and told to “drop my attitude” when attempting to defend myself. My boss continued to reiterate that it was my fault for not bringing it to their attention, and continued to grill me about sharing the document with other employees outside our team (which I didn’t) and that it was her job as a manager to “have this conversation” and that I “need to understand that this is how a work environment works” and that “I need to be prepared for these kind of discussions, since she “is the boss”” (I had NEVER had an altercation like this in my LIFE) 

Come to find out when I finally arrived at my new apartment several days later, my boss had been in the airport when she made that call (off the clock) and was absolutely aware that I was on vacation. Once I had returned to work, I spent the first hour drafting an email of the situation to HR to let them know my side of the story, still worried that I was a scapegoat for the situation and that I may lose my job. Immediately HR reached out to let me know I wasn’t at fault and the situation would be addressed. 

A few days later, my boss called me to talk to me about the HR report that I wrote. She began to belittle me and tell me that going to HR was an improper way to handle the situation, and that I should’ve came to her first because she is my boss and “we need to have those conversations”, not with HR. When defending myself, I said that I was not comfortable having a conversation with her after the first call. She then again used the example of “You need to be able to have these kinds of discussions with upper management in a workplace” as if I was unfamiliar with it entirely. To top it all off, she insisted that I admit it was a misunderstanding because she was just trying to collect information on the situation, and never “accused” me (even though looking back, it was definitely her blaming me for not bringing the document to managements attention) 

Even after agreeing that it was a misunderstanding, she refused to accept that I did not take blame for the situation. She insisted that if I ever saw something confidential that didn’t seem right, I should notify upper management immediately. I however disagreed, stating that HR provided the document and that our product owner uploaded it to the system. This lead to an awkward standoff, in which I had to say “we can agree to disagree” while her face was beet red. I still to this day do not understand why she attempted to put me at fault for the situation at all.

This led to a pretty bitter falling out between my boss and I (who stated during the call regarding HR that we ‘always had a great relationship, so I don’t know where this is coming from’) and eventually led me to seek other opportunities (also caused by seeing salary gaps between my coworkers and myself) — but looking back at this job, and my current job, I can see what a real leader looks like - and what a plain “boss” looks like. She still holds a directorial position at the company, and I will forever wonder how anyone of her capacity is able to function as a leader.

Moral of the story - don’t wait around for respect from a boss who will never give it to you. Find a team with a leader who grants you autonomy to do your job, and trusts you as an employee. Wish I had learned that lesson sooner."

3,2024-02-09,Let's See What They Do,u/AnchorLost,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1amx8jb/lets_see_what_they_do/,antiwork,"So I have been working at a company for 2.5 years. Over a year ago I let them know that I would need to relocate for my partner's job. They were initially on board with me going remote and staying with the company. Then they changed their mind and gave me a grace period to tie up all of my work and I would get a severance. Fast forward to THE WEEK that I am supposed to be done (I hadn't found anything yet, but I have several interviews) and they told me that they wanted me to stay on in a different capacity, but hadn't worked out a job description or offer yet. They asked me to stay on for an additional month (with my same terms in place) while they work out the offer. Which I agreed to since I don't have anything firmed up yet.

So as fate would have it, the only other employee with my knowledge base (which is essential to the company) has given notice. When I say essential, I mean like key infrastructure essential.

So now, I have sent them the job description of the position that I would like offered (including a pretty significant title bump with corresponding salary) for me to stay. The way I look at it, they can give it to me or they can give me my severance and I can find a position with any of the recruiters that have been reaching out to me daily. 

I should note that I do like the company and my former boss, but with the back and forth and only realizing that they made a huge mistake valuing a butt in a seat over critical skills, I am a bit disillusioned with them."

5,2024-02-09,Only friends of executive leadership can be fully remote.,u/burgundybreakfast,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1amzr29/only_friends_of_executive_leadership_can_be_fully/,antiwork,"**Important context to note before I begin: I am not going to disclose the nature of the company for privacy, but I will share that objectively all work can be done fully remotely regardless of job position or title.**

I started working at my company in 2021, shortly after they did a RTO on a hybrid schedule. It was then a team of around 20 people. 

It was mandated that everyone must come to the office two days a week, no exceptions and no flexibility. 

It stayed this way until a little over a year ago when a new VP was hired. Due to VP’s experience and relative notoriety in the industry, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity for our smaller company to snag them for this role. Only problem was they lived across the country. No problem, surely an exception can be made to not miss this opportunity. 

Fast forward to present day. VP has since hired on a dozen of their friends in the industry, all who are allowed to be fully remote. Those friends have recruited on other friends, and the company now has employees in various states across the country. The total amount of fully remote employees is nearly half of the entire company, a mixture of executive leadership and mid- to senior-level production roles. 

However, the company has remained steadfast in their requirements for in office despite the obvious hypocrisy. Several times myself and other members of the team have expressed our desires to be fully remote or even come in only once a week, all of which have been denied. One employee needed to move out of state for their partner’s job and requested to continue to work fully remote. They were denied. 

When I bring this up with my direct report, who is fully remote, they fail to see the issue, saying “coming into the office isn’t a big deal” and “I would come into the office if I lived there.” 

Not to mention the state of the office is abysmal. I require a lot of concentration to fulfill my role, but have to share a tiny office with other people (who are lovely, and this situation isn’t their fault). The constant noise is incredibly distracting, and not to mention the other people in the office who stop by almost every hour to idly chit chat.  

With every announcement of a new fully remote hire, it’s one more nail in the coffin. I’ve hit my breaking point and have started to look for other opportunities. 

Going into the office sucks no matter, but it extra sucks when the company clearly knows work can be done remotely, but only offers remote work to an arbitrary group of people. 

Anyways, just wanted to rant. Everyone in my life is baffled by the situation and the company’s lack of self awareness on how this appears to their employees, so figured you’d all agreee."

yesterday i had something planned with my family. since lunar new year is tomorrow and everyone had work on the weekend, we thought it'd be cool to celebrate on thursday where everyone was free. i was scheduled 3pm-7pm (we close at 10pm), so i thought i could make it even though i'd be a little late.

as i was getting ready to leave, my manager came up to me and told me the closing server called out, so i had to close. i told him that i had something planned already so i couldn't, but he told me it didn't matter, that my availability in the system was posted as 'all day' so he could make me close whenever he wants to. the other server who was with me had a night class at 8pm so they couldn't close either.

i ended up closing because i felt too intimidated. i don't know if i'm being taken advantage of, or if this is actually a policy. is this allowed?"

6,2024-02-09,Paid Monthly & Payday came and went without being paid....,u/Euphoric-Coat-7321,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1an000h/paid_monthly_payday_came_and_went_without_being/,antiwork,"So buckle in because this will be slightly longer. I am an employee working in a semi-government funded position. We submit our payroll invoices to the government agency, and they sign off on our company paying us with the grant the government gives basically. Our payroll is submitted on the 1st of every month with the expectation that we will be paid the first Friday of the month. This is my second month with them. I must admit it's a really easy on call position, and I knew the job would be some extra side money for me. 

2/2/2024 was our pay date that was scheduled. 2/2/2024 came around and employees texted each other asking if anyone got paid. The manager said since 2/2/2024 was so close to when we submitted payroll invoices we would probably be paid the upcoming Friday. We all accepted this and honestly shouldn't have looking back. I called HR that weekend and asked for a payroll schedule so we could avoid the confusion moving forward. I also emailed HR asking for this. 

2/9/2024 rolls around, I open my banking app to no direct deposit. I wait until 12pm and text my other coworkers after still not getting any payroll. They also have no gotten payroll. I call HR. I explain how payroll was the first Friday of the month. I explained how we know the submission of hours and payday fell really close so we assumed we would be paid the following Friday. I explained how none of us were paid. The HR man was run around at best. He said we were following the normal pay schedule but wouldn't supply said pay schedule. He said we would be paid on the 15th when the semi monthly employees are paid. He said this would happen again next month. Lastly he said he would let me know about a payroll schedule. I proceeded to text a summery of the call to the HR man. I screenshotted this conversation/summery and sent it to my coworkers. 

I then contacted my manager. The manger was very confused and unhelpful to say the least. I went back to texting the HR manager and asking questions. I asked specifically why I was paid last month the first Friday of the month but this month we will not be paid until semi monthly employees are paid. I asked specifically why an alternate payday of 2/9/24 was not put in place. I asked why monthly employees had to get the short end of the stick and wait while semi monthly paid employees did not have to wait. The HR manager started making less and less sense the more questions I asked as I truly believe he didn't know what went wrong. I think he was more confused than anything and ""I don't know"" looked bad in writing.

 After seeing the true answer of payroll didn't have time to process hours and instead of an off cycle payday they are lumping us in with semi monthly paid employees pay date. I simply became upset. I called the lady who's a step down from the VP and explained the situation. The VP called me back and let me know she preauthorized off cycle payments for any payday that will land like this in the future. 

What did I learn from this endeavor? We off source HR to a company just to have to just go to higher ups within the company to fix HR mistakes/corner cuts. Due to the fact our outsourced HR outsources payroll to India and its Saturday there we will not get paid until likely Tuesday or Wednesday...But hey we will be getting paid 12-13 days late now instead of 15 I guess...

One of my coworkers is a teacher and so is her husband. They teach during the day at a special needs school to afford tuition for their son with special medical needs... the mom does what we do together to help cover bills... her mortgage will be paid what they can today and the whole balance will be paid 13 days late... All because the company that pays us once a month thought we wouldn't need to make an off cycle payday and could wait another week without telling anyone... "
184,2024-02-09,I’ve just REALLY had it with this coworker 😡,u/powderpuffpenguin,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1an0133/ive_just_really_had_it_with_this_coworker/,antiwork,"I (25F) work as a full time GED teacher in a medium security men’s prison. There are three other teachers in addition to myself. We have this one lady in her mid 40s who works as the placement specialist, yet acts as if her job duties entail supervising us teachers. When she’s not policing us around, she just sits at her desk and shops online and/or applied to other jobs. 

This woman (call her A) does absolutely nothing for most of the day, except police everybody around. Our boss is gone 60% of the time as he works at different facilities, so she pretty much gets away with everything because of this. One day an inmate was not on the right call out list to be excused from his dorm (so that he could come to class), so while my inmate TAs and students were all gone to lunch, I followed typical protocol and walked down to the central gate to make sure the COs know to release him still. The CO acknowledges and makes a note, so I did my job and all is good. I turn around and A is right there. She then starts scolding me on how I “need to be in the classroom at all times so that way I’m there when my students return”, so I respond with an ‘alright’ and went back to my classroom. 

Two weeks later, Ms. A ‘no call no shows’ the morning I get in to work. My boss was frantically looking for her bc the two of them had to travel to a mandatory meeting at a facility 30 min away.  I asked the other teacher and she went on about how much she absolutely *hates* miss A and that surprise surprise miss A is the main reason my colleague is transferring to another facility 😂 She and I spent a good hour just spilling on how much we dislike her. Apparently she applied for one of our positions and the educational director refused to hire her lol. 

A has also apparently gone around and tried to get each inmate worker fired. Our boss is too afraid to fire her himself bc he thinks she’ll file a discrimination lawsuit against him (she’s POC), even though she’s only been there three months and still has seven to go before she’s off probation. 

I found out today that our other teacher is now also leaving. I have (since last week) started the paperwork to transfer to another facility bc I just CANNOT stand this woman and her false sense of authority. I’d be in the middle of class and she’d just barge in the room yelling at me about “making sure “ to do stuff (that’s not a part of my job at all). Right in front of my inmate TAs and students which is just  *highly* inappropriate! 

At this point I’m just hoping my boss grows the balls to fire her before I transfer out (I think it’ll be another two weeks before that happens). I’m just tired of going into work everyday with the threat of her fire breathing hanging over my head.

 I’ve just had enough."

I finished my multi day video training at my store, and was informed that I start training at another store next week. I called the store, and it's a 2 week training period 40 hours a week. I told them that I have school, and was hired part time because I cannot work full time. They instructed me to call another regional manager. This manager made it clear that yes, I was hired part time, but training is full time. I was NEVER told, at any point that I would be training at a different location, AND that it requires full time work. Ever. I mentioned again tot this manager that I was hired on these terms. Apparently, in the last few weeks, they have since let my hiring manager go, and none of my info was every communicated to anyone else. (This company is having massive corporate layoffs.) Now they are telling me that full time for training is REQUIRED. I am so stressed in general about money and school, and now this. I don't know what to do. Please help me."

For example, he’ll have hour long conversations with him during this time basically telling him that he needs to sell more and make the gym more money (he works as a personal trainer/manager) even though he’s already made over 6k in sales this month compared to the usual 3k people do. He also won’t let my boyfriend take his break if a client wants to talk to him (he does “encourage” him to tell them he’s on break but will ultimately get mad at him because he lost a potential sale if he does so). As of today he was told he no longer has an hour lunch and that it was being reduced to 30 minutes. I’m just wondering if any of this is legal? I know here in Wisconsin, employers aren’t forced to give their employees a break but that they’re encouraged to give a 30 minute lunch/break, so I guess my question is, is it legal to reduce an already set lunch time out of nowhere? Ik he’s technically breaking labor laws when he calls specifically during his lunch to talk down on him and lie about his sales but I can’t seem to find anything regarding reduced lunch/break times. Sorry if I rambled a lot, I’m just very frustrated on his behalf right now."

Meanwhile, if a cigarette smoker goes without nicotine or a alcoholic can't get a drink before work, all hell breaks loose. Employers have absolutely no legal right in telling you what you can or can't do on your free time, but walk in Monday morning and let someone  get a wiff of weed on you and see what happens.

I mean, there's the usual stuff, tracking up time according to your teams status (defeated with a chip clip or a pen in the keyboard holding a key down), brand new useless training to replace the old useless training (When your position is remote and you have to take a workplace violence prevention training, it causes one to furiously think) and the whole nine yards.

What's new that's even dumber?

Well, I went in to say that I worked all week this week and didn't use any vacation time, and wound up fat fingering a drop down selection a few times because I was in a hurry.

Turns out? It's a three strike system. If you accidentally select ""Paid Day Off - Accrued Leave"" or any of the other options and then change it to ""I worked that day"" three times, you are no longer allowed to submit your own time sheet. Your manager has to sign off on it before it can be submitted.

The error message? ""Due to repeated errors in timekeeping it is now required that your immediate supervisor fact checks your time records.""

That's corporate speak for you are too stupid or untrustworthy to report your own time.

Mind you, there's never not been a time when your immediate supervisor *didn't* have to sign off and approve of your reports to payroll. I guess now there's just an extra emphasis when it comes time to sign off on stuff.

There is almost no doubt in my mind either that however many times that happens is being tracked.

I remember the good old days when HR existed to keep the company from getting itself sued for stupid reasons and said it was there to help you."

Whats your opinion on the privileged top 1% of earners in the world?

Like here in Brazil someone who earns around $6.000,00 (R$ 28k)/month is top 1% earner.

Do we dislike anyone who earns like $72.000 or more per year? 

Also, when does it start? Like.... Top 10% ($800/month in Brazil) already seems pretty previleged, no?

Like, imagine a world where you are in the top 10% most beaultiful people? Most healthy people? Most safe?

Imagine living in a place that is better than 90% of the rest of the world? Man that would be cool.

So again - like, here in Brazil we are very poor (compared to US and most of Europe of course), but when we look to our neighboor Venezuela, minimun wage there is like 2-3 dollars, while here in Brazil its like 300 dollars...

Like, do I have to dislike myself for being more previliged than my friends in Venezuela?

In very confused. I do am latino, and not very smart, a little slow too. I did not inherited money from my parents. Dad actually left us 🥲. Also I went to public school (in Brazil, imagine that), do forgive me my ignorance and lack of knowledge about the world.

Thanks for your time, and I hope you can help me better understand how we should the top previliged people in the world 😁👍"

The job only lasted three weeks. I caught on to the work relatively early, got along well with everyone, dressed professionally, communicated effectively regarding my work, was always early, never goofed off, worked well alone, kept my work area neat, had good hygiene, etc.

They were already down one admin because she had moved to another state. They shuffled the responsibilities around to us after she left. I feel I took to the situation well even though our workload was heavier with her gone. I actually enjoyed my job. I looked forward to going there every morning.

Tonight I received a call from the agency, ""As much as I hate to say this, they're letting you go."" ""Why?' ""They didn't say, just that you weren't a good fit."" So now they're down *two* admins with even more of a workload. 

I'm ready to move on with my life, but I'm wondering what I might've done wrong so I can avoid this in the future. I've wondered if It's ageism (I'm 50), but I'm still going strong. I'm also on the neurodivergent spectrum, but I don't feel that interfered with my work.

I now ""report"" to this junior person, and now this junior person is supposed to review me in the coming weeks. 

 

Needless to say I feel horrible. Do I deserve an explanation? I asked the ""Chief Talent Officer"" if this was performance or disciplinary related -- no answer. Does this person need to even give me an explanation. The only explanation I got from CFO was they didn't want so many people ""reporting"" to our new manager. I said I don't feel like my career should be subject to their convenience and that I'm hoping we can continue to dialogue in the coming weeks. The CFO is brand new and has no idea what everyone even does. They had us all submit a list of our ""duties"" after the 'restructure' when through.  So, I felt it was a bit callous to simply bump me down and make me report to this jr person when they don't even know what we each do.

Fast forward to now, I have been promoted once (out of sheer necessity) & I have not only attained my required certifications, but my bosses certifications too. 

Every superior pumps up my tires, tells me I have a great future ahead of me etc… but…  the reality of my job is that I work in a department where most of the people have gotten in due to family/ political connections. They are mostly lazy & uninterested, very comfortable with their positions as they know for the most part that they are except from discipline due to their connections. 

I do not have any connections & was employed here naturally off of the merits of my resume/interview. 

There are openings for mangers, I often act as manger, my superiors tell me I should be a manger but.. the skill level in my job title due to these lazy POS’s is very low. They rely on me to maintain some sort of operation & I know that this is a main reason they will not promote me. 

I have thought of becoming lazy like them but it’s just not in my nature & I just can’t stand by to see things go wrong but I also know that I am being majorly taken advantage of. 1 level promotion would see $35-40k minimum extra in my paycheck each year. 

I must add also, I’m not the hotshot looking to get to the top or a title chaser but I do feel I should be paid what I’m worth.

If it makes a difference in the law, I am located in Idaho.

I work at a company that does not have time clocks. We fill out our own time cards manually to the hour exactly. On RARE exception we can add (hours).5 if we work 30 minutes extra but this is not the case for every instance this happens. 

Shifts are assigned to one person and at the exact time your shift ends, the next persons begins. Except we have to do shift change together, where we count medications and go over work related topics about the building or clients. This takes anywhere from 5-15 minutes every shift change. 

So you stay 5-15 minutes late every shift, or you arrive early so the other person does not have to stay as long. These minutes add up over the course of a year, and they increase if your shift relief is late. (One girl was 30 minutes late and we had to ASK to give me that 30 minutes on my time card). We normally are not compensated for shift change or the lateness of our shift relief. My coworker is 3-5 minutes late every single day. I do not get compensated for this. I do not mind that she is late, but I am annoyed that I do not get paid for it. 

 I want to be 100% sure that this is illegal wage theft before I report this to the US department of labor as there have been multiple instances where I have stayed 30 minutes late. I am only now recording my exact times myself and will submit these with the complaint."

I’m currently living with my girlfriend and her brother and have been there for just shy of a year. When I first moved here, I found a job pretty quick at an escape room nearby, and it was actually pretty good all things considered. Then around Christmas it all went tits up. 

They sacked me for a multitude of reasons, I won’t go into all of them, but some were valid, others less so. The ones that really pissed me off we’re getting write ups for being late, which I couldn’t control because I don’t drive so I have to rely on buses and they only come once an hour here, so if one bus doesn’t show up, I’m just fucked. And then I was also getting write ups for days I wasn’t even working.

Since then, I’ve been trying to find something else but I keep running into the same problem. Places that are hiring near me are all a bus ride or two away, so I can’t realistically start before like 11am just in case I get fucked by bus schedules. Couple that with my severe anxiety, depression and ADHD, it feels like there’s no way for me to get anywhere beyond where I am. I’m sick of being broke, I’m sick of being judged by my gfs mum, and I’m sick of feeling like I’m a failure and a burden.

We all see in the news headlines ""Company X is laying off a thousand employees!"" Etc.  but let's be straight here they're not really laying people off, they're terminating your employment. That distinction is something that I want to get off my chest for a minute. 

A layoff means that you are being told ""don't come in to work because we don't need you for a few months. Your job is still here when we get more work for you."".  Think assembly line workers when demand for a car drops but we're retooling the plant for a new model. Or construction when the first set of houses is finished and we're lining up the paperwork for the next line of houses. 

Terminating employment means ""we just don't need you anymore. Your job has been deemed irrelevant"". Think they're closing the department, plant, role etc. bottom line is that work you were doing is not being done in that same capacity anymore. 

The last several years many companies have done rounds of ""layoffs"" to shore up the bottom line and help the shareholders/CEO make more money. They sell off divisions of the company or they close departments or roles down. They shuffle job duties so that your job description is no longer required and this you can be ""laid off"". 

But the reality is they have no intention of ever hiring you back. They have no intention of ever getting the work done in the same way again. They are terminating people and then getting the remaining people to split the original duties up and ""do more with less"". Headlines of layoffs are not really layoffs, they're terminations. 

That's why stock prices go up when these things are announced. A true layoff is a failure on the part of management to future plan for their workforce. A true layoff means that the forecasting department screwed up. But terminations are trimming the fat. Terminations are getting rid of redundant people. Terminations are ""sound management decisions"". Terminations are signals that send stock prices up. 

It just really burns me when we don't use the right words for stuff like this. Language has power. A headline that reads ""company X lays off a thousand people"" has a subtly different message than ""company X terminates a thousand people"". The first headline implies they might get their job back and there's a little bit of hope for them. The second headline tells the truth; that a thousand people are fucked and won't ever get that job back. 

I just really wish that more people articulated the truth."

I like my job. The hours, the work, the pay, the people I interact with. I've made a decent reputation for myself there.

The director is a condescending narcissist. Nothing is their fault. It's everyone else's. We're all stupid to them. The don't listen to understand, they listen to reply. I've had to explain things to them like a toddler, repeating myself until their lightbulb finally clicks.

There was an issue last week. I did what I could to circumvent the issue. I alerted them, and if course they tried to make it like I have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm wrong, etc. All of that is nothing new.

I leaned they called a higher up and tried to throw me under the bus. That I messed up (it was an IT issue). I learned they told someone else that I was crazy and a lunatic and that I made the situation up.

The higher up she tried to throw me under the bus to, I spoke with them last night. He gave me a name of someone they said I should tell all this to. I told them I was anxious because the management are known to be retaliatory. They said ""So you'd rather just take their bullshit? ""

These two have been reported before. Nothing happens. I have texts and emails from them both. Nothing damning, but enough to back me up on a lot of things.

I've thought about creating an anonymous email and sending it out to various top brass. I'm just not sure what to do, so I came here."

I have a heavy background in call centers and I wanted to deviate from phone jobs. I applied as a loan processor to a bank nearby & I made it all the way to interview #3. The final interview was with the branch manager & it was over zoom. He came on late, and was distracted the entire time/cutting me off because he was tracking his DoorDash order. As I’m answering his halfass questions, he would comment “omg how hard is it to deliver an order” because the dasher was having a hard time finding the building. 

I didn’t pass the 3rd interview and I was upset because that pos wasn’t paying attention the entire time. 2 weeks later, I get a call and the person they hired didn’t show up. No call no show on their first day. They were really disappointed because it took a while to find someone. They offered me the position & this time they changed the location so I would’ve needed to commute almost an hour away. The pay stayed the same & they said “we reallly liked you, your credentials stand out. Can you start Monday?” 

I said yes. Monday came & I get a call 10 minutes after I was supposed to start, “hey where are you, trainings waiting on you” apparently the branch manager that did my 3rd interview was. Conducting the hands on training. 

Me: I’m pulling up in the parking lot rn! See you in 5!

10 minutes later, another call:  you should’ve been here by now, I expected you here at 8am! What’s your eta? 

Me: I am 6 minutes away from receiving my order 

Him: excuse me?  What do you mean?

Me: my DoorDash order ☺️ you didn’t actually think I was going to join your company, did you? Have a lovely day🦋 *clicked on him*

I work for an e-commerce startup, which up to the last two months has been a good experience. Our team deals with clients, analytics, reporting, and automation. Last year, in September and November, we lost two team members; one quit and the other was fired.

Since then, we took on their workloads and their clients. Our manager convinced the CEO to hire two more analysts and he agreed. However, now he’s saying we are at extra capacity and keeps repeating it in every meeting.

I don’t believe we are at extra capacity, since our time sheets have an average of 8 hours every single day. We still need to train the new guys, and once they are ready, we will be at normal capacity again. Nonetheless, when we were planning the transition, my direct VP stopped it and said we can’t handoff any accounts yet, since we’re developing a new product and we don’t know if it’s going to work, so I need to keep my accounts until we sign off new clients to the new product.

It’s insane. I can’t concentrate on the development of the new product because I have my old clients, which are senior clients, and account for almost 40% of our revenue. Thereupon, I have missed some deadlines and the VP has gone crazy about it. I have never had a performance review before, and she schedule a meeting to talk about it. She also said she is disappointed and I should be happy I was considered for this project.

I need some guidance on what to do or what to tell my boss to make her realize I’m doing more than I’m capable of."

Another co-worker made a point about something I said which was true but probably not the best to tell a customer. Basically I stayed an hour yesterday to help a different department’s manager deal with the CEO’s urgent instruction to stop certain deliveries. So we had to search through all the routes and check each type to see if it needed to be cancelled. Just him and I. 

I do so much variety it could total to about 4 people’s jobs. But whatever.

I told the customer it was due to a manager’s instruction that we could no longer deliver, and could not provide a date until we received an  update on the instruction. The other co-worker told me that I should’ve just said it was due to vehicle issues. I could kind of see the point.

Now, I’ve had NO phone training, but due to the fact I’m a quick learner and hardworking among other things, I’m the go to person for the department’s manager. Quite happy to do overtime, help out etc.

But then this temp, who does one very basic job and nothing else, not on the phones, turns around and basically told me how to do my job, joining the conversation between the co-worker and myself.

Don’t get me wrong, but this temp is lucky I don’t report her phone use to the manager, if her work gets behind I have to do it. I’m not going to offer to do that anymore as I can clearly see why. 

My eyes are opening and, all I ask is to WFH, I’ll happily do what I do if I can WFH, which is possible. But they’ve been holding it as a carrot on a stick for months and never done it. Fine, but when stuff likes this and another 3 month employee who seems to have it out for me, who also tells me how to do my job, I start looking for other jobs."

So this week my department finally hired another manager.  My current manager is stepping into a slightly different role while the new manager is, um, I guess managing the team specifically?  There's only about 15 of us on the team.  So the new manager sits down with everyone individually over the past couple of days to ""get to know us"".  At first the conversation is about non-work things such as where I grew up and hobbies (which I didn't really want to discuss, I found the whole thing weird because I never talked to my current manager about my personal life).

Then of course we talked about my role in the department.  The manager asks me how busy I think I am in my role.  I was honest and told them that I don't have enough of my own assigned tasks to keep myself busy throughout the week but I help other people who are overloaded with work.  As the conversation went on it felt like I was interviewing for my own job.  When I got home last night, I dusted off my resume.  Should I run for the hills now or wait to be laid off?  Even if I'm not one of the people being cut (and it wasn't specifically stated that people are losing their jobs), the whole situation seems sketchy to me.  Even though I'm a hard worker and help other people, I am one of the least experienced people there.  It reminds me of the movie Office Space when the consulting Bobs were brought in to fire people."

I've had the same salary since 2020 while the 4 managers got themselves (with the company's money) the latest iPhone ""for work"" (they already had a good one) and the latest €4000 iMac. I don't judge people spending their own money, but we have been asking for a raise but they said they can't afford that.

We're 4 employed people. 10000€/4 = 2500. 2500/12 = 208. They could have afforded a gross 200€ raise on salary. Even if I received 50% of that, 100€ would have been a huge hand.

I'm a manager at a fast food restaurant. So, normally, I don't give a reason when I request a day off, however, I wanted to impress how important it was I get my requested day off this time. As soon as I was able to, I put in for a day. It is my deceased child's first birthday. I already know I'm going to be a wreck on that day. I told the gm just as much. I will not be available that day.

The weekly schedule doesn't get released until 3 days before, so we don't get a lot of notice on our days, and being fast food, it can be unpredictable at times. I found out when I saw the schedule that I am scheduled for that day. I approached the gm to speak with them in person, stressing that I won't be in. Was told it would be taken care of by the next day. Next day comes, and no changes. 

Haven't been able to contact the gm since, until the meeting we just had, in which we were told that asking for days off aren't an official thing until approved. We can't count on having days off we request for. And, if we are not at work on that day, it will be considered abandonment of our position. So I guess I will be mourning my child while at work."

4,2024-02-10,The common trait of leaders at the company where I work,u/spookybuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1anna4k/the_common_trait_of_leaders_at_the_company_where/,antiwork,"I am sorry for my bad English and I don’t have enough experience or interest in business to presume this is the same in other companies, or in all companies – though it may look like that to me.

At least where I work, there is a common trait shared by all the people in leadership positions:

Subservience.

No matter how selfish, bossy and threatening they appear to their team, whenever their own bosses and other people above them open their mouths, all the leaders will behave like smiling trained dogs. They are exaggeratedly solicitous and will always do whatever they’re told.

I doesn’t matter if it goes against their interests, their reason or their character. Whenever “important” people are around, they become instant flatterers fighting to bring the person a glass of water, or to open doors in front of them.

In my observation and personal experience, this is the fundamental trait in all of them. No matter how competent a person might be, if they lack this trait, they are soon demoted.

So isn’t it funny, really? At least around me, the people posing as proud and mighty are actually quite passive and insecure. They act proud and mighty just as a mean to achieve their role in being passive and insecure to their bosses, who in turn act the same way towards their own bosses and so on.

Of course not everybody who excels at being a doormat gets to be accepted and get a position, but absolutely nobody without it can be a “leader” there.

I myself believe the only leader in the company who is allowed to lack this trait is the owner, and even so, I think their businesses would soon go to ruin if they didn’t act like subservient puppies in front of people with higher standings than their own, outside the company.

I think people like Elon Must acts like that too, when they meet people who could give them something they want and who they can’t fuck with.

So I’m sorry, I know this is a pretty subversive view, but being perfectly honest I myself understand “leader” as “a little bitch”."

Hello all,  
 

I work for a large telecommunications company in the U.S, as a Software Developer. Our manager recently warned us that HR is watching our activity. By this, I mean he mentioned they are keeping an eye on our VPN connections and when we swipe our badges to enter the building. 

Since we came back to work post-Covid, it seems they have a hair up their asses to keep us in the grind for that 8 hour a day, 5 day plus work week. This seems to be another reminder that they’re finding an excuse to take away our hybrid work days and get us all back in the office.

My question is, how stringent is this monitoring on VPN usage and badge swiping? I’m a hard worker and I’m not going to lull myself into hanging around the office more if I’ve no work to do for that day.  
 Additionally, are there any ways to game the system that will throw HR off my back? (Logging into laptop before driving into work? Refreshing sites on my browser that point to work items? Any tips are appreciated, I’m just trying to do some chores when I work from home, ya know)?"
192,2024-02-10,"I make too much as a server for government help, but get told to donate plasma as a way to make some extra income and then I get turned away for not meeting the weight requirements",u/adorable_boots74,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1annucc/i_make_too_much_as_a_server_for_government_help/,antiwork,"I posted on Justnomil yesterday about issues I was having with my mom. Another reddit user messaged me and told me I should donate plasma to help make ends meet and how they made thousands from it because my serving job just isn't cutting it/I'm not making enough to pay all of my bills and Im just basically juggling glass balls from one pay check to the next. After leaving my son's abusive father I just took the first job I could find but it's $2.75 an hour plus tips and I don't always make decent tips. I was relying on my mom for ""free"" baby sitting but would repay her by buying her groceries using my WIC or I would clean her house on my days off. Just something to show that I appreciated her and the fact I wasnt paying more than my rent in daycare costs

I found out my mom has been sending photos of my son to my ex/his abusive father. This is the man who choked me when I was pregnant, screamed at our infant son to shut the f**k up when he was sick with colic, did really awful things to me. And my mom knew about it, I told her everything when I left him. I ended up having to crash on a friends couch and then to a women's shelter where I could only stay for 30 days. The social worker at the shelter had me apply for just about every government assistance I could qualify for. I applied for SNAP WIC TANF Medicaid and got on the low income waiting list. but when I started my serving job and had to report my check and any tips I made I got disqualified for SNAP and TANF for earning too much and I dont know if my name will ever get called for a low income apartment because the waiting list is years long. I had to give my ex's/sons fathers name in order to apply for all of these programs and thats why he's supposed to pay child support but Ive never seen a dime of it and I doubt I ever will too be honest

So I decided Id try and donate plasma today. the center closest to me opened at 7 am, I dropped my son off with my mom and promised her I'd pay her back for watching him today when I worked my serving job tomorrow by either cleaning or Id cook for her or something. When she asked what I was doing and i told her I was going to donate plasma to make some extra cash, and she laughed and said they wouldn't want me any ways but good luck.

I get to the center and complete all of the questions, they prick my finger and put the little heart monitor on me but when they weighed me, even after eating, drinking water and wearing my clothes (just no shoes) I didnt meet the weight requirements. The lady said she couldnt let me donate and said she was sorry but I'd have to go. I just started crying and then felt embarrassed that I'm crying over not being able to donate plasma. I dunno why I thought Id be able to make some quick cash and it might be a way to help get ahead a little. I ended up picking up my son from my mothers and she asked how it went and I just started crying all over again explaining everything to her and she told me to stop being a little bitch and go sell some p*&&y and to stop being so pathetic and it just made me feel worse

Im going to call my case worker on Monday to see if she knows of anything I can do or if she can help me get into a better paying job, some people suggested I work at a day care on my justnomil post and he mroe I think about it the more I like the idea. Or even just a better paying job because being a server at applebee's just isn't cutting it any more. Im thankful for the job when I left my ex but I have to find something better for my son so I dont have to keep relying on my mom or having to go through this embarrassing ordeal like I did today"

At times at work I'll close my eyes and think about just being happy with someone who loves me. That's it. Just being held. (Go ahead and laugh at me, always one of you slinking around.)

I’ve been vaccinated, but they haven’t been to work since then. “Apparently” they had gotten a note to return to work today and that a doctor said they were non-contagious. Our manager never let anyone know they were returning to work, that they had a medical document stating it was safe to work alongside them. Albeit their tests are apparently still showing positive 

Me, being asthmatic and not wanting to bring Covid home due to mine and my brother’s health issues went to my manager and asked about the situation. They were dealing with some sort of personal issue and blew up on me. They seemed perfectly fine five minutes prior as I was clocking in for the day. I had just asked, “Hey **** I noticed so and so is back today, my other coworker said they’re still testing positive for Covid and I’m just curious what’s going on with that?” 

My manager’s first response was to cuss and yell at me telling me if I had a problem with it to just go home. I asked them wtf their problem is and why are they getting so agitated over me asking a medically relevant question? I could barely say anything, as I kept getting cut off. “I have more important things to worry about than what **** and you have going on!!!” Got so mad they hit the bathroom stall, and basically screamed they didn’t care. 

They angrily asked “wtf I expected them to do?!” I said it would have been nice to know about them returning to work and if it was safe to work alongside them. I got cut off again. Then they said something about me coming in there and critiquing them. Just the worst interaction I’ve had and honestly made me start to question finally looking for another job. Due to personal health issues as well as financial issues I haven’t taken those steps… yet.

I told them I’m sorry for whatever you’re going through currently but it’s not my fault and as a manager there’s no reason for you to treat the people who work for you that way you just did to me. They didn’t say anything back. 

I promptly said then okay, clocked tf back out and as I was walking to my car, I hear are you working today or not?! 

I turned around, and said no, I have asthma and don’t want to get sick! I worked for like 13 minutes today and now I’m down a day of pay for the week over this. I have pto, and another manager works tomorrow so I’ll ask them to put in a vacation day or something I guess. 

——
This was the first interaction I had with them today, I was extremely calm and professional with my question and I do not understand why someone would act that way let alone let someone return to work with a positive Covid test. 
I wonder if I should contact my district manager about the situation. Not happy at my current job but not trying to get fired for leaving today. Medical note or not if the test says positive- that’s not right to act that way for one and nobody should have to work in an unsafe work environment."

I know my right from wrong and do my best making the right decisions. I’ve been in corporate America for about 10 years now and I haven’t yet (nor do I think I will ever unless someone has amazing advice in the comments) figured out how to accept that corporate America is unjust in so many ways. It continually deteriorates my positive outlook on life every time I’m put in a situation or see others being treated unfairly in the work place - and there is absolutely nothing you can do to help the situation. We all know salaries aren’t equal, even for the exact same job. One person could be doing the majority of work on a project yet the whole team gets credit for it. A director takes credit for the work of an analyst. An employee gets skipped over for a well-deserved promotion simply because the business ran out of allocation so it gets bumped to the following year. A top performer could get fired for no other reason than that business unit is shutting down. I could go on and on. It’s as if corporate America is the opposite of a meritocracy. 

My real ask here is, knowing I can’t fight city hall and change the entire capitalistic corporate mindset of America, how do I reconcile that I’m a good person with morals and believe in right/wrong yet spend most of my waking hours in an environment ruled by a totally different (and hurtful) set of principles? I’m tired of experiencing situations that make me scream “but that’s not right!” Or “but that’s not fair!” But still be expected to walk into work every day with a smile, motivated to do my best.

I work at a law firm and make PowerPoints for attorneys to use at trial and mediation. Ilike it, the pay is good and I can rack up a lot of overtime without doing a whole lot, it floors me that I'm the only one at my job that knows how to do powerpoints, but my boss won't let me do anything else and praises me a lot for my work. My boss says that she likes me in this position because it also serves as a sort of final case review that makes it easier on the attorneys. But there is this duo that have a lot of opinions about how things should be run.

Long story short, this lady I was hired at the same time as was a former assistant principal of a high school that for some vague, ever changing reason ""quit"" (I don't think she quit), and now she works in a similar position to me. she was promoted to manager and then demoted because she caused constant insane drama and tried to get me fired, then moved onto others when I got her in trouble. She literally changes offices every few months because no one can stand her. (I have no idea how she has not been fired yet)

Her friend came to work for us, and she's a lot better to deal with. We are generally cool, but there are certainly some issues I have with her. She was a teacher who ""quit"" as well, and now she tries to be my manager, will stand behind me to watch me work, will try to give me orders on what needs to be included in my PowerPoints. The thing that really drives me crazy is that if something affects my ability to complete my work, say a document that another department was supposed to file first or like photos have yet to be taken, it's not my responsibility to take them. I'm supposed to basically tattle on those people/communicate what is missing so it can get done if there is time.

These two ladies will hear me say I can't do something or say that I'll work around the issue and go ""so you're not gonna finish it."" or ""so it's not gonna get done."" and that just drives me absolutely crazy. or they will repeat back what I just said, but it's been oversimplified and it always paints me out like I'm lazy (I am but not in the way they portray me) Sometimes if I slack off too much at work but I'll usually go home and remote in (I got my laptop connected to my work computer) and make overtime. Sometimes I say I'm going to do that, and then never do. If that happens, I always catch some snide comment about how little I work or how I'm always late when I'm really not late all that much unless I get especially lazy or if the schedule gets messed up again.

Lately, these two have been acting up towards me a lot more and it's mainly because they tried to come for our manager's job again. Our manager is 26 and a law student, but they feel that she is a child they shouldn't have to listen to. They apparently are constantly trying to take her job and have been ignoring her until the manager had a meeting with our boss and both of them. Now they've been making snotty comments about my laziness.

Idk, it's just been hacking me off more than usual. I had this lightbulb go off in my head that I need to back away from these people. My manager I genuinely see as a friend, we hang out sometimes outside of work but we keep it light. the other two have to be kept at a distance for us to be good with each other. But I think I need to disconnect from my job some for my own sake. I don't want this to be my career, but it is a good job for the now now. Any advice? I think I got drawn in too deep and need to back away without upsetting anyone.

TLDR; I have a good job that's doing good for me at the moment, but I caught myself sinking into budding work drama that it only going to cause me grief. These two former teachers are mad because they keep causing drama because they think I'm lazy and don't approve of how our manager runs things, so they make snide comments to me. Could use some advice on how to deal with them and how to back away from the drama. Also looking for some advice on how to reframe my mindset so this job doesn't become my life."

It started as a seasonal role, during the seasonal months I was there every day, stayed the entire 8 hours and all around it was a decent time. Once the Christmas season ended they asked me to stay on, originally I was excited about this, I soon came to realize that the store is painfully slow after the Christmas season. Since my first day as non seasonal employee, I have left 4 hours early almost every shift. I’m supposed to work 3 to 11pm but every day I leave at 6-7pm. This has been going on for over a month, no one has said shit. I’m doing it again today. I’m just so suprisedI’m not fired lolll.

I got fired from my job a bit ago. It was a fast good service job that i was hired too on the spot. I was fired due to being seen as unreliable, i kept getting sick due to stress from moving and was told that the only callout policy was to call out when you get sick. I was not given any kind of warning for my attendance and I wasn't told about any extended version of the policy. Now, I am again struggling to find employment. Everywhere is hiring but somehow I don't have the experience. I worked register at this last job, i've worked customer service before, yet every place I've interviewed at or applied at keeps saying I don't have the experience to work there. One company I applied with denied me and then put the application back up like 20 minutes later. 

Are either of these common now? It was so much easier for me to get a job when i had just graduated, but now it's almost impossible to get hired and I hate it. I have the experience. I can't get more experience if I'm not hired. Why are companies so stuck up? I have been applying almost nonstop and have either been denied or ghosted. I'm running out of places to apply too lol."
6,2024-02-10,sexual harassment on a weekly/near daily basis in healthcare,u/juneispridemoth,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ant6zl/sexual_harassment_on_a_weeklynear_daily_basis_in/,antiwork,"I have worked for the last 2 years as a phlebotomist for a local blood bank that spans over a 5 state region and for the most part I find it very fulfilling. But lately I've been dreading going to work and the shit I put up with from some of our donors makes me sick to my stomach. For the most part, people who come to donate blood are very nice, you'd have to be to voluntarily give up your time (some people as many as 2+ hours if they're doing platelet pheresis) for free for the good of your community. However, a large portion of donors are 40+ years old. And a portion of these 40+ year olds are men seem to think you can treat the women here as you would at a dive bar. For starters, I get the worst harassment out of any of my coworkers. I'm 5'1, in my early 20s, tattooed and very underweight which seems to be these old men's wet dream. For a group that seems to vehemently hate transgender people no one seems to love me (a person who looks like a teenage boy with several pins stating my they/them pronouns) more than conservative old men lol. I wear men's scrubs, an under shirt which covers most of my skin, have very short boyish hair, and an n95 every single day to work so I'm not even sure what these guys are seeing as I am shapeless (I am so skinny I have no chest or ass lol) and almost faceless, save for my eyes. When I screen donors prior to donation (which is where most of the harassment takes place as it is a small closed room for donor privacy) I regularly get lingering touches in the booth from trying to hold my hand, rubbing their hand on my forearm and even rubbing their hand on my back. I have been told the same ""there's too many sexy women here. They get my blood pressure up!"" excuse too many times from several old men for me to count when I defer a donor for having a blood pressure too high to donate. I have been asked if I was in high school (ew) and then the next sentence later was told I was sexy enough to be a model (double ew). I have been stalked on social media by several old men to the point where I have to have everything privated. I have a regular who requests me to draw his blood who has told other staff I'm ""his fantasy"" 🤢. I have so many old men forming parasocial relationships with me, thinking it's okay to try and hug me and ask me out simply because I am nice to them and skinny. I screen them and/or stab them and that's the end of it. If they're regulars, I ask them how life's been and about their family, but even lately I've been cautious to talk to them too much. I used to dye my hair multiple rainbow colors at a time but I stopped last year and settled on a more natural shade after too many snide ""does the carpet match the drapes jokes"" from greasy old guys. I've been told I'd be much more sexy if I didn't ruin my body with tattoos and piercings. The list goes on. I feel like I work in a bar sometimes the way men talk to me. There's certain donors that are definitely worse than others but when brought up to management we always just start a case against them that never goes anywhere. The one who personally requests me to draw him every two weeks (the one who fantasizes about me) is a 100 gallon donor. We're stuck in a place where we can't really ask these men to leave as what they're doing is so desperately needed, if you need blood or even more specifically platelets, you have no alternative. So for the sake of everyone dying in the hospitals we put up with it. Donors are a dying breed, less and less younger people start donating every year. I put up with old men trying to grab my chest as I lean over them because I remind myself someone out there will die with out this man's blood.

I feel so hopeless. I am somehow getting as sexualized as my friend who strips at the club 3 nights a week 😭. This has happened at every job I've ever worked since I was 16 but this place has definitely been the worst yet. I can't wait for the next 40 years working!"
2489,2024-02-10,My company is stealing $20K from me. Got a 1:1 with my boss on Tuesday. What should I say?,u/MileyMoss,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ant8ci/my_company_is_stealing_20k_from_me_got_a_11_with/,antiwork,"It's early 2023. My company, Company A, gets acquired by Company B. People from my old place slowly leave one by one, whether quitting or being laid off.

On my team of 4, I'm the last one left of Company A. Everyone else are new incomers who applied to Company B. We do physical products, and I'm pretty sure Company B bought us just to get our clients, because the rest of the company does digital products.

When I started in 2021, my salary as a Junior employee: $48K. I was promoted in the midst of the acquisition a year later: $58K, now ""mid-level."" Got a raise a few months ago to $60K.

Thank God Company B has a union, because I've asked around and learned fellow ""mid-level"" people on my team are starting out at $80K. Company B has job listings for my exact role and experience level with starting salaries of $80K.

There's no way I should be making $60K. They're shafting me. And they've probably froze my pay to get me to quit.

Last week, before my company A boss quit, I asked about a raise. She basically said no, wrote up a document of things I'm not going well enough (it's BS), and said I could possibly get a merit increase in a few months. Then dipped.

Now my formerly skip-level boss (now my direct boss for the time being), knows about this document and that I asked for a raise, but doesn't know I've just learned all this $80K stuff.

We have our first 1:1 this Tuesday. How should I bring this up to her and start to put their asses on blast?"

I'm European. I've been working hard since I got my master's degree 7 years ago (I'm 34, I was 27 at the time), and despite ALL my best efforts, I only managed to save 25 000 euros, which I mostly invested into a business I started last year (I only have 2-3000 euros put aside now).

Now here's the thing : I know our wages in Europe are a lot less than in America (which definitely doesn't translate in a better quality of life for Americans, I'm well aware) but I gotta ask:

Is it a common thing for people in their thirties to have sooo much money saved so young? How do they do it?

Thank you."

For most of my time there, I've worked as a BOH Cook. I was first assigned for late shifts til Christmas season. Now, I was on for morning shifts. It's inconvenient for me because I live in a city 31miles away from work. I get little sleep and Im not energetic while I work in the morning. During my shifts, I got a bit more exposure of how my head chef can be a little sh*t. Granted, I know lots of Chefs are a pain in the ass,  but as more the management keeps changing, the more my head chefs keeps minimizing my role. 
 
One day, I was completing all my tasks. I'll admit I felt pretty out of it and it was only a few things I had to do, but I was getting all my prep task done at least. A coworker of another station got mad at me out of nowhere and told me that I was supposed to help him at his station. I got confused because it's a different station, but even if it's important that I helped, he told me at the last hour. We got into a short argument and my boss heard. He first heard the coworkers side and then mine. Because my list was short, he said I should had finished everything within a short period and helped my coworker. I tried to explain more on my behalf, but he shut everything down. He then gave me an ultimatum and said if I slip up again, he's talking me off the schedule. I was irritated and I rolled my eyes. Just because of that, he demanded that I leave the restaurant. I tried to argue again, but he kept his foot down. I bolted and left. I figured I was fired right then so I emailed my HR department about Severance pay and if I was eligible. I received an email from my head chef saying I'm not fired, but he doesn't know when the best time for me to put me back in due too much employees and and my performance other than my own station.
That was 1 week ago exactly. Ive job hunting right now, I'm not really depending on them putting me back in the schedule. I think this just a way for them to cut corners. I side of me is saying I should fight this somehow, but I have no idea how to approach it. Or maybe just stop worrying and keep up the job hunt. I just upset because I worried about bills my the end of the month. I'm just hoping all the places I've applied to will call me back asap."

This weekend I received a message from a company, I previously applied for programmer position, they were rough and dind't provide me details more than monotonous answers when I asked for details like the topics of the position.

The weird thing is that, once in the interview, they gave me a test, nobody told me that I had to do a techincal test it previously. Then they asked me some questions, basically they told me that I need to be dispose to work full time (even weekends) and that the culture they managed is focused on work, work, work. They doesn't consider the work-life balance or at least they ignore it at all.

So it seems obvious the answer, but whay should I do? for now this has been my only call in the year, and I really need money, but I'm afrad in fall in some shitty company."

Their reasoning is because I worked seven hours one day that week when I was supposed to work my usual eight (my fault, I didn’t know my lunch would end up being an hour) I worked an hour overtime another day and my boss asked me to add that overtime hour to the day I worked seven so I wouldn’t get time and a half. I’m not fawned of that but did it anyway. {every time (hasn’t happened in awhile, but when I do take an hour for lunch I’m struggling mentally) I take an hour for lunch I feel like afterward my boss punishes me by not allowing me overtime for awhile… I even overheard my boss and hr talk about writing me up even though it’s an accident… thankfully hr convinced my boss to let it go}.

Personally I don’t see any difference. My boss has said people do get upset when bosses allow overtime… but I have so much work that I need overtime to even get stuff under control which I’m happy to do when I’m given what I’m due. I don’t understand why my cares if people get upset because I’m drowning in work and it’s necessary for me to work overtime.

So, is it illegal?"

My metrics are slightly above average and I get good customer feedback pretty consistently. My clientele are the very rich and it's not like they dole out compliments often. But nothing I do has been good enough for my team leader.

This past week we had our annual review and she was telling me I needed to improve on communication with my team because exactly one time she had to remind me to say hello to the team in the slack chat. But she kept beating the dead horse on this one criticism. I finally just asked her why she felt like a one time slip of the brain needed this much focus. She stated I was being defensive.

I told her I wouldn't be defensive if she didn't hyper-fixate on minor things and talked down to her subordinates. She asked for an example, I gave her one from what she said to me last year, where she was like, ""I don't understand how you don't understand this."" At the time I was pretty new to my position and an abnormal path to my position where I didn't have all the training yet.

She then lost her absolute shit on me. Called me a liar. Called me dishonest. Said she knows herself and she would never say anything like that and how DARE I put words in her mouth and she won't let me talk to her like that. At no point did I ever raise my voice but she raised hers, kept berating me, and in all my 30 years had never seen someone suck their teeth in anger until then.

I'm leaving the company in 1-2 months anyway so I don't see the point in going above her head but she's the reason so many people leave their jobs. Bad management really sucks the life out of you; especially, when you stand up for yourself.  


TL/DR: Boss called me a dishonest liar for pointing out something she said to me last year."

Let them figure it out, or else have them pay you a managers salary. If they don’t like it, then you should tell them they shouldn’t be a manager. 

Managers always seem to put their own responsibilities on their employees and that is bullshit.

so basically i’ve worked this job since October, and it’s my first retail job, before this i worked at the post office.

Since October i’ve not said no once to a shift, not when he gives me an hours notice, not when it’s the 7th day of the week when i’m working in a row, not when it’s my second 10 hour shift in a row. (working 7 days in a row isn’t allowed in my country, you have to be given 7 days notice of your schedule (which i never am, its usually the day before), and you can’t work more than 38 hours in a week which i do consistently because i work 8-10 hour shifts and don’t get paid overtime) I personally believe i’ve been a model employee. Our Sales for the store aren’t great but it’s not just me, it’s everybody, and in fact i’m our top seller, and also the only person who ever does any work while at work (like cleaning, restocking, moving stock, VM/presentation). I also reply to his texts instantly, which is something he’s said he appreciates of me, and he’s told me many times he wants to be able to just leave me in charge of the store (which he does, always, like i’m basically managing the store, i just don’t get paid extra for it) 

Anyways my best friend just got hired by our boss (there’s like 4 people who work here, including her and me) and she was being trained over at our other store. She just messages me and says “*our boss* is dissing you so hard rn” and when i said what about she said “i’ll tell you later” 

now idk what it’s about but genuinely in my head there’s nothing he could be saying with any backing, i’ve done nothing wrong, but it hurts so bad and i’m so upset about it, it doesn’t help that i’ve literally worked like 10 days in a row and am so sick but keep going in to work cause i know we have no one to cover."

Logged into ADP just now, and I got a 1.9% salary increase. My job says this is because I was hired in May of 2023 and it's retroactive, so I won't get the full raise, only the 8/12 months I worked. My company requires 60% in-office and 40% remote and I do weeks of 100% or 80% in-office.

So now I get to work the entire year of 2024 on a bullshit 1.9% raise because I was hired in May of last year.

Your life has passed.

Old and grey, you wonder where it all has gone. 

It started in school — where you’re told what to do and can’t do what you want. Later, you had to do things you hated in exchange for food, water, and shelter.

The years have passed in the blink of an eye. The days spent with family and friends have been thinly spread over weekends and vacations. The rest have been spent in dead and meaningless jobs, surrounded by well-intended strangers at best — or morons at worst. And while there, other strangers have raised your children — starting the vicious cycle over.

When you’re old and grey, this will have been your life.

The reason? We are slaves. Our lives could be rich and meaningful, but instead, we must waste it on bullshit.

This is the true cost of our economic system.

A life lost.

Maybe, just maybe, we have nothing to fear.

Perhaps it’s time we fight back.

I’m 20 years old. I currently work 40-50 hours a week in a retail warehouse position. There’s only about 3 of us who work in the warehouse plus a couple casuals who barely get any hours.

I make about $1600-$1800 AUD every fortnight. And my renting situation is very cheap, only $50 a week. So money isn’t a massive massive issue for me right now. I’ve been slowly saving for a while and have amassed $20,000 total. With my expenses low (compared to most) how dumb would it be for me to quit my job entirely and focus on my degree full time? 

My plan is essentially quit my job, know how much time I need to devote to studies in order to feel comfortable with achieving adequate grades (I haven’t studied since high school). Then the rest of my free time I spend with my girlfriend and working on myself (gym, friends etc). I will of course be looking for a casual/part time job to work between 10-20 hours a week maybe? On the days/nights I’m not studying. But the thing is I don’t have enough time to set up a job to fall back on before I quit. The degree starts next month and I’m currently full time.

I’m not sure if asking my current employer to go partime is the best option. We don’t have the best relationship I’m not sure what they can/will say.

I can provide any more information if needed. I’m really just looking for advice/help. Thank you"

Hello r/antiwork community,

Today, I'm reaching out not just to vent about the problems of modern work culture, but to share a vision for something radically different - and to seek support and ideas in overcoming one major obstacle.

I'm in Austria, blessed with a solid business education and the necessary legal knowledge to start a company. My ambition is to create a business that's everything traditional workplaces aren't: prioritizing human growth, stability, and ethical practices. But there's a catch: the financial hurdle to kickstart this vision.

Here's what I envision for this company:

1. **Remote Work as Standard**: Maximizing remote opportunities to offer flexibility and respect for personal life.
2. **Fair Profit Sharing**: A remuneration system where effort translates directly into rewards.
3. **Autonomy Over Micromanagement**: Ditching fixed schedules and overbearing control for a culture of trust and empowerment.
4. **Health and Well-being First**: Ensuring that no employee has to worry about healthcare, hunger, or homelessness.
5. **Inclusive Global Benefits**: Especially for U.S. colleagues, providing benefits like free healthcare, generous vacation time, and unlimited sick leave.
6. **Open Opportunities**: Targeting skill and drive, not financial background or connections.

Despite my experiences in companies like Blizzard and under Warren Buffett, where attempts at change were stifled, my resolve to create a better work environment is stronger than ever.

But here's the challenge: starting a company, especially one with such ambitious goals, requires substantial financial resources. This is where I'm currently stuck. I'm turning to this community, a group that understands the deep flaws in our work culture, to seek advice, support, or even collaboration.

Do you have insights on overcoming financial barriers in starting a socially-conscious business? Are there others here who share this vision and want to contribute, whether it's through ideas, expertise, or other means?

I'm convinced that with a community as passionate and forward-thinking as r/antiwork, we can find ways to overcome these financial challenges and start building a workplace that truly values its people.

Let's discuss, brainstorm, and maybe, just maybe, start a movement towards a more humane work culture.

Thank you for any advice or support you can offer!"

I’m worried about quitting a job that I love a lot due to increasing toxicity in the workplace. I don’t have another job lined up but the bs is fucking with my mental health and I don’t think I can stay and tough it out any longer.

I have major depression along with cptsd and was going through a hard time/having suicidal ideation the other day. I didn’t speak to anyone that day because I knew if I did I would probably have a breakdown. Instead of asking me if I was okay, they started spreading rumors saying I didn’t like them, talking about me behind my back but loud enough that I could literally hear them, and they made sure I did. Mind you, I work with a bunch of grown adults, and I am a barely adult college student. I get it if it was from other people my age but Idk to me if you’re like 40 and gossip about a kid I feel like that just makes you a shitty person and I personally don’t want to deal with that.

I love my job but the new people are making me want to leave. I feel bad for leaving the people who do treat me well but at the same time I don’t want to stay. I was thinking about quitting during my next shift Thursday, but I’m afraid that they won’t let me, and will probably get angry with me because I was full time and the only person who could hold down my station during rushes. But I also don’t like shitty people so it’s like, can I just block everyone and leave without warning? 

Aside from the obvious repercussions of not being allowed to work there again or not getting a good reference, is it recommended to just leave like this? I am luckily in a program so I can reduce my rent so I can save money until I get a new job. But I’m also autistic and feel like I won’t ever find another job again because it’s hard for me to socialize and jobs want “outgoing” people. I also don’t have any skills so I’m stuck doing basic jobs like restaurant work or retail (which I honestly don’t mind because I don’t have to talk to anyone). 

Anyways, this is my second job that I will be quitting without notice due to toxicity and my mental health, and I feel like it’s definitely going to be bad on my record. But people with what I have are known to have problems holding down a job and I feel like this will be a reoccurring thing in my life because people just don’t have empathy for neurodivergent/mentally I’ll folks.

I’ve been reading through this sub to ease my nerve, but I’d still like to hear some words of encouragement or just any advice on how to move forward with this whole ordeal. 

Thank you all in advance :)"

Hello. I am wondering if anyone on this subreddit has ever successfully quit a job and received severence as if they had been let go by their company. I am looking to request this from my HR department and want to know others' experiences and suggestions.

All I feel comfortable saying is that myself and my coworker have legal leverage that our rights to a physically and emotionally safe workplace have been grossly violated. We also have been told directly from other company leadership that the incident that led us to feel we needed to quit was handled very pooly by the head of our company. I'd like to bring this to HR and say that we feel no other choice here but to quit, and quitting will be incredibly financially detrimental to us, but that returning to work would be incredibly emotionally — and possibly physically — dangerous for us.

If anyone can help me figure out what a reasonable ask here would be and how best to go about it, I'd be in your debt."

8/9 goals added to our talent software as if to track it for a 1-2 months timeline, while others get 2/3 a quarter.

Feel like I'm being managed out and just had enough of feeling like I need to rely on employers. Tired of the politics and stress.

Had very little interest in my applications to other jobs so far which worries me. Also concerned about what will happen to my career prospects if I get fired and another offer wants references.

Not looking for advice here, but just want to vent.

Most of it is okay, but here's some tips if dragged into an office by your manager for a bollocking.




* Join a Union. Even if the place you work doesn't recognise a Union, join one anyway. They'll help you where they can and will often provide the funds for you if your case has to go to an Employment Tribunal. If the firm recognises a Union, take your rep in with you. If not, go in with a trusted colleague. If this isn't possible set your phone to record everything.

*  If you can, get in the room earlier than them and put the air conditioning up to very warm. Move the chairs around so that you can sit next to the boss, not opposite them. Force them to turn to face you. If you have to sit opposite them put your hands under the table and keep them there as much as possible. Some managers have weird ideas and consider you moving your arms around to be a sign of guilt. Honestly, I've seen a few go there! Also stare directly into their eyes. Don't be obviously aggressive. But don't drop eye contact. Especially do not look at your feet.

* If the first question is ""Do you know why you are here?"" you answer ""No."" Let them tell you why you're there. Keep notes in your head if you can, or write them down if you can't, and answer every point raised briefly. Do not ramble, do not argue. Look up Grey Rock. Go Grey Rock. Bore them. Make them think it's a waste of time doing this. Make them want to get out of that room faster than you do.

* These people are not your friends. From the moment they decide to discipline you then cut them off socially. Remove them from any social networks you have and DO NOT go out after work with them. 

* Do not sign anything that you disagree with. You are not obliged to sign something just because it's put in front of you. 

* Once you've had the bollocking then all goodwill is off the table. If you can afford it: no overtime. Certainly do not step in for others. Arrive on time, leave on time. Take your breaks. Ignore them as much as possible. If you're ill, have the time off. Do not let them bully you into working more than you have to. 


Life is too short and the social contract has been broken by psychotic plutocrats. You owe them nothing. Somewhere along the way we've forgotten that the bosses should be the ones ensuring that we have everything we need and are comfortable in our roles. Not enforcing rule after rule after rule for their own egos. They should be honoured that we decided to work for them. After all, without us they'd have to do it all themselves. Without us their business wouldn't survive. The cap doffing, forelock tugging and ass kissing has to stop.

Solidarity."

2,2024-02-11,Company is trying to “silent fire” my team. How can I force them to let me wfh until I find a new job?,u/nerdybirdeee,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aoedjm/company_is_trying_to_silent_fire_my_team_how_can/,antiwork,"Okay the title sounds crazy but hear me out- 

I work for a huge corporation owned by a very evil CEO that is a household name. You probably know what company I’m referring to. They are just as crappy to their employees as you’d imagine. I’ve been here for 5 years and the stress I’ve endured has cost me thousands in medical bills.

This company is currently “silent firing” my entire team by removing all of the work we do and giving it to another team in the company. I know the reason is my boss. It sounds stupid that they’d eliminate a whole team bc of him, but he’s awful and my company won’t fire him. It also makes sense they’d do it this way bc our team is small and pretty unnecessary if you ask me. So now we have had zero work to do for the past two months. 

Despite this, my boss wants us all in office 5 days a week because he knows what’s happening and thinks it makes him look even worse if he lets his team wfh even though we did our jobs from home for 3 years but I digress. 

Having no work means my team is just sitting around doing *absolutely nothing* for 8 hours a day. 

Now, I’m the queen of keeping myself busy but I also have some issues that make it very difficult to focus. Since we have no work, my coworkers sit around and talk loudly all day. Which I totally understand, but it’s very draining for me and we have an open office plan. I can’t even focus enough to apply for jobs or update my resume when I’m there, it’s gotten really bad and it’s keeping me trapped and depleted. I come home and crash. I can’t do it a moment longer. 

Here’s where my ideas to use malicious compliance come in- 

I would love some help brainstorming some ways to basically force them to let me wfh until I can find a new job. If they aren’t going to fire me, I’m not going to stand for being forced out by boring me to death. They are going to screw me I’m going to find a way to screw them. 

Luckily, my company is notorious for refusing to fire anyone. Hence the silent firing of my team. I feel this could be used to my advantage. I’m open to any and all suggestions you guys have. I don’t even care about getting a reference from this company as I plan on switching careers anyways once I leave here. So as long as it doesn’t get me in legal trouble, I’m game. 


If you feel like reading further, here are a few ideas I’ve been playing around with:

1. I have a disability protected by the ADA. My doctor has worked w me to request accommodations in the past (not wfh) which all were denied. My dr has been saying she will write me a note to wfh but I knew they would say no. If she were to write me the note, and I just started working from home- what could they do? I have a note, they are legally required to provide some kind of accommodation and they have refused everything else. 

2. Just start working from home anyways. I had an old coworker who did this and he was never fired for it. He did it for months before finally being terminated for something unrelated- which was bringing a weapon into work and discharging it. Even then, they weren’t going to fire him until someone on the team threatened legal action. 

3. Call their bluff. Meet w HR and boss and tell them the only way I can continue to do my job is to wfh. Basically make them admit that they are willing to let go an employee who is a high performer just bc they refuse to accommodate my disability. They know how bad this makes them look since they are constantly preaching about how inclusive they are to people w disabilities, and it could get them in trouble since they are legally required to accommodate- so I feel like they might allow it to save face? If I quit, that’s another person gone from my bosses team which makes his days even more numbered. I feel this would give him incentive to fight for it or allow it? (I’m probably being delusional w this option but it’s a last case scenario) 

Normally I’d just quit without anything lined up- but I don’t want to be without insurance while in between jobs. The marketplace isn’t affordable for me at my current income level and I don’t have a ton of savings due to being an underpaid single parent in medical debt. That’s why I feel like I need to either wfh until I can find something else or make them fire me so I can get some unemployment or something in the mean time (which will be very difficult bc like I said- they don’t fire anyone)

I know this all sounds nuts but I’m telling you, desperate times call for desperate measures and here I am. 

Edit to add- I’ve been looking for a new job for over a year now and have interviewed at so many places. My field is super competitive right now which is why I haven’t found anything. This is also why I will be switching careers once I leave here.

7,2024-02-11,Not wanting to participate in weekend 'team building' event as a manager,u/Sentello,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aoffey/not_wanting_to_participate_in_weekend_team/,antiwork,"Hi everyone,

I know that the topic of team building has been discussed extensively, and while the answer may be out there, it may not quite address my concerns. So what's the problem? My situation is a little different from others. I am in a leadership position, responsible for a significant number of people, and this year a three-day team-building event is scheduled, 2 months in advance. It starts after work on Friday and ends sometime after lunch on Sunday. We're going to a lakeside retreat. Everyone is responsible for their own transportation, which allows for flexible arrival times. Although I haven't looked into it, it's probably not required that we stay the entire time. Maybe I could stay one night and leave in the morning. Accommodations will be shared in wooden cabins with minimal privacy. Undoubtedly, there will be individuals who snore or make noise late into the night after consuming alcohol, so it's not really about relaxation; it's more about excessive drinking. Besides, I hardly drink. I only occasionally open a bottle of wine with a good meal. So what will I be doing there? There won't be anything like ready-made meals from a restaurant, we will prepare our own meals, probably using an outdoor grill to cook meat, burgers or sausages with ketchup at most.

My superior will be present, along with his superior and other leaders on the same level as me. Therefore, my presence is expected because all my subordinates are eagerly anticipating it. They behave like children in the office; there isn't a day when they don't discuss and plan it. I'm not sure if I'm just a complete introvert who doesn't like people, but I really don't want to attend! I make an effort to go to the office a few times a week to avoid accusations, but I prefer to work from home. I have trouble concentrating in the office, which may be the root of the problem. Because I'm not in the office, I don't foster social relationships, so activities like team building or going out to bars with colleagues just don't appeal to me. I didn't even attend the last Christmas party - there were more reasons to stay home than to attend.

Last year, I missed the team building because I had already planned a vacation, so I did not have to deal with this nonsense. Besides, the company didn't organize such activities two years ago because of the pandemic.

When I was younger, I didn't mind such events - I was happy to participate in all company events, including team-building activities, and maybe even looked forward to getting to know my colleagues. Now, however, I see it as a waste of time. I'd rather watch TV shows and sleep than attend these events. I see my job simply as work; I have long since stopped believing in such notions as ""we are a family. After I leave a job, no one is interested in me, even though I have made a positive contribution to the company. I can't say that I have any friends from past jobs, so I consider it a futile endeavor.

It's obvious that this question is not only related to the planned weekend team building; it's a question I generally struggle with because I'm not enthusiastic about these events. Several times a year, we meet with colleagues after work at a bar or pub. Everyone pays for their own drinks and food - I emphasize this because these events are always organized by someone in the team as informal get-togethers and aren't covered by the company budget. I've attended several times to avoid inconveniencing colleagues who have reserved seats at the venue. I usually opt for something non-alcoholic, and if it's late, I'll enjoy dinner, but I usually leave after two hours. Other colleagues stay and drink until closing time.

I need advice on how to handle this situation."

My vision is to start my own company so that I can be my own boss and be a (hopefully better than the rest) boss to others."

His health is really starting to take a decline these days and the past few weeks he has been in a lot of pain from his hips and back. His management has acted incredulously towards him in the past about his problems, but this week has taken the cake from with it being outright malicious and harassment.

He is taking a few days off work because he simply can't deal with the pain of standing and moving around. I've never seen him be in this much pain from his RA before and we've been together closing in on a decade. And he is scheduled to get cortisone shots in his hips during his time off to hopefully help him manage his pain. In response to him taking time off work, the store manager said, ""Oh, that's the story you're going with?"" as if he was lying. And then the manager said that people were saying ""He was going around telling people he was taking time off for his anniversary"" with me. At no point has he ever said that. It is a blatant lie. He has worked there for years and has never taken time off for our anniversary. We've never formally celebrated our anniversary.

I am incredibly disgusted and miffed about this. He has been a great worker that has worked through countless shifts in pain. The way they have treated him has me utterly incensed. And given his health condition and that he is handicapped, I feel like they're in violation of the ADA or at least they are creating a hostile work environment in light of him being handicapped.

I am kind of at a loss here. I'd love to go there and give them a piece of my mind, but obviously that wouldn't be good for him."

Before starting here I was laid off twice and was desperately searching for a new job. I originally applied for a lower-paying position just to make money, but they offered me a different position as a QC Engineer. Cool? Right? Well, here's the thing. They kind of hired me without a plan. Like, I've heard from other people that my boss and others in my department don't know what to do with me. My position is namolous. 

I haven't done much in terms of working. I've been given very little to do. Most times I sit at my desk for 10 hours doing nothing except browsing reddit and youtube. 

Whatever work they do give me, I'm not properly trained for. I'm an Engineer, whose mechanically illiterate. I can't read a print or spec to save my life. I do have a background in QC, but not Engineering.

My boss has said they're gonna give me white belt training and other resources to help. That was back in October, and I still don't know what the hell I'm doing. Improvising can only get me so far.

You'd think sitting around getting paid to do nothing is ideal? After a while it becomes tedious. Especially for ten hours a day. Seems like I'm just wasting my time until I can the weekend comes.

Back to school season is the busiest time of year and we commonly needed four cashiers to check people out. After a long day of checking people out I was burned out and ready to head home but unfortunately we have to stay and clean up after we close. Because it was back to school season I’d have a thousand returns to put back at the end of the night and cleaning all of our employees headsets is also a pain in the ass as well as taking out all the trash and vacuuming the entire store. We normally close at 9 but just because we are scheduled to work until 9 doesn’t mean that we clock out at 9. It means that we work a closing shift and we have to stay and clean up and do all the things I mentioned above. During back to school, we usually did not end up going home until 10:30. I had to deal with a lot of rude customers there as well. It’s hot as hell here in summer in Charlotte, NC and temperatures commonly reach 95+ yet our manager will not allow us to wear shorts. He only lets us wear jeans which is very stupid. It is torture for me to wear jeans in this kind of weather. We only get a 10% discount which is absolutely pathetic. Don’t get me wrong I liked some of the people I worked with. My manger was very nice to me and he always admired that I sold a lot of school supply donation boxes to help kids who can’t afford school supplies as well as selling many protection plans on electronics and chairs. Thanks to me I always put our store in the lead as far as donation box sales in our region. This location would not have gotten anywhere close to the top of that list without me. My manager would also always schedule me for closing shifts to 10:30 5 days a week during back to school and that was also torture for me and sometimes he would even have me working closing shifts one day and then opening shifts the next day and that was awful too cause then I got little to no sleep and I was always so tired because of that. This is all at the cost of me making only $12 an hour. After a while, I just decided that it wasn’t worth it so then I just quit. I feel like I wasn’t getting paid enough for everything I had to put up with. I would go back but not for less than $15 an hour plus 20% commission on every protection plan and donation box I sell."

I wanted to ask this in here in case someone had a similar experience or some guidance if I can say something to HR in this case. 

Back in December I was put on a 90 day PIP (performance improvement plan) which is essentially a final even once completed. Prior to this I have never even had a write up just informal off-the-records talks, even more weird is the months before I had been complimented on raising my stats. I have asked for accommodations to help with my tasks, but HR and management have not done anything even after sending them resources myself. 

With the PIP it had some things that would have fallen under accommodations, such as solid & tangible goals instead of a generic ‘boost your numbers’. To me it comes across as a punishment for requesting accommodations. It also seems super fishy that I would go automatically to a final without any documentation of any kind, especially after speaking to HR and management about being AuDHD.

I don't know if I should stay in the hopes it gets better but this feels intentional because of the rostering hours changing so drastically , used to start at 9 but now its been moved to 12 and it feels like a mass lay off."
19,2024-02-11,HR wants to meet with me to discuss my “role”,u/APoxOfMox,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aooyey/hr_wants_to_meet_with_me_to_discuss_my_role/,antiwork,"Our company has recently been releasing a lot of employees and making the remaining ones pick up the slack.

I’ve been kept around but the difference with my role is that it was always a back end role with no front line interactions with customers or clients. They suddenly changed my job description to include front line support which I obviously didn’t sign up for and hate. 

They originally told me it was temporary and just changed my schedule and tasks. This was almost a year ago and since then I have been doing a job that was completely different than the one I’ve been doing before. 

I have been making a lot of noise over this, especially since it seems I was the only one of my department who has been changed. The others who were doing the same job I was have kept doing that job. Only I was given the front line task.

Now HR wants to meet with me to discuss my “role”. I am thinking they either want to fire me, or get me to accept the new role as is without compensation. Does anyone have any advice as to what I should say or if there’s anything I can do to get them to put me back to the role I applied for. I am seriously starting to worry that I will be majorly screwed here. Any advice is appreciated"

Imperium Logistics in Carneys point New Jersey. Recently they implemented a “Policy” that we have to complete 20 training videos in 10 days or we get written up and 1 day of unpaid suspension. If we don’t complete these videos in these 10 days we get 2 more days to complete these videos or we are fired. Each video training takes about 45 minutes to complete. We work 3 14 hour shifts a week we are constantly running and only have 1  30 minute break. They expect us to complete these videos on our break or on our days off. Our boss is very hostile and yells at us constantly it’s gotten very bad. It’s gotten to the point where we are taking steps into possibly unionizing.

He’s very trans inclusive and he’s inexpensive and always works with me but I just don’t think it’s doing anything. My depression won’t go away because my situation will not improve. I don’t have a stable job and I have no plan for when my lease ends in April. I’m on the verge of losing my home and possibly cats and my job told me they will call me in March if they need me so I’m just screwed. I didn’t ask for any of this. I was happy at my theme park job and I thought I excelled there and my coworkers liked me and I had a roommate picked out from my coworkers.

I messed up and I made an inappropriate joke at the expense of a coworker and while the joke was objectively hilarious, the person whose expense it was also happened to be the renowned Snitch. I didn’t know this, I thought he was my friend and that I could make the same type of joke that he always makes. I was suspended. Leadership told me very little until they brought me back and demoted my pay and stripped me of my title of “trainer” and denied my time off request for December and January. They said I wouldn’t be eligible for the park wide raise anymore. Then they positioned me at the most stressful ride at the park and expected me to be okay. I had a panic attack and a meltdown and I could not pull myself together. Then it got worse because after they moved me to a different ride and I carefully took control of an incident, proving my worth despite my treatment, they pulled me into the office and asked about a comment I made on YouTube that morning (this was before they spoke to me in the office the first time) apologizing for a coworker yelling at a guest and I confirmed that it was me so they fired me. They wouldn’t listen to me explain about my autism in either instance, shutting me down instead. My Black supervisor even made a comment for the second time since I started that she understands Autism because her Nephew is Autistic. I only bring up race because it’s a bold claim for her to make when we all know how it would be if I said I had a nephew who is Black. You can’t know my experience and I can’t know yours so stfu and listen to me and stop telling me my Disability is an excuse. 

I couldn’t take it so I stormed out of the office before they finished going over the separation information. My supervisor escorted me out with a different area lead and they were talking and joking as though I hadn’t just lost my only source of income. It rubbed me the wrong way. After the sacrifices I made for almost two years, they acted like I was nothing, that I meant nothing, like I wasn’t there.

Months prior I had lost my girlfriend suddenly when she abruptly told me she was no longer attracted to me because I am a man now and she’s not attracted to men. She previously claimed to be Pan and then she kept asking if it was okay that she is Ace. All while shaming me for saying I’m open to polyamory. The signs were there but I didn’t see them because I was legitimately in love with her. I thought she was going to propose to me but instead she gave a detailed description of the ring she was going to propose with followed by a weak apology for what she was about to do. I ran crying to my room and our relationship soured quickly after that. I have been coping with so much and I have held myself together better than most NT people but still punished because I can’t be exactly as the world wants me to be. 

Thought things were looking up at this warehouse job but they basically laid me off for the month of February and I don’t know what to do. I’m depressed and I know I have to keep going. The roommate I thought I had stopped responding and I found out from a different friend that she was moving in with her boyfriend (last I heard they broke up). So everything keeps falling through. I cry and I starve myself but it’s not because I hate my FTM fat…I just don’t have interest in much except caring for my cats. I keep hearing the thoughts that I know will send me back to the hospital if I voice them. I keep writing posts and deleting them because I’m scared of being too vulnerable.

I don’t want to be arrested again. I’m not a threat to anybody except sometimes myself. My fear of being Baker Acted keeps me from attempting which is fucked up but hey, it works. My fear is I’ll be living out of my car and have to give up my cats. I feel like shit for not spaying them yet but I haven’t had money or time or energy because I’m juggling more than a person should. I need help but not the kind my boomer parents or my therapist can provide. I need someone to help me get my life back on track. I have education and job experience so finding a job shouldn’t be this hard. But I’m transgender and autistic which lowers my desire ability. All jobs are ableist in America, they just are. They do not accommodate and I don’t have resources to sue any company for mistreating me. So they get away with it and I get further away from independence. 

I know Reddit will roast me for being a horrible cat parent because they already have multiple times. All I have to give my cats is love and food and water. I wish I could do more and I never intended to adopt them with this predicament. I never thought I would lose my job. I didn’t even think my partner would leave me but here we are.

If I didn’t have my cats I feel as though I would have attempted my life already. The way they look at me makes me want to try harder and to protect them. But I can’t afford their vet visits or flea medication or spaying. I can’t find an affordable apartment that allows pets and I can’t find a roommate without a stable job.

I’m going to try to get fork lift certified because then I might find some work that pays. I’m unfortunately resilient. So many times I swear in a parallel world I have died but in this continuum I just continue on.

This isn’t scraping the surface of my job trauma and life drama but it’s something and I just want someone to hear my scream. I am empty"

With school, you are there for 7 hours vs the 8 hours you are at work, but you have homework you have to do and you don’t get paid for it while your work does pay you. Yet, I despise work more than I ever did school. I did start dreading my last 2 years of high school, but it was nowhere near as much as I dread work, and I haven’t even been in the workforce for that long.

Does anyone else feel the same? It could just be nostalgia, but I’m not sure."

During the interviews, they mentioned that I might have to work from other branches **from time to time**, but they made it sound like it wouldn't be too frequent—maybe once a week at most. Sure, those extra trips would tack on almost two hours to my commute each time, but I figured once a week wouldn't be too bad. 

They told me my main focus would be in the arts field, which really appealed to me given my background. I was eager to help grow a new arts hub—it seemed like a perfect fit. But when I actually started, there was no desk or computer waiting for me. I had to make do with whatever was available from colleagues who were out for the day. And after just about ten days of training, the whole team took off for three to five weeks for the holidays, leaving me to fend for myself in this new role since I didn't have any leave to use during that time.

As time passed, it became clear that the job I thought I was signing up for was not at all what I was doing. Instead of diving into the arts scene, I found myself doing more secretary and customer service work, just with a fancier title.

To make matters worse, nobody seems to know what to do with me or where to put me. **I haven't even met my manager face to face**, and the senior staff in the branch I'm at keep asking if I'll be around next week. Honestly, I have no fucking idea!

Now it's February, and **I'm still without a proper workspace or computer**. And on top of everything, they're saying they want me to be at a branch even farther from home, full-time.

I'm feeling pretty lost and frustrated with the whole situation. I don't know what to do or who to ask for help."

I moved into a nice apartment in 2020 with no job as I had just been accepted for Disability for having Crohns disease. Not wanting to be a then 27 year old just sitting around the house all day long I figured I would go get a part time job to fill some time to not be bored. I found a local pizza place that I actually used to go to as a kid. I applied and got hired. Now a little back ground with crohns is it can affect your Small and Large Intestine as well as your Colon and Illium I got lucky and it affects me in all 4 regions of my stomach. So when I was hired it was to be a server/phone order taker. That's what I did for my first year. At the one year mark I received a 5/5 on every review category and received a 50cent raise. However I started to notice issues among the crew with eachother as well as the job itself. Ranging from cross contamination to people calling others words that would normally get you fired but apparently not here. I told the owner and nothing was done. However the way I looked at it was I don't really need the job but it is nice to have some spare cash. So i stayed all the way up until last thursday. Last thursday did it in for me. A manager and her husband were working with myself and two other female employees. Now I normally don't like the female manager due to things she has said/done like calling autistic people the Rword or stealing our tips. However tonight she made a honest mistake and dropped a piece of pizza and was like welp I'll just give them a 10% discount. The husband instantly starts verbally attacking her to the point of tears till she walks out. 5min later she comes back in crying and even though I don't like her that's obviously no way to talk to someone especially at work it made the environment super awkward and me pissed as I had to deal with a domestic violence situation between my sister and her husband nearly 4 years ago where he nearly killed her if I hadnt of been there to stop him and call the police. However that night made me say screw it no ammount of spare money is worth this so I planned on quiting. Well the next day I go to talk to the owner and I bring him my shirts and hat. He ask if I'm quitting. I say it depends on if he wants to do something about the manager and her husband. Depending on answer I was going to give a two week notice or just straight quit then and there. Let him know what was going on and my obvious issue with it as well as why. Instead of being appalled this person who consideres themselves a good Christian man says I owe him and that I can surely stand working with them for 2 more weeks. I tell him no I can't set my stuff down and walk out. Now he is telling everyone I quit because he denied a day off. This is even after I just had 6 toenails fully pulled and still came in the next day. Did I handle this properly? Or should I have done something differently?"

The last thing the said as they were headed up to watch the superbowl in the community room with its huge projection TV was them saying, “Jobs have never been this bad before, it is all the fault of Boomers and GenX” with someone agreeing that “it was like working in office space.”

My dudes office space was a good representation of the tech industry when it came out, 25 years ago next week.  How lucky you are that your job is only beginning to be a shit show, some of us lived the live long before the movie became a meme.

It's worth mentioning that I've got a decade of experience at this point. I built my career in start-ups, but I'm no longer in that grind mindset. 

So this interview goes on, and it's going pretty well, until this guy says something along the lines of ""well you know these people who leave at 6 pm on the dot and call it work life balance.""

Giant red flag. So I say, ""Well, what would you call it?""

Him: ""Well, you know these people who just want to put in their hours and then go home. We need dedication, and sometimes, working late is just part of the job.""

Me: ""Can you give me an example of when that happened?""

Him: ""Well, we had a product feature that needed to be released, and so it was all hands on deck. Our whole team worked throughout the weekend. It doesn't happen often, but it's important to have that commitment when it does.""

Me: ""Right, so how were your employees compensated for sacrificing their time with their families?""

He just looked at me. Finally, after an awkward pause, he said, ""Well....we're a start-up.""

Me: ""No excuse. When company X was the same size you were, we worked throughout the weekend because our biggest partner's customers couldn't use our biggest competitor anymore. We were all given a 200 dollar permanent raise for our efforts. You can't expect people to just sacrifice their time and not get paid for it.""

And he just stared at me, not knowing what to say. He awkwardly wrapped the interview, and I shot off an email after withdrawing my application. 

Absolutely the hell not."

But everyone is aways on edge freaking out about who sees what over pretty small shit. Because you can get fired over pretty small shit. They're always talking about corporate and the whole thing is way to serious.

It actually messes with my head a little as I have an anxiety disorder and other mental health issues. And rumor has it they have falsely accused someone before and fired them. Even though I'm not doing anything wrong I feel paranoid af. It just seems very excessive.

My father told me not to look for work before New Year, because by his words “no one is hiring in December”. So I stayed home, searched for jobs but never found one. 

In January my father comes at me and says that he has found a job for me, a pretty high-paying one. I was surprised, nervous, but I was ready to work. 

I went on an interview, they surveyed me and offered me a one-week non paying trial, then a 3-month internship with a 50% salary, and after that, if they would’ve liked my performance, they would hire me. 

Next Monday I come to this one week trial, and I gotta say the office is gorgeous, people are smart, and the tasks are hard enough. 

For the first two days they gave me some theory and tasks, I completed them, but then they abandoned me. I had no tasks, no new theory, no nothing. I tried to ask around for more, but all I could hear was “we’re busy”, “ask tomorrow”, “not today”. I tried to ask around till the end of the week and I was nervous that they didn’t like me. 

On Friday I had no answer about hiring, I asked my manager on Saturday, they told me to come on Monday and wait till the big boss makes the verdict. 

And so on and on, two weeks go by. I snatch some minor tasks and do them, but I’m not getting paid. 

I’ve worked for a month total, and I haven’t received a cent. And finally, after a month of my one-week trial, my manager comes at me and asks to have a chat. They ask me about my colleagues, these minor tasks, and if I have any further questions. I ask them about my status in that job, and following question was “Is that so important for you to sign a contract?” I was flabbergasted. I thought to myself “do they really think I have any motivation to work other than money?”

Oh, in addition to all of that, the timetable is 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, but they keep everyone till 7:00 pm without bonus payment. I stood my ground and told them that I wouldn’t sit there 2 extra hours. 

So, after that question, I decide to leave. A week goes by, they call me and ask me to give them another chance. I need money, I want to move in with my girlfriend, but I’m not sure about that job.

However in my current position I have a very good team that we cohesively work well together. There is room for personal growth where I am now and lots of practice for customer interaction.

I have passion for what I'm doing now and I'd feel very bad for leaving my team high and dry after our boss getting fired last week. We are struggling to find a new norm. My current position only I'm able to do in the company right now.

How do I talk to my work that I'm considering leaving? They have been very good to me over the last 3 years and my boss that was fired was like a mentor to me and actually gave me enough confidence to ask for a raise (and I got it!)

I'm very torn with loyalty because of the growth I've had but economically it makes sense for me to leave."
17,2024-02-12,Micromanagement,u/Luvfallandpsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aozey4/micromanagement/,antiwork,"Started a new job 6 months ago and it has been micromanagement 24/7. My boss is about 9 years younger than me and we share a tiny tiny tiny office. Boss is surface friendly. They hired an additional person for our team, so our team is 3 people. I should be getting a job offer elsewhere pretty soon.

 Is this excessive micromanaging?

-Got a write up 90 days in for a file NAME not being exactly perfect (I may have labeled it Annual Review and it should have been Eval). The file names per boss are approximately the length of about 6-8 words (very long).

-Boss watches me constantly and stares at me, I can see out of the corner of my eye.

-If I say something, like I need to look something up and don’t know it off the top of my head, I can hear boss furiously typing away notes (most certainly about me having to look something up).

-Got into trouble for moving a coffee pot 2 feet down a counter (to a better spot quite frankly) while cleaning.

-Got in trouble because I had the office door open but it was not perfectly flush with the wall (a 1-2 inch difference).

-Coworker who wants my spot told me that boss trashes me behind my back.

-Boss has started giving coworker my projects and giving coworker credit for my items.

-Got in trouble for asking for a copy of a template message that my coworker sends out for consistency because according to my boss ‘You have to create your own material but it should be similar.’

-Then got in trouble for trying to write my own material because it wasn’t perfect and was then advised that I SHOULD have copied and pasted.

-Got in trouble for asking an employee ‘How did it make you uncomfortable?’ During an investigation because according to my boss ‘Employee feelings don’t matter. Only FACTS do.’

-I was injured on the job (fell badly on ice) which was captured by camera footage AND witnessed. Asked to go to doctor and was glared at by boss on my way out the door. The witness came to me later to tell me they thought it was weird because boss asked them if I actually fell. And yes, I really did fall.

In short, I feel like I cannot even breathe. I am not able to make a mistake and go back and fix it. I get in trouble for using my own words. In the morning, my boss grills me 5 minutes after walking in on things that happened 2 weeks ago. Boss literally got back from 2 week vacation at the beach, and started grilling me about everything that happened (very clearly coworker trashed me and made shit up). I am not perfect, I don’t claim to be, but this boss has completely deflated me.

Am I being ridiculous?"

- gave feedback to our manager that I have sloppy work that needs to be repeated
- he knew fully well that I am caregiving for my mom with Stage 4 cancer
- I once apologized via chat for taking long in my task, saying that I’m occupied with my mother’s cancer but he DID NOT even acknowledge this and just went on talking about what was wrong in my output

I just don’t know how these soulless people are even born. My manager also just fully accepted his “feedback” as truth and even said that sloppy work costs the company more because of rework.

Maybe I was slow, but I was goddamn new to the job (it’s in software engineering) and I already informed them I have personal stuff going on. I was even called out for all my UNPAID leaves because I accompanied mom to chemo 🤷‍♀️ and now I may not be regularized.

About 3 years ago I used to work as a videographer doing social media content for a 7 figure company. I was paid roughly just better than minimum wage and was cranking out (at one point) 50 videos a day. I was freelancing and was on a loose contract. I was desperate for the money.

It was an insane amount of work and however I managed to do it for 6 months is beyond me, especially for how shitty I was paid.

The office was an incredibly bitter and snide place and it was clear that management would purpolsely stir shit to watch staff fight as a form of entertainment. I kept well away from it but it was incredibly stressful on top of video work.

After about six months I pitch to the higher ups that my videos are making an insanely positive difference to their sales (I showed them graphs of interactions and direct links to sales on the website via my content) and asked for a pay rise. I compared my ideal salary to others in the industry and made a big deal about how it would still be less than I should be paid however I still wanted to continue working for them. I was fired hours later for, and I shit you not, not ""pulling my weight"" as well as not having the desired effect they wanted on social media.

I was fuming and now unemployed. I struggled for months to find any other job.

Today (years later) whilst browsing a very old Google drive account, I found that said company was still using a folder I created and owned. They were mostly active in the files containing templates, adjustment layers, presets, and even video that I all created. Over 18 people were actively using it daily to continue with their social media campaigns. This was a cloud service that I was paying monthly for as I wanted extra space for my work.

This is my drive and my work. I own it. So I copied the file as a local version for myself and then deleted the online version. Tomorrow they will wake up with none of their video assets (including things they were working on).

On top of that, they were CONSTANTLY closing it to be cleaned.  It was very common to do the “bathroom shuffle” - walking around the entire building and never finding a stall, eventually just losing the “urge.”

My company was purchased by an even larger company.  Now I work on a mega campus and there is 1 bathroom with 4 stalls for my entire floor.  It again is ALWAYS being cleaned (more than half the time I go to use it)!  More often than not I am having to go to one or several floors to get my business done.

A while ago I went for another role - I was advised during the process about the different  rounds - the final round, they advised me, would be doing a presentation on-site to 2 directors . This was for a support manager role .. imagine taking time out of your day to go present let alone a couple of evenings to draft a presentation. 
Previous to that I had to do a 6 page executive summary on support practices only to have to chase the company recruiter down to find out how i did in the interviews .

I find tech companies having such a “holier than thou” , self important attitude who think everyone should be so privileged to work there.

I'll start saying I am not an economist or something else, I am just a worker in a welding site who is tired about this shitty life, working 8 hours a day, berated from boss or coworkers, and having less time for hobbies and hurting my back, joints and eyes (the other week I was working whit a machine with exposed cables and then they sparkled, I am very horrified that I could literally die for  a bunch of money that guarantee me only to pay rent, food and sometimes  shitty entertainment). 
I was thinking what about open a factory where all the workers can enjoy the entire monthly company turnover divided equally whit each others?  A place where all the people can have a decisional impact for the Company businesses? Where all the machines are upgraded and cleaned, and no one can risk their lives?
What would be, in your opinion, advantages or disadvantages about this system? Could it fail In a system like ours? Could it resolve, in part, the inflation problem and be a good option for a redistribution for the workers?.

I opted for the passive aggressive reply of sending a screenshot of our prior conversation.

*Processing img whq9cunnv6ic1...*

Whatever bot she was using to see if someone is interested needs work. It clearly didn't know what to do with the screenshot I sent, and must have not detected any negative words, so sent an automated message inviting me to book an appointment. Naturally, I booked a half hour. She wasted my time. I figured the least I could do is return the favor.

Not sure if these types of bots are against the TOS of LinkedIn, but I'm pretty sure her using just her last initial instead of her last name violates their TOS.

I already can't stand recruiters, but the fact that she's automating the process so that she can send out hundreds of these out a day to get people to buy a franchise from her is just insulting. They don't give a shit if your franchise succeeds or fails, as long as they get their fee."

I justify it by my quality of work and the company is a giant in my state that in my opinion underpays the majority of positions including mine.

For the most part I've never understood why being at work for 40 hours is so important if it's not completely necessary, Like if I went to my company and told them I've been stealing time for the last year but my performance was good that whole time I'd still get fired but if I stayed at work for 40 hours each week I'd just spend 10 hours a week doing completely unnecessary shit, I understand I'm in a really lucky situation where I can flex my schedule a lot without anyone ever knowing but it really makes me sad thinking of how many people can't do that because they have eyes on them making sure they're at their 40, I worked in a shipyard prior to this job as a mechanic and there would be so many God damn hours out of a week where we'd just be sitting and waiting for the day to end so we could go home and it was killing my mental health.

The restaurant doesn't get a lot of business.

However, I overheard my coworker recently complain about this task today. They said that they don’t have anything to do during this time since this task almost never has to be done. They then said that they might speak with our manager to try and get them on board to do a more time consuming task that other coworkers are currently doing. And if they are put on it, I will almost certainly be put on it as well.

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t fuming. Why on earth would you not want an extra hour or two a day to relax and do whatever you want? What’s even more mind boggling is this person usually works from home and they were COMPLAINING that since they didn’t have anything to do, they did their laundry and other household chores.

When I started my new job in December, I was excited to be part of a big company with branches all over the place, including two branches that are VERY close to where I live. During the interviews, they mentioned that I might have to work from other branches **from time to time**, but they made it sound like it wouldn't be too frequent—maybe once a week at most. Sure, those extra trips would tack on almost two hours to my commute each time, but I figured once a week wouldn't be too bad.

They told me my main focus would be in the arts field, which really appealed to me given my background. I was eager to help grow a new arts hub—it seemed like a perfect fit. But when I actually started, there was no desk or computer waiting for me. I had to make do with whatever was available from colleagues who were out for the day. And after just about ten days of training, the whole team took off for three to five weeks for the holidays, leaving me to fend for myself in this new role since I didn't have any leave to use during that time.

As time passed, it became clear that the job I thought I was signing up for was not at all what I was doing. Instead of diving into the arts scene, I found myself doing more secretary and customer service work, just with a fancier title.

To make matters worse, nobody seems to know what to do with me or where to put me. **I haven't even met my manager face to face**, and the senior staff in the branch I'm at keep asking if I'll be around next week. Honestly, I have no fucking idea!

Now it's February, and **I'm still without a proper workspace or computer**. And on top of everything, they're saying they want me to be at a branch even farther from home, full-time.

I'm feeling pretty lost and frustrated with the whole situation. I don't know what to do or who to ask for help.

Edit: I want to point out that secretary work or customer facing work is not to be dismissed, reduced or held in any kind of contempt. It's tough, thankless work and I apologize if I gave off the vibe of ""I'm better than this""."

10,2024-02-12,"i quit my job, now what?",u/teethfordice,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1apcnsv/i_quit_my_job_now_what/,antiwork,"a few weeks ago, i made the decision to quit my job, and it's been the best decision i've ever made. i had been working at the job for three years, and while it paid well for someone my age (22f) the stress and workload were taking a toll on my health.

there were times when i juggled multiple responsibilities at once, and despite my efforts, the workload only seemed to increase. i expressed my struggles with anxiety and workload to my bosses, but unfortunately, things didn't improve.

the breaking point came when i was unexpectedly asked to take on even more responsibilities after a colleague was fired. (which i found out about from other employees) i started to panic, i knew i couldn't handle anymore with the way my health was looking. i was burnt out and overwhelmed. my bosses told me to take my lunch break and move my things to the new office afterward. (they had moved me about 5 times at this point and each time they said it would be the last time i'd have to move) i ""complied"" and started packing my belongings to move offices during my lunch break. (moving things to my car) i knew i would quit, i just didn't know it would be that day. i made the decision when my boss looked at me with cold eyes. they didn't care about my health. they didn't care if this job killed me. i was just a convenient body to have around. to pick up the scraps and to do the heavy lifting when they didn't feel like it. 

here was our conversation -

*i was in the middle of moving my stuff to my car*

she saw me and asked ""what are you doing?""

i said ""i have a lot of stuff i need to move""

she stared at me and said ""your lunch ended 30 minutes ago, you need to be in that office."" truthfully i didn't care if it took me all day to move my things.

i smiled and looked at her then said ""okay""

she said ""you can either go to that office right now, or you can leave"" a few times. 

i said ""okay"", finished getting the stuff i cared about, walked out to see outside at the window, the boss talking with hr, looking at me occasionally. i told my coworker she can keep the rest of my stuff in the office, got in my car, and left. i couldn't stop laughing. she called and texted telling me i needed to go to hr. i didn't respond. it was a relief to be free of a place that didn't care about my well-being.

while leaving the job has alleviated much of my anxiety and stress, i now find myself without another job lined up and no more savings. i wasn't planning to quit that day, but i couldn't continue subjecting myself to such a toxic environment. now that i've had a few weeks without work, i'm hesitant to jump back into the workforce.

i'm dealing with a lot of debt and bills, but i also recognize the importance of prioritizing my mental health. i'm a highly anxious person, and traditional jobs leave me mentally and physically drained. i've tried various industries like food, retail, and office work, but none of them feel like the right fit for me. i live in a small town with very little opportunity for creative work. i don't know what to do! i just wish we didn't have to live like this. there has to be a better way."
377,2024-02-12,It's all bullshit.,u/LuckyPersimmon8217,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1apcr3s/its_all_bullshit/,antiwork,"Me, my mom, and brother grew up in a tiny two bedroom apartment. Me and my brother shared a room most of my childhood and never had a lot of space. This is all my single mother could afford. I watched her work up to four(!!!) jobs just to make ends meet. I give this backstory to help you understand that I've always wanted a home. Always. I dreamed of having my own backyard with a fence. It sounds silly, but it's true. 

 My mom made sure me and my brother went to college, had good work history, and great credit. She was convinced, like most of us, that this would protect us from having to live and work the way she did.

Seven months ago, I quit my job. My boss was verbally abusive and it was beginning to affect even my physical health, according to my doctor. She said, ""You might have to choose between your health and your occupation."". 

 I believed what my mom said though. I will be okay. I thought to myself, ""That's okay-- I have a degree, I have great work history, I have a very good credit score. I'll get hired by someone in no time."". I had some money saved up too, so I figured I was fine. 

I applied for over 1,000 jobs. I got four interviews, and two of them ghosted me after the first one. My apartment rate went up. Lost my healthcare coverage. Didn't qualify for unemployment because I chose to leave the job (my state apparently believes I should have stayed in an openly hostile place of employment rather than leave because of course). Sprinkle in necessary use of a credit card to pay my rent and other necessities and guess what? 

My credit score has plummeted. Savings has dwindled to nothing. My car has probably $700 worth of work needing to be done to it. And that dream of owning a home? It's gone. It's over.
I finally found a job making barely enough to even pay rent and will have to get another to pay for other expenses. 
I am living the life my mother always worked to make sure I didn't. 

Here's where I'm at. Right now it looks like:
I'll never have a home.
I'll never pay off my student loans. 
I'll never get a vacation.
I'll never get to live my life.

All because for six months of my entire working life companies refused to hire me. That's it. That's the reason.

These evil, bloodsucking, leeches at the top get to lounge around while everyone else has to beg for scraps and be told that they're selfish or bratty for wanting more. 

My mom's plan to keep us safe was well-meaning. Her lessons about hard work and planning came from a good place. Her insistence on having a good credit score made sense in theory. 

But guess what?

It's all bullshit. All of it. You stay safe by being rich. That's it. Everyone else? See you at the bottom begging for scraps."

People are pissed because obviously they have bills to  pay.  
Today, Monday morning comes around and again, another email stating we should be paid by 3.

The thing is, the employee she supposedly sent money to in Belarus works at the US warehouse.  and we are now well past 3 so I reached out and got no response. 

A little while ago, I got a notification that someone was trying to log into my google account from the same area the office is based out of. I went to change the password, it was changed back to what it was before I changed it. I changed it again, t was changed back again. I noticed that the recovery phone number was my boss' so I texted her asking if she was trying to get into my emails to which she answered that the woman that does our payroll emailed everyone at the company asking us to change our email  passwords , and since I didn't respond she went ahead and did it for me. I know both of these things are lies because 1,  I privately texted several people in my department as well as our accountant, our COO, and a few others in separate departments asking if any of them got this email. No one did, and  2, the password she supposedly changed remained the same as it has been for months.  


About an hour after the notification about my account being logged into, me and a few others received an email from the lady that handles payroll asking us to change the password to our PAYROLL login app. nothing google related. as well as the fact that there is no update on our pay.  


My boss has texted me and several others asking us to request money from her on Venmo. I don't know about everyone else's but mine was an amount I am not normally paid and since I am salaried, it is usually exact every check.

When I came to the company they didn't hire me as a security guard: On paper my job title is ""Doorman/Residential Concierge."" But my responsibilities are literally that of a security guard, in fact I'm quite certain they hired me for this building with the intention of paying me as 
a doorman but using me as a security guard.

For the past few months I have been working at this spot 6 days a week with only Wednesdays off. Funny enough every other week on Wednesday my only other ""guard"" for this site would call out (Keep in mind he only does one day!! While I'm doing six)
They would call me and fully expect me to cover his and other sites too.

To make things even worse, I live far away from the site my normal commute is like 1 hour and thirty on a good day, usually 2 on a regular day. 

Tommorow In my city (NYC), we are expecting a snowstorm and my main method of transportation to work is usually the train. Hell even on a good day sometimes the train in my city sucks, you couldn't imagine during a possible 8inch snowstorm. 

So having all this information ahead of time, I think since I haven't called out in a while I would call them and call out. Especially since the guy on Wednesday has no problem calling out on his one scheduled day.

Well I call in and explain it to them, suddenly the line gets transferred to my O.M (operations manager) and she's telling me how it's mandatory we come in during a snowstorm!

She literally told me if I didn't come in she'd take me off schedule, I didn't back down and instead now they told me to come in @ 9:00am on Thursday.

If they fire me for calling out during a snowstorm, while there's a dude calling out every other wensday then I'm pretty sure this isn't a company I want to work for.

+Since I'm licensed, I can get a better job as an ACTUAL security guard. Probably make more money as well. . .

Wish me luck guys I made need it, fuck these companies that think we are supposed to just bend over backwards for them!"

She’s been getting on some of the kitchen staff’s nerves recently because she’s been telling us what to do and whatnot whereas previous bar managers were pretty separate and didn’t affect us at all.

Anyway, the bar manager has now told us we have to sign this 6 page policy agreement shit by our next shift or we’re fired. Some of what it contains is shit like:

“Uniform

Bartending staff uniforms must look clean and stylish while being comfortable enough for a server to perform their duties.

Bottoms:
- Shorts must be long enough to cover private parts. No skirts are permitted unless there are shorts underneath or they are skirts.

Tops:
- Crop tops are OK as long as they are not TOO short, they must be crop tops NOT bras.”

This is one small snippet of the policy but it seems pretty suspect to me. I’m a uni student and don’t know much about this, so I was wondering peoples thoughts on whether I have to sign it or not?

Tbh there isn’t a ton that’s egregious so I might sign it regardless but it’s a bit of a principle thing for me.

The longest tenured cook (other than the kitchen manager) who is also the kitchen manager’s niece is not too pleased about the policy. We have a group chat and when the bar manager told us we need to sign it or we’re fired, she was clapping back and they had this whole long back and forth.

Anyway sorry for rambling, if anyone has any insight into whether they can fire us for not signing this policy shit please lmk"

Now, I would enjoy a smoke on holidays if there's any coffee shops about such as in Spain or the Canary Islands so I thought in the fantastic state of mind I was in, to tuck in a suck down on this joint. That led to another and another and probably about 10 more being honest, I can't really remember. That leads to where my job comes in.

So one day at work(I was a supervisor of a workshop but have a trade background in the same line of work) I get called over the intercom to drop into the office for a message. I went in and took the note and read it on the way back out. My heart fucking sank. Random drug screening. What the actual fuck are the odds. I won't bore you with the nitty gritty but I did the test and obviously failed. This led to being suspended with pay while the company decided disciplinary action for gross negligence of the drug policy. A month goes by and I get the response. ""7 days notice of dismissal"". I cannot describe the words I felt. I gave my heart and sole to that place and so did my father before me. I had aspired to someday be the manager or possibly a managing director. I knew my job and the system inside and out. Sure many people probably did too, but I seemed to be the only one that cared or strove to do better, without stepping on anyone's toes.

So naturally, I appealed the decision. I went through the process, sat in front of the board representing the company for my appeal. Stated my case to them. I won. Fantastic!! I knew they'd have my back, despite how it seemed at first. Maybe that was just procedure considering what happened and I was just the unfortunate lad to break the rules and get caught? Either way, it's over. I have to drop in and do another medical at short notice. Once it's clear, I'm good to go.

2 days later I get one of the worst phonecalls of my life. My sister, who lives in another country, is on the other end. ""One_ad, I'm dying. I've got about a year, maybe 18 months. It's cancer"". My world started crashing down but I wanted to help in anyway I could. The plan was, fly over, get her and her stuff and come back here to Ireland for treatment. I notified my job as to what happened. The response, by text message. ""It never rains but it pours"". What the fuck. Whatever, fuck you. At least I wasn't told no I have to be here in Ireland for a medical and my sister can go fuck herself.

Well, they didn't say it out loud anyway. The very day after I had landed, I get a phonecall while in my sisters place abroad. Its a company landline. I answer and its a lady from HR. She says I've to attend a medical the next day at 9am. I told her that isn't possible and had explained to management I wouldn't be available for a couple weeks. ""You will be referred back to management"" *click* 

What the actual fuck. Whatever, I've more important stuff on my plate right now. I get another call that evening, roughly 10 minutes after finishing time for the staff in my job, from my partner back in Ireland. ""Someone from your job wearing a managers jacket called to the house looking for you. I told them you weren't here so he handed me a letter"". I asked her to open it. It's another gross negligence form...

I get back to Ireland and respond to the letter and appeal the charge, stating I had informed management, which I did, that I wouldn't be available. I still have the texts on my phone to prove this. I go to the appeal a week later, state my case to the appointed manager and wait for response. Another week later I get the letter in the door. ""7 days notice of dismissal"". I'm fucking done. D O N E, done.

I've started drafting my resignation but I wanted to share my story above before handing in my notice as people may have some fantastic information I should add into it. I can share what I've drafted so far into a different post if there is enough interest.

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk. Life is certainly something, ain't it?"

I am head of security for a mall and I do everything I can to make the job suck less for my employees. I take extra shifts rather than forcing them to, try to make as much overtime voluntary when I can, and I get all my employees $25 gift cards for Christmas. I make every effort to express my genuine appreciation and model admitting to my mistakes when I make them and take accountability. I don't micromanage and let them rest during their shift because I know how horrible overworking is.

What else can I do for them knowing that the company doesn't really care for them no matter how many emails expressing thanks they send out or pizza or whatever? My boss does care, but likewise can only do so much. How can you care for employees in an inherently exploitative system knowing your care only does so much?"

9,2024-02-12,My manager changed my hours so it shows I didn’t work overtime.,u/MyBelovedASMR,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1apgci1/my_manager_changed_my_hours_so_it_shows_i_didnt/,antiwork," BC Canada. My manager changed my hours and I told a friend at work about it at and they said it was very common… so I will be reporting it to… who ever I have to report it to. I wasn’t going to report it until I was told it’s typical behaviour in this business. The higher-ups reasoning is because we have to ask in advance to do overtime. Which I usually do but sometimes I have so much work that I don’t look at the clock so I email my manager an apology and they are always okay with it. 

I noticed awhile ago my coworker leaves lunch early and comes back late… never has lunch for an hour but it’s definitely not half an hour, and they live five minutes away from the office. They also leave early. I’ve never reported them because it’s not my business but they have reported me the first time I took an hour lunch. The thing is I don’t take my two paid 15 min breaks like we are allowed to do (my coworker does though) but I still get in trouble when I take a long lunch.

This is some bullshit

I’m hoping I can give the government an anonymous tip. Can I do that? I don’t have any proof that it happened but there are countless people that this has happened to. When I come back from my vacation I’m going to start recording my hours down to the second."

Which is due in march 18th. Since my first month in the role she began questioning my work, skills and abilities. 1 month into the role, by the 2nd month she “extended “my probation for another month. She originally thought it’ll be only 3 months since I’m an internal hire. She has had it out for me since day 1. I created spreadsheets, to so lists to track my projects and tasks. I work 12 hours a day even weekends. Because I saw how badly my adhd was impacting my work at first I decided to get diagnosed and officially tested and I sought medication within 2 months into the role. She put me on a PIP, daily task list before 9am and end of day. She has me on LinkedIn trainings I’ve done it all…. I applied for school this fall to finish my bachelors I’ve given everything to this role since day 1. I love what I do and I’m so thankful to be given an opportunity in this field (finance) that I haven’t taken it for granted. I called out 1x sick. Granted this is a new field for me and I have a lot to learn hence why I devote so many hours to work and trainings. I schedule a meeting with my director since my coworkers and I feel as if he’s being blindsided by this decision. Just an fyi she’s slacking big time in her role my supervisor has been asking her for a budget for months he got so angry with her because she’s falling short on everything: I feel as if she’s using me as scapegoat. She’s behind on EVERYTHING I’m taking we’re at risk of going bankrupt and loosing our department card because she’s reconciling accounts late. I’m going to start applying today but I’m devastated because she made me believe if I did more I’ll be better, and I’ve done everything and it’s still not enough. She’s crushed my self esteem since day one, again I love my job and what I do. But idk what to do. Any advice or words of encouragement thanks !!!"

1,2024-02-12,Manager is micromanaging me to the point of people telling me to go to HR. I've no clue what to do and need advice.,u/Fierybuttz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aphfpn/manager_is_micromanaging_me_to_the_point_of/,antiwork,"I really enjoy my job. I will admit, as my first office job in a customer-facing role, I struggled to get to speed in the amount of time that my manager wanted. There is no point in me mentioning this, but now that I'm 2 years in and looking back, he kind of failed me in helping me get there. I see where I could have done differently, and I see questions that I could have asked that would have helped, but sometimes you are so lost you don't know what questions to ask. I am loads more confident in my role now, although there are always improvements to be made, I don't think this amount of micromanaging is productive in any sense. It feels like too much far too late, which I have expressed.

The issue started with me not meeting my all of my metrics. I see what went wrong, and I see that he truly did fail me to some degree, because there were certain things he wouldn't allow me to count then, but he will allow me to count now. He hasn't acknowledged it, but if he had let me count it from the beginning then this whole situation could have been avoided. I will admit he did help me stay off HR's radar (which happens when you don't meet your metrics) and in order to ""help me out"" and see the work I've been doing, he put me on a ""probation"" with him, which HR was not aware of. It has been miserable for me, and did cause my performance to suffer. This all happened leading up to the holidays as well, which are also a difficult time for me to get through. 

I didn't hold up to one of our agreements in the second week because I was on a work trip and it slipped through the cracks. I did not respond urgently enough for him, and he gave me a choice of punishment: have my wfh privileges revoked or be put on actual probation with HR. He gave me one hour to decide. Keep in mind, HR was not copied on this email. I had no idea if this was something he could do and I decided to not blindly make a decision so I involved his manager. Things were ironed out enough to where I wasn't on probation and could continue to wfh, but clearly this was a massive hit to my morale and our relationship. 

Now to conclude all of this, my fake probationary period ended last week. Of course, he had forgotten the end date and tried to get me in trouble, but I copied his own words and he apologized. HOWEVER, he's decided he still wants to monitor me, even though he acknowledges that it seems like I know what I'm doing. This goes till the end of the metric period, which brings in concerns. Is he allowing me to stay until the end of the period so I can get my bonus, but will switch me teams after that? So he will need to know what's going on with my accounts in order to smoothly transition. I have no clue. But it doesn't seem right to me, and my friends are saying I need to escalate to HR and stick it out till the end so I can get my bonus and eventually quit. Some people have mentioned that this can be considered harrasment, but I'm truly not sure. Has anyone had an experience like this? I am only 2 years into my career and have never had any interaction with HR, so I don't want to accidentally make things worse for myself."

A friend of mine works for a small (<10 employees) retail business. The business is open 10:00 to 6:00 Monday through Saturday and employees work a full shift any day they work. Since the Mardi Gras parades tend to start around 5:00 to 6:00 that means employees can't really go to parades on any day they work. In prior years they were always closed the Monday before Mardi Gras Day. That made it possible for the employees to go to the Sunday night parades without having to get up early the next day and catch the Monday night parades too. 

This year the single owner decided they were going to be open on Monday. None of the staff was happy about it but they were hoping the owner might close a little early so they could catch the Monday parades and/or prepare for Tuesday. Well, not only did they not close early, the owner left at 3:00 because he has to get up early Tuesday because he's riding in a parade. 🙄 They're also opening late on Ash Wednesday so he doesn't have to come in so early. And she didn't mention it but I would bet anything he's taken off a few days early in the last 2 weeks so he could go to parades. This business provides literally no PTO or even holiday pay by the way. 

This is one of those businesses that started out small and ""everyone was family"" but now they only get the "" family treatment"" when it benefits the owner. 

I told my friend to quit but I doubt she will. 

Me? I work for myself. And I literally give up a couple thousand dollars every year by deciding not to work Carnival season and go out and enjoy myself instead. If I had the kind of business with employees I would have a skeleton crew and reduced hours at the very least during Carnival season. 

If you're not willing to work a holiday it takes a lot of fucking nerve to demand your employees do."

I have worked tirelessly in a business that is 100% supply and service, we are authorized distributors of products that provide local contractors and municipalities with materials needed to maintain and develop utility systems. I was hired on in 2011.. after many years I worked my way up from sweeping the warehouse floors, making sure every trash can was empty and all the coffee cups were washed. In 2017 I transferred to a new location, my experience and knowledge enabled me to move up and become a primary contributor as far as ordering stock, quoting customers and maintaining a reasonable inventory. Fast forward 2023... My #1 boss (love to this day amazing person) passes and in his second in command he has my name. I've been steady for many years seen people come and go, established relationships with all our customers. His wish and what we had been planning on was myself stepping into a succession role. I just didn't anticipate it happening so soon, I've worked tirelessly everyday to ensure to our established customers we are still in operations and our business model will remain the same, I'm the new point of contact and the overall business has remained steady... Corporate has gotten involved as this is somewhat of a (franchise) they have their best interests on the forefront. I know our customers and their wives.. their kids as well as their favorite foods. I was asked if I was interested in assuming the role, reluctantly I agreed but was somewhat concerned about how much time I could give to the business and to my newlywed wife.. she supports me and the idea of venturing off into fully operating and running the business at my lead... Up until today, I get a call and news I need to complete a ""culture index survey"" to see if I'm the right fit... I literally transferred to this location away from my family and literally lived in a room at this warehouse throughout the week then back home on weekends all while driving a company truck and transferring materials from one location to the other. Needless to say I was and am offended, jus completed the survey I am honestly hoping they decide I am not ""culturally fit"" for a job at a location they know absolutely nothing about & I've lived since 2017!! Career is on the brink of being absolutely obliterated by one of those ""about me"" surveys."

I’ve been looking for a job for 13 fucking months. Then all these massive layoffs have just made the application pool that more saturated 

I just want to fucking work and provide basic needs for my family. I hate that my husband has to work full time and go to school full time just because his salary isn’t enough to cover our needs and we need the fucking GI stipend 

I just want to alleviate my husbands stress 

I hate that a company put me through five fucking interviews only to give the job to someone else. I hate that their HR turned me from a different job opportunity to one that I didn’t even get. I hate that I let myself believe my personal hell was over and that my family was gonna actually have breathing room again 

Going through all this just reignites my hatred for my previous employer and how they fired me for an illegal reason. I hate I can’t get justice because lawyers just want money and the EEOC is too chicken shit to challenge a corporation because that corporation knows how to play the grey area 

I’m so tired of family saying the right opportunity will come when I’m ready but my family is barely treading water 

I’m just fucking done. If it wasn’t for the fact it would cost my husband child care I’d be fucking ending it because I’m tired of getting screwed by life rn"

But at the same time if I was working a min wage job I wouldn't be proud either. The harsh reality is some people just aren't able to function in this society. People like me would be on the streets if it weren't for their parents. 

I haven't worked in 4 almost 5 years. Now people will say wow must be nice. But honestly it does sorta suck. Working sucks but not working also starts to suck. A part of me blames pyschiatry because they put me on meds that killed my drive, made me gain weight, and made me way lazier. Yes it's also my fault but I am quite depressed so it's not easy. 

I do want to change, I'm only 24. But I'm telling you my iq for basic shit is so low. I try to learn to code or do other stuff and I cant stick to it. I give up so easily. I have so many bad traits that stop me from being successful. The odds are stacked against me... it's likely I'll only ever work a min wage job so why even try?

Staff uniforms. 
I’m in a government department that works with the intellectually and physically disabled and have done so since the 1900’s (just to make it feel extra long) and back in the 90’s and pre my time there, uniforms for staff were common. 
The reasoning behind it was there was a significant chance in day to day duties your clothing would become significantly soiled, and it had been argued that as a work hazard it was justifiable for staff to have some of their clothing paid for, so a uniform was created. 
Basic. Just grey pants or blue culottes and a white top with a logo on the pocket. 
The system ran for 20+ years

Philosophies changed and the idea of uniformed staff being out in public with clients made the scene look ‘institutional’ and ‘noticeably artificial’ compared to just two people out in the community, one either a disability. So the uniforms were discontinued and nothing more was said about it. 

Now, 20 more years on or so, uniforms have, once again, been raised as something staff will have the option to wear. But here’s the kicker. 
Now you pay for it. 

And the philosophy has changed as to why you would or wouldn’t want staff in uniform. They want the branding to be seen. The department want to be noticed. They want to be raised in the communities recall, so staff, are walking billboards. 

Will I be buying the uniform? No. Will I continue to wear tshirt they want to complain about but don’t? Yes."
15,2024-02-12,Got fired for calling out the boss' lies,u/SneakySpoons,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1apkyug/got_fired_for_calling_out_the_boss_lies/,antiwork,"For TL:DR, see title.

About two weeks ago I got fired, as the title suggests. I've talked about it with a few friends and in some DMs, and thought about making this post a few different times. I've actually written the whole thing out a few different times before scrapping it instead of posting it. But I am finally at the point where I need to talk about it with people outside of my circle, and maybe get some advice in the process. This will be a long story, so apologies in advance.

So the story: I worked for a small electronics assembly company, owned by a much larger corporation, for the last 3 years. After about 8 months with them, I got promoted to the warehouse specialist (think warehouse manager, without the authority) role when the person who held that role resigned from it. For the next 3 weeks, while he was training me for the position, we naturally talked about why he was leaving and what he was going to do next. He confided with me that he was leaving because he was quitting because he couldn't take the stress and being overworked anymore (oh lordy, was he underselling what I got myself into).

Right around that time, the company also got a new VP for our NAM division. As part of his efforts to familiarize himself with the company, he did a tour of all of our separate branches to see how we did things. After visiting us, one of the issues that he brought up with our team as a whole, not just the management team, is that my role specifically was a weak link as it was a critical role and had no backup in case I was gone (vacation, sickness, whatever). It was something he wanted the production manager to work on as soon as he could. That was March 2023.

During last year, not only did we not hire a backup or assistant for me, we added two new product lines. These new product lines added roughly 30% more components that I was responsible for maintaining inventory levels on, inspecting for QA purposes (I was not quality control btw, but it somehow still was my responsibility), and stocking for production. 

I need you all to understand the implications of those last three paragraphs. My predecessor quit because of overwork, upper management came in and said we need to get more coverage and help for the warehouse, and our manager's response was to not only NOT get more workers but to actually give me MORE work instead. Not only that, but they also stopped approving overtime, so I couldn't even stay late to finish things if necessary (like say, trying to catch up after an absence or vaction). Despite several meetings with the production manager over the last year to address this, the only response I ever got was ""we are looking into options.""

To drive home exactly what I mean by ""I have no coverage,"" in 2023 I got Covid TWICE. Both times I missed roughly a week of work. Both times I left, when I came back, everything I had been working on before I left, was still exactly where I left it.. a week later. A position identified by upper management as a critical role, and they just let it rot for a week at a time, multiple times. This is me actually trying to look after their interests when I say, that isn't ok. You can't just let delivered material (and their attached invoices) just sit on a dock for a week at a time. That is not how a professional business operates.

Alright, here's (finally) the event in question that led to my ultimate termination. In November some of the leadership team of one of our sister companies, as well as the VP, came out to our site for a tour. Essentially the whole thing was a big dog & pony show about how we do things and share some of our ""expert organization skills."" During the tour, when the director brought them to my area with his ""Here is OP, he runs our warehouse, he does yada yada yada."" 

The Warehouse manager for their group asked directly ""What do you do when he is gone? Like when he takes a vacation or gets sick?""

To which the Director made the outright lie ""Oh, we have several team member who are crosstrained and can easily come over and fill in when necessary.""

That was the straw that broke my will, and I just couldn't let it slide. So I called him on it right there in front of everyone. ""Wait. Since when have I had coverage? I was out for a week last month, and I am still trying to catch up from it because no one did a thing here. Accounting is still asking me for an invoice for a delivery that supposedly we received then, that I never saw.""

The Director tried to laugh it off and wave any further questions off, quickly herding them all off to another area, but he definitely gave me the ""you will pay"" look before leaving. The VP however, stayed behind to talk to me alone for a while to get more details. After the tour, the VP and Director were in a closed door meeting for the rest of the day. I don't know what was said, but after that interaction the director never said another word to me for the rest of the time I was with the company. That said, nothing happened for the rest of the week, while the VP was on site. 

Of course, the second they were gone I was put onto a PIP for an ""unprofessional attitude towards management."" The PIP lasted for a month, into December. I completed it fine, which was agreed and signed off by the production manager as well as the HR rep. Then, a month to the day after that, I was terminated without notice for ""continuing attitude issues,"" despite literally never talking to management, or even most of my coworkers unless needed to. Every day I just show up, do my job, and go home. When I tried to ask for any clarification about what issues I was causing, they simply ignored me, told me to turn in my security badge and escorted me to clear out my desk.

&#x200B;

It has been a couple weeks now, so I finally have a better handle on my feelings with the situation. That said, its rough being back hunting jobs again, and knowing one of the first questions asked at literally every interview is ""why did you leave your last job?"" Why did I leave? I ruined my boss' reputation by not letting him make himself and the company look good by lying about a problem at my expense, and got fired for it.

Anyways, thanks for reading my long, rambling story. I don't really know what I'm going to do now, but I'll figure something out."

Zero understanding for what it's like just trying to survive while you're being worked to death and/or treated badly as employee. PMC are typical gatekeepers and they appear to love to jump in to either tell you are wrong or to explain how you should be treating management.

We were all floored, because the company knew long before hiring us all that it would be a short term position, but instead advertised for (and offered us) a long term position. They lied to us, wasted our time, put us in a bad spot financially. 

Luckily for me (and unluckily for the CEO), I have IBS and I had the WORST farts that day. Silent, deadly, awful farts. Imagine the farts of a dog who had been fed nothing but brussel sprouts for it's entire life. That's what my farts smelled like.

When we were filing out of the room, I could feel a fart brewing. I had to walk right past the CEO, who was still sitting down... so when my butt was 4 inches away from his face, I paused and let out a long, silent, whisper of a fart right in his face. It took everything in me to act nonchalant. I resisted the urge to turn around to see the look on his face. I just kept walking. 

Every time I think of that fart, it puts a smile on my face. I hope he could feel the warmth on his cheeks. I hope he knows that someone did that to him intentionally. It is my very proudest fart. 😂"

I really enjoy it, my managers are awesome as well as my coworkers. I always have regular customers that I enjoy talking to. It's also just a fairly easy laidback job in terms of labor. However, a few days ago I started looking for a new job because I found out I'm being paid pretty unfairly (see previous post here). I sent that message to HR on Sunday and I have today (Monday) and tomorrow off. I'm nervous about going back because I'm not sure if HR is gonna talk to me or whatever.

Today I interviewed at a locally-owned convenience/liquor store where I'd be making $14/hr to start and then be evaluated in 3 months to see if they wanna part ways or raise my wage to $14.50. The manager seems really nice, he definitely stands up for his employees, doesn't micromanage, and is very considerate. They would want me from Saturday and Sundays from 10-4 and Mondays from 12-6 and then another day in the week. At my current job, I mostly work 4-10 all weekend and then some days in the week. Getting overall between 18-30 hours, but mostly 21. At the new job, I'd be guaranteed at least 24-25. They also said I'm someone they're specifically looking for due to my experience in a liquor department.

My problem is that I really love the job I have now but it'd also be a good opportunity for me to start at the new place. I'm conflicted on either leaving my current job or working like 1 or 2 days a week there. I've never worked 2 jobs at the same time so it's confusing me on how I want to tackle this.

Round 3 interview the entire interview was more or less a critique of my experiences and abilities to match what they wanted. Overall “meh” in tone. The job description is now described as clearly senior, and grueling work, with absolutely no time to adjust.

I can read between the lines and I think they’re firing the senior position and hiring a replacement, but asking for very light requirements and giving junior pay."

Got emailed a “test.” I opened it and it said “10-15 minutes to complete.” Wtf.. anyway, I entertain it. Five minutes into it I realize *none* of the questions have anything to do with the job. So, I closed it. It kept emailing me reminders, and ai ignored them. The next day I get emailed “test #2,” and it says it takes 20 minutes to complete. I ignored it and deleted it. 

The next day the lady from the agency emails me reminding me to complete it. I ignore her email. So what does she do? 3 days later she emails me to book an interview.

Someone explain why they couldn’t have *called me* to book an interview from the beginning like professional, normal fucking human beings?"

As some background, I took this job because my old company was downsizing and it was an ""any port in a storm"" scenario. I believe in doing a good job so I did one and my reviews reflected that. Also worth noting, my father also works at this company that I'm at so nepotism was also a factor in getting the gig. This past week I had a new job fall in my lap with some old colleagues that is more in align with what I want to be doing. I put in my notice on Monday and shit got weird. The CEO called me into his office all ""I wish people would come to me when they are thinking of leaving,"" which is weird on its own. It's a multinational company, who is going to go to the CEO for stuff HR should handle? Then he said he was going to sleep on my resignation and come back tomorrow with an offer I can't refuse otherwise [makes gesture like firing a rifle]. Then the CEO and my boss sequestered my dad and demanded to know what he knows, which was nothing. I don't complain about the company to him for a reason. Then my boss made me sit in a stuffy conference room with the HVAC off so it got hot and stuffy fast for an hour while he begged me not to leave. He told me to sleep on it tonight and give my answer tomorrow. I've already signed the paperwork for the new job. I feel like I'm stuck. The employee handbook asks for a 1-week notice and I gave them 2 weeks. I've been up all night pounding Tums becuase of the anxiety. I promised to finish all my projects in the next two weeks cause I don't want to burn this bridge but now I'm thinking ""fuck it. I'll just use up my vacation time instead."""

When I first started two years ago, I was told I showed a lot of promise. The owners and managers alike told me they expected me to bump up in a quick time frame. As such, I began floating so I could learn different areas and chip in where needed. I was happy to learn and happy to play my part.     
      
About nine months in, I was promoted to an assistant manager position. I would help the managers of all areas when the demands called for it. It depended on the day or the week as a whole.      
        
One particular week, a manager was out and I was put in their area.      
All in all, it went well. On the last day of that week, I was given a task that requires special attention as it’s easy for the product to break en route.        
        
Unfortunately I was not able to completely finish the task and so I saved the last part of the order for the manager to do upon return the following week.         
        
I am a very detailed person and started out in the department where orders were sent out and so, I knew exactly what needed to be done. The manager I filled in for isn’t as careful but typically okay.        
        
Manager finishes and sends out. Time passes. About a week later, the general manager comes to me and tells me the last part of the order went out and was delivered broken up inside.      
I am the type of person to admit my faults. It’s very important for me to do so because I never believed lies would save you.     
I told general manager that wasn’t me and I had proof it was the manager of that department.    
He told me he didn’t care.       
        
Ever since then, my tasks have been drastically decreased and I’ve been ordered to train my replacement. The person filling this role has no bad blood with me. I actually like him and think he is great.     
       
I wasn’t given an explanation and I know my work didn’t falter in those weeks.     
The work song bird finally told me what’s going on and apparently, everyone is aware.    
I spent weeks mad and feeling betrayed.     
       
I’m aware I can find a new job and I will when time and finances permit. Unfortunately I cannot afford to as of now. Maybe in a few weeks time.        
           
Made me realize that hard work can be disregarded and honesty can quickly lose you favor, even if you were just standing up for yourself.

1,2024-02-13,Rant - statutory pay is shocking (UK),u/thatkid1992,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1apsmnx/rant_statutory_pay_is_shocking_uk/,antiwork,"I'm in the UK. I'm on maternity leave for my 1st child.

Before I went on mat leave I spoke with my line manager about Statutory Maternity Pay but it wasn't as in depth as I would have liked.

My line manager swapped my schedule as per my request so I rarely got to see them. I expressed several times I was worried about taking the time off because of my career but mostly pay. At no point there was a clear breakdown saying ""this are the amounts you'll get paid"". But my company offers full pay for 6m and then the rest is SMP. 

I also got a new line manager (also new to the business) a couple of weeks before I started my mat leave.

What I didn't realise/know and wasn't explained clearly, when I expressed confusio and wanted help, was that after 39 weeks (give or take 9months) if I take the full year, which I can by law, it's 3m of 0 pay.

Come a recent pay I'm very short of my expectation of pay and I question payroll. Who then send a pay breakdown and say that they weren't allowed to do so unto recently and my HR team should now be able to share this also. In all fairness they did speak to me about it. I also failed to notice that an upcoming pay will be even shorter.

I question it now and I'm finally explained that the government allows for a year of maternity but only 9 months of SMP, and my company is ""very generous"" for complementing SMP for the first 26 weeks/6 months so I have the equivalent of my normal pay, but then only 3 months of SMP. 

Given how I'm using my annual leave to have an extra month off (little one will start nursery and since he'll probably be home more than at nursery for a few weeks), I'm still now unexpectedly short on pay because my HR doesn't give a shit and didn't bother covering any of this with me.

Doesn't help that I know someone from a different department who had a completely different experience to mine over this, where management took the effort to clarify everything and even payroll give them different information

I'm also angry at the government for allowing mothers who can't afford childcare to also have to chose coming back to work 3 months sooner solely because they can't be bothered with paying 3 extra months of SMP. 700 something quid for 3 months is peanuts when you look at childcare costs, and given how the new scheme only starts after September for 1 year olds, it falls very short of supporting families.

Yes there are way worse situations, and I'm glad I have enough savings to cover shortcoming, but doesn't make any less stressful and less upsetting that Humans Resources absolutely ignore the Human part of it (including a recent request for a 3rd party to be present on a difficult discussions)."

I work in a fast-paced environment, a.k.a. top-tier bullshit corporation. My new boss has requested me to provide him with my ""personal development items,"" although I haven't had to submit any for years.

For those unfamiliar with a BS workplace, development items in our company—despite what the term suggests and its intended function—are certainly not doing any good to anyone. Essentially, these are flaws you're expected to highlight about yourself, a way to admit ""I suck at this... and this..."" So, later in the year, when it comes time for salary raises, bonuses, or promotions, your management can argue there's room for improvement here and there. And since you're the one who set up those ""improvement"" points yourself, the debate is over before it even starts.

It's the BS circle as we know it.

Please help me figure out some development items I can provide. No, there's nothing I want or need to improve. I am a translator and copywriter, native in my own language, and have been working for the same company for 5 years. I've always delivered my job with the highest degree of quality, met my deadlines, because I'm paid to do so. I have good relationships with my teammates, and there are certainly no extra skills (SEO, UI/UX, etc.) I want to learn, since then I'd have to implement them in my job, and they will certainly not raise my salary for it.

I have already queried the holy BS oracle : chatGPT, but please share anything you can think of, serious or funny ones.

Thanks in advance for your input,

Best regards."

And I can say confidently that if this job was remotely interesting and didn’t stand on the shoulders of slave labor shoe factories I would feel less disgusted and angry but alas.


I’m so restless and full of hate toward my job and manager and director and how they incessantly fuck me over and over and over and over. I am constantly on the verge of rage quitting and tears because of how much these people suck and have essentially TRAPPED me in an entry level role while giving me advanced work  and taken advantage of me and denied me any sort of official advancement bc they don’t want me to leave their stupid dumbass team. And past management that got laid off denied me a promotion bc “they don’t want to spend money”. And so I’ve been doing all this work and I’ve in total gotten an increase of ~1600 dollars in annual pay since 2021. 

The past SVP (who I have worked with directly) had a bonus of 6 million dollars waiting for him (my DIRECTOR TOLD ME THIS??? idk why!!) but he left to work for Disney before bonuses were sent out. That is 0.1% of what I make in a year.

They let an assistant on our team who didn’t do anything (she was nice though) leave a few months ago to a different team and she’s already been promoted to associate manager(???????).

I just finished grad school and essentially just stayed in this job so I didn’t have to learn a new job while finishing school, so I’m hoping I can escape sooner rather than later but everything feels BLEAK rn. 

I can’t believe that I’ve allowed this to happen. I’ve expressed many times that I want to do something else. They just gave me additional work to spend half my time with another team with no compensation and said it would be temporary until a position opens up on the other team. No position is opening up on the other team. I’ve been in this situation for OVER A YEAR now.

I have almost rage quit about 12 times since January 2nd.

Every day I work I am sad and miserable and full of hate and I try to sit here and do as little as possible but enough to keep my job. I just don’t want my life to feel like this and it really scares me that I live like this and that other people live this way too. I do have hobbies though which bring me much joy thankfully.

May end up moving to Europe eventually but not sure how it will change my life.

I feel selfish for feeling this way when people have it so much worse and don’t have health insurance etc

How am I supposed to get the energy to prostrate myself infront of another slew of employers just to get run around and ignored for months, all over again? There aren't enough jobs for people. Let us fucking live, please, fucking god damn. 

How long can this go on? I know the answer is unfortunately ""a long fucking time"" and nothing about our society will change. Millions can go homeless, hungry, or dead and nobody will do anything about it. It's so unfair. I hate this system so much."

And so there I was, working at a popular fast food joint on Super Bowl Sunday, struggling to make sure everything was prepped, cooked and out the door on time.

I was successful too, but little did I know that the store's owners were tracking our ""performance"" remotely and freaking out because numbers weren't moving around on the screen fast enough. Shit rolls downhill -- they chewed out the regional manager, who chewed out the general manager, who chewed out the experienced shift lead, who chewed me out, even though I got everything done as quickly as could be expected with my two weeks of experience, broken equipment, and a store full of new hires.

Here we are, creating all this surplus value for the owners, and all they could think to do was start yelling at their workers instead of wondering why things were going wrong and asking themselves ""what could we be doing to support the people who are busting their asses so we can have all these nice things?""

All of this for shitty wages and shitty benefits. The second I get a better offer, I'm out of there."

Think miles and miles of single family homes.

There are a few major corporations with office buildings sprinkled throughout.

Work options are essentially - commute to the major city, get a job at one of the corporations, or hourly wage jobs at the local super markets, fast food joints, etc. 

Commuting to work in the major city is an option many living in my area take. You get a higher salary without the city real estate prices (make no mistake we are still quite high being in the suburban outskirts). It’s a major pain though. The traffic on the freeway through the sprawl is HORRENDOUS and can easily take over an hour and a half. The other option is the train which is jam packed and constantly running late. 

I took a job at one of the major local corporations. I don’t have to commute and get paid decently  which is nice buttttt….

Middle management gets into position and does not budge from these local companies. Why? 

Because location location location (no commute plus they are locked into their 30 year mortgages) and they all have school aged children so they aren’t planning on going anywhere anytime soon. Once the kids graduate many of them will leave this rat race and go somewhere more rural with LCOL but it takes YEARS. 

I’ve seen so many younger talented people get hired, work really hard, then LEAVE due to the lack of movement vertically. 

I agree some of the younger crowd is impatient. They job hop their way into better salaries. Sure this is part of it.

But I’ve had conversations with some of them and mostly it’s the fact that they’ll have to out wait the boomers and elder Gen X who have the higher positions and aren’t letting go until their kids are out of school. 

Granted I get that once you are in a good position you stay there. But when I first started and entered the workforce in the late 2000’s there was MUCH more movement at the management level (ppl coming and going). 

Am I totally making that up or does anyone else remember the same?"

I love that I can work from home some days with a movie playing. The breaks I would take in the office were now opportunities to mop, vacuum, and do laundry.

Then my job installed Microsoft teams. 

We are required to sign in during our working hours. They have a setting where you go from green (available) to idle after 5 mins of inactivity. 

Even if you manually set your status to stay green it won’t save and will go yellow. If you schedule yourself into a meeting you’ll also still go yellow (it will override the red). If you log in on your phone and the phone screen goes dark, you will go yellow. IT has blocked the status settings to where if you aren’t actively moving the mouse you will go yellow. 

It is a huge pain in the ass and yes ppl have gotten fired for pulling things trying to manipulate the system into staying green (like logging into an all day meeting with yourself to stay red).

The other day we had an outage and our messaging system went down, we had to rely on email.

I got laid off from my job a few months ago, so I'm back to aggressively job hunting. Although I am getting a lot of interest, the interview process in general is exhausting. Most companies want 3-4 hour long interviews with different people (not including the phone screen), and between each step is ""hurry up and wait"". 

Most companies move at a snail's pace when it comes to hiring. After my initial phone screen with one company, it took three weeks to finally hear back from a recruiter that I was not selected to move further in the interview process.

I know rejection isn't personal, but constantly having to sell yourself and then fall short to another candidate can eat at your self esteem. It feels soul-sucking. Imposter syndrome is hitting me super hard.

To anyone out there looking for a job, I hope you find something soon. Persistence is key. I'm trying to stay positive and tell myself that it only takes one company to say yes."

I recently received messages while I was away using the restroom for about 8 minutes earlier in the morning. When we leave the desk we basically have to ping out group in Teams because they seem to love micromanagement. My manager and an employee above me asked me why I was away from the desk even though I gave a heads up why I would be stepping away. I explained it was for a bathroom break and she got defensive. Well, today there was a post to our team stating they are allowing 3-7 minutes per day for desk away time. I don't know how everyone else manages this but I usually require about 10 minutes per day for bathroom breaks outside of lunch and my two 15 minute breaks. They said we need to reach out to HR for medical reasons if we need more time than the allowed 3-7 minutes. Is this ridiculous or what?

I think they just really needed someone to fill this role. I was slightly underqualified when I got hired. I was a skilled IT professional just hadn't used any of their specific tools. in hindsight, they can't hire someone that knows my job for what they currently pay me. So the only reason I think they were willing to negotiate my salary outside of their posted range is because they couldn't find anyone and probably still can't find anyone at my dollar amount to do what I'm doing. which is going to be great for my next career jump but they're going to have a rude awakening.

While we are slowly turning against it based on the evidence, we did largely go to college/technical school with the expectation of getting a decent job, funded our retirements (when we could afford to), and figured we would buy a house/car and have a family some day.

I feel like Gen Z witnessed the system turn on us and learned from our misfortunes. Already, managers are complaining that Gen Z is ""hard to manage"", ""entitled"" etc. They don't seem to have any plans to ""work hard"", ""build a career"", save money, etc., as they know it's an uphill battle. I envy them, honestly. I've gone through a lot of personal pain realizing the old system that I thought I had been working under was gone, after I had already given it a lot of my time and energy.

What do you think will shift in the workforce once the Boomers and Gen X exit and the Millennials start aging out, leaving Gen Z and Alpha? Will companies change and adapt to new working norms? What do you think those norms will be?"

261,2024-02-13,Approved PTO revoked last minute,u/Mysterious_Bread_569,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aq34mb/approved_pto_revoked_last_minute/,antiwork,"tldr; PTO that had been approved for months by multiple bosses got pulled at the last minute, after already putting thousands into the trip.

I work remotely as a software engineer at a company with “unlimited PTO”. Around last October I started to plan a trip of a lifetime. It consists of a 3 week vacation up front, followed by 5 weeks of working remotely from this other country. Before booking anything, I ran this by my boss multiple times, who not only approved it but was excited for me to go. 

I planned the time of the trip around a major project that had an “immovable” (but near impossible) deadline of mid January. Since late September our team has been working extra hours to try to achieve this deadline. I’ve only taken off 2 days for Christmas and 1 day for Thanksgiving in that time, and have worked the majority of the weekends. 

A week before the planned release of this project there was a round of layoffs, including my boss who had approved the PTO. Along with that, the “immovable” deadline was moved to near my trip date. That same week I had a 1-on-1 with my new boss and I told them my plan for the trip, they agreed with it all and said that it won’t be a problem. After that is when I started to actually book everything for the trip (I only had the flight and 1 airbnb booked before), and now I've invested $6k into this trip.

Yesterday I got a random call from my new boss saying that I can no longer do any of the trip. On top of that they say that we’ll be lucky to be able to get a single week of PTO through the end of the summer. This company (particularly the CEO) seems to base performance solely on the amount of hours that somebody works, not the quality or speed of their work. 

I realize that 3 weeks is a long vacation, but I have had hardly any time off since I started this job a year ago, and it had been approved by multiple bosses for months. I’ve already decided that I’m going to search for something else, as this is just one in a series of rug-pulls and problems that have happened in my time here. A good amount of that 6k is still refundable, but I’ll still be out thousands if everything is canceled. Unsure what to do next, the only thing keeping me from leaving the job right now is how rough the market is. I don’t know if I’ll ever have the opportunity to do this trip ever again in the future."
2,2024-02-13,I feel like I’m going crazy,u/RoutineGas3646,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aq3a7t/i_feel_like_im_going_crazy/,antiwork,"So first of all this isn’t about a specific job but just the constant feeling like I need to be working. It’s driving me nuts. All day I daydream about helping my mom with money problems but I’m too broke and not smart enough to truly figure out how to make those ends meet. 

It may sound funny but I feel like music is the only way out in this case and when I don’t work on it when I’m home, I feel I’m failing myself and my family. I work of course so I’m not just stagnant but my job is baking bagels for a shitty bakery with terrible management and shit pay because I got into a car accident and broke my leg awhile ago. Out of work for a year and was making good money as a bartender before my accident. 

Couldn’t go back because I had no transportation there and paying for rides there and back would eventually take a bunch of my check so luckily my friend got me a job nearby. One I could walk to and get enough money to get back on my feet. It’s like I’m slowly scraping away trying to save up enough to get a new car and get myself back on my feet with another job.

 My family wants me to get a good job and keeps recommending me my dads job in construction. He makes good money but I’ve watched him sacrifice so much of his time idk how he doesn’t go crazy. I’m considering it but feel like I’m taking a handout or getting stuck in a place where I’ve given up on my life and taking the carrot on the stick. Just walking, hoping that I finally get to a point of satisfaction. 

I want to be able to enjoy my time off work by not thinking about it all but I can’t! I hate this cycle and wish I could get out of it. Maybe I’m not trying hard enough or looking for something better but what can I do?? The motivation is slowly getting sucked out of me and I’m finding it harder and harder to enjoy days as a whole. If I’m not working I’m sad and if I’m working I’m ready to get off because it sucks ass. Fuck the world and fuck this system. 
Fuck the people who use it to suck our life dry."

9,2024-02-13,"Am I burned out, depressed, or just lazy? How can you tell which it is?",u/NeedThatCoff33,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aq3l4e/am_i_burned_out_depressed_or_just_lazy_how_can/,antiwork,"I slept 12 hours on Saturday, not including the overnight hours. I mean, combined, I'm pretty sure I slept the entire day.

Stared at my screen for an hour before finally working today. Completely zoned out during two meetings today. 

My best days in the office are when my manager isn't there but I'm the only one that has an issue with him. Although, in private, he does say some pretty toxic stuff like how I'm not adding value and how ought to be grateful for his help. Maybe he's like that only to me, who knows. Everyone else here worships him like Jesus has returned.

At my most toxic job, I was still pretty physically sick (stomach spasm) but my lovely clients made up for it. I hated most of my day, but some days were better than others. Finally left when my stomachache evolved into excruciating ""Oh shit, I need 911"" pains one random night. Job hunted casually for 3 months, gone by the last day of the year. That job was 2 years long, nearly 3, before physical symptoms took on. Here? It's been only 6 closes.

I can't be fucked to work anymore. I don't know. Maybe I'm lazy. Maybe I want to game all day. But damn. Don't even enjoy games anymore. Ive been aching to finish that epilogue for Pokemon Violet and yet, my Switch hasnt had juice for weeks. I do enjoy accounting. I was actively engaged in the learning during the first few months, asked all sorts of questions, was scolded for every question, and now I can't be fucked to ask anything unless it's dire. Can't get out of bed. Don't care about food. Lost 15 pounds. Could go all day without eating if it weren't for shakes. 

But I don't want to go into another job if it's ""just me"" you know? Maybe I'm lazy. Maybe I'm tired. Maybe I'm depressed and hope a bus runs me over so I can take a week off without nagging about how I let the team down for a single pto day like before. If it's ME. If I'M the problem, this will only keep happening no matter where I go. It's true, I really rather just fool around and die young. Doesn't everyone not want to work? But I recall a few years back during my unemployment phase, I was ready to die so long as someone offered me a gig. Where did that me go? Trampled by corporate culture?

I mean, if I'm lazy, I too wouldn't want to work. But I don't know. Is it depression? Career burnout? Or just company burnout? Or am I really actually just lazy?"

I have been thinking about next steps in terms of career progression, traditionally speaking  it would be a senior or lead role. Im starting to think taking this step isn't for me. I came to the realisation the biggest thing driving me to seek out a promotion is my ego, with more money secondary. That's it. I see younger people come into my business and get promoted and I compare myself to them. It somehow makes me feel like I should be doing more or im not in the right place.

I analyze DNA to detect cancer. Since I started ~4 months ago I have only been trained on 1 thing. Which is fine with me because we all know the more you learn the more work you’re given. Also, they rarely cross train people so I’m not really worried much.

I am extremely efficient and do my work with a lot of precision. I can multitask, time manage, and finish a lot of shit in a short amount of time with no guidance. I have been given a raise and ‘reward’ already. Although these merits have been given to me, most people of the same job level seem to still find me incompetent of doing my job… although I do it every day… all day… for the last 4 months straight. I understand in the beginning not quite being able to complete everything on my own but I was fully trained and working on my own in 3 weeks.

I am fully capable of completing my tasks with even time left over. It has been a reoccurring theme that my coworkers will straight up take over my duties and complete the only thing that I am trained on. Yes, they have other responsibilities but they purposely take mine over their own and then complain about having SO much to do. There are days (few) when they don’t do this and I am able to still get everything done and have time to sit around.

At first, I talked to my supervisor about this in my review telling her that I feel like I’m being treated like a child and it needs to stop, I can do my own shit. She said it will be corrected. Lol nothing has changed so I’ve been taking full advantage and sitting around on my phone for hours. If I’m asked to do some bullshit task while I’m just sitting there (which doesn’t happen often) I straight up say no and that if people didn’t do my job I wouldn’t be sitting around as much.

Example: had my work done and was sitting at my desk. A couple coworkers were setting up a Christmas tree for Christmas and my boss said since I didn’t have anything to do I should help them. I said verbatim, “I’m not festive and I’m not doing that, thanks for the offer though.” She looked absolutely flabbergasted by my response and just said “okay” and walked away.

Another example (from literally today): I went down to the lab after lunch to finish my stuff and my coworker said, “Me and everyone else already did that (my task).” Then began to huff and puff about having to complete her own tasks. I walked my happy ass upstairs to my desk and sat on my phone. She then comes up to my desk and says, “You can go fill tip boxes. Since you have nothing to do.” I replied verbatim, “No, I’ve already done that twice today and everyone else used them when I needed them. You also did my job for me so someone else can fill tips, I’m not going back down for a task that takes 5 minutes. Thanks for the offer though.” I am currently sitting at my desk plesantly typing this post as my coworker is fuming over our interaction. 

TLDR: Coworkers keep doing my work so I get paid to play on my phone and tell them to fuck off."

I got an email today stating that management wants to part ways because of my reliability and attitude during training. How is my reliability even a factor with something outside of my control? Then, the attitude during training part caught me off guard because I was actually happy working there, I’m just have a serious demeanor when learning something new. But I was finally getting the hang of things. Prior to this, I addressed to the GM that he put the wrong availability for me on the new schedule. When I got the termination email I literally cried. The job market is so hard right now, I just want to pay off my credit cards so I can go to Air Force boot camp & go back to college to stop working dead end jobs. I’m over it."

I grin and bear it but I just know this person has it out for me. Do you have any tips on how to get someone fired? Should I make an anonymous complaint? The good news is this person had a restraining order filled recently when they broke up with their boyfriend, so there is track record of toxic hostile behavior. thanks for any tips "

I started in August, but now have 13 people under me in seniority. I work 10:30 to 7 and I hate hate hate my shift. I know it’s my fault because I signed up for it, but I didn’t know how bad it would be. This is why I hate it so much.

No other Union position in the company has this shift. I know it’s for business purposes that we have to have it in my department. However, most of the other departments work 4 tens and then don’t work Fridays. Or, can choose their own hours.
By 5pm everyone in the building is cleared out, except for us. I WFH, but the days I come in hybrid or sucks because no one else is here past 5.
It sucks for my family. I never see my husband because he has to be at work 5am-2pm so by the time I get home at 7:30 he is already tired. Also there are a lot of things I can't do because of my shift, like there is an event going on in my town, but I can't go because it only goes to 7:30 and I wouldn't be able to get there in time.
No one is willing to switch shifts if you have something going on. I had one important thing to me, but no one was willing to switch shifts. However, you are expected to take more senior people’s shifts.
I thought I could take this shift but I can't. I don't want to quit my job because I thought I could do it. However, I am now the most senior person on the 10:30 to 7 shift and I’m worried I will be stuck here for a very long time. I know at a minimum I will be stuck for 5 more months. I will be the longest person stuck on this shift because they did the cut off to move up right at me. I just don't know what to do because I love my job, I really enjoy what I do. I just hate the time I work."

It started super good, high base salary, completed the degree in a great university, got promoted to mid-career position. Did extra certifications.

Mass lay off in my company. I wasn't included in the lay off due to ""top performer"" status. But was assigned a crazy amount of unpaid extra work (the work that the laid off workers did). Working hours increased from 40 to 55. Work from home revoqued. I was burned and resigned in good terms with the company.

After few months of rest, I started sending resumes. Got a good job at another mega corp. Was a top performer there too. Was laid off after few months despite being absolutely excellent.

Sent other resumes, but this time couldn't find any good job. I accepted a bad job just to not stay unemployed too long. It's basically the same software engineering job that I did before, but with less salary despite having more experience. I can't handle this anymore, too long hours for too low pay and can't find anything better in my field, don't want to be in tech anymore. It's crazy that new jobs offers less money/hour than what was common some years ago (when everything was cheaper).
I live in a rich area, with lot of companies.

7,2024-02-13,Did my employer violate the WARN act? (California),u/ACatNamedFreddie,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aq71e7/did_my_employer_violate_the_warn_act_california/,antiwork,"My (ex)company laid off 60 people on Friday with no warning. I started work at 9am to an emergency all hands meeting, then two hours later I was laid off and all of my access was revoked. The company had about 220 employees prior.

Now I know this technically violates the WARN Act. But there is an exception to the WARN act. Section 1402.5 states the following:

*a)An employer is not required to comply with the notice requirement contained in subdivision (a) of Section 1401 if the department determines that all of the following conditions exist:

(1) As of the time that notice would have been required, the employer was actively seeking capital or business.

(2) The capital or business sought, if obtained, would have enabled the employer to avoid or postpone the relocation or termination.

(3) The employer reasonably and in good faith believed that giving the notice required by subdivision (a) of Section 1401 would have precluded the employer from obtaining the needed capital or business.*

So I am trying to figure out if I have a case. 

The previous Friday, February 2nd, we had our monthly company-wide meeting hosted by the CEO. In that meeting the CEO said we are in great shape, and are in talks to be bought out by another company, and it was very positive. A week later, they laid 25% of the company off after the deal fell through.

According to section 1402.5 the company had to know back on December 11th, 60 days prior, that they needed to layoff workers if the deal fell through. But at this time the company had recently gotten funding and they said it was enough to get through the first quarter of the year. They hired multiple new people in the end of last year. They gave me a raise and a bonus the last week of December.

I have no idea if this deal was even in talks yet 2 months ago. But based on the way the company was functioning, they did not know that they were going to need to layoff 60 people back then. 

Any advice is appreciated. Would it be worth it to pursue this? Will I go broke if I try this? They only offered me one weeks severance so I am not too concerned if I become ineligible for that."

My desk is on the same floor as one of the directors (50ishM). I’m not a fan of work in general but this job has been pretty decent so far (as decent as it can be). 

A few months into the job I started noticing really weird things going on. When the director walked down the aisle past our desks, at least three people would scramble to the radio to turn it down before he passed every single time. I noticed that towards the back of the floor, where he sat; there were no women. Most of us were seated towards the front quite far away from him. The women of the office would look down when they passed him in the hall, and leave when he entered the break room. 

Last month, he approached me in the break room. It started out with small talk, nothing above casual but then he moved onto talking about the office Christmas party. He told me “you looked gorgeous that night. If we had been at a club or a bar, you would not have gone home alone sweetheart” I was honestly so shocked I asked him to repeat himself because what the fuck??? He grabbed my hand and said “I’m just being friendly darling (Ew) are you free tonight?”

I said to him “no thank you, I find keeping work and personal life separated to be best practice.” The face he then made at me almost knocked me off my feet. He frowned and smiled real wide, kinda scared me a little. The encounter ended right then as he walked away. 

A few days later I arrive at the office to see a sticky note left on my monitor. “Meeting room 4 2:30 pm performance review” I was a bit confused because HR usually schedules our performance reviews in our calendars. We had been having a few IT issues recently so I thought it had to be something to do with that. Some issue with shared calendars. But I was wrong. 

At 2:30 I enter the meeting room to find (you guessed it!) him. He motioned for me to sit down and he pulled out a bunch of papers. He went on some long rant about how he works really hard and considers us all ‘family’. And he gets upset when family doesn’t treat each other right. He flicked through his papers for a few seconds and said “your performance is up to par but I’m afraid I must bring up the issue of friendliness. There are a few people in the office who have expressed to me that you can be quite rude and uninviting and id just like to remind you that we are all equal, and we all must put in the work.” This really really shocked me as I am friends with pretty much everyone on my floor. I am a usually kind person but I do have boundaries and I have no issue with drawing a line in the sand, which I’ve had to do a couple of times and as you know, I’ve done that with him recently. I asked him who those people were and what exactly was said and in what context. He wasn’t able to give me a straight answer. We had an unproductive back and forth until I assume he got frustrated and said he had another meeting to get to. 

I’ve started talking to other women on my floor about him and realised that they ALL have had similar experiences with him. One of them said she kept seeing him at her local grocery store even though he lived nowhere near there. Another one said that he has left a red rose on her desk every Valentine’s Day for the past 6 years. I asked them if they had gone to HR and the answer was yes, but nothing happens. The worst he gets is an email telling him to back off. Because what he does is subtle, HR doesn’t take it seriously. If he actually touched one of us it would be different but I suspect he is very aware of that fact. He’s calculated. 

So, this all came to a head yesterday when we were all called in for a quarterly meeting. There was about 50 of us in the same room watching his presentation. Halfway through he started talking about forming connections and bonds with your coworkers is important to ensure the flow of daily life in the office. He then pointed at me and said “isn’t that right, (my name)” I then said “correct. *PLATONIC* connection is important to everybody. However we also must respect each-others boundaries in keeping work and home life separate.” The room went DEAD silent other than the odd ‘oh my god’ or ‘oh shit’ muttered under their breath. I went totally red in my face and could feel myself start to sweat profusely for about 10 seconds before he resumed his presentation. 

I called the rest of the day off and I don’t know if I can bring myself to go back. I don’t know why I feel so much shame and embarrassment. I might just hand in my notice. 

Anyways. All of this is to say, it’s difficult to navigate a world in which everyone pretends. I pride myself on being open and honest, I will never tell someone a lie or lead them astray. I was ashamed of myself when I realized life was a costume party and I attended with my real face."
4,2024-02-13,Mutiny!,u/POSTHVMAN,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aq7msf/mutiny/,antiwork,"Found out there are multiple contractors in the area paying around 30% more for my position than what I'm making. I started asking around and have now spoken to a handful of coworkers that are in the same boat. There are currently 8 applications in with one competitive contractor and another 4 known interested individuals. That makes up about 15% of total employees, all of which are mid to upper management level. I may have started something of a mutiny. 

For a bit of background... I work in the construction industry for a largish contractor that is locally owned and has been for decades. They were once a union shop and during a strike in the 80s they opened a non-union side and let the union shop die out. They are now avidly union busting in what is a very union-weak state. Before starting with this contractor, I worked in our union, and would like to rejoin the union for my trade, but it would guarantee the need to travel for work. So it is currently not an option with what is going on in my family.

The contractor I currently work for has no internal meetings for management whatsoever. They keep all new business very hush-hush, ""need-to-know""... everything is a big secret. The contractor I'm going in for an interview with is on the other end of the spectrum. Coordination meetings, management involvement, structured tiers of management, structure to job bonuses/profit sharing... the works. But it's a bigger company from out of state and is one of our biggest competitors.

I don't know if this is the right sub, but I wanted to let it out somewhere. I very well could be a part of a major sea change for the contractor I've happily worked for these last 5 years. Feeling a little guilty, but also ready to get what I'm worth."

Apparently global employers want the tap into the US talent market because we've produced some of the most influential companies in the world. 

The return-to-office demand have pushed the working class to look for opportunities overseas. A Deel CEO said, ""A couple of our competitors did that, and we hired their best people. So I welcome them to keep doing it.”

While this is nice news, I want us to keep in mind that RTO orders, mass lay offs, raising the retirement age, corporate inflation and stagnate wages are *intentionally* abusive and exploitative to the working class. Don't forget the many public talks and articles that came out last year discussing the ""power shifting"" to us and that we need to submit to our employers.

 Don't forget multimillionaire Tim Gurner said ""We need to see pain in the economy"" and that employees should feel extremely lucky to work for their employer, not the other way around. Don't forget that even though international companies are leeching on us to work remotely, that capitalism is still a *global* crime and exploits everyone in varying degrees, some harsh, some more tolerable if you have enough privilege."

For a birthday gift I got my husband tickets to one of his favorite bands, who has only just started to tour in the U.S. (literally this is their second time in the U.S. ever) and so requested the full week of September 2nd-6th off work. It's February, that's PLENTY of time to plan a schedule around me being gone. My new boss (who I will be referring to as T-1000 - I've already had issues with her to the point I went to HR about her behavior) immediately denied it, and then came into my office to tell me. Her reasoning? ""Well (coworker) already has that week off. Can you you possibly go a different week?"" Suuuure lady, let me just call the band and see if they could possibly come a different day instead.

For context, I work in a bank. This coworker and I do not do anything even close to the same job - to the point we cannot even cover for each other. She is the ONLY one off that week, so there was zero reason to deny my PTO. I don't know what T-1000 was expecting, but it was definitely not me challenging her on it. I explained that coworker and I do not even do the same job, so I did not understand why my ability to take my vacation was contingent on her being in the office. T-1000 explained some bullshit about how if there are any call outs it puts us in a tight bind and we have people who have flex days because they work on Saturday that we had to consider. I tell her that I would think it would be easier to plan the schedule with the understanding that two people are out, rather than only one and then another (possibly multiple) other people call in and she comes back with some bullshit about how she's just following guidelines that state that only one person in a branch should be off at a time... guidelines that do not exist. I even checked with other friends who work for the same bank I do, in the same or similar roles. NO other branch does this. 

The kicker? She tried to tell me to talk to my coworker and see if she could move her vacation... which everyone knows hers is also for HER birthday, and is a trip out of the country.  Not only that, but there's a good chance this coworker will actually still be on maternity leave, since she's expected to deliver in mid-May and we get 4 months of parental leave. So I guess since planning around two people being out nearly 8 months from now is soooo hard (it isn't, I've done it, I was literally a supervisor elsewhere before moving to this job) for T-1000 I suppose I'll be saving my sick time instead of my vacation time, because there's no way in hell I'm skipping out on my husband's birthday gift, which I've already purchased. Especially since she already denied my time off for my wedding anniversary because SHE has that time scheduled off. "

The money was bad. Bad bad. I mean, getting paychecks bad. I held out. Fat Tuesday is coming. 

We get our tips onto pay cards daily. For some reason I didn't get my tips from Saturday until 8am central on Monday morning. What happens Monday at 8am? Pending transactions post. It was supposedly an error. Might have been. Suspicious regardless. Error or not, not getting my money when I am told I'll have it is a violation of trust and about as big of a red flag as possible. Would they disclose to me if they were insolvent? Fuck no. I got some bullshit, confusing run around nonsense. 

Today was finally the big day though. Fat Tuesday. I ended up being a bar back on the busiest day of the year. $12/hr and 1% tip out. We have brand new servers (like first serving job ever) who were doubles on the floor that would walk with 4-5x what I do because of it. On top of that most if not all of that would have gone towards taxes, so in a sense it felt like I was working this morning for free. The plan was to just tough it out and make money tonight. 

My bar manager decides he's gonna just stand there and micromanage this shit out of me. Jigger shots that literally have a fill line. Make the servers non-alcoholic drinks. 

I just stopped. ""Is this fucking clown show of a business worth this? I start a new job Thursday anyway."" 

I decided it wasn't. So, I left them without anyone to run their well on Fat Tuesday. A major drinking holiday and aside from managers very few people there know how to bartend at all. I really hope it doesn't fuck a coworker too hard, because I doubt the managers are going to step up. They sure as shit aren't gonna reflect on this or ponder changing their corporate culture. I'm just some disgruntled asshole. Obviously, their business is perfect and I just have unrealistic expectations. Fucking lol.

I won't name names but I imagine some of the people that work there will read this. It's a *shit* restaurant. The constant promotions under cutting our individual sales, but maintaining their margins. Cheapest place I've ever ever worked. Laziest motherfucking kitchen on the planet. 

Good fucking riddance. I have a multitude of reason to *never* rush back to that fucking place. I hope they go out of business."

Quick background: i live 110 miles away and 5mths into a hybrid role our boss told us to return full time in office, no notice, no grace period and no real reason. My boss is young, inexperienced and this is her first management role. I saw my coworkers applying for jobs at work when she called in sick the day after dropping the bomb. 

I had a (50 min) meeting with our director and my manager yesterday. There was tons of back and forth and I did my best to stand up for our team and demand answers and a compromise.

They offered to re-evaluate a possible 1 day WFH schedule, instead of the original 2 days, in 6 months. I said I can't plan my life around empty promises and maybes half a year from now to get an answer. I said no, I'd start looking immediately for a new role. 

Then they bumped it up to 2 months after our new hire is trained.. to ""re-evaluate"". I have this feeling they want somebody trained while they dangle the carrot so it won't hurt their bottom line as much if 1 or 2 of us quit when they don't allow the WFH at the ""re-evaluation"". 

I'm quitting. I've applied to my old job in a lesser role. I'll have to start over and move my way back up. Le sigh. No more commute though."

It's somewhat become a joke in the office when it comes to me. It's incredibly overstimulating, overwhelming, anxiety inducing, stressful, all the things, to be in the office. The lights, the sounds, the fake coworkers, everything. 

Anyways, my boss has been saying to the group over the last few months that we need to start coming in 50%, which tells me Im not the only one who abused the 50% policy. He's been very nonchalant about me not really coming in, very hands off. Doesn't call me out directly. However, today he did text me we ""need to talk"" about doing 50%, to which I responded that's fine, I dont mind coming in. I will note the text wasn't out of mowhere. I told him I had an appointment which happened to be at the same time as our regular meetings. He said okay, then said the part about the 50%. That was the end of that, for now. Hopefully forever.

I've been ignoring asking for accommodations for my time there so far as I tried to just tough it out. I'm also scared of retaliation or worse just by asking for accommodations, after reading the many horror stories on r/jobs.

But, I don't think it's unreasonable to ask to go remote or at least to expand my WFH agreement. Or maybe to move me to a more private workspace if nothing else. My job can pretty much all be done remotely - it's not causing some ""undue hardship"" on the company in my view or restricting my job functions. All I really need is my work phone and laptop.

So, what do you think? How should I proceed? Should I stay quiet, or start this process once I get the documentation? Thanks for any advice."

I'm gonna TLDR you what I'm asking...then try to explain myself 

The tldr, is if, and this has happened to me twice, if one of these background third party check things does the employment verification, they aren't going to find anything, I'm not gonna pass it, my paper history is informal, mostly, and I'm clearly terrible at accounting. 

Let me preface this, I'm not a careerist, this isn't good work, I'm talking unskilled seasonal work, but for whatever reason some franchise corps use, I think the name was Hire Right...I failed the work history part, no criminal history. I'm only 24, so I don't have ya know a huge history.

I know there were a couple years like when I was 20/21 where I did taxes, however poorly, but I really, really don't feel comfortable giving that info to some weird background company.

What is the right stage in the interview process to bring this up, that I probably won't pass this robot system, how can I avoid companies that use this, or how can I approach this upfront with human resources? When is the right time in the hiring process to bring this up? --without this extensive tax and 1040 history..apartments I understand..jobs less so.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm from a very very remote rural area with less than 6000 people,My credit is bad, that's a part of this, I did it in when I was 19, but the seasonal jobs are suppose to have company housing, and I have some friends in that part of the country.

 I did other labor. I would sell some assets at the beginning of the year, then keep things outside a bank..most of the year,...yeah boy did I not understand how bad that is for background checks...hindsight

I did do ranch hand/landscaping/farm stuff--some cash, some personal checks, some paystubs.

Cash for helping various relatives, taking care of ailing relatives for some considerable time, one of my ranch and landscape boss slash family friend's--he had bad business practices, hiring, etc, he of course ended up owing and paying back the IRS for this habit, I know the 6 months or so I got paystubs from part of their family are lost, I of course didn't keep copies. His father owned the ranch, who then passed away, and then their family sold it. I mean sure, there might be some paystub record from a subway job as a teen, but...I mean...that's not very ""current"". 

I'm trying to move to the other side of the country and start over, I'm trying to make a big life change, and I just really didn't understand how aggressive corporate HR automated systems could be. 

I feel like I'm just lost in Job Hunting purgatory, and can't repaint this in a good light, I am not sure what these seasonal resort towns or even metropolitan employers want to hear in such a situation."

It has been awhile. Just over a month since I posted here thinking I just wanted a bit of support from the community, but I ended up learning that my situation with the CEO of my company was in reality, extremely dangerous and abnormal. 

[Here is my original post if you’re missing the context](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/s/T5znFiVLfF)

Firstly I wanted to thank you all so much for helping me come to this realisation. I had no idea that the things I was experiencing were huge red flags. If it weren’t for you guys explaining all of this and connecting the dots I really don’t know what would have happened. 

Also just wanted to say I’m sorry for not responding to everyone. It was all really quite overwhelming and shocking. I read every comment and listened to everyone, it was just very hard to put how I was feeling into words. 

Since then, alot has happened so here’s the update. 

I never went back to work, i emailed HR saying I needed to talk about my resignation ASAP. HR lady called me almost immediately and I told her about seeing him around my house, touching my back, giving me roses, begging to take me home everyday, etc. She was really really shocked, and told me that i don’t have to work my notice but I will still be paid regardless. This all led to him being suspended from his position without pay pending an investigation. His brother has taken his position as CEO. 

After a suggestion i received here, i ordered a ring doorbell. Two weeks after i caught him on camera knocking on my door and peeking into my front window. I have been in contact with a lawyer as per your advice and things are moving quickly. I’ve also had ongoing contact with police since that video was taken. 

A few days after that I got on the train to go to an appointment I spotted him on the same carriage. I moved about 6 carriages up and sat down, then saw him pass me a few minutes later. I got off, switched trains and haven’t seen him since then. 

And this may just be me being paranoid now that I know I miss things easily but I’ve also seen roses around my neighbourhood. Since leaving work I haven’t been walking as much so I started going for afternoon walks everyday. I’ve found 3 singular roses at different times just on the ground along my usual route. I wanted to include this to ask you guys what you thought?  Again, it may just be paranoia. 

I’ve since moved out of my house and am staying with my parents until I can find a new place. 

Again, thank you all very very much. You guys are doing good work!!!! Once things calm down and the outcomes are final I’ll make another update, though it may be awhile. 

All the best, stay safe."

My boss is the owner and we have a great relationship. We have a ""Meet The Team"" page on our website with everyone's full names, photos and titles. I've never been a fan because I don't like having personal details and photos accessible online to anyone that just google searches my name, but I'd gone along with it because it was good for my role and seemed small enough.

Her new website company has told her that 'link backs' from other websites to yours and also from yours to other legitimized sites are very critical for the organic results listings on Google which I know is true.

They have told her that on the ""Meet The Team"" page each person's name/image should link back to their individual LinkedIn page as it helps authenticate the company's webpage by linking back to other legitimized sites.

I don't have LinkedIn (anymore). I don't have any social media (anymore) and I prefer it to stay that way. I understand how many will say LinkedIn is essential for career progress, but I'm not looking to find a job and I much prefer keeping my life/status/job locations private.

My boss positioned the conversation as ""I know you don't have a LinkedIn profile but now everyone needs to link to theirs on the site"" I didn't agree to do it or not as we changed topics quickly.

What do I say when this comes up next?? 


TLDR: my boss wants me to create a LinkedIn profile outlining my work history that will be publicly accessible to help increase their website SEO status"

16,2024-02-13,I turned down employee of the month.,u/Hexent_Armana,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aqdi6f/i_turned_down_employee_of_the_month/,antiwork,"Just a small post. I figured I could get it off my chest in this sub of people who might understand.

I got employee of the month a couple days ago but turned it down when they offered it to me. Comes with a gift card, a certificate, and your picture on the wall.

On one hand I feel guilty for turning it down because my boss nominated me and she's awesome. She's the best boss I've ever had and probably will have. I have so much respect for her and am flattered by the nomination.

However on the other hand the company as a whole is an awful place to work at. A real (fake) jewel encrusted shithole. Frankly I'm embarrassed to work there and can't even bring myself to say its name when locals ask. I work one of the lowest positions, have no experience in business leadership, and no potential for advancement and yet I constantly find myself recognizing all the correct decisions while watching them make foolish ones. Then cringe as I notice other far more respectable businesses make the same decisions I do.

Having my face on that wall in the fancy sparkly frame. That would feel like a crackhead calling me his best buddy. Even if it were true I'd still be embarrassed if he went around telling everyone."

Basically stuck in the ""I love my job....but the pay SUCKS"" mode.

Can't reveal too much about my job, but it's a very specific field (we're one of the only ones who really do this, and others are starting to do what we do), so it's hard to even find a comparable job title/duties as this one, and even the ones starting to have similar job titles elsewhere are offering the exact same things this current place offers (probably got tipped off from my very employer that you can have that job title with that pay and people will still do it).

Just don't know what to do. If I got a drastic increase in pay or happened to win a huge amount of money where the pay at whatever job I do is secondary, I'd love doing this job, it's fun and time flies. I've very casually just been looking elsewhere on LinkedIn and Indeed (also knowing full well I won't have much free time for interviews) and haven't found anything that sounds too interesting either.

Just starting to lose a huge amount of motivation for working and its literally only because my current employer are the biggest cheapskates imaginable for a multi billion dollar company who just employs mostly part time minimum wage workers who even expect people to be on call 24/7 and has workers begging their bosses for the most basic of items like Pens, paper, envelopes to do their own job because the company is just so dirt cheap and pathetic."

And part of my company’s policy is that’s there are no merit or review based raises, only position move based raises. I’ve been with the company for over 10 years. I’ve moved up from position to position starting at the lowest paid hand laborer up to the highest paid forklift driver. About three years ago, I applied for a millwright position. At the time the position paid four dollars more an hour. Since then it’s been a nightmare. At first the plant manager called the maintenance supervisor and asked if I was fit for the job. To which he replied that I was eager and willing to work and learn. My pay was still not increased. After a couple months I went to the plant manager and inquired about my pay. His reasoning at the time for not changing my pay was “he just wanted to make sure this position was something I wanted” I told him, yes this is
Something i wanted to do. These meetings came over and over through three years and the excuses changed every time. “Well you’d have to change you’re schedule” so I changed my schedule to two hours later. Then he told me that California (the company that owns our Washington company is based in California) has an apprentice level program that hasn’t been implemented at our plant, so he’s waiting to hear back from them about my wages. I made the point that my co workers, other millwrights, were making a wage and no apprenticeship was being followed for them, “I’ll talk to my boss” was the answer. We had these meetings 6-8 times over the last 3 years. The last one we had he told me that the management above him had eliminated the position. That was about a month ago, I’m still working the same shift in the maintenance department, but am being asked to fill in for other departments when people call out sick. And as of today I’m being told I will be moved into my original forklift position with the same wage. So my question is, if I call an employment lawyer, do I have a case for the difference of three years back pay?"

Since we are understaffed and the restaurants philosophy is to mainly work with part-timers and very few full-timers it's a weekly problem that we don't have enough people for some days and to many for others.
The problem is that the organisation is beyond sh*t. Every week we write the days we want to work into our WhatsApp-Group-chat & he does the working schedule for Monday night.
This morning i wake up to this text in the groupchat from him:
""Hello everyone, everybody who can just work one day a week and thinks he can chose what day doesn't need to come anymore."" (It's in German so the Screenshot seems unnecessary). Since a few months he has his meltdowns about planning the schedule every other week. One week he has not enough people for the Friday, than it's the Saturday and so on.
First of all i know he doesn't go through with this because we are already understaffed. I think he doesn't know how the concept of part-time works. He thinks that the work at the restaurant is the part we need to prioritise the most. He sometimes even wants us to leave early from our mainjob or take off to work there on specialdays like valentine's day.
I have a full-time job and i study so I don't can and especially don't want to plan my life around my part-time job.
And if he wants to decide which day i work he can't give me my schedule for the week during that week. I wouldn't minde giving him a few options to chose from but then i want my schedule at least one month in advance. He also refuses to use one of sooo many apps designed for planing schedules. We even showed him a few where everyone sees which days are already covered and on which days we need a few more people. No the groupchat is the way.
If the job wasn't the best paid job as waiter i ever had i would flip this nutsack the bird.

like the schedule being posted on time. i usually get my schedule 5 days before the following week. i have asked for this to be fixed. i have had to cancel plans and doctors appointments because of this.

it’s not tuesday about to be wednesday and still no schedule for next week. so i will not be showing up tuesday and monday of next week. 

and any additional days the schedule is t posted.

i’ve talked to higher ups management and spoke to the specific manager doing it as well.

i am also one of their more reliable and fast and efficient employees so this would probably make them very upset.

any advice on how to protect myself?"

It was written about in Exodus. It parallels many things about the modern worker. Sure there is no whipping and beating occurring or slavery but when survival and the basic needs of human beings has been tied to working a job for someone else for the vast majority of them can it really be said that there is a choice in it? I say in modern day America there is as much choice for the modern worker and everyday person as the people of Israel had under Pharaoh and his slave drivers. 

The slave driver squeals ""They dont want to work"" or ""WHY DOESNT ANYONE WANT TO WORK!?!?!"" as the children of God in the ancient times Exodused to the sea. Go read it because the written version is untouchable. 

The Bible is a spiritual book in every sense of the word but it's not beginner tier spiritualism because you have to be receptive to receive it. It's not for the novice but those who have stepped straight into the battlefield of the spirit. To those who are losing the battle as it rages on all around them invisible and unseen to all but themselves that pick up the sacred word of God in book form will wield the very weapon of choice and it's many other spiritual weapons and arsenals. And dont feel dishearten and defeated those times that you slip and fail, get back up and remember there's not a warrior alive that doesent have battle scars.

The world has marketed and told us all that ""That's just a book about love how boring is that come over here and watch some more TV and Sportsball. That's what you really want right? You dont need none of what that book has to offer. I mean books are boring right? The only text you're interested in reading is drama on social media after all.  Stick with being entertained. Dont veer from the path we have made for you. Continue to consume without thinking. Continue being abused in the workplace. Continue to be beaten down by overzealous laws that are unbiased. Continue living in the world that was designed by us just for you. But whatever you do dont ever open that old book that will tell you everything you need to know to shatter your chains and be liberated."" 

If you want to understand what drives the labor shortage and why nobody wants to work go read Exodus and understand, while there is nothing new under the sun, that Exodus describes the modern work environment but it shows us something critical; how to change it.

So I say again the answer to ""Nobody wants to work"" is Exodus."

1. Sundar Pichai (Google) - $226 Million (2023)
2. Satya Nadella (Microsoft) - $48 Million (2023)
3. Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) - $27 million (2022) and $700 million in dividends a year as of 2024
4. David Calhoun (Boeing) - $22.5 Million (2022)
5. Mary Barra (General Motors) - $29 Million (2023)
6. Ted Sarandos & Greg Peters (Netflix) - $40 million each (2023)

Does this not infuriate anyone? While these companies are firing workers and cutting wages, their CEO’s are making around 150-2000 times the average wage of the workers at their companies. And we wonder why the US is in shambles. The average person can’t even retire, young people can’t buy homes or start families (no real future), we’re all up to our gills in debt (mortgages, student loans, etc). Every dollar the common person makes is taxed 1000x while these corporations have numerous legal loopholes for tax burden reduction. 

Lovely. And in addition, we’re supposed to sit here and play pretend that these people are hundreds to thousands of times more productive than their average workers who build/develop their products and make them all of their money.

And what is more disconcerting: These CEOs are incentivized to fire more people in order to increase the value of their individual stock holdings. They are more incentivized to do share buy backs than to put money back into their businesses for R&D, or I don’t know, give their employees a livable wage that keeps up with inflation. 

These corporate oligarchs have bought our politicians through successful lobbying and continued donations. They have done this so they can function as monopolies and duopolies and small up and comers can compete with them. 

These large corporations, big media outlets, and corrupt government officials want to keep us divided and arguing amongst ourselves. They want us to be distracted while they syphon all the resources and flee to their peaceful private estates in other countries like the globalist elites they are.

It is time for people to remember their power. We should be boycotting these companies, creating unions and the kicking the corrupt cronies in government out of office and replacing them with people who will crack down on big business. 

If this does not change, we will have no future, and if we are lucky enough to have children, they will also not have future because we did not fight back.

The work environment was bad, and the manager wasn't very professional. So, I decided to inform the employer via text that I couldn't continue working due to personal reasons. I had worked for 10 hours and want compensation for my time. However, the employer asked me to sign a contract before paying me. I recall being paid via Interac e-Transfer for a three hour training session at a bake shop without having to sign anything. Why do I need to sign a contract if I've decided not to continue working at this organization?"

21,2024-02-14,Do you find that discretionary work effort is decreasing in your workplace?,u/paisleyno2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aqk2h9/do_you_find_that_discretionary_work_effort_is/,antiwork,"This is for my fellow Canadians, however it must be applicable to areas of the US/Europe as well (although I believe Canada has it the worst of most first world countries right now). 

It feels like due to the Canadian cost-of-living/housing crisis, that a majority of those under the age of about 35 and/or who are renting or don't own a home, has ""quiet quit"".

Quality of service and products are now total shit and we are paying 5x for it.

From front line service workers right to professional management functions.

No discretionary effort at work, no motivation at work, just get through the day, etc.

I can understand why and respect it, since if you're a Millennial/Gen Z you are essentially completely fucked. You have no future. Zero future. The entire societal contract is broken and discretionary work effort (hard work/going above and beyond) provides the employee with 0 benefit or a marginal benefit that is absolutely not worth it (enjoy your 3% raise).

To highlight the Canadian crisis: 

1. My parents bought a home in the Greater Toronto Area early 2000s for $300k on a combined $100k income (3x income/cost).
2. At the height of the Canadian housing boom just 20 years later it sold for $3.00M dollars (yes 3 MILLION dollars).
3. To buy this property today at 3x income/cost you would need a household income of $1,000,000.00 dollars/year.

Your monthly mortgage payments would be $10,000 a month. Every. Month. 

In other words, it's impossible to buy based on your labour income alone.

GDP per capita in Canada has now been dropping and we are at [2017 levels in terms of productivity](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F589ec32d-5ebd-4804-852a-a4951cdfa0b4_896x550.jpeg). 

We are living in an era where labour is being pushed into an unproductive state by business and supported by corrupt government initiatives (i.e. commute the the office via old means of burning fossil fuels as you are most valuable as a physical body/commodity to the commercial real estate industry).

There is a significant disequilibrium in the labour market and this won't end well - I see productivity rapidly decreasing further. If you have limited time on this planet and the labour market offers no hope of a future, why bust your ass at work? There is literally no point.

Have you noticed the same? Is labour productivity currently falling off a cliff?"

I'm at a different location now, closer (like 15 mins with a car) but I can't get there without transport, they assured me that they would provide me with that transport. Half an hour before my shift I call them just to confirm that I'll get transport, they said they'd pass the message on. I don't get a call back so I called them again 15 minutes later, said they'd pass the message on. The next time I call them my shift is supposed to have started and once again they said they'd pass the message on. Skipping ahead a bit I'm now close to an hour late because they never called me back despite me calling like 6 or so times. I call my site manager and he gets someone else who is onsite to pick me up, I'm an hour and a half late at this point. Thankfully my site manager was completely understanding and assured me that it wasn't my fault. 

It's around half past nine when I finally get that call from the control room asking me if I'm alright, after I'd already called several times and told them that it's urgent. I say everything is fine because I'm already both over it but also very pissed off.

Then there's the time a few days ago where I randomly check my roster and see that I'm on Monday and Tuesday, it is Saturday. I did not get an email and would not have known if I didn't check. I call to tell them that I literally can't work those shifts unless they give me transport to and from work, apparently 7 am is too early for them so no work for me.

I got a call ten minutes ago asking if I can work tomorrow, exact same location that I need transport to and from. At least they had the decency to let me know I had a shift."

So I asked them how do they want me to meet their expectations and have me “mentor” this new hire. Even if they dont assign me urgent matters, I still need to meet the metrics. It fees like the boss passed the responsibility to me to train this new person, but not willing to pay me extra or lessen my case load. It feels like they are not willing to compromise.

 Im already struggling to meet their new expectations. I told them at my previous job, I atleast get 2$ more/hour plus no other responsibility other than just train the new hire. None of my coworkers want to help “mentor” because they are also struggling and are swamped with work load. How do I approach this? How can I tell boss that I don’t want the responsibility politely and professionally? 

I quoted the word mentor because based on what boss told me on what to do with the new hire, it is basically just to train them and follow new hire around and check everything they do."

It's probably the most miserable I've ever been

My dad is a terrible person

He has been shunned by most of my family for how he treats then and has spent many holidays alone because of it

I have to drive 6 unpaid hours a week to pick up his kid for him due to divorce custody stuff. He's too lazy to do it himself and calls me his personal slave.
One time my gfs grandma died and we had to go to her funeral on one of the planned driving days. My dad got very pissed off after hearing how I couldn't drive and made us leave early
That's time my girlfriend will never get back.

He's told me he wished that I was aborted(while also being anti abortion lmao)
And plenty of other threats that I imagine aren't below him

I get paid more than most of the employees ($24 an hour which is not above average everyone else is just under paid) but the job I do is much harder than any other job at the factory so most people don't see an issue with it
I've been getting harassed for about 2 years now and will constantly bring up how it needs to stop.

There is one specific employee that's doing this to me and I don't know how he has a job
He's constantly high or drunk and causes property damage often
He lost a multi million dollar customer because of his drug use
He's made violent threats to other employees 
He's popped 4 sets of my cars tires
He has been caught on video going out of his way to vandalize machines that I use
For some reason this employee is protected and no matter what he does he will get a raise and never get told he's done anything wrong and instead gets rewarded for being a piece of garbage human being.

I told my dad that if this doesn't stop soon I'll have to leave. My dad responded by saying that he'd do what he could to make me lose my apartment if I left. (He knows the landlord)

I have made plans to move very far away and get a new job as I'm starting school this month but I didn't plan on quitting until next month

Today has pushed me over the line and I don't think I can put up with it any longer.
I haven't officially quit but I don't think I plan on showing up the rest of the week and left early today.

The workplace abuse has become overwhelming and I cannot do this anymore

If I get fired then I'm finally free but I'm terrified and have no plan on what in gonna be doing for then next month and a half.

I'm a Bilingual Receptionist living in a developing country. I live 1 hour and 30 minutes away from my job, but rush hour bumps that up to 2 hours if I'm lucky. I make 2500 BRL (500 USD) a month. I'm a third party, and my company doesn't even pay a decent food allowance or the full cost of my transportation, so that salary ends up being way way less in the end.

My boss at the company I work for is an absolute idiot. Once, when the entire building's AC was shut down, my coworker tried to get in touch with him (he's the facilities specialist) but couldn't because he was playing videogames at home. I've also came up with multiple interesting projects and ideas, and never got any feedback from him afterwards, neither positive nor negative. This is clearly a dead-end job that will lead me nowhere and is sucking away on my life.

I spend 10+ hours at this job and 4 hours on the commute. My mental health is really suffering and I can't even take a medical leave (by paying for my doctor's appointment. surprise! I don't have health insurance) because my coworker just quit and they have yet to find a new receptionist to take her place. If I do it anyway  surely I'll be fired, and I can't be jobless right now.

Well this morning, she speaks to the receptionist alone in her office. Next thing you know, my boss comes out threatening me and my coworkers that if we gossip about the receptionist anymore we are getting a write up and we need to stop “excluding her” and we aren’t allowed to talk to each other in our offices behind the receptionists back anymore. She got away with it all, no punishment. I was super excited to work here at first because my last job had an issue with letting problem people go unpunished, and it looks like that’s whats happening here too.

Once I got the claim on track and was seen properly I was given light duty. My director sent me home because I “wouldn’t be able to do anything.”
I’ve never filed a claim before and was not told how any of it worked as well as that since I was being sent home I was not told I wasn’t going to get paid while I was away. 
After a week and a follow up appointment with no improvement to my neck injury I was given another week with the same restrictions. 
Told my boss and again I was told to stay home. The next day was payday, I realize it is short and pull up my paystub. To my surprise I’m missing a lot of hours. BUT someone without my knowledge or permission decideds to use all my vacation and sick ours on that check. 
When I confronted my boss she got defensive and said it was her choice “to try to help me out with missing hours”
My question is what she did actually illegal? 
I’ve called the state workers claim department and the lady I spoke to didn’t give a definitive answer. She said it definitely wasn’t the right way to go about things but it could be worked out if I wanted the hours back. 
I’ve been planning to leave this hell hole. I was hired as a “yes man” a check in the box just so they can say they have maintenance and someone to blame when everything continues to break.

I had talked to my manager about the reasoning for us not to clock in and all he said is that they don’t want to pay x amount of people for doing nothing.

So, I just started a new job this week, and everything about it is pretty great. I came from a really toxic work environment (I’m an engineer), and I finally feel like I’ve landed in a place that is a lot better than what I was dealing with before. 

The issue is that I’m in training and whenever I try to take a break in my 8.5 hour day I basically am not getting them, or when I try to take one it’s not being respected as one. We are also going through some pretty heavy stuff that would be impossible to process all of it without a breather. 

For example, I said “I’m going to take a break now” I go and make food for 5 minutes, come back in the room and within 3 minutes the trainer is still talking to me about work stuff while I’m literally sitting there eating. 

How do you even address this as a new employee? I have an hour drive home and by the end of the day I’m absolutely exhausted just because I have to sit here and pretend or try to absorb all of this crap without a real break."

I have no idea where it's coming from and I wish it wasn't happening to me but it is, and as of now, there's nothing I can do but rest. However, my manager is quite upset that I have called in sick every month for four months in a row. Today when I let her know about not being able to come in because I am too ill, she just said ""that's unpleasant, but mostly because of you calling in sick every month these past months"". However, I don't think it would be very responsible of me to contaminate all of the food with my extremely runny nose. Oh, and I think she was actually the one to make me sick this time, as she came to work sick a couple days ago. 


What should I do in this situation, is my manager responding as a good manager should? 


(If possible, please try to avoid speculating on my health, I'll try and resolve this with my doctor, but I'm a massive hypochondriac so I don't wanna get too concerned, I have called my doctor and they advised me to start taking vitamins and eat healthier, and to see if that has any effect.)"

It was a newly created position, and I had trouble retaining some of the smaller details. I tried to correct them when they were pointed out.

I have ADHD and swing from hyper focusing to forgetting on the daily.

So I was written up and told I had a week to do a 180. I hyper focused on fixing what I did wrong. A week later, I'm told I improved...but they were letting me go anyway.

That was the outcome I expected tbh.

What got me was one of the reasons: the office manager's kid's school called. The stupid bish on the other end didn't give me her name or the business name before she hung up. I went scrambling to find the phone number when the office mgr came up and asked was that call for me?

The other reason was some long time client ""wasn't aware"" of a long standing deposit to book a certain type of appointment and canceled by walking out the door.  I got the blame for that one somehow.

I also made the mistake - which I never did at previous jobs - of disclosing the ADHD.

*Insert Price is Right sad horn*

Anyway, I've pretty much had it with office politics and the blame game, and I'm looking into freelancing.

While I was wrong, was this unfair of them?"

she assumes the worst of me no matter what. But she is faux friendly too. So I just ignore her backstabbing shite.

She hates that she can't get a reaction out of anyone and thrives on the drama that comes next. Sometimes she will go into a complete strop about her home drama and take it out on us for the day by being passive aggressive.

But they're trying to text me after I specifically said not to and threatening to call a wellness check on me if I don't respond. 

I don't want to contact them because I don't want them to know my business, nor do I want them to try and persuade me to come back or make me feel bad for leaving after ""everything they've done for me"" which I 100% know they're going to say because they're fake as shit.

After the second, the called my references the next day. My understanding was that their next step would be to make offers. Both interviews went incredible well and I was really excited at the prospect of working with them.

 Then, I heard nothing for three weeks. So, I sent an email offering more information and just asking for an update on my application. 

They replied within the hour with a generic ""we had a very competitive application pool"" and ""we decided to go with another candidate."" I spent 10+ hours on this application: from writing my cover letter to prepping for interviews to sitting through two panel interviews. I'm incredibly disappointed and I guess looking for some resolution.

I was making $6 more at my other job but I quit because I was going to move back to my home state but I decided to actually stay and find a different job! So I took this one as I was desperate for a job to pay my bills and I figured I could talk myself into a raise later down the road! It’s been 3 months now and my finances are struggling with life being expensive and my pay cut! 

I emailed my boss (it’s a small business) that I wanted to request a meeting and talk about compensation! He said he would meet with me about it but he wanted me to create a list of reasons why I would like a raise! I did my list and had atleast 7 reasons why!! I sent him the list and he never replied! He never brings it up in person, it’s a small office so I see him everyday! 

It’s been 3 weeks now and nothing! I emailed him yesterday asking him if he had a chance to review my list and he never replied!! What do I do? I enjoy this job, my schedule is great which allows me to have work life balance but just feeling like I’m getting underpaid which isn’t fair!!

Thought it would be cathartic to some, if you remember this post, to know that all locations of this restaurant have permanently closed for unknown reasons around 6 months ago(?) and the manager lost his job.

It is also interesting to note, that my girlfriend proceeded to get hired at another restaurant, a fine dining one a town over, which after several months of working there, had a gas explosion where a chef received 3rd degree burns and had to get a skin graft. Her words before the explosion were ""it smells like gas in here, i would turn off those stoves."" and she wasn’t listened to.

There are rumors that the gas explosion was deliberate in order for the owners to purchase a highly sought after building in the area, collect their insurance money and open a new restaurant. It’s such a widespread rumor that about a fifth of their online reviews mention it, including two former friends of the owner. My girlfriend was one of the two people that was not informed of the new restaurant upon its opening and ghosted after working there a year, and had to sign an NDA.

1,2024-02-14,Work related mental disorder,u/Flat_Exam_3245,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aqvqqo/work_related_mental_disorder/,antiwork,"I think I have a work related mental issue. I struggle with major depression and anxiety, and have been for 10 years. But I’ve found the hopelessness of work and having to only make enough money to live paycheck to paycheck really sends me into a suicidal place. 
Especially when my boss (and pretty much all the bosses I’ve ever had) has a great life with a nice house with a pool. It’s not like he’s insanely wealthy, it just is the fact that I can barely pay rent on a cheap apartment in an undesirable part of town, while he lives a casual nice life in a nice town.

They say comparison is the thief of joy, and it is, but the unfairness of all of it is really the point. I have tried to kill myself many times over the years and have made concrete actions to do so that have put me on an involuntary holds. They never help. Because right when I get out, I have to go back to work and months go by and then I’ll want to die again because I don’t want to go to work. 

The job I held for the longest was probably the most demanding job, but I worked there for a year and made a good amount of money, so I had a couple hundred left over after bills. I still had days where I would cry on the way and back to work and not want to be there, but the money really drove me. 

However, the concept that I never chose to be here, and I have to work to survive, makes me feel like I should just kill myself so I don’t have to go to work. 
It’s not laziness or anything, and even if it is, do  people deserve to starve to death cuz they’re lazy? It’s just the depressing nature of doing stuff I hate every day until I die naturally, and I just don’t want to do it anymore. I don’t typically start the job hating it, but it festers into hatred feeling like I’m forced to go somewhere and do something every day when I would rather be doing something creative, or spending time in nature. And jobs that involve those things are far and few in between, and even if I got one with those attributes, the day I don’t want to go in and feel that I have to is the day I’ll try to kill my self. It’s a never ending cycle. And I’m in therapy and on meds but nothing ever makes it easier. 
The system has no place for me. I’ll never make more money than I did at my last job and that was only like 2500 a month. And I live in a place where rent is really high. I just feel hopeless and useless, and that basically I should be dead because who cares that I don’t want to work? Nobody does, but they don’t try and end their lives over it and I do. What’s up with that? "

Okay so I live in California and I got a job opportunity in New Jersey. I had 3 interviews as expected an offer after. Turns out the company froze hiring and they cancelled the position. My lease at my current place was almost up and I decided to renew as that no longer seemed like an option in my life.

&#x200B;

Now today, I got an email from the hiring manager saying he submitted a request to hire for this role and that he would hire me and keep me in mind. So now I am perplexed. What am I supposed to do now? Do you think I could get away with asking that if I start for this role to be fully remote until my lease is up? Do I break my lease and move there? Or do I continue my life as is? (I have my whole social circle in California, girlfriend, friends, family).

I was recently hired as an hourly, part-time worker as a retail brand representative. The company is expecting I put Salesforce on my personal phone so I can use clock in and out while on-site, and communicate with everyone via Teams.

They offer a $20/month reimbursement for using my personal phone for work. 

My schedule is 16 hours / week (8 hours Fri, 8 hours Sat).

It feels unbalanced, but is that my personal bias? Is this a reasonable expectation and reimbursement offering from the company?

I’m upset. I don’t want to go back. And I don’t want to be happy about it. Out of spite I started scheduling meetings during times when all meeting rooms are booked so that  people have to take the meeting at their desks. I know this annoys people because (1) they can hear all the background noise that the mic picks up (2) if they sit too close together, it creates an echo when multiple people are unmuted. I know that it’s petty… but I like being petty. It makes me feel better and makes my day tolerable.

I really don't like my current company and have been looking actively for ages but the job market is terrible.
I have not had had anyone complains about my work in the past three years at this company. This new guy, I can tell he is trying hard but he is extremely obnoxious. He likes to micromanage and I already got called into a room for work I didn't ""complete properly"". He saw said work before I finished it on my screen and said it was good and what he wanted. But then the next day it wasn't and i was off sick and he had to ""finish"" it but took too long cause he had ""technical"" issues and I think he caused some problems and blamed it on me. I looked at this work that he completed for me and i am still not sure what he actually did. This guy is just not good at communication. I double check everything I do with my line manager now, as well as other departments when necessary just. This guy keep twlling me that ""I just have to ask when i dont understand something"". But he still makes things out like I don't do my work or questions me on things constantly. I had an extremely toxic manager for 4 years during my first job in the industry and literally had to get on antidepressants and it took me years of therapy/ hard work to feel better about myself after he constantly put me down. I always try to do my best so this new manager is giving me the worst anxieties because he seems so erratic in his demands and expectarions. He doesn't seem to take feedback well, doesnt listen and makes a big deal whenever he actually does work that's not meetings and calls it ""helping out the team"". It's not like he is in back to back meetings anyway so it shouldnt be such a huge deal to ""help out"". Like I can tell this guy is trying to be a good manager by giving 200% or what he thinks that is... maybe he's doing his best but personally I do not like working with him at all. Any advice on how to best deal with a manager like that to avoid it getting worse? I have a talk with my line manager where I will bring it up but also already demanded more written down info on tracked tasks of what the deliverables are so this guy cant keep blaming me for random stuff."

They said the prior plan was misinterpreted but the wording is very clear to me and I have access to 2 years of documentation seeing that it matches the wording of the plan since its inception. The plan also states that changes must be announced and can only apply to future goals.

Here goes a tale of corporate sorrow, from a most fictional real character - let’s call him Benjamin. 
Benjamin is working for Big Important Firm and been under a lot of stress lately, like all of you here, supposedly. His body’s been sending him alarming signs for a while now that “dude, you really need to calm down and take a fucking chill pill”, and he was not able, of course. “I was thinking about work during the weekends, before falling asleep, with the gut-wrenching feeling that I can never rest after completing a task, cause someone is coming after me with something “even more urgent”. 
And boy oh boy, did they do that. Add to the story that Benjamin is fairly new in his role, wishes to prove himself, show his skills, topped with a high work ethic. [this is when we get abused btw, when we dont pay attention and do not establish boundaries early on. Imho , establishing boundaries should be taught at school.- the editor] 

So of course you guessed right, Benjamin fell ill. And as new as he is, he inherited one of the more (problematic) intense customers - whom he suspects caused one of his co-worker’s earlier burn-outs- at least partially. This Very Important Customer is the kind of person who is all about hustle culture: high maintenance, requires lots of inputs, likes to micromanage and then complains they have too much work which they generated for themselves, all originating from their lack of trust and ability to comprehend that others are also competent professionals, not just them. They are the ones who organize meetings to irregular hours, text after regular work hours and the ones who reach out to others’ managers during others’ sick leave. Otherwise, Benjamin had this looming feeling that this co-worker will grow restless in his most unbearable absence but little did he know that they are going to text his manager in little short of one day of his absence, like he was away on “some kind of fucking 6-months long sabbatical, kayaking down on the wild waters of Alaska while slurping home-made aperols from his baby-head-sized thermos”. 
The whole point of this cautionary tale is, that; 
1. Let us fucking working-class slaves be sick and leave us be (otherwise you prolong  recovery and jeopardize work quality and mmmm - you don’t want that, do you?) 
2. Stand the fuck up for yourselves and don’t be “on mute” when it is about your own mental and physical well-being. Even one person can make a difference.

Last but not least, Benjamin says fuck you, you fucking Corporate Fuck! You piece of entitled shit. Man, that felt good! I mean of course felt good for Benjamin, our boy. I tend to believe that all these glorified hustle culture idiots come from a silver-spoon background where entitledness just came through breastmilk, and they just reeeeeeeally dislike when slaves have their own minds and stand up for themselves and just simply … misbehave (being sick is definitely one of the most frowned-upon mischiefs).

I have just started a new job, and my first day after orientation I showed up with my walking stick, knowing that this job involves a lot of walking and I would need it. The management took me off the schedule and told me that under no circumstances would I be allowed to use a walking stick, and they can't put me in any other positions (there are dozens open with the same qualifications that are less physical) unless I resign and reapply. This, of course, felt like a trap, so I said I wouldn't resign and that I was asking for reasonable accommodations by allowing me to use my walking stick. They accused me of lying on my application because I didn't say I was disabled (an optional question) and that they were going to review my application to ""make sure everything was filled out correctly"". 

I was on standby for 10 days until I finally got the call to discuss an accomodations. Them telling me I'm not allowed to record makes me nervous, like they know they're about to do something they don't want to be held accountable for.

Had my end of year review, it’s was rushed and extremely vague with no specific examples of recognition, positive or negative feedback or areas for improvement. I was given the second to lowest possible score. Again, no reasoning why was given. Nothing specific at all. The doc is pretty lengthy as there are questions manager must fill out. No tangible areas to work on, no feedback, very weird. On top of that, the funniest part to me was my 1% merit increase. Lowest increase I’ve received in my career. Literally 1%. Imo that is worst than no increase at all. I find it to be a slap in the face. I also take this as the writing on the wall, they want me gone and are laying the groundwork. 

I challenged the scoring and methodology and was immediately gaslit. “Most people will have a similar score.” “You are doing a good job.” If I’m doing a good job then why am I at the bottom? It’s a leadership and managerial failure. I have biweekly 1:1 and was never told I was not meeting expectations or falling behind in any way.

Well, I messed up bigly.  I linked to the wrong cell.  It was a sheet for a project with the same name as another sheet for another project.  I know, I know; Be best.  

Never mind that the 3 people I sent the one report to didn't validate their numbers.  Never mind that the 3 people I sent the report report to didn't validate those numbers.  About 4,000 monthly project reports in and I linked the wrong cell so you better believe I got a talking to.

It's not gonna help if you're in the office next door, they aren't gonna look at your screen and pilfer through your documents ON YOUR COMPUTER every couple of hours. They have their own and can review documents on the cloud. If they don't want to email, pick up the damn phone. If they feel nervous about stuff not getting done, they need to dig for facts for a reality check one way or the other. A loss of oversight with folks who work at a computer 40 hours a week is because the supervisor isn't delegating or keeping track. If a customer complains about the service they receive, then the supervisor is responsible for coming up with a solution on actual performance and institutional operations. If the customers refuse to use electronic communication, that is their misunderstanding of how an office works and it is not the employee's responsibility to coach the customer. One doesn't speak to an employee when they place an order online.

Now for my personal rant

I am one of the poor bastards who has been told to go back to the office or lose my job. I'm an accountant and finance guy in a university physics department, and so the majority of my ""customers"" are old white bastards (physics professors). I have successfully been working remotely since 2020, moved to another state because my partner had to take a job. My main customer begged the department to let me work remotely because I was doing such a great job. Fast forward to a couple days before winter holiday break, I was asked to meet with my supervisor and the department chair. They graciously gave me a promotion (for work I had been doing for a year, sub-rant below) and a significant raise. Then told me I had to move back in that same conversation. Nope

As for my promotion, I had a nervous breakdown last January because I realized I was being manipulated by one of the professors and I was sabotaging myself by taking responsibility for his mistakes because he wouldn't. I told my supervisor I refused to work with him, and so they ""promoted"" me to supervisor over two Jr employees who could not keep up and needed direction. They said they had to get the official promotion and raise passes by the college. Fine. The intent was to get away from that professor. One year later, I get the raise without back pay and am immediately in the job market"

now before i go on, i know that Georgia is a ""at-will"" state. although i am very frustrated on them not giving me a reason, i understand the laws at place and am not mad at that. 

BUT, heres what i am curious about. 

The FIRST day of work, my Supervisor(boss over warehouse) showed me around and taught me how to do things. easy. we go on break and he shows me to the break area. a garage door INSIDE the warehouse.

as we are walking up to the spot, i see 3 other gentlemen sitting and chatting, one has something in his hand. i dont know what it is.

i sit down and my supervisor looks at me then asks ""you smoke pug?"" i said ""do i smoke WHAT?"" and as soon as i said that, he lit up a joint. yes, weed, the devils lettuce, maryjuWANNA. They all 3 pass it around and hit. it comes to me, and i hesitate and drop out of the sesh i was basically forced in. 

this is a EVERY DAY THING EVERY BREAK. the workplace its self is very slow, not much to do after 3pm (we get off at 4:30) 

my question to you lot is, i want to contact HR about this, and let them know what's going on in their warehouses. but what should i say?

 not gonna lie, my goal is to get at LEAST one of them fired, if not all. The reasoning in doing this is cause, i need to pay my fucking bills, and they fired me in the middle of the week, with no warning, and no excuse. It is also not legal to smoke marijuana here in GA ESPECIALLY at a work place, which would be my next question, wouldn't that be an illegal form of grooming? someone with that knowledge let me know. 

I want to start taking action in my life as a young 23 year old, and i want this to be my first step into that feeling. So even though i smoke my self, i think its fitting to fuck over some guys who fucked me over big time. i gotta go AGAIN and find ANOTHER job that isnt shit. im SO close to going back into the military, cause this shit getting out of hand. 

either way, i would like some help on what i can say to HR and what i should do going forward, I DONT want to leave this end loose. I genuinely feel wronged in the worst way regarding working a job. If it leads to monetary gain from getting HR involved then awesome, if not, than at least i know i caused them to have the same outcome as me, but with and actual reason. which will be worse for them cause thats on their record, not mine.

they want you to be available all day, the working hours are 9 AM to 7 PM with no lunch break (they keep saying ""it is remote work anyway""), i have no holidays and now, after 2 years of working here, i am feeling extremely burnt out and requested to take the next week off. i attempted to do it last year but got told no, it was not the time to rest. they have a set month that all employees are allowed to take their leaves UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THEY HAVE THEIR LAPTOPS AT ALL TIMES WITH THEM ""JUST IN CASE"". when i learned about this, i called them out and got told that it is just how it is. i ended up not taking my annual leave since i was hospitalized for 2 weeks at the set month but that is another story. now, after a few months passed and i am just exhausted from all this. sometimes having to take phone calls at 10 in the evening.

when i let my manager know about it this monday, she told me ""OK, i will talk to the boss and let you know"" and today all of a sudden i get a phone call from my boss' sidekick. he was heated, telling me they have a regular system that i cannot disrupt this way ""in the middle of the season"". he is very dismissive, constantly cutting you off and raising his voice. well, today i couldn't takr it anymore and screamed at him on the phone ""STOP CUTTING ME OFF AND LET ME SPEAK"". i told him i needed some rest, that i cannot finish my second year without having taken no breaks, that i already work very flexibly for their convenience and i won't keep slaving like this if they keep disregarding my needs. he told me ""there aren't that many projects currently, how are you tired? what do you even do working from home to get burnt out?"" and i was extremely pissed and anxious and my voice started shaking. i hated myself at that point but stood my ground, and i told him it didn't matter, i deserved a break and my exhaustion is not dependant on their approval. i got the OK.

however, the phone call ended very abruptly and he tried to intimidate me. i was told to take next week off as an exception, and after i come back, to have a discussion with him for the aftermath. after the phonecall, workload increased immediately. i am thinking they are trying to overwhelm me even more and forcing me to quit. i would LOVE to quit but i have been applying to jobs now for more than 10 months to no avail, even though i had some interviews, none of them worked; and i can't quit cold turkey since i am still paying off my college debt and i have a chronic condition i take daily EXPENSIVE meds for and i need this health insurance. i will take the next week off (not really, they said they are going to give me a call if anything pops up and to check our management platform every other night) and will be punished afterwards for it with even more mobbing, more workload and more insanity.

i know some of you will give me advice but believe me i thought it all through and it is either stay here and get paid in my mental health's expense, or leave and let life kill you slowly. my third world government has terrible unemployment terms and i will keep losing my sanity if i fall out of a job again.

i am feeling completely helpless, hopeless and alone here. i just wish i had a choice, and i wish writing all of this helped. if it wasn't for my cat, i don't know if i could have pushed through so far."

Workplace incident 513 “Cartman” 

  
 the woman who was terrorized in this meeting formerly worked up in HR. this is important to remember as the agency >!\[department of revenue\]!< observes a strict caste system. This woman had gone from HR to 'training' to us. To the front-lines.   

  
  The meeting begins. There are about 14 people in attendance. 

  
 The woman wonders if the letters the team composed and printed and posted have started to land, because if they have landed we will start getting phone-calls. 

  
  **Team-leader-in-training** (red-faced, unkempt, morbidly obese) interrupts this woman.   

  
  “-I will stop you there. … and I know, I know, I am 'Cartman'. I am a bully. (to the assembled team members) And I am going to keep bullying all of you until you learn: you are not here to do your jobs, you are here to (raises volume) GET A BETTER JOB. Get a job at \[another agency\], get a real job, that is why you are here!” 

  
 The floor supervisor (only an assistant director is above a floor supervisor) who is also in attendance says absolutely nothing and stays absolutely still.   

  
  There is a sickening pause of at least 3 to 4 minutes. It is 7 a.m.   

&#x200B;

Eventually, the floor supervisor prompts one of us to read the new parking-lot policy or whatever irrelevant normalized text had been approved. 

&#x200B;

 I would estimate that most individuals at the agency experience this sudden and unexpected psychological warfare about twice a week. Dozens have quit over it, dozens have reported it, hundreds and hundreds have ignored it and tried to go back to their lives. I fall into all three categories.   

  
 Close to the end of the meeting 'Cartman' makes some kind of unfunny joke that she wants to see twice as much doughnuts, or something, at the next meeting. To which the floor supervisor answers. “you're the boss, you're the boss.” 

the team-leader-in-training is not, in fact, the boss. The floor supervisor is in not actually afraid of her, though he pretends to be. I doubt 'Cartman' will ever be fired, but if she is it will be because she is a Machiavellian scapegoat, and because the agency recruits and hires new Cartmans every day.

Now, they implemented a new thing where we not only have to edit/reject/approve the AI’s text, but we need to explain WHY and HOW the text is bad so that they can improve it. So we’re all basically training this AI for them.

On top of that, they just sent an email stating they’re cutting their 401k matching because of “financial difficulties” and they didn’t evaluate us for a raise like they do every year last year because of “financial difficulties” AND they got rid of the free mental health benefits for the same reason."

It will reveal that not all bosses are hired for their history of achievements but rather they fill the void of darkness in many workplaces, and what proceeds (the horror stories) is emanating from these individuals.

I work for a normally progressive government agency in a red state that has been taken over by a political puppet who wants to make headlines rather than lead the organization. My unit is a mission critical one with only a handful of staff across the state, and we get compensated well (comparatively) for it, which includes being on call constantly and covering large geographic areas.

Recently I found out that there are plans at the executive leadership level to cut our staffing in half and remove our on call pay additive. The staffing change would mean that one person is doing the work that is currently being done by 2-3 people and some people would have to move across the state to other areas. Not only this, the new pay structure would cut about 20% of my salary despite taking on a bigger workload.

I love this job and it's been my dream job for years. I was finally promoted into it about 9 months ago and it has been great until this news was broken to me earlier this week. I love my supervisor, the people I work with, everything else, but the fools at the top of the chain are doing everything they can to dismantle the system.

Anyway, just a reminder I guess to make sure you're always looking out for yourself because you never know when you're going to get screwed over for some political points."

   The office has a lot of new competition in the area and with the terrible economy dental is one of the first things people are cutting to make it through (understandably so) but our office is still making about 240k a month on average and our dental fees have increased yearly due to fee guides going up. This is one of many offices they own. 

   They pay their hygienists lower than average in the area because of the bonus, yet most of the offices they own don't bonus. I used to feel like I make good money but with the cost of living going up substantially it doesn't feel like it anymore and it's really getting me down.

TL;DR New general manager gets hired, doesn't speak to us for a year, we find out from other areas in the company that we are getting fired.

So my department in a very large company got a new general manager (GM) about a year ago after an org restructor. At the start GM went around and spoke to all of us wanting to know what we wanted to see happen in the department and what wasn't working. Everyone had high hopes as we have a lot of processing issues that are easily fixed, but because we work accross 2 departments to get stuff done, every decision for improvements gets bottle necked because 1 person won't agree until it gets forgotten about, and GM wanted to change that.

2 months go by and radio silence from GM. None of their direct reports have heard from them, we have seen them but they don't sit on our floor. Whole department is missing core business updates cause its part of GM's job to tell us. Not getting anything at all.

Then all a sudden we get an email from GM saying there will be a meeting and everyone is mandatory to attend, this was about May last year. We all get into the meeting room and GM says ""we aren't making money, we need to change how we do things, there will be changes, more to come in 2 months"". July roles round no news.. September.. November.. Janurary.. nothing at all. It has become an office meme that we say ""oh we can't do this cause we don't know what the 'change' is"" and everyone laughs.

Not long after the meeting, whenever we  try to request system changes and it need to go to another level of approval but we have no vision of what that is, we don't even know who does it. 

Laterly some of us are hearing stuff from other departments. NOT our GM in regards to what is happening. Basically we are all loosing our jobs and they are going to a completely new untested model that they think will work but don't acturally know if it will. The info changes constantly but the end message is alway the same ""you will be getting laid off"".   


I'm just mad that our GM (who is on at least $200k a year) is completely incompetent. Has no idea what the department acturally does to get stuff done even though it's pretty fucking obvious. Never speaks to us, can't stick to promises or dead lines, and we have had to source the info ourselves.   


Luckily, I have been here for quite a while so my payout is going to be pretty decent, but I know that there are people that I work with that need this job and aren't as secure as I am. Businesses are going to close down because we are their sole source of work, and they don't want to tell them because they will stop working for us if they find out.  


Its just a shit, yuck situation that is going to be a shit storm. And we won't get actural confirmation until they decide to pull the trigger."

this shows both the General Contractor or Developer/owner even if your working under a Sub-Contractor that your Serious and know what your doing,. This kind of action will also get the Sub-Contractor butthole blacklisted ElseWare too. Don't even waste time talking to them either because they'll brush you off as some kind of fool in there world.

Or at least mostly. I started a new job in civil engineering about 10 months ago and just got fired. I was getting less work this past month so I knew something was up but didn’t expect this. Apparently my performance wasn’t up to company standards and they didn’t really go into detail? I was in shock so I couldn’t even push them to elaborate more than it was performance related. They kept it very vague.
And get this: they just told me to come to the conference and told me it was my last day. No 2 weeks or nothing. I walked into work normally and they had small talk with me and gave me a few tasks like normal. Then they pulled me into a meeting room halfway through the day.
The thing is - they never defined performance goals or put me on a PIP. I could understand if I failed to meet deadlines and expectations - but they never told me these things? They just slowly iced me out and cut me off? 

I’m sad I didn’t leave on my own terms, but more frustrated they had the nerve to just spring this on me and never work with me to improve. I was very open to feedback and often had to juice out criticism from them. Mind you I turned in everything on time and to their standards. I did make some mistakes (not often at all) but was able to correct them same day and ahead of schedule. It would’ve meant a lot had they done the bare minimum in telling me what to improve instead of slowing giving me less work and firing me. I talked with management plenty of times and they seemed to notice me working harder and turning in good work recently and throughout my time here.  

Part of being human is growth and this makes me feel like I’m just a number and was fired bc I wasn’t perfect or putting in regular 10 hours overtime like my coworker. 

But I’m not gonna let this ruin me. Tomorrow I’m working on resume and starting to apply.

This job was my first job as a medical coder, working at a practice that recently filed for bankruptcy. The manager I originally was hired by left a few months ago unexpectedly and the new hire and I tried to fix the broken mess of the billing department. 

During this time, new jobs demands were put on me. That were way out of my job description. One of these was changing with all the major insurance companies banking information. 

On top of this, our billing system changed (he didn’t pay the old bill) so we had 400+ claims sitting for the last two months. 

These past two week I worked very hard with the now new manager, but it’s come to our attention that Tricare hadn’t paid us. 

The doctor went back and forth with Tricare, I was called into a meeting Monday with them bc my manager couldn’t be there. 

Yesterday I got called into a meeting with my manager, the office manager and the doctor. During this meeting he also said we haven’t been paid by Aetna. It clicked in my head what was wrong. 

I had given admin rights to our office mananger before we had a billing manager. She had not changed the info to the new banks. 

The doctor got mad, stormed out. 

I was in a bad mood the rest of the day because I felt like my hard work, where I had to teach myself how to do things, wasn’t appreciated. (I was also being severely underpaid)

Well I received a text at 9 pm that I was let go. She said they’ve observed my performance to not meet their standards “these last few days” (it was a Wednesday, I finished all claims on Monday) 

She said she can collect my things. I told her n, I will come bright and early and collect them myself.

My sister started training for a new job with an extremely large, reputable company. She was hired based on her experience to work in administration. She was upfront that she had \*NOT\* used their system before.

The hiring manager gave her 3 days of training to learn the company software system, amongst other things. On the 3rd day she was given a test to see how much she progressed with learning their system.

Unfortunately, my sister did not pass the test. The hiring manager met with her and invited several other HR/company reps to discuss how ""disappointed"" they were with the results.

When my sister spoke with her new coworkers and supervisor, they all said many people fail and it's actually common for staff to attend training every couple months as a refresher.

Sister returns to training, retakes test, feels a lot better about it and is waiting for the results.

Hiring manager emails her to say that they don't have the test results yet (?) but sister should not come to work tomorrow and instead meet with the hiring reps on Zoom.

Obviously my sister is super upset as it sounds like she's going to be fired less than 2 weeks into her job.

I worked in recruiting for several years, granted in a different sector, but I have never heard of a legitimate company firing trainees before they have even begun working.

According to my sister, she spoke with the hiring manager about training more than once to get feedback and clarification about expectations. It sounds like she was brushed off each time.

I can understand my sister not being a good fit skills-wise based on the test. However, they were aware she was learning an entirely new system before hiring her, and I can't understand why they would fire someone based on ONE learning assessment.

Is this common practice? I might just be out of touch with recruitment in Canada these days."

1,2024-02-15,Is it illegal to ban someone from applying for that particular job?,u/Stitchesofspace,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1arb00s/is_it_illegal_to_ban_someone_from_applying_for/,antiwork,"I applied for a job at a big company, and was rejected after the interview. They said try again in 6 months. Long story short, I later found out from other staff that this particular recruiter discovered I was a unionist and didn't offer me a job because of that (obviously there's nothing written so I can't prove that at all)

It's been way longer than 6 months, and the website still says ""you've already applied for this"" when I try to apply. 

I tried to reach out but the IT team said the portal was managed by the internal recruiters e.g the one who passed me over.

I doubt they'll ever fix their ""IT issue"" so I can reapply. But is that illegal? To block someone from applying? I know they don't have to offer you a job, but surely they have to allow my application?"

I asked earlier in another subreddit from Mr. Wipond about how psychiatry is used by the employers to ”resolve” workplace disagreenments.  He provided this example from his book: 

”I include a number of interviews in the book with people who work in human resources, workplace insurance, etc, who talk about it as a broader phenomenon. And I include a few cases--for example, a man argues with the human resources manager, who calls 911, and a SWAT-like team surrounds his house. He gets taken to the psych ward -- they knock him out with drugs because he's demanding to know his rights -- and then they just let him go in the morning.”

I reached my last straw in Dec when my supervisor guilt-tripped me for taking a long weekend over Christmas. He claimed that i was ""abandoning my tasks when I know this is a peak period"" which was a lie since I offered to handover my portion while I go on break. Also, the leave was approved by him at least a month in advance.

Anyway, since then I've been applying for jobs and I'm in the process of interviewing. I turned in my resignation today with a one month's notice and thats when my supervisor suddenly changed. He started saying how this is such a shocking curveball, that it would be really difficult to find someone with my skills, and that one month's notice won't be enough. He asked that i extend my notice ""by a few months"" as a favour to him so they can have enough time to find someone. 

Since I don't actually have a confirmed offer yet, I thought of just sucking it up and staying till they found someone. He also really guilt-tripped me about resigning with no heads up. He said something about how its unprofessional to just ""drop a bomb like this on someone"". But, I found out from a trusted work friend that he was trashtalking me yesterday with another manager from my team. They were talking about how he should have chosen more carefully when they hired me. So now I really don't know if I should even bother extending my notice. I know its petty but I even thought of waiving my one-month's notice as a big ""fuck you"".

Tl;dr: Please advise me on whether I should extend my notice or should I leave after serving the customary one-month's notice?"

I asked a Phd student who was about to graduate how long it took him. He said 7 years. Not including masters which took him 2 years. So it took him 9 years of grad school to get a PhD.

And then I talked to my cousin who was also doing a PhD at the time. He said that some Professors actually keep their grad students even longer if they are useful. So even if the grad student is ready to graduate, the Professor will intentionally keep them longer. 

I said fuck this and I went into industry. Best decision of my life. Yeah, I get ordered around. But I have a 6 digit salary. Decent work life balance etc... On the other hand, my cousin eventually got his PhD. And then he did a postdoc. As a postdoc he was getting paid like $65k in a high cost of living area. My cousin was at this point in his 30's

My cousin is smart, hard working, years of experience. And he was making half of what I'm making. Just because he picked academia instead of industry. 

Why would anyone want to go this route? I know if you're a tenure Professor you have a ton of freedom. And yeah, in industry you get ordered about and have less freedom. But being a tenured professor takes decades. And very few people can get that far at all. "

Minimum age to work is 16 so I've worked for about 10 months and stopped after previous boss not wanting me anymore. 
During when I was employed, She made me live with my grandma because I would complain about her bad cooking at moms house (she would cook me kids meals like 3 sausage) and I had to always pay my grandma with my paycheck when I lived with her to feed me which is 10 euro daily (but she gives me lots of food and washes my clothes etc so it's fair). Even when I lived with mom for a month before switching to my grandma again she made me pay her car insurance and she cooked me bad food.
After I lost my job my mom hasn't been paying my grandma ever since I stopped working but she is still feeding me while putting the 10 euro bill daily and my mom would be so pissed at me telling me to find a new job because she doesn't want to pay my grandma the money. What should I do? Should I just work and pay my grandma? It seems like my mother doesn't wanna financially support me anymore and she forces me to work as well so currently I don't know if I should pay my grandma for the food or just work to save up for a gaming pc because i need one (current one overheats). And my mom will probably try to make me pay for some bills as well if I stay well in my new job and get a paycheck so idk what to do exactly. I kinda just wanted to go to school where my friend continued going but apparently she just told me the gover stopped her single mother paycheck so she didn't continue my school and is forcing me to work. I feel like my last teenage years is getting ruined by working this early. My grandma is not my guardian but my mom made me change my personal details to my grandmas house so I'm currently living at her.

I was already ashamed of it since it does make me feel disgusting, but him being immature about it didn't help my depression. Tuesday there was a snow storm and it was dangerous on my way to work since the roads had ice all over them since they didn't salt the streets or roads. I am also currently still on the issue as I'm texting this but Tuesday it was severely painful and I didn't have time to grab products. I told my boss I'm going home since I'm not feeling well at all and he saw that I was in pain. He tried to make me stay when I needed to go home to heal myself and even blocked the computer for me to clock out. I left anyway, yesterday he threatened to fire me for leaving. He kept asking me did i feel my period coming and did I know how to basically manage it. Gross, I told him I was just going through it and still am, he threatened to fire me and told me I couldn't leave unless he gives me permission to leave. I told him no offense but I must prioritize my health and safety over a job. He didn't say anything after that but he was pissed off anyway. I reported him to his boss because what the fuck? I can't leave because I'm in severe pain and I didn't want to go into details about me feeling it? I am very disgusted and pissed about it.





Tldr: my boss judge me for having a period then threatened me yesterday on firing me for leaving to take care of my health saying I'm not allowed to leave but asked me if I felt my period.

Ever since then, I’ve put in several hundred applications, had at least 6 in person interviews, and NO RESULTS! 
One of the interviews that infuriated me was one I had at a local gas station. I live in the east coast and we have a fairly popular chain of gas stations/cafe called Wawa. I went in for an interview and the interviewer asked why I had so many veterinary based jobs on my resume. I told her because I wanted to peruse that as a career and that I plan on furthering my education in the veterinary field. She said, and I quote,
“Well we’re looking for someone who’ll be with the Wawa family long term. Why should we hire someone who’ll be gone in two years or so?”

UUUH…PROBABLY BECAUSE ITS A FUCKING GAS STATION?????

Why tf do places like gas stations, restaurants, retail, and other places with notoriously high turnover rates expect me to commit to their business? Oh yeah, I’d LOOOOVE to work in customer service for the rest of my life. The level of entitlement for my time is mind boggling. I’d consider two years to be a pretty long time to work at the same low paying part time job. 
Also, “part time” to these people are 38 hours a week. WTF?? How am I suppose to balance school and work if I’m expected to work 38 hours? 
A part time job should be a thing you clock into for 3-4 hours after class and go home to do homework, NOT A FUCKING MARRIAGE TO THE COMPANY!!!"

I definitely didn’t put in the most time or effort in my department, I’m just very good at what I do mainly because I have ADHD hyper focus that allows me to get more done in a much shorter time frame.

Getting the same raise doesn’t incentivize me to stay at the level of work I’m doing.

Why bothering being better when I’ll get the same raise? Why shouldn’t I just put even less work in? 

Why do companies not realize this only discourages getting the best out of people?

I am sorry that I keep beating this to the ground however I am intimately aware of how I communicate does not come across clearly and you have a million of obligations outside of this issue and you may not be able to interpret what I am trying to say and balance your time. I will also take these to \*\*\*\* as you suggested but wanted you to have a written account.

The first being the meeting itself, happening when my direct supervisor was out of town and our VP questioning me on something that was well within the scope of my job description. I have been in contact with executives of almost every level since joining \*\*\* and have enjoyed the openness of all the departments willing to work with me. Me reaching out to \*\*\* was in response to a question I was asked during the conference that applied to payer related behavior. Her comment saying hes add and just pops out at the mouth all the time” is severely misinformed of the diagnosis itself and honestly does not lead me to believe she will be unbiased in any of her decisions about me once she learns of my ADHD. I had no business knowing \*\*\* disorder, nor should have it been used as an attempt to discredit him as a professional, something I believe VP should apologize to him for. \*\*\*\* response to my email was unfortunate but now I know to tread a bit more carefully and be aware of my audience. VP  goes on to mention a 1.1 mil settlement that they have talked about saying I had no need to know about this when in reality I do. I send these accounts to the payer repeatedly and need to know if they are settled so I can remove them from the list of issues. I work In both PB and HB for their RCM issues and her comments lead me to believe that she does not know that and is unfamiliar with my roles outside of the payor and internal calls I hold frequently. The only reason I agreed to everything she said was because A) she could have fired me leaving employee completely vulnerable. B) I wanted to verify if anything she was saying is true. I only panicked when she called employee that night saying she was moving her under \*\*\* and employee did not tell me that it wasn’t going to be immediate.

I sent VP my resume so she had better clarity as to what my experience was, as she seemed unfamiliar with the tasks she was listing she needed or what the position would look like. I have experience with everything that falls into my lap the \*\*\*\* way however is not something I am used to. It should in all actuality be called \*\*\*\* way because it involves berating payers, embarrassing employees and showing an abhorrent amount of favoritism to certain staff. The only time I have been allowed to fulfill the duties of my position was within the past few weeks and the process is more organized than it ever has been with multiple departments noting this. I love talking to the payer reps outside of the calls and we have made great progress coming to the understanding as to what can get accomplished with Leslie on the call vs what can when she isn’t. The one thing I refuse to do on the calls however is be verbally abusive with the payer reps, something that Tiffany and Debbie wont do either.

This is where I believe \*\*\*\* comes in, he is the son in law of \*\*\*\* and has risen quite quickly into leadership roles. Something that has not been afforded to employee in her 11 years here but I digress. \*\*\* has shown his willingness to be “direct” with the payers without first referring to the contract and not making himself look like a fool. This is apparently something VP values as she, as you heard during the call, thought about moving it under \*\*\*. He has 0 experience in payer relations or contracting, nor does he have any idea of what it takes to maintain the relationships. Something employee has been doing since her first day with Methodist, her breadth of knowledge has frequently made her the leaning post for the majority of the CBO yet she has been passed over multiple times for promotion outside of being given the offer to work under someone she does not agree with. If my role were to move to anyone it should be her or \*\*\* if they were looking for someone with leadership experience. Being moved under \*\*\*\* would be demoralizing and ultimately the reason she ceases her relationship with the CBO, this is not something that was thought of in what I believe was an attempt to give \*\*\*\* my role. I also find it hard to believe that this didn’t come about over the span of a conversation as \*\*\* was waiting his turn the minute I walked out of the office with VP and he has become increasingly less available to provide his part to me for the payer calls but manages to not have to answer to anyone for it.

The conversation with VP was probably one of the only times she has been pleasant to speak with, however her motives were less so. Even if the implementation operations role were available her maintaining my director role and pay would be inappropriate as the DFW average was about $50k more than my current salary. After some introspection I realize that I will not be able to work directly for VP (both because of my ADHD and her management style)  nor will the complaints lodged against amount to much until we can get these outside reps to call. For now though I am attempting to protect the ones who have been a considerable amount of their lives with this organization and keep doing my job efficiently to make sure whatever transition happens, it does so smoothly."

He promptly sends another message asking me to tell him how many times I used the restroom today (twice, a pee and a poo, total of 15 minutes MAX) I asked if I was required to disclose that information to him and he said I was required due to the fact that it's a paid bathroom break and that I have confirmed that I have no medical problems. I'm just curious if this is true and wondering how I should handle the situation forward from this point."

The Mars Redback Currency System and it how takes control of the US economy. It is easy to predict that the next major stock market crash will occur when Mars and the lunar node are in a similar close alignment. This information makes it easy to confer enough value to the Mars Redback currency, such that it could become legal tender overnight, capable of settling both public and private debt, while also being backed by gold. In the event of a crash or bank run happening at the right time of Mars and the lunar node being in close alignment, the existence of private Mars Redback currencies, which is available on Amazon, would allow Amazon inc to take over the US economy and print Mars Redbacks, set the exchange rate and get the economy running again."

7,2024-02-15,"Well, I got fired.",u/Moose_Cake,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1arlt7g/well_i_got_fired/,antiwork,"I apologize for the long story, and I am definitely leaving a lot out because there’s so much to cover.

To get started, I worked for a local corporation grocery chain for 3 years and had the pleasure of co-running one of the largest buildings in the area.  I had started at an entry level position, but within 8 months was already a supervisor due to turnover.  That should have been a sign now that I think about it, or the anti-union classes I had to take but those are no longer relevant I guess.

Over the next 3 years, I with the help of my management team, had noticeably raised sells, had almost eliminated turnover, and overall raised customer satisfaction.  I began a work newsletter that’s still running, reformed our store’s counterfeit detection system, and worked on creating solutions that covered problems that had plagued the store for years.  I absolutely loved my position, and before I knew it I had generated a lot of positive feedback among the community and with workers.  The local management loved my innovative ideas.

Until recently, corporate and I had not had reason to interact.  But that changed shortly after we received a new manager.  Due to the manager’s reputation we experienced a small walkout and I got moved to supervisor.  Yay!  One day I had spoken with a new worker and learned we were making the same amount of dollars per hour.  I went to speak with my new manager, who explained that there was a mistake and they were paying me like I had never received the promotion.  She said she would contact HR and get it sorted out.  I asked if I would get repaid for the time I already worked as a supervisor and she said they would look into it.  I eventually got my pay increase ($2.50) but heard nothing back about the back pay.

Fast forward months later.  I spoke with my manager again and she said she didn’t recall when I started as a supervisor but said we were already squared away with the back pay.  I contacted my prior supervisor who I replaced and had her write a statement on when I took over.  I also collected paystubs and went with all of that to HR.  HR said they would look into it but that they were going to have to give my manager a chance to work with me.  So then I ended up back in my manager’s office where she explained that she felt “I wasn’t going to be in the position long” and that she took the liberty to not give me the raise.  She also made sure to inform me it was within the company’s rights and sent me on my way.

Then the exodus began out of nowhere.

 My store manager I had been arguing with suddenly retired, my produce manager left, then two pharmacists left followed by our district meat manager and many others who worked directly with corporate.  Corporate moved workers to fill the gaps and before I knew it, I was working with a new team.  At this point, I washed my hands with the back pay and decided to focus on trying to get noticed by the powers overhead.

It started with meeting my new manager.  She was a quiet woman who loved the corporation.  She spent all of her time in the office and wasn’t very talkative.  I felt that if I played by the book everything would be fine.

And then everything began breaking.  First the parking lot lights, then supports on one of the shelves began to give, the 1990s technology we had been using went into full issues mode, and numerous other safety and structural issues popped up.  Meanwhile, corporate began cutting staff which only accelerated issues.  It became normal for me to walk 11 miles daily between departments and customers were noticing quality drops everywhere.  Complaints online began appearing about the parking lot lights being out (we had approached almost a month without parking lot lights in our huge parking lot by that point) and concerns for the safety of the workers collecting carts were voiced to me via workers and customers.  I started by speaking to my new bosses who told me they were still working on it.  I then moved to my in store HR who felt I had a valid issue but couldn’t do much.  During that time I was climbing ladders and popping breakers to try to get 30 minutes of lights before they would crash again.

This past Friday I finally snapped.  My management team decided to send workers home while I was on lunch in order to run a skeleton crew due to “budgeting”.  After a rather angry conversation with the one assistant manager (we’ll call her assistant manager #1) I wrote out my two weeks notice and worked through the Super Bowl weekend with my small crew.  During that time, I also wrote an email to my district store director.  I should probably mention that my management crew took the weekend off with the exception of one assistant manager (assistant manager #2).

During this time, I voiced my concerns with assistant manager #2 (she agreed the store was bad there but also said I ruined my career putting my two weeks notice in).  I begun speaking with a few workers about how I could improve things for them before I left and I begun writing a list of suggestions to talk to the manager about when she returned.  In my mind, there should have been a middle ground we could reach and I would leave with a healthy impact.  That did not happen.

On Tuesday I came in early and requested the manager’s time to talk with her.  She was unavailable so I begun speaking with my customer service manager knew about the issues.  My assistant manager #1 immediately came into the CSM office and began blowing up.  I was told I had to accept conditions and policy changes and that everything going on was “normal”.  I was then brought into the manager’s office where my manager began yelling at me for being anti-corporate, not following the chain of command (a reminder that I had spoken to the in store HR, both assistant managers, the manager, the district manager, and now my customer service manager as it technically involved them), and they told me I was “creating a disruption” by talking to other workers about issues they were experiencing that I was hoping to fix before I left.  I was then informed that they were “expediting my two weeks” and that I was going to no longer work for them.  I was allowed to work my shift but they took my keys at the end of the night.  My manager’s final remark was that I should have realized I was just another worker despite the supervisor role and that she hoped I learned my lesson about rocking the boat.

Since then, HR has refused to give me documentation on why I was released before my two weeks but has asked me to provide documentation of my complaint lists, prior emails to bosses about conditions, etc.  I have yet to do so.

I have also had half of town asking for me to fill out apps with them.  Part of me wants to keep fighting but I don’t even know where to start.  I’m ultimately glad to be out of there, but I feel bad for the workers who are still there.  Someone is going to get seriously hurt."

The other issue is that every 2/3 hours they want to know how many calls were made and the excuse as to why you didn’t meet the  5/6 calls an hour goal. We have to notify in an email when we go on break and when we come back, that seems outrageous.
My other concern is I’m paid under $16 and they’re over working us because we are backlogged. The issue seems as if to hire more people not make your workers do mandatory OT and 50+ hours a week. Am I lazy or those this seem as if I should find a new job? Money isn’t an issue I can afford to be without a job"
6,2024-02-15,COO thinks we have a Four-Day Onsite Requirement (It's 5),u/ChickenDenders,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1armqfm/coo_thinks_we_have_a_fourday_onsite_requirement/,antiwork,"My place of employment enacted a 5 Day RTO mandate about a year ago. 

Our CEO at the time, who is still ""in power"" within our own company structure, sent out a email detailing that everybody was expected to return back to office, five days a week, starting the following Monday. And that was that!

Now - we've recently been acquired by another company, for a few months now.

We just had our first joint ""Town Hall"" meeting, and the new COO repeatedly referenced a Four-Day onsite requirement. 

He took a pretty hard stance on the importance of coming to work onsite, ""if you aren't onsite per the requirements, you should be ejected from the company"" - but... For FOUR days a week. 

He was also pretty vocal about how highly he valued working from home on Fridays. How it lets you start your weekend sooner without the need to commute, allows him to spend more time with his family, all that stuff.

He didn't really explicitly state: ""This is the new policy, we all have to be onsite 4 days a week now"". Made it off as more of a ""don't ask don't tell"" kind of thing. But - as far as he knows, this was *already* the policy, so there wasn't much reason to try and declare anything.

I don't really know what to make of this, because - unless we get another ""official"" email that outlines 4 Days a Week as the new policy - I'm not sure anything will actually change. 

I'm just frustrated. Things were working so well when we could be remote. I work night shift IT Helpdesk, and there's really not reason to sit here staring at the wall for 40 hours a week. I can so easily do 90% of my job from home.

Bonus: My boss didn't even watch the Town Hall"

I am a 23 yr old college grad. For years I had been in retail/food service. 6 months ago, I got an office job as a medical receptionist for a big eye pharma (I work at a previously sold private practice now public) and it has been HELL

Since I graduated, my parents pushed me to get a ""big boy job"" and it has been so stressful and awful that I am greying. First, they started me off lower than the starting (because I did not notice), my district manager denied me a raise because I ""was doing more than just my job instead of fine tuning my skills"" (I had to because one of the opticians is an absolute imbecile). And they overall treat me as if I should do everything and anything except be the actual doc. More and more responsibility piled on and critiqued for less than 18/hr. So I am done. I am interviewing for retail positions - I miss being up and on the move. I despise scrubs, insurance, and sitting for 8+ hours (I work usually from 7-5:30). I despise not having time with my newlywed husband. I despise the way the older generations speak/stare at me as if I am not a person. I despise everything about this job.

I went to college, got a degree, and started my professional career working two different contract roles in creative communications. About two years ago I made the decision to accept my first corporate role as a social media professional. It was my dream job in theory. The salary jump was amazing and I really aligned with the values of the company. 

Now, almost 2 years later, it’s my biggest regret. I’ve become someone I almost don’t recognize. I lash out at my friends and family, I’m constantly stressed and overstimulated. Everything makes me feel overwhelmed. I cry multiple times a week, I have fits of rage, and I’m exhausted. I’m in the office three days a week and it gives me existential dread. 

Every day in the office is an absolute shit show and I never know what is coming my way. I’ve been talked about behind my back multiple times by the CMO. Our team has so many issues with communication and organization. I feel like I’m in high school. Everything is so unbelievably fake and hush hush and I’m astounded at everyone who just goes along with it and plays into it, meanwhile I think I’m looked at as crazy and mean because I’m just brutally honest and can’t act fake. Every day is breaking me more and more and I know I have to get out but the job market is so horrible. 

I feel like I’m waking up. My whole life I thought this was what the goal is but now that I’m in it I know I can’t do this for the rest of my life. The stress is killing me. I’ve taken a significant step back these last 6 months and I’ve stopped trying because my hard work got me absolutely nowhere but I’m still feeling like this environment is just NOT for me.

Some of the happiest times in my life was when I was working summers in college at an outdoor adventure center. I love the outdoors and would love to find a career that centers this.

3,2024-02-15,Gaslit by Executive Director and Supervisor,u/MiserableFox7960,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aropah/gaslit_by_executive_director_and_supervisor/,antiwork,"My wife worked for a non-profit organization that specializes in tutoring for low income families. They were working there for 6 years going into the 7th year and was feeling overwhelmed with onboarding their new direct supervisor. Prior to this, they were tasked with doing small projects and tasks to support their previous director, who moved away. During this time, my wife had not received the proper training and development, let alone any yearly and 6-month performance reviews for 3 years in her role as assistant director.

My wife’s mental health took a turn for the worse and is now thankfully seeking help, but was then placed on a performance improvement plan that she had to write herself and disclosed this to her direct supervisor and executive director. At every point in their meetings, the executive director laughed at everything she said, called this process “remedial” and repeatedly said that “this is no longer working for us…” essentially providing “feedback” and zero opportunity to actually bounce back. During the Performance improvement process, her direct supervisor even had the audacity to coach her on other roles outside of the organization, highlighting that they just wanted to get rid of her.

TLDR: Her executive director and direct supervisor did not follow HR protocols and created a hostile work environment and negatively impacted my wife’s mental health and affected her wellbeing with a process that they didn’t even want to do in the first place. They bullied her into making her own PIP, did not provide timely feedback and opportunity to grow, and did not follow their own organizational processes and procedures by not giving her a review while everyone had a review every year during this time.

Fast forward to a staff party that was changed to a “congratulations” and “best wishes” to my wife for her “new” endeavors that the executive director and direct supervisor had a hand in firing her for. While people were giving their best regards, the two of them did not wish her good luck and spun the story and were cruel in making it seem like my wife was going to be the one taking the lead, when in reality, she was not in control at all.

I want to write a letter to the board of the organization about this, but don’t know if it is my place.

Any support or advice would be appreciated!"
3,2024-02-15,How do you all feel about “tardiness”?,u/e72c,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aroq68/how_do_you_all_feel_about_tardiness/,antiwork,"Currently working as a Creative Director at a small family business with a large reach- I’m withheld real profit info, but I can safely estimate we’re hitting a few millions in gross profit.

I became the Creative Director a few months ago after the only other two people in my company’s executive team quit. Since then I’ve completely absorbed their roles and I’m making $33/hour, no paid vacation or sick days, and some holiday pay at a reduced rate. (Yes, I know I’m getting scammed. Im on the job hunt but I need to maintain this income until I have something lined up.) It’s just me and my two bosses (60F, 35M) running the entire company basically. 

Overall, I am hitting / succeeding at nearly every mark. I am single-handedly managing all marketing efforts (paid print and digital ads, eblasts, etc) and design production (ads, product labels, artwork, print and digital collateral, etc). There is no one underneath me, so im hardly a “director”, and I also have no assistance with my responsibilities. My work is consistently of high-quality, and is always to their pleasing. I am pleasant and respectful, and always dress professional. I have never missed a project deadline, and I will stay late whenever needed to finish projects with an urgent deadline. Just last week, my boss gave me the project of building a 40-slide, highly graphical presentation at 11am, and I stayed until 8:00pm to get the project done as he needed it for the next morning. I handle their personal projects, such as birthday party assets, Christmas cards, gifts, etc. 

My only flaw has been my tardiness. I am consistently showing up 10-15 minutes late for work. I have a 45 minute commute, and I work 8:30-5:00 M-F + a 30 minute unpaid lunch break (whether it’s taken or not). One of my bosses (M35) comes in at 8:30 every day, but leaves around 3pm. The other boss (F60) is more fluid- she comes in around 9am on the days she works and leaves anywhere between 12pm-3pm. I am expected to leave no earlier than 5pm- aside from the very rare occasions they have let me leave 30 minutes early, that is a firm rule. 

My boss had a meeting with me today where she stressed that this is unacceptable. I expressed that I am feeling a burnout from my schedule, and I don’t think it’s necessary for me to be in office a full 42 hours every week, and I would appreciate a lighter schedule (maybe knocking 30 minutes off each day). As is, I barely have 3 hours to myself to handle dinner, cleaning, and self care at the end of the night. When I’m here, I’m balancing the responsibilities of three roles. During our meeting she said, “Are you replaceable? Sure. But I don’t want to do that because I love our working relationship.” I’m on the verge of quitting every day, but that sentence nearly got me to commit. Namely because it’s entirely untrue. Overall, the conversation went okay and she wants to think on it. 

Anyways, I know it’s something I have to work on- but I just want to know if my bosses have any ground to stand on and how you all feel about the expectations of timeliness in general."

Call all the team leads in to a mandatory in person session (informed us the evening before it was scheduled that this was mandatory ) where we did group exercises with other team leads trying to come up with “What is our purpose”.

The great idea was that if we understood our purpose and enforced it, the employees will too and the outcome will be better performance.

I frequently arrive within a 3 minute variance window due to unpredictable traffic. Some days it’s a school bus slowing me down. Other days that school bus is nowhere to be seen and I just catch red lights. Some days I make excellent time and arrive a couple minutes early. But every day seems different despite leaving at the same time and taking the same route to work. 

They always say well just leave earlier. (Read: just devote more time out of your day to work than you already do) and it’s just funny to me. Why do I need to adjust my off work time to arrive 10 minutes early just so I can clock in perfectly on time. Is 1 minute of your time really worth 10 of mine? If you really think my job is so affected by 1 minute in the morning you’ll be astounded to find out how much time is wasted on average during an 8 hour shift. 

Rant over I guess. I know not everyone feels the same about this stuff so feel free to share perspectives. 1 minute just hasn’t ever affected my job or anyone else I work with in a negative way. Does anyone have a good reason why work should be so anal about time they barely pay you for?"

I work in a retail role for services, usually front desk checking customers in and out. Revenue had been lagging a bit since the holidays (which is a very busy time for us) and the owner discounted our packages by 10% and told us to push them until yesterday when the discount expired. 

Typically we sell between $30-40k in packages in a month in addition to other revenue streams. Our goal was $90k and we beat it by about $4k and handily out sold the other location that gets much better treatment than us (things like supplies, approved time off, experienced managers, etc). To reward our efforts and exceeding our lofty goal, we will be treated to a pizza party some time in the next week or so.

The thing is, we have already voted to unionize and the owner is completely stonewalling us. It's been 5 months and they have not budged on any meaningful issues, with plenty of inappropriate outbursts during negotiations such as ""This is bullshit"" and just laughing at demands we put forward. Also, they are using the union negotiations as an excuse to not give anyone their standard raises. 

This is ridiculous, we have already presented a petition from the staff for the owner to actually negotiate in good faith and are 100% ready to respond when they inevitably retaliate. I only wanted to stick it out for a full year before moving on to something better, but am prepared to walk if nothing changes."

So naturally, he decided to enforce a new policy that prohibits people from taking unpaid time off. Oh but it gets better, there's another new policy claiming that if employees want to use their vacation time they're required to request permission 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE. 

Thinking about calling out sick since your vacation request was denied, even though you've been saving PTO hours all year to enjoy a vacation with your family during the holidays? Well fuck you! You're now only allowed to accrue a maximum of 3.08 sick hours per pay period. Want to do the right thing and save your sick day hours so that you can take a day off if you fall ill? Sorry, you'll have to wait 1.5. to 2 months so you can accrue 8 hours of sick leave. 

&#x200B;

With all of that being said, there's only one logical explanation for the enforcement of these new policies. My employer seems to think we're living in the 19th century and that indentured servitude is still legal. How can I break the news to him that this is no longer the case?

They put me on a PIP, which I’d never heard of before, and when I saw it I realized it was nonsense - things that if true are obviously important like failing to follow office rules, meet deadlines and work consistent hours, but weren’t true at all and stuff I’d contested when my coworker complained about me. For context and background, I’ve never had such an issue before and it kills me that something says I’m a “bad performer” - I am the type to work extra hours and most weekends (once overnight for this position), nailed school/grad school, and my curse/monkey on my back always says I’m not good enough, so typically my issue is balance and relaxing (it’s a big issue!) not slacking or breaking rules. 

I’m not sure how to approach this effectively when applying for jobs, and could use some help. On principle I almost always default to being honest, but I’ve heard from others this is a mistake in this situation, and while I hate that, I don’t wanna go bankrupt because no one wants to risk hiring me if someone else said I suck.

I’ve read recently potential employers will know if you got fired for performance because of how it is “coded” in an HR system. Is this true? If so, can I view it to see too? Also, how should I approach this when interviewing? I don’t want to over share and scare people off, and I hate lying. Also for background I’m a white collar employee, something like finance.

During annual surveys a lack of transparency was mentioned by employees and this meeting was the company's response. They addressed employee pay including relation to regional cost....

But they made it quite clear that this was cost of labor NOT cost of living. This means they acquire information to determine how much labor costs in your region and that is how payscales are determined. Cost of living has nothing to do with how they set pay. So if living costs have gone up in the region you are in, but the market pay for your sector has not matched inflation, then guess what buddy, sucks to be you.

I see these factories bleed legions of people and somehow still run. Let me not forget to mention the forced swing shift some factories do. It's incredibly unhealthy physically and mentally. I feel like some factories don't want you to have a life. don't understand and, I wonder if anyone out there is having the same experience? Is this common?

I mean, I can kind of understand for those in WFH roles needing to touch base with colleagues/management at one extreme or be relentlessly annoyed several times a day by pushy managers on the other BUT I work for a bank and we're required to be on site every day. We are branch staff. Email is our tool, we have phones to ring eachother if needs be.

We recently had all systems nationwide upgraded to newer systems and now our main communications tool within it is Microsoft Teams. All well and good when it first launched in late 2023 for us. Zero calls affecting majority of staff. Cool chat features etc etc.

2024- not so much. There's pretty much calls about fvcking calls at this stage! -_- I had one of my weekly calls this evening with a bunch of experts in some department of some nature (pointless rubbish occupying time when I could be working in the branch to get out the door on time).

 My mic somehow refused to work even though I had actually prepped notes to discuss. There was a disgusting echo because someone kept forgetting to mute their goddamn mic. So I just opted to email them on afterwards what I attempted to say on the call, so they wouldn't think I was avoiding. 

Call ends. My manager comes in, ""are you not on a call?"". I said ""I'm just finished one"". 

""What about the next one?"". I got pretty pissy and remarked ""There's another one right after?"". There wasn't but it was poor scheduling apparently! I had shit to actually do in the office and not be stuck listening to Sophie tell us how we need to be doing xyz in a certain way...

It seems we're becoming a company of on site employees being forced to be Teams personalities with little to no experience of this type of communication on a daily basis. We will have a staff member act as chairperson for retail banking discussions starting Tuesday and this apparently rotates every week. I can sense the anxiety amongst my branch colleagues already.

They throw these random meetings into your calendar, pop you an email which blocks off valuable time to be continuing your work IN the workplace WITH customers or on customers work and NOT discussing/digesting some incoherent sales gibberish on a computer at 5pm!!!

It's seriously making me consider a swift departure! They're boring, put you on the spot when you're anxious/tired and just generally unproductive if you ask me. Managers are getting a poor look into branch work if they're relying on a webcam and audio mic to grasp the shit we're dealing with on frontlines.

Has anybody else had this obsession creep into their workplace as of late?

Apologies for rant!

TL:DR: Microsoft Teams being the latest weapon/obsession to chase down regular staff, force them to communicate remotely from an office environment on topics they have no interest in."

Now, keep in mind, I’ve never been trained properly on any of this. I just use the notes from the girl before me. This year, the IRS rolled out a new 1099 submission website called IRIS. It sucks. It was bogged down on the 26-31st of Jan and we tried to submit things but it kept freezing. 

I told our Controller and CFO that I was really struggling and they shrugged and told me to figure it out. I submitted the files at this point, I think, but now we have a bunch of vendors reaching out saying that we have the wrong W9 for a lot of them, and others are saying the amounts we filed are incorrect. 

I literally have nothing to do with inputting any of the info they are saying is incorrect, so that’s not on me. I’ve also never done a correction form, and with this new IRIS system, I’m in way over my head. I asked the Controller and CFO if they could assist and they told me to call the IRS 1-800 number. It was no help. We also have outside CPAs that do all of our other tax filings for us, but they don’t want to use them either.  

So I’m kinda just blindly changing numbers in our system and submitting a shitton of correction files with the IRS. We’ll see what happens. I don’t get paid enough for this shit and I’m using the ID verified login of our controller so it all comes back on him."

Well, turns out you can say anything about anything and it means nothing. Because they just announced mandatory RTO for everyone who lives near the head office. About half the company.

I have been on my team for about 2.5 years, so I am not new, but not as tenured as others. 

I have one co-worker who lacks nearly all self-awareness about what she says and how she says it. Over the last year or so there have been times when she will point out when something appears wrong, but it is in reality not wrong, in her mind it is black and white, and there is no gray. She will often stand on a pillar of self-righteousness, and blind faith she puts into ""knowing"" she is right, leaving no possibility that she could be wrong. I myself stand with the devil and will be his advocate because I want to make an informed decision and the best decision. 

In December we were reviewing some items for payroll and she says in our meeting that xyz is wrong, I pull up what she is talking about, it isn't wrong, and there is NO pay implication, but it just looks wrong to her. She does this in front of the rest of our team, by the end of that meeting, one team member was like, ""Wow! That was really rude."" Again there was no pay implications, and two others agreed with me.

This week we are looking at items for payroll. Again - xyz looks wrong, I pull up what she is talking about, and that xyz should not be done if they are at this status. But had she took the time to look at my notes she would have seen that this employee's boss reaches out explains that there is an emergency and that they need to be out longer. I entered PTO so that this guy would get a paycheck. Mind you what I did is something that WE ALL HAVE DONE for these kinds of situations. But in her mind, this has never happened, and we have always done it this way. 

I was not having it, I was like, we have all done this and have made exceptions but yet you sit here and want to tell me that I am wrong. No, this is just fine. My other co-worker was like I agree we have done this and there is nothing wrong here. Sometimes she has this way of gaslighting you into thinking that you are wrong, when in reality you aren't. Turns out she didn't like me aserting myself and being aggressive in my response with and upset her. 

She had a hand in a mistake that caused 10s of thousands of dollars in an overpayment to an employee, there are things that she does that are completely wrong. Do I drag her in meetings and call her out publicly? No. I tend to be discreet. Another thing that happened this week was that my boss started looking at the data of everything that my team does and she found that two of my co-workers have been pushing the shit work my way. Of course, no one admits this, but the data does not lie. (THAT IS A WHOLE OTHER POST)

I have no idea how to handle this and am slowly getting sick of it, I mean I did lash out this week. I love the company I work at and have easily let 3 opportunities pass by because I like where I am at to an extent.   

The next time this happens, I just want to be like, wow that was really rude. Just let that awkwardly hang out there.

I (54m) started working at a newish ""start-up"".  It was owned and run by four respected and knowledgeable owners.  I'd worked with them a couple of years earlier.  Over the course of six years I'd learned so much and became a valuable asset to them.  I actually said to myself, ""You'll retire here.""

Year six the owners decide to sell to a big, worldwide company/corporation.  I never, ever blamed the original four.  

It came time for the ""yearly reviews"".  When it was the original four It was usually a 20 minute bullsh*t session in their office, followed by what they were going to give you as a raise.  Sometimes it was over late lunch and beers.  Which was ALWAYS very generous. 

Corporation sends out emails to all that instruct all to fill out your evaluation.  Each section was scored om 0-4.  0 being a paint eater to, 4 the best of the best.  I was honest.  My attitude, I gave myself a 2.  I wasn't happy.  Get to the attendance section.  4, b*tces.  I hadn't missed a day of work in the six and a half years I'd been there. I fought thru gout flare ups in my feet to get there.  I had a manual.

Have my review and my new manager, whom I liked immensely and respected, gave it to me.  He flowed thru every section and sort of glided past the 3 the company gave me for attendance.  Insert guy blinking meme.  I stopped him and said, ""You literally cannot have better attendance for the last six years.  It's impossible.""  He replied that the company told him that they don't give 4s.  The f*ck?  

I had a new job 4 months later.  Went to a place with 12 employees. 

TLDR: F*ck the automated and impersonal review process.  
Sorry I was not brief."

Salary-wise it was a lateral move (purchasing/supply chain), but I felt like the quality of life changes would be worth it. I had to cash out my 401k to afford breaking my old lease, all the down payments on the new one, and all the moving expenses. When it was all said and done I didn’t have any money left, but I figured it would recover with time & I’d be happier here.

Fast forward to today where I am almost out of the hole financially & was suddenly fired by this new company for not getting up to speed quick enough & “not being a fit.”  I knew they were expecting a lot of me & had felt like I needed to learn fast, but it seemed like I was turning a corner and doing much better so this was difficult to take.  The worst part was my boss and I had a 1:1 2 hours prior where we discussed long term goals.

I don’t know how you can fire someone after just over 2 months on the job for asking too many questions/wanting to ensure I have a clear understanding, but now I am completely fucked financially as a result!  Praying I can break this lease and return home to save what I can…"

So, I started a new job right before Christmas. It is a sales job at an unnamed cell phone retailer. This cell phone retailer is one of the biggest in the country and things have gone from terrible to even worse ever since I started. almost half of my pay is commission based and there are a lot of sales goals expected of me.

lately, to fulfill these sales, goals and quotas, my job has instructed me to start including things such as protection plans (phone insurance) and early upgrade packages into people’s plans without informing them in order to meet the lofty and frankly ridiculous sales goal.

Last weekend, we had a holiday party that was set up about an hour from our work location. We are in the rental industry, so our manager decided to make it optional for anybody that wanted to attend the holiday party to hop into the van as she would be giving us a ride there in one of the company vehicles. 
There was about 7-8 of us that decided to go with her. 
We got to the party and it was not what we expected, it was advertised to be a really cool party but ended up being set up in a crowded arcade with cold noodles as our intended food. 
Some of my coworkers and I decided to leave the premises of the party and make our way to the mall.
As we got to the mall, I stayed behind to check some books at the bookstore while they made their way to a restaurant in the mall. 
The work holiday party ran from 4-7pm and the van was optional for anyone who wanted a ride back to our work location. 
Time flew and before we knew it, it was 6:50pm
I met with my coworkers at the parking lot to go back together but one of them had family in the area and suggested that we could stay with them and miss the courtesy work van. 
We texted our manager, letting her know that we would not take the van and she went crazy! 
She started calling us non-stop and texting us saying “you must come back in this van”
We eventually came back at 7:15, mostly because she was very insistent, that she needed to take us back to our work location.
On our way there, she was driving really fast and would not talk to us. 
When we got to our work location, she insisted on calling us an Uber if anybody was drunk. Nobody was drunk but because she started crying talking about drunk driving and the importance of being responsible, one of our other coworkers that didn’t go to the mall with us took the rest home but me. (I had a cold and emphasized that I could not drink due to my immune system already being really weak)
Again, nobody was drunk, but we only decided to comply because she started crying and we didn’t wanna make her any more upset.
Monday rolls around and I’m called into her office to tell her and HR about what happened and why did we leave the premises of an off the clock work party?
I basically just told them that we split up and we met back again and we went to go visit the mall blah blah blah…
I found this behavior really odd, but I thought that maybe HR wanted to know just to clarify any misunderstandings (even though we were off-the-clock)
She started interviewing everybody, coworkers that didn’t even attend the party, she started just interviewing everyone. She prohibited any of us to speak about that day, and made the excuse that there was on going investigation.
Today I was called into her office again with HR and asked to clarify because there had been some new stories come up and a video that surfaced (which is lies because nobody was recording)
I denied to speak or comment, and I said that next time I would be having a lawyer present or lawyer advice before continuing to speak about this.
They said that if I didn’t comply, that would be deemed as insubordinate, and I could be written up
What can I do to protect my rights as an employee?

Last year we gave out end of year bonuses. Apparently there were some errors in calculating the bonuses because all the employees were overpaid. The largest was around $15,000 and in total cost the company nearly $600,000. How this mistake was only found a week ago is beyond me. Of course employee morale has been at an all time high.

Unfortunately the CFO is pushing hard to make the employees pay back the mistake. She has the support of most of the C-level executives. Our legal counsel says we could do this. The only dissenting votes are the founder/CEO and the COO. Honestly I can pay that back if needed but I know it will kill morale and many employees won’t be able to pay it back.

I think it’s BS that a company can make a mistake then take it back. Some of these employees already spent the money and can’t get it back. Now I’m also worried about a promotion I’m expecting later in the year because the CTO overheard me saying how much BS this is and wasn’t happy I contradicted her.

Update: so we decided to let the employees keep the bonuses. It came down to whether the CEO who owns a majority of the company could make the decision without vote of the rest of the executives which the attorney agreed she can. We’re sending out a letter to all employees saying it was a mistake but we are choosing not to ask for it back. Apparently this is a cover our ass move in case everyone wonders why next year’s bonus’s are back to normal.

The CFO was suspended and will likely be fired. We’re still trying to determine why this all happened but having the CFO out of the picture will likely make it easier to figure out. "

They can just sit around making dumb videos that everyone likes and donates money to while me, a former retail worker, and employees are overworked, underpaid, and the higher management treats us like dogs.

I am 21F. The company I work at is a small business. It has no HR. No oversight. Whatever the owner says goes. I have worked there for two years. Since I graduated college in December I have been working full time and trying to get a promotion. I have had my pay increased once over the 2 years from 11 to 13 dollars an hour (a year ago). I used to do far less at the company, essentially I’ve recently had my responsibilities increased a lot and my pay has not increased at all.

Granted, I do receive tips for my work. The tips can be very good on good catering events, but they are not guaranteed. And wether or not you get put on good events or not is entirely up to the catering director. So if they are mad at you they can essentially dock your pay by refusing to schedule you for good events.

I talked to my boss about desiring a pay increase. I offered to train in anything I could to be more valuable. I now work full time, doing the work of a previous salary employee who left, and do quite a lot for the company. They’ve had me in a “shift lead in training” position for two months. I’ve been leading shift events with another leader and I’ve led 8+ events well with hardly any problems. Both my manager and my catering director say that I’m a great worker, they advocate for me to get paid more, they’ve told the owner that I’m a great shift lead, I haven’t had any problems with my coworkers (besides one who has been misbehaving with all the shift leads but he’s a separate issue). 

The owner talked to me two days ago and essentially said “you’ve been doing a great job but you aren’t there yet.” To paying me as a shift lead. So for now I guess I’m still “in training” even though I’m leading several events over the next few weeks. I went out with my manager/coworker to dinner tonight and she told me that our catering director got in an argument with the owner about me specifically. She said my catering director (a woman mind you) was asking why I haven’t been promoted why he hasn’t made me a lead and the owner said “she doesn’t smile at me.” Basically he gets a “bad vibe” from me because I don’t smile enough. Or I don’t greet him with enough enthusiasm. 

He has no idea how well I do with customers. He barely interacts with me when I’m working. He’s literally never seen me work an event or lead a shift. I’m just not extroverted enough or I don’t great him with a big smile enough. I’m a person with anxiety and I’m also neurodivergent so I know I can have weird mannerisms/ face reactions or patterns but I have never been anything but nice and respectful to him. In general I am anxious around him because he is extremely emotionally volatile and has fired people for very minor infractions. 

This feels like genuine sexism. I feel like I’m jumping through hoops that my male coworkers haven’t had to jump through. He offered to give a raise to my male coworker who literally NEVER SMILES, always calls out of work, and always leaves early. One of my male coworkers (the one with several disciplinary issues) is one of the highest paid workers there and only ever gets a slap on the wrist. I have been here two years. Every other worker is advocating for me. My managers are advocating for me. I’ve never had a disciplinary issue. I’m just not smiling enough. do

There is a large project started right before the previous person leaves and I offered to just help out with that project and more or less helped them out for two weeks on that project.

After this two weeks, I really decided I didn’t want to take over this job, and had my direct report explain that to our director.

So much that I feel like taking my own life everyday because it feels so much worse…I went through some horrible jobs in my past and it’s been 5-10 years and I still wake up in the middle of the night with fear, anger and helplessness. Thinking of all the yelling, belittling, teasing, sabotaging, illegal things I’ve encouraged working pink collar jobs. From managers writing chain emails making fun of my face and body to an operation manager hitting me up for a booty call at 3am and terminated at the end because they protected him all along. Thank goodness for Snapchat screenshots and text messages. I never thought working a job would be a bigger trauma to me than my cousin r**ping me! Every job I had felt humiliating, gut wrenching and miserable. 

At least I was able to be a survivor of SA and move on with my life. But It’s a huge red flag that I have flashbacks about the negative experiences I have at work… i have nightmares about work and my terrible coworkers who wear lanyards that say “kindness” around their neck. the worst part of all: my coworkers do not CARE. these hollow people are soulless and love ganging up on me. I try my hardest to be a good soul, but there is so much I can handle before I snap and a coworker gets hurt. How does a small job cause so much damage to a body and mind? When I look back at my SA, I see a thriving survivor. When I think about my toxic jobs, I feel like my world is falling apart."

I believe the term Neo-Feudalism is a more appropriate name that better encompasses the situation we are in. Here's the massively simplified take.

To increase profits, traditional capitalists are forced to either improve their offerings or cut their operating costs. Platform owners who own the store, neo-feudalists, charge their tenants rent for the opportunity to bring their products to the prospective consumer. When this rent is charged by market owners like Amazon, Varoufakis calls it cloud rent. The techno-feudalist charges rent much the same way a baron would have charged rent to their peasant surfs, but the problem is bigger than the cloud.

Enter the housing crisis. Homelessness is at and all time high in the US, at the same time interest rates and investment in residential property by commercial investors has exploded as well. Debt has been weaponized against working people just as young people are being blocked out of the housing market. The stage is set for the century to be dominated by this rent to live system of exploitation. Neo-Feudalism has effectively replaced traditional neo-liberal capitalism and has already shown to be a far more brutal and destructive system than its predecessor.

What do you think? Has capitalism mutated into something new?"

I applied to a small startup company to be a social media coordinator. Which sounded fine, especially since previous two part time jobs were as social media managers; however, the work environment here is just not for me. 

The work isn't well structured, the managers aren't the nicest people, I feel a little overworked with hardly any motivation and it's now affecting my self esteem a bit too. Since I'm not putting in great work, I just feel like an idiot sometimes. 

Hey everyone, I graduated last August in 2023, and got my first job out of college in January 2024, and man... it SUCKS. I applied to a small startup company to be a social media coordinator. This sounded fine, especially since my previous two part-time jobs were as social media managers; however, the work environment here is just not for me; I'm just having a really hard time transitioning. 

And the pay isn't great either. I'm getting paid $22/hr with no benefits, healthcare or anything. I wouldn't have accepted it, but hey, it's a job and I literally was not getting anything else. Heck, I'm still applying for other jobs right now and I'm still getting nothing back. 

I don't know, I feel hopeless about it. I feel like this job is the best thing that I'm gonna get (for a while at least) and I just have to tough it out but it's so hard. 

I think I'd just prefer to work remotely or to be in a more corporate job versus a startup so my work is more well-defined and structured. I really hate the structure of working at this startup, but again, no other options. 

Does anyone have any advice or just similar experiences? a part-time job remotely for even minimum wage while I do other things like build up my YouTube channel or something. Unfortunately, I just can't do that since I signed a six-month lease somewhere and I have to pay it off for another 4 months. But my mental health is just dying and I want to leave so badly, ugh.

TLDR: First job out of college sucks, and I want to leave but can't. Does anyone have any advice or just similar experiences?"

10,2024-02-16,Bad interview,u/On_Wife_support,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1as1w9q/bad_interview/,antiwork,"I had an interview today and when I asked the manager about what could be improved, this is the first time they responded that the business didn’t need improvement. I always have a mental list of three questions I use at the end of every interview and now I realize just how important my questions are to me. All of my previous jobs, my managers were aware of areas of improvement and actively working to improve those areas. Despite my current need for employment, I fear jumping into the wrong position. I’ve been in a precarious position for months and I don’t think it would be wise to jump on this opportunity if the manager isn’t competent enough to admit areas of improvement. I even pushed again by adding “well, everyone can use improvement” but he insisted nothing needed improvement. This is bold given the reviews online which are relatively mixed.

I will also add to the benefit of the doubt that he did say that he doesn’t usually conduct interviews. But, regardless, if he didn’t see a reason for improvement, it shows how out of touch management is with what their workers deal with on a daily basis. It just seemed like a red flag and I wasn’t sure if I was inferring correctly because I am Autistic. I don’t mean this in an attention seeking way but I want validation for my concerns.

It’s a niche issue that I struggle to discuss with my parents because they are boomers and pretty out of touch with the job market/climate. When I have brought up red flags at previous jobs with my parents, they are quick to take my manager’s side since they are doing me the favor of employing me. However, this feeling of owing a position loyalty or favors can be detrimental to me as a worker. It’s just gaslighting and manipulation (of course my parents would be immune because it’s the same tactics they have used in me in the past to make me feel I owed them for their generosity)

Sorry for rambling. I just wanted to get this off my chest"

Been working as a dental receptionist for 2 yrs now at this office, I know I'm the lowest paid among front staff even tho I've been here the longest. We always had dental benefits & recently they've added on medical

Dental benefits are completely covered for basic services (Cleanings, fillings, some extractions ect) I've always booked my appointments and pre booked my next ones, **never** had any issues 

Come in for my cleaning today in the AM & come back later in the PM for my shift, wondering when I pre booked my next one (I come every 3 months, plaque build up) all of my pre booked apps are gone and from the note, one of the owners wants my hygiene to be 6 months and not 3, I didn't have a exam from him today so I'm like...wtf??

I get pulled aside later and the dental plan is being changed, I'm no longer allowed to book my own appointments, it has to be for 6 months and not 3 & basically for cleanings everyone is to be put on a waiting list for when the hygiene coordinator can accommodate us, if possible. I was NEVER told this up until now. Mind you, I booked my next appointment in August, there's spots for people and I NEVER work Mondays, which is when I book my cleanings. Right now for cleanings, we're booking into July FFS, so I'll NEVER get in then unless its super short notice 

I knew as soon as they introduced medical they'd be messing with the dental benefits. I can deal with being talked down to like I'm stupid from some people here, the condescending tones, the sneakiness, the low wage, patients yelling at me and management/owners not being transparent but after this, I'm just done.

I was thinking of emailing the manager because I hate confrontation and quitting in person as I start hyperventilating with any conversation that's beyond a normal conversation. 

Should I tell my manager why I'm quitting and why I'm not giving my 2 weeks? I just feel really unwelcome there, I'm often ignored by my coworkers, and my last day consisted of my least favorite vet tech micromanaging me as usual. The general atmosphere of the place feels like high school: a lot of whispering, and coworkers talking shit about other coworkers. I had to complain to management about the newish assistant because he wasn't doing his job by just standing around all the time, which left me with most of the cleaning.

Today I was told that because I get headaches once every month, my manager has to take an action against me and inform the “health” team.

As this is a 24/7 facility I worked a 4A to 1P shift.

My boss...(lets call him J) has always been a bully and micromanaging asshole.  But because he had protection from HIS boss he got away with it.  The rumor is he was sleeping with her even though both were married.  He was one of these assholes that demands an immediate response no matter what.

Anyway.... due to my shift schedule I usually went to bed around 7pm in order to get up at 3am.  I mean, all you need is coffee for fast..lol.  I looked at my phone and realized he had sent an email at 10pm and demanded everybody respond because there was an event (not incident...big difference).  I get in to a write up on my desk and a post it demanding my signature.

This jackass had the balls to write me up for not responding to an email when I was asleep.

/sigh

No wonder this dept has the highest turnover in the entire company."

https://preview.redd.it/ht7a8j4lmyic1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=f47a70bd3c8543bbd98ffc3810912727595877a9

Why did school feel better than work?

In both, your freedom is restricted, and your life is regulated by others. Technically, you are more independent as an adult — and you even get paid. So why does it feel worse?

Because you used to have hope.

Recall your concerns as a student.

Yes, school is tough, and everyone tells you what to do. But at least you’re growing as a person.

Moreover, it will soon be over. All you have to do is graduate, and real life will begin. You’ll earn your own money, get your own place, decide your own bedtime, and decide who you hang out with. Independence and freedom await, which serve as the light at the end of the tunnel. These, of course, are false hopes. As you enter the workforce, you become more enslaved than ever — forced to choose between bullshit and starvation. And, above all, there is no end in sight.

School felt better because you lived on false hope. There was an end in sight, which gave you hope. In work life, you know this sh\*t will last forever.

This is why it feels so hopeless.

And why you have nothing to lose.

I'm starting a new job on Monday that I'm really dreading. I only took it because I was unemployed but looking through the handbook makes me question taking it.

This company also claims they can discipline you for discussing pay so I know they're slightly full of shit.

BUT, he says he wants to keep us in a Net 15 since we've done so much for the company. All we have to do is put a due date of no shorter than 15 days in the invoice. 

So I do that, send an invoice to accounts, and then on the 15th day I get no check. I send an email to accounts and they say I'm on net-30 terms. I reach out to the VP who says ""he'll take care of it"".

Was brought on after the office/general manager of 4 years had no/slow growth and higher employee turnover over in the last year. 

I completely revamped the system, inventory, audited P&L, changed pricing matrix’s, added legal verbiage on invoices and estimates, set up the company on multiple software platforms to gain more commercial business, uniform changes, process changes, etc.

They weren’t even charging taxes to customers correctly.. no disposal fees to cover our end removals etc. 

Had record profits and 41.67% increase in sales with the highest grossing profits per labor hour they have ever seen. 3 months into my employment we already surpassed last year’s profit. 

Had a tiff with the owners nephew on workflow changes he was switching every 48 hours and causing bottlenecking, time sucking and confusion, next morning didn’t even make it to clock in. Was terminated for “lack of respect” and they hired back the old office manager that ran it into the ground in the first place in less than 4 hours of me being told to leave the building.

5,2024-02-16,I don't know who needs to hear this but...,u/duckofyork11,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ascr9o/i_dont_know_who_needs_to_hear_this_but/,antiwork,"This is mostly applicable to white collar office jobs, but I'm sure some of this can be applicable everywhere.  I see a lot of stuff on here about people feeling stuck in rough job situations/ afraid to move on/ having trouble  finding work/ getting fired laid off by terrible bosses.  Sometimes this is all unavoidable and cant be foreseen and I get that.  Nor am I here to say this is ever your fault.  But I just thought I'd share some things here that I have found are super helpful in helping to get out of and avoid antiwork horror storries.

1.  ALWAYS have your resume up to date and handy.  You never know when you will need it or when a positive work opportunity may pop up.  And when you are depressed and stuck in a grind the last thing you need is that added disincentive of applying because you havent added your current job to your resume and you have to come up with your current work and achievements on the fly.

2. LinkedIn is 100% a necessary evil.  Keep it maintained and up to date even when you are comfortable.  Add people regularly, add skills, update your bio etc.  If you are doing this stuff when you arent looking you won'tbe worried someone is going to suspect when you actually are.  And again already being ready to look when you need to leave is a hige help mentally.

3.  Always know who your 3 references are, and keep and touch with them (at least a ""hey, how are you?"" email like once every 6 months) when you dont need them, so that it doesnt feel like you only contact them when you need things.

4.  Always start looking before you need to go.  If you start feeling the grind, realize your boss sucks, start seeing the signs of department ir company upheaval, boss starts talking to you like a pip may bein your future?  Listen to your gut and start looking. When you have a stable job you are in control of your job search.  You hold the cards.  You are the comodity.  You lose your job or are desperate you instantly lose that leverage even if its only leverage in your head.

5. Never feel like you owe any company anything.   If you feel weird about a job after 3 months who cares?  Start looking.

6.  With very few exceptions, never accept a counter offer.  Leave and dont look back.  It just breads resentment and the second they feel like you are no longer essential they will remember you tried to leave.

7. Recruiters are your friends... to a point.  I mean this to say that they are the best way to find a job usually.  Every job I have gotten has come through a recruiter.  Apply for jobs ofcourse, but engage with the linked in recruiters who contact you who arent cllearly scams.  Reach out to the big local recruiting firms in your region.  Be smart, avoid scams, dont trust the recruiters to protect you.  But they are the best tickets to jobs  So be nice to them and use them.

8. There is 0 downside to applying fo a job or talking to a recruiter.  Their is considerable downside to waiting too long to start looking.

9.  DO NOT BE MODEST and undersell your skills.  A little exageration is never bad.  Just make sure there are no strait lies on your resume and that you can do the job (or at least can learn it fast).  Most job descriptions nearly always overshoot on job requirements.  Dont let that disuade you if you get yhe gist and can do it.  That being said if they ask for a weakness give a real one that doesnt fel like a deal breaker as a thing you have struggled on in the past then describe a way in which you have worked to improve on it.


tldr always be ready to jobbsearch and it is never too early to start.  Screw loyalty.  Use recruiters."

Even though they have me working 40 hours a week in an office setting, I am classified as 1099 and as per my tax return a “non-employee”.  My compensation is $1500 every two weeks as a draw towards future commissions 

This is my first sales position out of school in a shitty and shady industry which has me totally disillusioned and disgusted with humanity.  I’m good at and have a talent for sales.  The industry and the company is the problem

The company is less than 20 people and only two or three years old which probably explains why my role is a lot more business development oriented.  It’s full cycle sales from prospect to close.  I can’t even begin to describe the lies from our company partners that go into these bullshit deals that end up falling apart in final review and not counting towards my commissions 

I didn’t go to work yesterday and today and as such am locked out of the company email because I did not keep my boss posted 

The reason I haven’t officially quit yet is because I am waiting to speak to a lawyer regarding the draw

I fear it is recoverable and I would owe them back the money even though I didn’t sign anything about that 

But they cannot have made me work for free for over six months at forty hours a week so I am confused ???

I guess they are shady and vicious people so I want to talk to a lawyer to be sure

I recently made a big, expensive move to start a  new job at a small, seemingly friendly clinic.  It’s in a different country with a different health system.  The job had promised they understood the challenges of making the shift and promised lots of support. 

Almost immediately things went wrong.  More responsibilities and call than discussed.  Was expected to be functioning at full capacity within a week with minimal training. Continual pressure to do more. Lack of equipment/broken equipment.  Annoyance if I asked questions etc…. Boss also loved to find me after work to rant about his day or his highly conservative political views. 

I gave it a couple of months and tried to talk to my supervisor and the clinic manager.  Everything I said was dismissed, ignored or we’d agree to something and they’d not stick to it.  It became clear nothing was going to get better.  

I knew it wouldn’t work for me longterm and that it would be hard to find a permanent replacement so I told my boss I wasn’t happy and while I was  not going anywhere right now he should look for my replacement. He said he needed as much time as I could give him and I said I’d work with him.

He came back to me a few days later and told me that he had found someone to cover for a few months and wanted me to leave with minimum legal notice (4 weeks). He then proceeded to tell me that it was a hard conversation for him to have, it cost a lot of money to recruit me and I was putting him in a really difficult position.   I pointed out the move was also expensive for me and he was putting me in a terrible position as a visa worker.  He dismissed that and insisted I’d be fine and that he was helping me.  He then also brought up a bunch of supposed patient complaints and job duties I wasn’t doing (which were never mentioned in the two months where I’ve asked for feedback).   Pointed out it was strange to only hear these things now and he didn’t really respond, than continued to insist that this would also be great for me.  I just shut the conversation down as quickly as possible at that point.  

The thing is, I will be fine.  My job is in high demand and I have great references, but I’ve never been fired before and it still feels really awful/confidence shaking and I’m still furious about the treatment I received. I’m also not feeling great about working for the next four weeks for this shithead.

I had NO IDEA how long it would take to, at the bare minimum, get an interview. Not even a real interview, a phone interview. It is just insane. So, eventually, a relative told me there were openings at a nursing home she works at, which wasn’t my ideal career but at this point I had no choice. I had bills to pay. I took the job as a CNA in memory care. I trained for 2 days, and was sent on my own after that despite never working in a nursing home, and still being told i’m training and getting paid a training rate. I was just training myself I guess? They had 3 staff members TOTAL, meaning there were only 1 or 2 CNA’s working per 14 patients. Some of which were 2 person assists. They had me working 4 12’s a week. By the third week, I was maxed out, I called in sick one day and said I was throwing up. I just don’t think I can do it anymore. Now it’s the day after calling in sick and not only was the manager texting me and calling me all day yesterday about “scheduling”, she is now texting and calling me today too. I answered her texts a few times but have ignored the calls. Today is a scheduled day off. Why is this happening? I am 90% sure i’m just going to tell her I can’t come in anymore because I just cannot do this. Any of it. She even told my relative to text me and tell her to have me call her. What could be so important??? Ugh. I have an associates degree, i’m 21, and i thought i was doing everything I could to be successful in life but apparently nothing matters. i am so frustrated"

14,2024-02-16,I think I’m being “quietly fired”,u/Meemoo10,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1asg9wr/i_think_im_being_quietly_fired/,antiwork,"Bit of context,

I’m a 21f working in an apprenticeship in the uk, I barely make 16K a year and work 40hr weeks with study time. When they hired me they knew I was coming in as an apprentice in a law firm, I had no previous experience in the area of law and I hadn’t been to university. I’ve been there just over a year and I’ve had 3 conversations with my boss about my “performance” 

When I started my apprenticeship last January I had no support physically setting it up, my supervisor was always late to meetings with my university and no one ever asks how I’ve been doing with my course (I’ve passed every exam with perfect feedback so far and had excellent marks from my law tutor and progress tutor) so on the study side I’m doing great.

In the office, I’ve been told I’m too slow at tasks, rushing tasks, messing things up, not making enough progress, not asking for enough help, asking for too much help, not communicating enough, getting into the office too early (start at 9, get in about 8.40) leave the office too late (finish at 5, a handful of times left at 5.15), not taking my full lunch break and not having enough initiative and taking on tasks I’m not asked to do (only example they gave was I was importing team emails into our files but everyone does that…also I would email before I import and tell them I’ve put it in the file). 

Many of the things they’ve told me seem like they just contradict each other, the way I dealt with it was I put in weekly meetings with my team leader and I put them in her calendar to look like she has arranged them (annoyingly but I sorted them) sometimes she doesn’t even bother to do them so I have to still ask for these meetings, I’ve also tried to get written feedback but it hardly ever happens. 

I’m really hating it. I hate my job because of how I feel. Before this job I have NEVER had a bad appraisal or pulled over to “have a word with”, I’ve literally tried so hard to get better and it’s like they don’t notice, I feel so micromanaged. I had a panic attack because I was the last one to leave the office today (at 5.03, haven’t left this late in about 4 months…), everything I do I feel like I’m gonna be written up for it again, I really don’t know what I’m doing wrong, I’ve tried speeding up and it’s wrong, I’ve tried taking my time and it’s wrong, I’ve tried asking for more work and it’s not given to me, I just don’t know how I can change their opinions of me. I’m the first apprentice they’ve had and I have even had comments from my law professors that they look unprofessional when they don’t show up with me. 

Forward onto today, we had someone come over to say a new trainee was starting, I’m panicking a little because no ones told me this, I’m starting to think they’re gonna fire me soon, I wanted to keep going until I finish this course ( I finish in November) but I feel like they’re going to fire me before then. I don’t even want to do law anymore I hate it now. 

Am I being fired? Please help I don’t know what to do "

Last year I was forced to move with a state with low pay in one of the worst job markets I had ever seen. I spent almost a year looking for work, and landed an OK ecommerce job paying making what I made 10 years ago. 

This is probably the most dysfunctional workplace I have ever seen - a $2m a year company run by two people, selling a sub par product mass produced in china with their logo on it. We do everything we can to keep your money and never do a return, warranty claim, or help you in any way. My daily work can be completed in 15-30 minutes and then I sit at my desk and pretend to work the rest of the day. 

The owner watches us on cameras in every room and calls into the office if we don't look busy enough. If this was a WFH job and I would be more inclined to give a shit, but since im forced into the office every day and spied on I really dont. Daily reports are written of every single thing I had done that day, and if it isnt long enough im going to have a talking to about ""making more work"", ""make me more money"", etc. The owners 'hustle grind' mindset is exhausting, and he refuses to innovate in any way. I have no set duties or daily tasks, im just told to find things to do.

I was hired as a graphic designer, and now I am the SEO manager, ads manager, shipping manager, customer service, truck loader, LTL shipper, etc. I essentially ran the company in \~2 months. To cut costs, he fired the cleaning crew ($100/month) so now we have to do that too. He comes up with half brained ideas constantly to ""make more money"" like opening a vape shop (totally unrelated to our current business besides its retail) or starting a trucking company (he actually did do this and its a complete mess). 

Once a week or so I am apply to maybe 50 jobs that I think I can do, averaging about 200 a month, I will get an interview every 3 months or so. The jobs in this city are awful and just like the one im at - hired to do A for $15 an hour, end up doing ABCDEFGHIJK for $15 an hour with no benefits. 

Sorry for the rant I needed to get this off my chest"

I can’t just disagree with her cause that has the possibility of me losing my job.

I started my job as a legal assistant 4 months ago. I have a BS in legal studies, and this is my first job in the legal field (not my first job out of school, I have several years of office admin work). I took a pay cut for this position because I really wanted to leave my previous office admin position and wanted to use my degree. The first 2 months were fine, didn’t love it and couldn’t see myself doing this long term, but they were fine. Im the newest LA/para at my firm. 2 months in, they fired our office admin. 2 days later, the whole office was sent an email with updated job responsibilities, and they absorbed ALL the admin responsibilities to me. On top of my LA work, I now do accounts payable, receivable, account balancing, reimbursements, deposits, cutting checks, etc. the whole thing. The worst parts are these: they didn’t have a meeting or clear communication with me informing me that this would happen, I found out about all my new responsibilities from the email at the same time as everyone else. They have also said at this time they’re not looking to hire a new admin, which means it’s all on me. Additionally, they did not raise my pay at all. I had already taken a pay cut for the LA position from my last job, but I had left an admin position cause I didn’t want to be an admin. I am now one again, ON TOP of all my LA responsibilities. They are also very strict about not allowing OT, so I have to get everything done in normal work week hours. 

My workload the last 4 weeks has caused me to lose my appetite, not be able to fall asleep at night, wake up in a panic 2-3x per night thinking about work the next day, and have dread about work 24/7. 

The pay seems so low to be performing 2 full  jobs, (45k in a decent sized city where the average 1 bedroom is $1500/mnth). 

I would give my two weeks right now, but to make matters worse, another LA quit the day after the admin was fired, so we now only have 2 full time LAs (including myself) and the other one got her entire workload when she quit. I would feel horrible if I quit and they dumped my workload on her, but I don’t know how much longer I can do this. I also feel like they put me in a terrible position by adding the responsibilities of another entire job onto me only 2 months in, and I feel so uncomfortable trying to leverage while being so new.

Am I being taken advantage of? Am I being too dramatic? Has anyone been in an uncomfortable position similar to this as a new hire?

I've been working at this place for about 1,5 years now, and all this time I  only had 3 days that I had to take off because I was ill, and for 2 of those I even found someone to cover for me. I covered for other people so many times, I stayed longer so many times if they needed me, I took extra shifts as well for people who call in sick every other week and shit like that. 

I worked my shifts when I had covid, I worked when I had flu, just because I knew there would be no one to cover and it would suck for my colleagues.

My manager's message with the schedule was that they know that it's not ideal for some and that it's just for one week. What bullshit.

The recruiter or boss will come to you and say we got you a salary  of $100,000 and present you this info.

What you need to realize is that $20,000 is that much the employer will not be giving you a raise on. So let's say the company employes 5,000 people and each of them get this $20,000 ""bump"" and at the end of the year the average raise was 3.5%. This company just saved 3.5 million in raises because they didn't have to give them on the ""bump"". This then compounds each year putting the savings even higher and higher.

It's just one more scheme to keep salaries as low as possible in the long run. "
16,2024-02-16,Boss scolded me in front of customers.

My schedule is when store opens (not BEFORE) so obviously we have to do our jobs around customers in aisles and que lines. When I’m in the warehouse, many times we have to dig/look for our products amongst pallets and pallets of items. So if my box is at the very bottom of a pallet, I have to move and find somewhere to put all the boxes above it in order to get to my box, then I have to put all the other boxes back onto the pallet. I also have to separate my boxes and plastics it’s wrapped in and squish them in their respective machines, sometimes there are other sockets doing the same and we have to wait.
 All these things add to my time working and I’m not ONLY putting things on shelves. I didn’t know how to tell her all that without sounding whiny so I blurted out something like, “I don’t know how to explain this without you being there to see it yourself, but there’s a lot to do”. She said “That’s why I said you should come in at 5am before people come in”. I said, “I can’t because that’s when I drop off my kids”. She knew that and it was in our texts, but I was tongue tied being put  on the spot so I didn’t say that part out loud. 
I think my supervisor felt bad. 
Anyway, this all took place in front of customers and I asked her about my pay problems (late, inconsistent and lower amount than calculated) and I got the distinct impression she was embarrassed I asked her that. She blamed it on the pay service we were using.

Has anyone else been offered a job on Indeed recently that involved processing packages from home that turned out to be a scam?

Last December I foolishly, foolishly accepted a position with a company based out of California that was offering what amounted to a dream job for me, and probably for many.

It was work-from-home, the pay was great, and the work looked interesting and something I could do. I was to receive packages from the major shipping companies at my home, inspect them and share the results of the inspection on the companies website, then wait for shipping orders from the company, and then ship the package off to a new destination after all of that.

Sound familiar? I accepted the job, I actually worked a probationary month for them, and I did in fact receive and process packages for the first two weeks. I signed a pretty legit-looking contract, gave them my banking info for getting paid, I even filled out a W8 form for taxes.

The only thing that really felt off about it at that point was that it felt too good to be true. There were a couple of other signs something was off looking back, but I was actually doing work, my supervisor on their website said I was doing great work, and I was 95% sure I had finally found a good job that I liked.

Then the packages arriving all but dried up the third week. I asked my supervisor if everything was okay, and she said not too worry, it was the slow time of the year being the reason the deliveries had slowed to a trickle, and that I was on salary so I needn't worry. 

Okay, sounds good.

For the last 2 weeks of my first month, I received just a handful of packages, and I asked again over that period 3 times if everything was okay and is this normal? Again my supervisor reassured me that it was the slow time and I was salaried, so again, okay I'll see this out.

I was to be paid by bank transfer at the end of my first 30 days. That day came and it was nearing 5pm local time and the transfer had not happened, so I contacted HR, Payroll, and my supervisor to ask if everything was okay?

HR wrote back within 30min saying Congratulations!, you passed your probationary month, and we are just reviewing your work stats over the next several days and will be in touch about a permanent position. This was really great to hear and made me relax quite a bit.

Payroll wrote back within 30min saying that my probationary payment had been released and to allow 3-5 business days for it to arrive. My supervisor got back to me about the same time confirming that she saw my pay had been processed in their system. 

Okay cool, this was a Friday so I can see I misunderstood about the 3-5 days so my pay will arrive next week some time.

But it never did. I waited the whole next week checking my account every few hours hoping to see the deposit. By Friday at noon, that being a full 5 business days, I wrote a very polite letter to HR, Payroll and my supervisor informing them that I still hadn't received payment and could somebody please provide some kind of paystub or record of transfer to prove to me at least that it was on its way?

They ghosted me. The CRM website I was using to do the job and interact with my supervisor went offline within TWO HOURS of my sending off my inquiry, and I never heard a single thing back from the company from that point forward. Never got paid. Even their phone number on their website went out of service by the following Monday. Completely ghosted me and I've not heard a thing since.

Now here's the thing that brought me here.

I've just received another VERY similar offer from a VERY similar company offering the exact same kind of work. Even their website looks eerily similar to the one for the company that ghosted me. Even the font and the layout of their correspondence looks the same, the contract they sent, all of their communication with me, the forms their sending me, and the job itself are very, very similar. 

Obviously huge alarm bells going off and I'm not going to take the job, but it really got me wondering if something similar has happened to anybody else?

I quit a real, paying job to take the fake job, and I'm pretty screwed because of that decision.

Work from home, pretty easy job. Stress is mostly from not making money. I am the sole provider for my family, including 2 young children. 

Applied to HUNDREDS of jobs and none are panning out. Husband is going back to school to get a job that pays for more than daycare. 

$90k and unemployed would last me a year with my current expenses. And NO I cannot decrease them, it’s bare minimum-  please be kind. 

Would you rather take $60k to settle and stay, risking termination if they get wild with the power? Or $100k and leave, risking the money running out (oh and no insurance coverage)?"

Hi Reddit community,

She's been doing this non stop since 5-6 months ago. 

I'm in a bit of a unique situation at work and could use some outside perspectives. My manager has a habit of checking in on me multiple times throughout the day, almost like clockwork. It starts with a ""good morning"" and an inquiry about my day right at 8 AM, followed by a check-in at 11 AM to see how things are going or what I'm up to. She then informs me about her lunch break and checks in again once she's back. There's another check-in at 2 PM, and then a ""goodbye"" at 4 PM.

I understand the importance of communication, especially since our team is currently short-staffed. I've taken on the responsibilities of the missing team member, ensuring all tasks are completed efficiently and to a high standard. I pride myself on my work and feel confident in my ability to manage my workload effectively.

However, these frequent check-ins have started to feel less like necessary updates and more like micromanagement. It's not that I don't appreciate her concern or the effort to stay connected, but I feel it's becoming a bit too much, impacting my focus and productivity.

Has anyone dealt with a similar issue? How did you approach the conversation with your manager? Any advice on how to express my need for a bit more autonomy without seeming ungrateful or dismissive of their management style?

Thank you for your insights and advice!"

Home of majestic rivers, beautiful scenery and enough meth heads to check your pockets. I work at a James Beard nominated restaurant. We are constantly packed and have.the absolute best team. FOH and BOH absolute slay at their jobs and every guest leaves feeling amazing. It's absolutely fantastic and makes us all love where we work. BUT, we get paid shit. Here in Portland, the cost of living is really fucked right now. Minimum wage is $15.45. The entire line makes $16 an hour. It's bad. We make the same as our dishwasher. I've been there just under one year, and for the past two months have been trying to get a raise. It's been excuses, but I came in and rocked it out because we love where we work. Finally, I was able to schedule a meeting with the owner, a local ""celebrity chef"". In this meeting I was fighting for the entire BOH to get a raise. Bump us to something reasonable. We work hard, are constantly coming in on days off for private parties, and know how much we are bringing in, due to a set coursed menu and knowing the books. During the meeting, the GM and myself were pleading our case of needing more money. Our GM is literally the best manager and person and we love him madly. The Chef scoffed it off and was smug. We've been working being sick, and after feeling disrespected in the meeting, I decided to leave and take a sick day and come back the following one. After I left, the owner told the entire BOH that we are ""unprofessional and don't deserve a raise. You answered a Poached ad and that's it"". Our entire BOH and FOH was pissed at the lack of compassion, professionalism and just over all shitty behavior by the owner/chef.

So today, the entire boh called in in solidarity. We shouldn't be berated on the regular when you are on of Portrland's best restaurants and do an amazing job. Estimating about $10,000 in lost sales today.

Hypothetically, we are going to get a call and tell us what's up.

Either way, I'm so proud of our entire team for not only being the best in the biz but also standing together for what is right and deserved. We aren't looking for a hand out. We are looking for common decency and a better pay.

That being said, PDX give me a holler if you are looking for staff. We have 5 people most likely leaving and all of us have a bonkers amount of experience, talent and passion.

2,2024-02-16,Seeking advice with senior exec with unprofessional behavior,u/fossi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aslqj0/seeking_advice_with_senior_exec_with/,antiwork,"There is an individual in the office, a senior finance executive at my place of employment, and I, merely a manager, unfortunately, sometimes have to work with him. It is worth noting that I do not directly report to him.

Additionally, I am an expatriate on a temporary assignment in another country, and most of the team members I work with, including him, are locals.

The issue is that for a few weeks now, this person has started to become very burdensome towards me, beginning in an in-person meeting where he started to question my way of thinking, calling it lazy and mockingly suggesting that I was lying when he asked if I had spoken to other people. The reality is that I have only been in this office for a few months and it was the first time I heard those people's names.

Part of the issue is that his department is responsible for sending us certain information, but he insists that it is our responsibility to generate this information when, for years, and as is the case in any company, it is information they are responsible for. The problem is that they are never on time and want to evade and share those responsibilities to avoid looking bad.

Anyway, a week later, he tells me that the meeting I convened to generate ideas on how to help them produce that information, obviously with the aim of working towards a shared goal that helps us all improve timing and minimize workload, was a disaster with no planning or sense.

After those two encounters, he has started sending nonsensical emails, putting pressure on me and trying to make me look bad, even ignoring my emails asking for his support on a task that falls under his responsibility.

I am thinking, and mind you, I never imagined I would come to this, about filing a complaint with human resources. He is obviously taking advantage of his position, his locality, and I even feel that because I am a foreigner or because of my nationality, he is acting this way towards me. The problem is that I will likely continue to work with him, and believe me, I am the most pacifistic person in the world, but it is too uncomfortable to have to endure his comments, even referencing me when I am not there, which my colleagues have told me about, questioning my work.

I have already raised this with my director, but it seems he has the same problem with him, so all he says is: ""Yes, I agree, I can't stand him either, he is like that with me as well and seems to take advantage of those with lower ranks, but with the local people and at his level, he obviously wants to look good.""

That's why I want to file a formal complaint, not anonymously, so there is a record if someday his actions cause me to look bad, even with my own vice president, since he always tries to get along with him. Or what do you recommend? I have wanted to speak to him directly, but he turns away from me, or I can't even imagine how burdensome he could also become there.

Honestly, I have never experienced anything like this; it is very disheartening because this assignment is a great opportunity for my career, but it is turning into a nightmare. And the worst thing that can happen to someone is for their work to be questioned without even knowing them or how they work.

What do you think, group?"

#CAUTION WALL OF TEXT












































I bust my ass for this place every time I work and they just shit all over me. They tell us to be proactive with noise complaints in security and to stop guests from being loud in their rooms after 10:30pm. I got a call about a noise complaint last weekend and I politely stopped it. However, the room that made the complaint was also being loud. Since I'm told I need to be proactive with these things, I also politely told him he also needed to quiet down a little bit. He said ok and apologized, and that was it. That night I got several noise complaints, several difficult groups as well. It was a busy night. So I come back today and get pulled into the office by our security director (the security managers boss). He told me I had a complaint from the gentleman who complained about the noise (who was also being loud) that said I **slammed on his door repeatedly, told him he was being a dick and that I told him to shut the fuck up.** He then sat in the lobby at the lodge for two hours just to make sure he wasnt going to be ""wrongly accused of anything further"" (director literally admitted this was petty). According to the director, his ""investigation"" fully confirms I did this because apparently according to ""several"" employees I bragged about how I am ""aggressive"" to guests and there's camera footage of the guy sitting in the lobby for two hours. I never once got nasty with this dude, and my entire time here I received next to no training on anything, and I basically trained  myself on many things like this, including on how to handle loud guests after quiet hours. When we talked that night, I informed him politely that we have a warning system (1st warning verbal 2nd warning comp fee 3rd discharge off property) which I was **vaguely trained to inform guests and follow through with from the get go.** That apparently pissed him off too, and according to the director, we don't even do comp fees, even though I was told by the old manager we did. In fact he still talks about comp fees (the old manager stepped down and is now a normal guard. He's still here.) Like he literally told me we charge the room choosing to be loud after one warning in order to compensate whoever complained with a free stay. Apparently though, that's not even a thing. **I've been here almost a year and I'm just now being told this.** Also, it goes without saying I have never once bragged about ""being aggressive"" to anyone. I've made really obvious jokes with others about it but we were all joking. I never once thought ""put my boot up that guys ass"" would be taken literally. When asked if I remember that gentleman, I leaned back in my chair quietly, crossed my arms and focused on a filing cabinet while I tried to remember, because again, a lot happened that night. Apparently according to the director, **this was a sign of me being aggressive with him, and was further proof I did what I was accused of.** Also, it was unreasonable to believe someone who made a noise complaint would themselves also be loud. Like this was a totally foreign concept to my department director. I told him this was ridiculous because I am being punished over something I didnt even recieve proper training for. He also said he ""knew for a fact"" that I received one on one training for 2 weeks. I called him on that. I'm only part time so I'm only ever at work 2 days, Friday and Saturday, due to my availability, and I spent 2 days learning absolutely nothing from the old manager besides scan point locations and the warning system we utilize for loud guests after 10:30; then I spent two days learning not to get lost with another officer who showed me briefly where to go (its a huge resort with 2 properties separated by a 20ish minute drive) and another 2 days with an officer who taught me nothing and couldn't answer my questions, who then just fucking vanished and never came to work again. He was supposed to continue training me. My boss at the time asked if I was comfortable working alone even though I was supposed to be trained further. I told him no, but he ignored that and scheduled me to be alone going forward. I was never trained in the ""ideal"" treetops method for handling noise complaints. I've always just politely redirected them, and apparently I'm supposed to be extremely detailed in these interactions via our apps reporting system which I was never taught how to use. I was never taught first aid or CPR either, and because of that I watched someone die in one of our restaurants. Still haven't been trained and that happened back in September. I was never taught how to change door locks, program door locks, code keycards and fobs, how to operate their camera network, how to activate the gas pump for the security vehicle, still haven't been trained on how to delete EPS codes and add users, I was never introduced to the higher ups I NEED to know in case shit went down, so I have no idea who they are or what they do in the security phone contacts, I still haven't been trained on how to operate the new pool filtration system to safely fill water when its low and I'm expected to do so anyway and when I asked about it I received very basic very minimal instructions and it WASNT even from my boss it was the head of building maintainance. I was never shown where all the extra rarily used keys are or what they go to, I still haven't been trained on how to cut keys, I was never shown how to swap out batteries from our lock sensors, or how to operate any of our EPS systems. I literally had to teach myself almost all of these things up to and including **noise complaint interactions**, and the director has the audacity to sit there and blame me for some of these things I'm not trained in because I need to ""ask questions"". The thing is I have, I had to  learn shit nobody showed me and 9 times out of 10 I just get hit with an ""I don't know"" whenever I asked questions. The guy left a day early and blamed me for it so I got written up (I refused to sign it),  and if I get another complaint I'm fired. So fuck this place its such fucking bullshit and I can't do anything about it. This is absolutely ridiculous.....I did my fucking job, and they didn't like it after it cost them money since they chose to refund this guy. God I'm so pissed right now. I told him they're just mad that doing my job cost the company money and they didn't like it so suddenly its ""wrong"" how I handled it.

As of this year minimal wage in my country got raised significantly enough to make my base salary below it. So I, as well as many employees would get a nice raise.

Note - my salary, as well as all of employees consist of base and commission. 

In the first week of this year we got a lovely email - this year was so far the best in our history, biggest profits and we are ahead of our competition to the point we are thriving and they have money problems. This year we want to give you more money, but not as a raise of the base salary but a raise of bonuses and commissions. - with those raises attached. 

Looks not to bad in paper, a raise is a raise, right? 

Nope.

If we didn't get enough commission to be above minimum wage our company would just match our salary to the minimum needed by law. Well, to be below it, you would need to not work for most of the month, but still first hundred bucks in commission would be work just to meet the minimum. That sucks. What else sucks were the raises. They would benefit only about 10% of the best earners compared to just raising base salary like it was done every year. And commissions fluctuate during a year. They are a bit bigger in slow months and a bit lower during busy months, so we can earn basically the same during whole year. They are not set in stone, so what's stopping them from lowering them later? Enough to lower all wages to last year lvl? 

People were not happy, many left the company. Many sent not happy mails to people in charge. 

What's the outcome? 

About 300 bucks raise to the base (monthly) and commissions still raised compared to the last year. 

Group up, work as a team, no company can funcion on managers and ceos only.

I had previously worked on a flyer for social media, thinking that is what she (lady who said we're like a family here four months prior) was referring to and I said ""okay, I'd like to rework it because I don't really care for how it looks as a print out."" She seemed put off slightly but she is often anxious and hard to read so I ignored it. I stayed 30 minutes past time to finish it as it was needed for tomorrow morning.

After it was finished the next day I continued work as normal and noticed a flyer for the same job posting was printed out on the counter. This was upsetting as it looked quite nice and I did not understand why someone else would duplicate my work, double inefficiency.

While I was finishing up this woman was pissed off and yelled in our group (Team of 6 plus a ""therapist"") ""That is not what happened! When you said you were going to redo the work it me very uneasy."" I asked, ""why?"" Still shocked that she was suddenly yelling.

She angrily replied, ""If I have a problem with someone I will bring it up privately and not in a public setting like this. This is highly inappropriate!"" I replied back, ""what are you talking about!? I had no idea this other coworker even made this thing! I wouldn't have redone the work if I had known it existed!"" 

I apologized for making her uncomfortable and couldn't believe what the hell was happening.

This teamwork meeting had basically just begun and my heart was pounding and I felt tears coming on. I got up and left at that point. They were surprised I was leaving. This woman had the gall to continue on, ""I just really dislike conflict..."" and the lie she said about coming to someone privately if there's a problem bothered me so deeply. Clearly she doesn't because I had no effing clue that a problem even existed.

I sat in the bathroom for about 20 minute before accepting I was going to leave for the day because fuck that noise. We only had two hours left anyways, I'll burn through my PTO. I couldn't stop sobbing once I was back in my car. I waited too long because both her and the director walked up to my car window. My director is a sweet heart and said take as long as I need and I'm welcome back in when I'm ready.

I did. I came back, therapist thanked me for coming back. That woman looked all calm and composed again and tried to revisit what happened. I have no clue what she was going to say but I can only assume it was to save face in front of the group. She took the hint, thank God, and did not proceed.

I really don't want to quit because it's a good job, but holy shit.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Brought up role clarity and preventing work duplication, got told I was an asshole and I had better silently harbor resentment rather than talk about my problems..."

3,2024-02-16,Narcissistic Boss,u/FinalDevelopment3592,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1asp127/narcissistic_boss/,antiwork,"I am on a team with 4 other people. We all have a boss that we report to that is in a VP position. He isn’t respected by any other departments and likes to tell the president of the company on people that disagree or challenge him. The president of the company no longer wants anyone in the company to come to him to complain about my boss but allows my boss to complain about everyone else. 

He always calling me on teams to tell me that he’s tired of the bullshit and the internal/external drama (even though he creates it because he treats everyone like shit). He would call me daily for hours just to vent about the lack of respect in the office and how he has personal issues with people. I use to say to him “you should have conversations with these people direct with your feelings” and he’d reply “there is no point”.  

Lately I’ve been distancing myself from him because I don’t want anything to do with his negativity anymore. I’m a sales person,  not a daily therapist. 

 Since I started, I’ve been big on creating team strategies and business development plans to help us reach our team goals. My boss told me “thanks for the effort but we will never use these. It’s too much effort and we can train people to utilize these tools” so I took my files off of share point. He yelled at me to put them back on sharepoint a few days later because a meeting with the investors was coming up and he didn’t have time to create a strategy.

I put the files back on sharepoint. 

Yesterday he told me he was going to promote me to Sales Director soon.

 Today he told me that he’s going to hire a “powerhouse” as the sales director instead and when I asked “why?” He replied word for word (I have it in teams writing) “ He is a personal friend and someone that I know will not be influenced by the internal/external bullshit. Someone willing to take on a challenge. Invest in a time and effort and order put together the best action plan strategy” 

I can’t help but feel like he intentionally got my hopes up just to upset me because that is the type of person he is. 

Do I have a right to be upset? I’m not sure if there is any action I could take."

Did great for the initial interview, then they wanted a tech interview which I’d never done before. I was told it’d be Microsoft suite and they mentioned some programs. Sure enough none of what was mentioned was on the tech test. I couldn’t concentrate and couldn’t think straight because the person doing my interview was very patronizing and nitpicking every little thing.  I was trying to read and process what I was seeing going through the TONS of files and it wasn’t fast enough for the person so they just started talking to me as if I was dumb. Criticizing my typing, my explanation for things because it wasn’t making sense to them. The other interviewer was much friendlier and seemed to like me more. And understand my more abstract way of processing information. I worked in the same field as the interviewer who seemed more opened to me and they mentioned the part time person also worked in the field and I said “maybe I know” them because it’s a small industry and the rude interviewer said “well do you two know each other?” referring to me and the other interviewer So snarky for no reason 

They haven’t had anyone in the position full time since 2020 because people keep quitting because it’s overwhelming the company said. 

I feel like entry level jobs shouldn’t require so much pressure during interviews. 

You didnt assess my competence to do the job you just put me under pressure in a scenario where I don’t have the security of having the job so it doesn’t reflect my performance accurately because I’m so focused on getting the job VS showing what I’m capable of. "

Started on the 30th and worked a bit in July until things just fell off. Didn't get put on the schedule till August and whenever I checked the schedule it was mainly the managers working all week with maybe 1 or 2 employees sprinkled in once a week. Including me. Most of the time I wasn't even on there. 

It was infuriating and a horrible place to work at I tell you. My paychecks only came up to 74$ and Panera paid me more than that. (I made up to about 400+ working there if only for a short while.) I'm 19 and still living with my relatives so money wasn't much of an issue but it was annoying.

Besides all that, whenever I went it was ALWAYS miserable. I'm disabled and got some horrible flat feet that were demolished even further by my joyous experiences at Panera, so walking and standing was an issue. My co workers were really snooty too despite...working at a Hot Topic. 

But that's not the issue here. The issue was when I called to see if they fired me since I hadn't seen the group chat light up in a while. I told my mother and grandmother that I was very sure they fired me and didn't tell me but they told me to call just in case. So I did. The response I get is insane. ""Yeah the SEASONAL positions are over with so we dissolved all of them, we're opening applications in October though!"" I politely said ""No thank you!"" and hung up. The confusion that I shared with my mom and grandmother was quite funny to say the least. 

So they let me go despite not being a seasonal employee. I applied to a position that didn't even have the word seasonal in it. They didn't even tell me that they had let me go either. I wasn't even upset I was really just baffled. So I filed for unemployment the next day and that's my current obstacle at the moment. 

I suppose I'll continue going into my VO career and continue art like how I planned but wow. Arguably the worst job I have ever had. Maybe next time I'll listen to some random woman saying that Hot Topic isn't a job because it really isn't."
4,2024-02-16,Sleepover shifts are a rip off.,u/Nervardia,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1asq71z/sleepover_shifts_are_a_rip_off/,antiwork,"I work in disabilities.

There's a type of shift in my industry called a sleepover. You start at a time in the afternoon. It can vary. The earliest I've seen is 2pm but sometimes it can start at 5pm.

You work until 10pm, then you go to sleep, and wake up at 6am. You get paid 3 hours, but if you have to get up after midnight for any reason, you get paid for an hour, even if it is for 5 minutes. At 6am, you get up with your clients and you work for at least 2 hours, usually 3, but I've seen up to 10am.

The longest sleepover shift I've seen is 2pm to 10am. That's 20 hours.

The thing that gets me is they make you work for at least 2 hours after already being at work for 15. One company I worked for also said that the morning of the sleepover shift was legally considered your day off. So they could legally make you work your day off because ""you were finishing your shift."" And trust me, they used that loophole to their advantage and would routinely deny people their RDOs. They were fulfilling their legal obligations to give their workers 4 days off a fortnight, but you better believe that 2 of those days followed a sleepover.

It's such bullshit. I hate that shift type, especially as a person with insomnia. I never get to sleep before 3am on a sleepover. If you're not going to give us full pay, at least let us go home at 6am."

I also don’t qualify for any kind of long term leave, especially because I haven’t been at this job for a full year yet.

I was not ready to come back to work. My entire life has changed suddenly and unexpectedly (my mom was very young so it’s all still a shock), and I’m not sure how I can get back to work. It all feels so unimportant after experiencing the worst possible thing that could happen to me.

Im in a vicious cycle of trying to work, feeling too exhausted to actually get things done, then falling behind and feeling guilty for not being productive. Im not sure how much longer I can handle it.

My options are either use up all of my sick/vacation time in one go or decrease my appointment to work part time (also slashing my salary which I can’t afford to do right now). 

Even my therapist said something along the lines of “the corporate world was not designed to be human.” Knowing that there isn’t much I can do and I have to just manage work while enduring the hardest thing I could imagine is just sucking the life out of me.

Forcing credit cards onto people already in debt, getting harassed by customers, and dealing with annoying management. 

I honestly don’t like working in retail banking. A lot of things feel so unethical to me. I feel like we take advantage of people. Tbh, I usually will take advantage of old people and try to get them to sign up for these credit cards and so on. Even new immigrants as well, since they usually don’t know much. 

Plus let’s not talk about the annoying customers. I had a customer threaten to slap me and my main manager found out. He said “you should’ve worded it differently.” Like wtf, if someone is threatening to slap me, I think that’s their problem, not mine. They take customer service way tooo serious. 

I literally had a customer racially harass me once, I even made a post about it recently. The company didn’t do shit. My manager said nothing will happen because the bank sees her as a valuable customer. That was literally my tipping point where I realized these companies don’t give a shit about you, even when you get harassed. 

Plus why do they expect me to work like a machine? My supervisor was telling me to work faster with my transactions, like do you want me to rush a 100k transaction and potentially end up making a mistake?

5,2024-02-17,Early career decision: better manager vs better project,u/notA_programmers,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aswmxe/early_career_decision_better_manager_vs_better/,antiwork,"Career decision in early career 

TLDR:
Need to choose between two teams: A / B
A: 
People manager that will nurture youngsters, will give a lot of support, opportunities and guidance. Also the job content interests me slightly more.

B:
Can involve in flagship project which is a good chance to learn a lot & meet a lot of people. The exposure will be great, applicable in the future and will be a great foundation for my career. Still rotating here and enjoying the work & can feel the personal growth.


I am in a Graduate a.k.a Management Associate Program in the bank under technology dept and it would soon come to an end, so I would need to choose which team I would pick to commit to after all the rotations. After some consideration, I have shortlisted two final choices but I still struggle to get a final decision.

Team A(People Manager & personal interest)
- The manager is very nice and really care about you. I will get lots of support and guidance if i follow him
- Will think of you when there are opp. and is likely to highlight your achievements to the management, so more chance to be known by the seniors
- Personally more interested in the job content

Negative:
- Missed out the opp. to work on the biggest project, project with that scale rarely happens
- dependant on the manager? What if the manager leaves the bank?


Team B(Flagship project & learning opp.)
- In charge of the biggest project( modernising the whole backend systems) Involves almost every part of the bank and end to end study of business flow, systems etc. 
- can involve in end to end delivery of the project that last for years and will gain huge exposure
- will force you to grow learn from the project
- the manager used to be a CIO somewhere else, So very experienced but less caring type. 
- still rotating here, also enjoying the job here and can feel my growth
- you can learn what is needed in team A but not vice versa 

Negative:
- less attention to teammates. Need to grow on your own
- more tough cuz very challenging project (but i like how it sounds haha)

My thought is since im still in a very early stage of my career, as much as i like Team A more( just slightly) more like enjoying both, it might be best for me to experience bigger projects so i can learn more and have a good foundation to move forward. 

Thanks for reading and your advice in advance! "

My job was constantly making me sick due to the lack of windows and ventilation where we worked combined with at least one person coming in sick just about every week. We also always had chemical fumes throughout the building that I'm pretty sure weakened my lungs in the almost two years I was there. Because of this, I called out a lot. 

Boss comes up to me and says ""we'll need to have a talk"" Friday evening then immediately runs out of the door before I could ask any follow up questions. I end up stewing on it the whole weekend, literally coming in on Monday with a stomach ache from stress. During the day, I ask if he wants to talk yet. He says ""later"". At the end of the day, I ask again. He says ""tomorrow"". 

I'm freaking out at this point and tell him that this is stressful and whatever it is, please talk to me now. He just keeps repeating ""tomorrow"" like I'm a child and since I'm on the verge of angry tears, I drop it. Then I took down everything on my desk because if I was getting fired, I wanted to leave asap. 

The next day he calls me in and tells me that it's nothing bad, but immediately starts going off about how I have the worst attendance in history of the company (he has no access to that). Then right after he said that, he talks about how hard I work, so he convinced the upper management to give me a 50 cent raise. If I was good, I could even get a dollar by next year. He made it sound like he was doing me a huge favor, and I guess it was kind of one since I wasn't getting fired and none of my coworkers got raises? 

Anyways, the whole thing had pissed me off immensely and the raise didn't help. I also was on the verge of leaving for other reasons, so I quit soon after and moved states. Also haven't been sick since."

Since I was 16 and started working. I have a post on a alt that got down votes to hell because I had a question about the correlation between easing minimum wage and inflationary as while I support higher pay I wasn’t sure how that wouldn’t effect inflation. I did learn not from that post. However why stood out was I didn’t get downvoted for my ignorance like you might expect from Reddit. I was down voted because this isn’t a works rights sub it’s a “Anti Work” sub. As in abolish working at all. However I’ve seen a increasing amount of posts that are calling for workers rights and ending up at the top of the sub. This was a problem when the ahem “Interview” happened. That’s made this sub loose alot of people now the same thing is happening and I think it’s time for a actual answer from the community. Is this a “No more work for anyone ever” or a “Workers rights” sub. Yes I’ve read the fucking description but when the actions of the sub don’t follow that then there’s confusion like what happened with ahem the “Interview”

I was asked to work midnight shift 02/17/24 from 10p-6a. Well, they moved the schedule around and the person coming in at 6a has now called off and there is an open shift and no one to relieve me. 

My boss told me “you have to stay and cover the jurisdiction”. I told him that it wasn’t my issue as my resignation was accepted and my last shift ends at 6am. Is there any issue that I would run into if I just left and had the state police cover my area? I’ve looked all over but haven’t found an answer. 

My boss is ghosting me and they wonder why I’m leaving the force….. 

TL/DR: Agreed to work 1 extra shift to help my police department out. Someone called off and now I’m told I will be forced into another shift after my resignation was already accepted."

Only when ready will I admit that this is why I left corporate America. When I realized that not only are my bosses infinitely sadder than the rest of us, but also that they clearly use the catch-22 of management to create microcults within an office environment.

I'm in the UK, It's my turn and with a months notice with my company is requesting everyone to return to a 2 day week. They have just refurbished the office to make it a hot desking-hybrid model but by the number of employees per desk space it's going to be a logistical nightmare.

This came after the announcement of no bonuses because of external factors in the industry, not our fault. Their excuses were new joiners not feeling welcomed when they are in the office, cross teams not working together. I consider these corporate lies. People have been welcoming and travelled in the office with the newcomers. Cross team communication problems exist in the office as well as remotely. In my eyes it's lessened by remote working. I'm pretty sure everyone in the company hated the announcement as everyone I spoke to had the same opinion.

While remote working I can drop and pick up my kid from school. I live 1.5 hours away by train on a good day and easily 3+ hours commute per day, not considering all the train cancellations, delays and strikes. The metal health I have to deal with every journey plus the cost which I don't have the budget anymore.

I guess with the backlash from everyone the executives are being a little flexible with the new mandate as the deadline to be in the office won't be enforced YET. I'm emailing with an executive and his last response is I should still try to be in the office for 2 days after the school drop off and before the picks up. This is unbelievable! I will be in the office for a few hours basically doing little work for the day and will definitely social with my colleagues.

What choices do I have?

- Ignore the mandate and continue to be productive remotely, saving my mental health from commuting and money. I'm not sure what will come of this. Disaplinary? Then be redundant? I'm happy to take the redundancy pay.

- Look for another job that better suits me.

- Suck it up and comply until there's 3, 4 and 5 day week."

[Photo by Loïc Fürhoff on Unsplash.](https://preview.redd.it/2ycp9flzv4jc1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a9e902a623fd4bc39525e9e308b1819ba446c1d)

We’re commonly told that we are free.

In actuality, only a few of us are. Beyond what’s necessary, we should be free to do what we want. But, this isn’t the case: most of us must work more than required — while some don’t have to work at all. The former are enslaved, and the others are more free than they should be.

This makes you wonder: how many wage slaves are there? 

Answer: 99.2% of humanity.

\---------------------------------------------------------------

To be in good health, you need a living income.

The average living income in the USA was $26,421 per person in 2019.¹ You can earn slightly more than this with $1 million (USD) in net assets — assuming a low-risk ROI of 3% per year.

In other words, as a millionaire, you can acquire what you need without lifting a finger. At most, you need to pop the champagne as you check your bank statement. In 2022, only 0.8% of the world’s population had this kind of wealth,² and if we assume that the US living income applied worldwide, then this is the fraction of humanity that didn’t have to work to survive.³

In other words, **only about 0.8% of humans are truly free to do what they want**. The rest of us must not only do the work on their behalf — we are additionally forced to do bullshit to survive. The game makes them free and enslaves us through artificial survival.

Meanwhile, we are told this is the best game there is.

Don’t let them fool you.

\---------------------------------------------------------------

# Footnotes

¹The average US living wage ($26,421 per person per year, in 2019) was calculated by summing the living wage of a single individual multiplied by the state population, and then dividing by the total population. The original source of the living wage data is \[1\], but was downloaded 26 August 2022 from [https://public.knoema.com/uombotf/living-wage-by-county-in-u-s](https://public.knoema.com/uombotf/living-wage-by-county-in-u-s) (where the data is behind a paywall). The variable used was the living wage of a single adult, specified for each US state in units of US dollars per hour. This was assumed to apply to every individual in the population, making it a conservative estimate that neglects that people who live together have lower living costs. (In other words, it neglects economies of scale of consumption.)

²According to Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Report, there were 59,391 million USD-millionaires in the world in 2022.\[2\] Meanwhile, the world’s population was 7,951,150 million in the year 2022.\[3\] Consequently, approximately 0.75% of the world’s population were USD-millionaires in the world in 2022.

³This is a rough estimate. The USA is comparatively an expensive country to live in, which means that we underestimate the number of people who can passively earn what they need.

153,2024-02-17,Return-to-office is farce and the cracks are starting to show,u/UsualStrength,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1at24aj/returntooffice_is_farce_and_the_cracks_are/,antiwork,"
At least at the company I work for. I’m a senior-level technology worker at a Fortune 100. As far as moving from a remote model to a hybrid model, I think the company has fared better than most of the competition in terms of execution. It’s still unpopular with everyone naturally since there does not seem to be evidence for transitioning from remote to in-office other than “culture”.  However, that doesn’t scratch the incoherent signaling from management. The incoherence is starting to grow to deep to ignore.

Sickness: there’s still heavy corporate communication and emphasis on “stay home if you’re sick!” and “don’t spread germs!” although the messaging around the company being innovative and caring about employees being remote for their health has softened now that Covid has softened. It doesn’t seem like the PR department knows how to maintain the impression that they encourage working remote when sick, but that you should reeeeeaallly come in if you’re not *that sick* because you need to be in-office. When asked to clarify there is no additional clarification.

Floor Plans: We used to have assigned seats. Then came hot-desking, where you just sat anywhere you could find a seat. Now it has just been announced that we are concentrating our four floors of office space into two floors with the same number of people required to be in the office next. It will no longer be hot-desking because there are fewer desks so every time you need a desk you will need to reserve a desk using an online application. But the in-office requirements are the same. Really interested to see this play out next month.


Locations: Since starting its crusade against the inefficiencies of remote work and espousing the importance of being together in person on Webex calls all day, the company has also announced that one team (responsible for about 1/4 of the work in my line of business) is having their duties outsourced to India. The team was fully reporting into the office because it’s just so darn productive, but for some reason it was also a productive idea to just scrap them and rehire remote workers.


Behavior: Nobody is taking this seriously, yet KPI hasn’t suffered. Mid-level managers and executives at my workplace struggle to toe the line. My direct manager as well as my boss’s boss have both have privately expressed sentiment that they feel enforcing return-to-office is a tedious waste of their time and they don’t like enforcing it because it’s unpopular particularly with high-performers. I’m fortunate that the top brass in my division is very results-oriented, but even still they are company men that are hired to enforce policy. Even still my boss regularly badges into the building, mills about for two hours, and then leaves. I probably have more in-office time than he does. I’ve also heard an executive that makes millions of dollars in income a year say “I can’t do anything about the attendance policy. It is determined by the people who sign all of our checks” while he was frustrated.


Economics: HR has threatened to take away performance bonuses or raises if the in-office requirements are not met. A growing cohort of my coworkers are starting to grumble about just forgoing the bonuses/raises next year (which of course are paltry given inflation). A lot of people would save a lot of time, money, and sanity by just taking a pay cut to avoid commutes, parking, eating out, clothes, etc and actually saving/keeping more of their take home pay. After taking away bonuses and raises what more could they do to enforce compliance? Try to reduce people’s salaries? That won’t work and they know this. I have yet to see/hear about any person at the company actually being dismissed because of lack of office attendance so far.

Anyway, I know some jobs need offices but mine isn’t one of those. My whole department of 10,000 people know this. Every person dragging their laptop in to the correct pile of bricks to do business knows this from the bottom position in the hierarchy to the department head. If you think that commercial property and corporate real estate values are going to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, you’re smoking crack. Remote work is inevitable and the corporate elite ownership class know this."

I got promoted pretty quickly and really loved being here until I got demoted without being told while still being expected to preform managerial duties. For a little bit I upheld that because I truly thought I was the reason for the demotion but after awhile I lost my spark and stopped caring. During a company party we were all given awards and mine was basically an MVP for “all that I do” which felt like a slap in the face. Now I have one higher up who constantly seeks out my guidance because they’re somewhat new to their position and another who is incredibly condescending to me and talks to down to me in front of other employees constantly/involves me in their drama. Needless to say I’m exhausted and it sucks because I really took pride in my job, now I just get anxious every time I have to clock in.

 I have had a few final straw moments but never done much about it. Yesterday I had a disrespectful comment from my boss regarding my appearance/hair colour. This was done in front of work colleagues and customers. I was pretty shocked and didn’t really know how to react. I must add this isn’t the first time. I don’t expect to still have these comments at the age of 28.


 We also had our area manager in the office yesterday with my boss. My boss made a passive aggressive dig at me saying “he’s actually doing his job for once” whilst I was on the phone with a customer. For context, I do all of my work all of the time, whilst picking up slack from certain coworkers who don’t do their jobs. These coworkers get away with everything and never take any negativity from my boss. 

 These incidents may not sound much, but my experience of working here is a cycle of these same incidents happening. 

 I have around a years worth of living expenses saved. I can live frugally. I am extremely tempted to hand my notice in with immediate effect, and look for another job. I would be much happier with a simple, part time warehouse job for example. 

 Sorry for this post, it was more of a vent. If anyone can offer any thoughts on my situation or advice on what to do please. 

Thank you and take care"

First, here are my issues:

1: I have ""other"" Amnesia. What does other mean anyway?
I would invent something and come back a few months later never remembering how or what I did to make it. I only got 2 out of the 3 objects during the short term memory test right and only remember apple today because I think about this every day and it drives me nuts I can't even do that.

2: I have sleep apnea, huge amounts of stress, and anxiety.
I can only sleep around 2-4 hours at any given time.

3: I have a pinched S1 nerve root and diagnosed with Lumbar Radiopathology. 
I cannot stand longer than 15 minutes without my leg going numb.

I applied for SSDI. It takes 1 year and you cannot work. On top of that most people who are 100% disabled still get denied. They say I must wait until I'm at least 50 on top of it. Apparently it is impossible to be disabled before 50??? They tell you since you are educated, you should be able to get a job.

I am on week 14 for Unemployment applying for every single remote/work from home job I can and put I am disabled on every application. Still no job. I even have a good background, doesn't matter.

I tell SSDI if they think I can work, prove me wrong and give me a job with my conditions... absolute silence occurs.

As you can see, even if you are honest, did the right thing, paid your taxes, & worked 20+ years. The SECOND anything goes wrong, you are screwed. The country is pure cutthroat now. That includes the businesses and the so called ""help"" our taxes should be paying for. Our election choices are business or government and both screw you completely.

I have no idea what to do now, but I am likely to be homeless eventually. Think about this story as you age and work for these companies and this country. No matter what, if something ever happens to you, you will very likely be thrown under the bus.

If I am wrong about my view on this, please explain how and what I could do to improve. There appears to be absolutely no way out of the path to homelessness at this rate despite my achievements."

Don't know what to do,u/theluckyone95,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1at8brh/seems_like_any_job_has_a_long_commute_dont_know/,antiwork,"I've never felt content with any job I ever had. Not that I've had many jobs though because I have been studying a lot too. Anyway, I live in a town that is outside the big city, where most of the less boring jobs are. We definitely have jobs in my hometown as well, but they aren't fun/at fun companies.  


After finishing university, where I studied in a science-related field, I got a job immediately in the big city. This was in 2022. However, I only stayed for 6 months. I had a 1.5 hour commute, meaning that I had to spend 3h/day just getting to and home from work. And if I did it every day, it would be like working 7 days/week but only getting paid 5. I take the train because it's cheaper than the car and I don't have to get stuck in traffic, but I assume the car would take slightly less time. But with the cost of parking, gas etc. it would just be too expensive.   


It was so mentally draining to never have any freetime. I had to wake up at 4.30 AM and got home around 6.30 PM. I always had to have food prepped and ready to eat because there was no time to cook. It was just eat, prepare my lunch for the next day, remove my makeup and go to bed pretty much (if I wanted 8 hours of sleep). The good thing was that I could be at work at 9 AM instead of 8 AM (we have 8-5 instead of 9-5 for some reason?) and I had the option to WFH a few days.   


I regret my field of study, as it was fun to learn but not fun to work with. It's also so niched that there are not a lot of job options which worsens my problem. So in 2023 I decided to start studying digital marketing instead and it has been quite fun so far. However, I have to have a 10 week internship at a company that is close to the big city, and I have to be there at 8 AM. I've had anxiety since I found out I had to be there at 8 instead of 9... They also said that they don't WFH at that company. It's a company that I really like though so I assume it could be fun to be there, but the long commute completely kills the fun.  


I have to have a second internship in the fall before I finish my digital marketing studies. Usually, you can get hired after an internship so I'm thinking that I need to choose another company for my second internship. My goal is to one day own an apartment in the big city because that's where everything is and I've spent so many years (when I studied at uni as well) having this long ass commute and I can't take it anymore. My dilemma is that I don't know if I should get a job in my hometown and *then* buy an apartment and try to switch jobs, or get a job in the city and *then* move closer to it? I need a full time job and work there for at least 6 months before I can get a loan from the bank to buy an apartment. This means that if I get a job in the big city I have to endure the commute for 6 months (and probably more since I won't just buy the first place I find, it may take time). Obviously I need to find a company with a good WFH policy... Or I'll just try to get a less fun job in my hometown and move afterwards. But if I by an apartment I'd be scared to switch job because you have a trial period for 6 months at a job so it feels risky if they don't allow me to stay after 6 months. So in that case it would feel safer to get a job in the big city first and then move. But omg, I don't know how I'm gonna handle the commute. Not sleeping enough and knowing that I'm wasting so many hours of my life commuting to work, where I don't even wanna be, affects my mental health so much.  


**I don't know if my post is clear, probably not because I'm bad at explaining things... But what would you do? Would you get a job far away first and then move closer once your employment is more secure (after the 6 months), or get a less fun job in your hometown, then move and maybe have to commute from your new place for a short while before you landed a job in the big city (your then new hometown) and have a less secure employment for 6 months?**   


**TL;DR** I live outside the big city where all the less boring jobs are, but the commute is always 3h/day to those jobs. My goal is to move there but I have to be employed at least 6 months before I'm allowed to get a loan for an apartment. So I don't know whether to get a job in my current hometown and then move and get a job there (and have a less secure employment at the new job during the first 6 months), or get a job in the big city right away and have to commute for at least 6 months until I can buy an apartment?"

Everyone got a 3 out of 5.  (about 40 people).  That is the equivalent of a C or a D.  We are understaffed but manage to keep up with the workload.  We know its all about pushing the numbers down so they can justify not giving any raises this year.  But everyone is pretty pissed off about it.  The Company was bought out almost 3 years ago by a Private Equity backed company.  Which means things will get worse and not get better.  And the big surprise on Friday is that 12 managers were fired and at least 5 supervisors were as well.  None were the 40 people I consider my coworkers.  We are the manpower behind their income.  I call management the talking heads.  I enjoy what I do, but to be told I am 'below average' is a real pisser.  I guess going forward I will give the 3 out of 5 that is expected of me. At least until my contract expires and then I will drop it down to a 1, if I stay.  "

I really like the job, but three managers were just terrible at their jobs.  I started writing a letter to corporate in July.  I kept adding to it over the next couple months, obsessively editing over and over.  And I may have told a few people about it.  One of them told management in October. 
My write-ups began on November 2nd.  
When I found out that management knew, I decided to not send the letter in hopes that it would make the snitch look like a liar.  That didn't work.  I felt it coming, so I ended up printing out screenshots of conversations that would prove that I wasn't really creating a toxic workplace. I was finally fired on January 19th for suggesting that one manager was trying to pit me against my immediate supervisor.  
A few days later, I was sent a separation letter, and it included a QR code for a exit interview.  I didn't hold back.  
A few days ago, I was sent an email from somebody at corporate wanting to know more.  So I told him about the letter I had been working on and the screenshots. I told him I would get back to him in a couple days, after I edited the screenshots into a PDF.  
Well, it was submitted yesterday and I'm just a ball of anxiety waiting to see how it goes.  If it goes according to plan, four people will get fired. If that happens, I'll actually try to get my job back.  Wish me luck."

However I know how much my coworker (who’s also one of my best friends) makes who is immediately above me on the totem pole (there are only 7 employees). My coworker and I have basically the same job, but he is favored more because he’s the “go-to guy” and he’s been there longer. He is dependable for sure. He made $100K last year and I made $70K. His profit sharing bonus was $20K more than mine. 

Word got out that I was unhappy with the difference in pay and my boss was NOT happy to hear this because of that dumb outdated mindset of not sharing your financials with other people. I was expecting to close the wage gap between me and my coworker this year because it was the first full year i went full time. I figured more hours and better work means I get a bigger chunk of profit sharing.
My boss even mentioned this in the 1 on 1 meeting as if it affected my bonus. I would’ve believed him if I didn’t know exactly how much my coworker made. The wage gap has been and still remains to be 40%. He also reprimanded my coworker for sharing his compensation info with me and now my coworker said he’s not going to tell me that stuff anymore cuz he doesn’t want to “deal with it.”

Well, my supervisor is retiring in March and I told my boss I’m interested her position. I honestly think I would enjoy her job and I want to close this wage gap between me and my friend. Like it doesn’t feel good falling behind (40% wage gap every year means the dollar amount wage gap keeps increasing). I’ve been at the company for 9 years, 1.5 years full time. My boss seemed to be happy to hear that I was interested, but then had a meeting with me basically telling me he decided to hire the friend of another coworker (who is his FAVORITE employee and technically our HR person lol). He clearly didn’t even consider me for the job. He also said that he was hoping I’m not just after the money. And I’m thinking first of all, what the fuck does moving up in the company mean if not making more money… He basically told me he didn’t think I would like this other position…. Not that be knows anything about me. I have a CS degree and I’m already familiar with the company, the product, and part of the job. I currently do manual labor (it hurts my joints) and this new job is not that. It’s all super easy computer work. Order entry stuff, emailing, phone calls. I told him I think i would like this other position, but he doesn’t listen. My boss said with this new position opening up tasks will get switched around and some things will be split between my friend and the HR person. And that he’ll give me some more responsibility like dealing with the building maintenance stuff. Lawncare, sprinklers, snow removal, equipment maintenance, etc). I don’t fucking want that shit, but I guess I’ll take it if it comes with more pay…
He decided to hire this new person that knows nothing and will be much harder to train. She’s been working for about a month now and I’m confident I would’ve been a better choice. 

He mentioned we would get raises soon because minimum wage just went up and that’ll be a good opportunity to re-evaluate our pay and responsibilities. No raise yet though.

So yeah that was all in December. I don’t hate my job and like I said, for the work, we all get laid well. I just know I’m not appreciated here which makes it unfulfilling for me."

Hey Reddit,

I've been feeling pretty anxious lately and I need to get this off my chest. After a period of unemployment, I finally landed a job at what seemed like a great workplace. However, I'm encountering some mixed vibes from my direct colleague, and I could really use some advice on how to handle the situation.

She's about 10 years younger than me (not sure if that's relevant, but thought I'd mention it). She's supposed to be training me on my tasks and responsibilities, but I've noticed that her training is rushed and often leaves out important details. I find myself having to ask countless questions just to understand what I need to do.

Additionally, sometimes instead of fully explaining tasks, she sometimes just takes them away from me without clarification… The final straw was when she accused me of deleting something from an Excel sheet, and leaving me on read when I asked twice if everything was ok with the sheet, leaving me worried sick over the weekend.

Oh, and I started working with some emails where forms needed to be filled for the post office. Unfortunately, since those forms were filled late, there were some issues (not my fault, they were late with them and gave them to me as extra help). She was so extra nice to let me know that the problems started only one week ago (when I started to work), but it turns out I filled out the forms correctly.

I'm not sure how to deal with this situation. The workplace itself seems pretty relaxed, so I don't want to come across as a complainer, but her attitude is really starting to worry me. Any advice on how to handle this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

(Update),u/KoalaLovesLemons,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1atc33n/am_i_getting_the_silent_boot_update/,antiwork,"Hey guys, it’s been a hot minute. Thanks for the advice on my last post, but things have changed a bit. Things might get a little rants. 

I haven’t had a day of work since February 3rd. That’s two weeks in a row I haven’t been scheduled. Last time I was at work, they signed me up for an app that allowed me to check my shifts from home, which I feel is a little insulting. 

Compared to what I had to do when I was working, which was check the schedule in the break room every shift, or call to see if I was working. On that sheet of paper, I wasn’t shown to work the week of the 10th, and this week, my name wasn’t even on the sheet. (Even if you weren’t scheduled, they’d still put your name. So, I guess that means I’m fired. But they haven’t told me this officially. Along with this…I figured out a dirty secret


I was in my boss’s office so she could help me set  up the app. That’s when I asked about my shifts and the “payroll” issue. And she actually revealed the real reason I wasn’t getting hours. You know how when you go to target, and they ask if you wanna sign up for their master card for rewards and stuff? I don’t work at target, but my business (rhymes with sharshalls) does the same thing. However, what I didn’t know was that if you don’t ask every single customer, (which I did), or you don’t get enough customers to sign up in a day/week, they cut your hours. 

And as soon as I heard that, I wanted to quit on the spot. I wanted to yell at my manager that she was scamming people. If I had known that going into this job that my ability to sell customers on those stupid cards. Basically a credit card you can only use at Sharshalls and our parent stores, with ridiculous interest rates, in a low-income area, would determine my hours…I wouldn’t have made it thru the first month nor would I have even applied in the first place. 

And now I’m thinking back to every time I shopped prior to working there. Every time the customer asked if I wanted that card. Every time I said no, and they were punished.

Are there any actions I can take in the mean time? Should I call and ask if I’m still employed? I don’t wanna work there anymore even if they ask me to, I just want that leg up, since it’s easier to get hired if you already have a job. Am I allows pretend I still work there when applying to jobs? 

Tl:dr, my employers are shitty people. I realize that now and I’m ready to move on. What are my next steps?"

The sad truth is just like previous generations before us we will also complain. Then work. Then complain some more, and finally....die. and we will prolly pass this shit on to our children. Unless some major social revolutions will occur. Or robots take over all jobs freeing us. Or any kind of meaningful reform happens we will all just work until we break down and die."

I recently received a one dollar raise at the same time as my coworker and as soon as that happened, her hours stayed the same but mine dropped exponentially. They said that it’s because I’m not trying anymore but I genuinely don’t get that.

I was late one time in the last 3 months (I told him I was gonna be late, and apologized when I got there, i was maybe 15 minutes late), he used that as a way to say that I was inconsistent and am late a lot now. There was another day that I was 3 minutes late but I had medication that I needed to take but forgot, so I had run home, again, I told my manager that I was gonna be 3 minutes late.

The raise that I was supposed to get was about a month ago, but my paystub still says my old pay, another thing I needed to get fixed. He also said that they scheduled me less because he heard I was looking for other jobs but I call bull because I started looking AFTER he cut my hours. He kept preaching how he supports me and wants to see me do good yet he doesn’t give the hours to support that. I even asked for a transfer because I know I would do better at the other store but he dragged his feet the whole way, so I finally just brought my resume to the other store, with no call back after 2 weeks. 

I’m currently sitting in the bathroom, hoping my eyes get less puffy because I was so nervous I cried. Honestly I  don’t even want advice or help, I just needed to vent. Thanks for listening."

Anyways I was on the phones, and this one time I worked 45 days straight. I took other people's shifts, and I work overtime. 

Corporate noticed and as a thank you, and keep in mind this was about 20 years ago, offered to give me a plaque of my favorite sports team.

I told management to just run a contest and give it to somebody else. 

And that's when I started just doing my shifts and no overtime. Even when they said it was mandatory overtime I refused.

There was a group who would gossip about everybody at work, even bullying others behind their back.  Then they started talking about how much they hated men, so I asked them to stop.  Of course, they ignored me and kept on gossiping and talking about their hatered for all men.  Note, I was the only male on that shift

I told my supervisor who said he was ""ignoring it since I'm not there.""  Then I went to the main boss, hoping someone would help.  He did say HR was involved, but the bullying didn't stop, and I was scheduled to work the same shift with them.  I could feel their hateful glares every time they were in eyeshot.  In so many words, the main boss told me to ignore it and, not kidding, to ""take your meds.""

I had been promoted at that job, worked longer than most of the bullies, covered other shifts and stuff like that.  I was valued, they said.  But they didn't value me enough to keep me from quitting.

When I suggested either leaving in two weeks or that moment, I was in great distress.  About to go back to that shift with the very people I was saying were hurting me.  I was clearly in distress too, as it caused me to start crying at work, even in front of the big boss.  That didn't matter though, because they took my immediate resignation and made me nonrehirable company wide.

It's been months, and I haven't been able to find a job in my field because the market here just doesn't exsist.  My mental health is worse and I don't see a future for myself anymore.  I let on to my former supervisor how much his inaction has hurt me.  He basically said ""don't blame me, you quit yourself.""  He called himself my friend, but friends don't let other friends get bullied into mental distress.

I wish I could move on.  But I can't.  I haven't found any job that pays what my old job used too, and they won't take me back, especially after the heated message I sent to my supervisor.  

I haven't been doing well mentally.  Every day feels like a struggle.  I dont know how much I have left in me.  I loved that job, it was my dream job.  

Maybe it is all just my own fault.  I guess I'm here looking for answers.  I feel so defeated."

Without getting into too much detail, he basically screamed at me a few times over the course of 2 days, and called me a ""f***ing R-word"" and said what I did was ""f***ing stupid"". I eventually walked out after he screamed at me for a problem that he caused. 

He has a long history of freaking out on employees, and he's been sent to anger management twice by the company. I planned on never going back when I left but after a coworker suggested I talk to the union, I did exactly that. They listened to my story and told me they would talk to the boss in question on monday. About 10 minutes after we hung up, the union rep called me back and said that he spoke with HR and they are opening a full investigation on him and it sounded like they're taking it pretty seriously. 

They said to come in on Monday like nothing happened, but also to write a letter documenting the events for HR. I'm having a lot of anxiety about this letter and even more about going back to work and dealing with an investigation or whatever else is coming. 

I was hoping you guys could give me some tips on things to say. The union rep told me that it was a huge deal that he used the ""R word"", and asked if I had any witnesses. And I don't have any witnesses to that so I worry that nothing will happen. I have at least one witness that seen and heard him screaming at me both days, but couldn't hear the exact words because of how loud the place is. I also have a potential witness who got screamed at right after me. 

The union rep also mentioned something about they are gonna wanna find out if he's creating a hostile work environment. I told him he was very hostile. The workplace is pretty toxic by nature, but this certain boss is absolutely unhinged. 

It's hard for me to say whether or not I felt threatened, because he doesn't physically intimidate me, but I feel that a lot of people would feel threatened. And in a sense I do feel threatened. If he were to attack me physically I would have to defend myself and get fired (zero tolerance policy), or just get beat up and file a complaint. I worry about losing my job over a future situation like this. 

I don't feel that it's fair to be screamed at. I even asked him nicely if he could just ""tell me what he wants me to do and I'll do it"" because of how he upset me by screaming before. That's why it got to me so bad when he screamed at me for his own mistake and tried to act like it was my fault. 

I'm having the worst anxiety I've had in a long time, and it's all I've thought about this weekend. The thought of going back to work Monday is killing me. My plan as of now is to do what my union rep said and come in Monday like nothing happened, with a full written report on the incident. He won't be there until I clock out to go home so I don't have to worry about interacting with him. I plan on going to the doctor for my anxiety so I can have a doctor's note to take a few days off for a mental health break hopefully. If that doesn't work I have 2 PTO days I plan on using, and possibly taking some attendance points to miss more. 

I'm having trouble deciding if I even wanna work there. I'm so worried about the backlash from this. If this guy were to get fired or transferred because of his long history of this kind of stuff, I would love to keep working there. But I don't know if I can coexist in the same workplace as this person. 

I guess I'm basically looking for some advice on how to navigate this situation, and anything I should or shouldn't say in this letter. I'm also slightly worried because before I walked out, as I was getting my stuff, i screamed ""MOTHERF***ER"" to myself, and kicked a wet floor sign over. I'm not sure if anybody seen or heard that, but I didn't know if that would ruin any case I have or get me in trouble. I was just to the point of losing it so I had to go. I'm not used to being degraded like that. I cried for hours when I got home because at the time I thought I lost my job. 



TL;DR: My boss screamed at me and called me names, I could use some help writing a letter. I'm also curious as to what kind of things qualify a job as a ""hostile work environment"".

My team leader was piloting WFH that would later be extended to the full team. 

There's a particular team mate with whom I butted heads frequently, we will call her Jane (f). To say we didn't get along was an understatement. Anyways, cut to a few weeks before being given my remote equipment and we were issued a mandatory training on using and setting it all up as part of it required a VPN and MFA to log in. I get my training done and later get my equipment (the training wasn't a requirement to *get* the equipment, just to operate). 

I flub my first day at home because I forgot a particular PIN I needed to log in before I could use a generated code (it was a 3 ish part process of PIN, password, and then generated code). So I panicked and scrambled in to the office because I didn't want to blow it for myself or the team. Anyways I was frazzled because I flub logging in, then have to get a password reset and I'm already late to work at this point. 

So that day, Jane just received her equipment and was in the process of testing it in office before she was allowed to take it home. She wasn't seeing the pop-up to log in to the VPN. She asks me about why it isn't popping up on hers and I told her that there wasn't one while she was connected to internal company networks. And sure, my response was curt because her and I don't like each other already and I'm flustered because of the above. That said, I was in no way unprofessional or mean/using rude words, it was my tone. 

She doesn't like my answer and goes and talks to my boss to get a second (read: better) opinion. My boss flat out tells her ""OP was correct. If you'd have done the training, you would know."" For context, Jane was actually really good at her job but evidently doing training wasn't her strong suit; I didn't care to stick my nose in her business to keep tabs on what she did or didn't do, that was boss' job (this does lead me to believe that this wasn't the first time Jane had been talked to about getting training done in a timely manner).

So Jane goes back to her desk and I thought that was the end of it. Months later, I get summoned to HR. And they tell me that I was condescending to a coworker. I was confused because that's not how I operate and so I asked for what event led to this and the above story was related. Cue my ""are you freaking kidding me‽"" face. I explained to HR my side and he of course had to keep his HR hat on. Even the HR rep knew it was bogus. So his response was just ""ok so... Be careful of your tone and try not to be condescending again..."" Mind you, this is HR for a fortune 500 company so very corporate-y.

Jane had a history of frivolously reporting people to HR. She reported our (my former) manager (f) to HR for being sexist against females; I know it's possible for a female to be sexist against a female and male against male, but this boss definitely wasn't. 

Tl;Dr:
Got sent to HR for having a ""condescending tone"" when giving the correct answer to a coworker."

Although brutal at times, It's a wonderful trade in a way that you usually don't have to be around other people outside of normal customer interactions, and rarely have to take any crap from anyone but the boss. You also don't have to hear about any serious gossip, or mass drama with overly sensitive people.

Prior to this career, before I was in cable service repair, I had my fair share Corporate environments. I floated around IT work in big offices for several years, when I was a young kid, I worked at blockbuster HQ. 

I can tell you, thatbig office environmentals are the epi center for all the toxic crap we have in the world today.   People jump off roofs to escape the hell from these environments.   I've witnessed people who did nothing wrong get fired for something other people did.  Several times including myself I've personally witnessed people getting in trouble for things completely out of their control.   I've seen bosses fire people because the woman they were banging was jealous the new girl was getting too much praise gor her efforts.  I've seen married men, and women alike sneak off into cloests or locked rooms then I watch them eat lunch with their Significant others like nothing ever happened.  I've seen countless scandals. And schemes, and I can only image what else happens. To top off my experience, what we hear on the news about shit that goes on in big corporate offices. Murder for hire, sexual assault galore, money laundering, drugs, embezzlement schemes, wire fraud, illegal crypto mining, illegal chemical dumping, ponzi schemes, consumer fraud, unethical business practices.   The list goes on. 

 Only worst I see or hear about in the trades is people doing drugs, having tendencies to to take lunch breaks at bar /strip club to pound down a few drinks. That's the worst I've seen on my 15 years of the trade.  

Working in dangerous weather conditions has  infinitely more chi, and zen than being in a corporate environment all day every day. "

Long version

Since the 2008 recession when I was in high school (sixth form for UK peeps), I feel like ive been unfortunate in terms of working jobs and trying to do something for myself. 

between 2008 and 2013, the only work I could get was working as a student ambassador who also worked security for university events (gotta love having a martial arts background and people saying you look intimidating ) . 2014-2015 I was doing my registration training to be a pharmacist but was in  shitty environment where my boss said to me that they wanted me gone within 3 weeks and was making my life hell by planting controlled drugs on me, making me clean sanitary pad / towel bins without any gloves, be a cleaner and personal errand boy despite knowing I had dust allergies / was unable to do much physical activity owing to recovering from a broken leg (like expecting me to travel 1 mile in 10 minutes to get them food whilst they and the others were bitching about me), having used needles in consultation rooms and accusing me of doing things when security cameras showed I had never even been there, literally throwing all the stock onto the floor from shelves and telling me to clean up and restack everything. She left after 3 months but so did the rest of the pharmacy team and I had to essentially help an inexperienced idiot (they did verystupid things / was very unsure about a lot of things) build a pharmacy team from scratch for the remaining 9 months. 

After becoming a pharmacist - I could only get 200odd days of work till 2019 as essentially there are too many pharmacists in my area (also pharmacists in the UK do not earn a lot of money and in fact had decreasing salaries from 2008-2020) and couldnt claim any benefits as I was earning on average, £20/ week more than people on job seekers allowance and had savings of more than £6,000.

2019 I ended up working as a hospital pharmacist, which went well for the first few months but then I found out how bad people can be. January 2020 I had 2 bad things happen - was in a car crash which ended up causing me to dislocate my shoulder and tear a sternocleodomastoid but couldnt get surgery or immediate physio / doctors appointment for a few months, but also was given news that my nan had 2 weeks to live due to going into septic shock. Rather than supporting me, the management in their infinite wisdom decided to make me have daily performance review meetings and gave me a a character assasination formal review meeting as I was underperforming due to being unable o stand straight or hold objects / and was late by more than 20 minutes due to the car crash **AT THE HOSPITAL.** I couldnt even get any union representation as pharmacist unions in the UK are useless. The other pharmacists felt it was unfair I was being given this treatment but whats interesting is that the management was crap to the extent they refused to give me lifts to work from the carpark, expecting me to walk on the side of an a road, and even screwed up a reference for a dream job offer...before telling me they wanted me to work across 3 hospitals without extra pay .

after I left that job, I worked a decent job which paid well but was let go after 2.5 years due to budget cuts (those who were being let go were being treated like shit by permanent staff members during my last 2 months there, yet the consultants were nice).

Last year was recommended to work for local government and my word was it a shit show. People werent allowed to talk to each other about work or collaborate with each other and my line manager, according to quite a few people (including HR) may have been racist as 4 of her previous direct reprots were forced to resign or work elsewhere in the organisation. She wouldnt be of any assistance, kept storming out of meeting, would laugh at me if I was struggling or in physical pain (twisted my ankle and she thought she would help by making me stack books for 2 hours whilst she was sitting and laughing despit eme having project work I needed to finish).  What's worrying is that she would lie during performance reviews and paint me out to look incompetent yet I was wise to record everything in writing and save copies of emails to my personal email ddress. I ended up quiting within 4 months and gave an 11 page letter to HR. last I heard, she was placed on extended leave after I left.

Now my current role - got screwed over by HR to the extent I wasnt paid till 2.5 months after starting, extremly lax staff to the extent that I could only access patient records 2-3 weeks ago due to them and their IT department being useless, and it seems that the pharmacist who is a partner of the PCN (group of GP practices) I am a part of, is a massive  bellend as he spends over an hour a day belittling me treating me like I dont know anything when he is literally explaining things to me I have been practicing for years / using documents. He is always yelling at me over every single word I speak to a patient or document when typing, and is always making comments like why dont I smile and why am I always looking miserable (I am not) and he gets annoyed that he cant read me. On top of that, he wont even let me do things as a part of a fellowship I am a part of, which is covered by the practice. Instead he just wants me to do administrative duties for the next 3 months to make sure the GP practices get paid for identifying people who need statins and are given statins. Personally I want to quit that job as I am fed up of pharmacy but am worried of quiting this job and the old one with 3 and 4 months experience respectively.

Any suggestions what to do?"

Since taft hartley its also had a role in minimizing union power. Such as enforcing requirement to provide notice before strike.

So they lose this ""enforcement"" while also simultaneously riling up labor. Thoughts on possibility of this biting them in ass in a big way."

When she's asked about it, the reason has always changed, but now it's because our availability isn't completely open? Which is bs because there's 2 others with locked availabilities that are getting 40 hours. 

I've talked to her before about it and shes said it's performance based. Which is totally bullshit because she told me to do extra tasks to get my hours back, and I did those things, and now I'm losing more hours. There's no performance she bases us on. I'm a full time employee and she has me working 3 days a week. Same with one of my other coworkers. Less than 30 hours. 

I've been trying to find something somewhere that I can do about this. I've talked to her management about it several times, same with my coworkers. I heard about wage theft, is there anything I can do with that?

Should I say anything to my employee about them illegally paying me salary instead of hourly so I get it in writing? I would like to have something in writing preferably so if they fire me I can claim retaliation and protect myself.

I talked to a lawyer and he said it sounded like I have a case. He wanted 45% of my potential winnings. Is that high? He was honestly an asshole on the phone the whole time and I don’t want to work with him but I’m just trying to figure out if I’m better off doing things on my own.

574,2024-02-18,Update on PiP while pregnant. ,u/milkofthepoppie,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1atss3z/update_on_pip_while_pregnant/,antiwork,"Back in November, 4 weeks after I told my boss I was pregnant, they told me I would be put on a pip. They gave me the choice to find a new role in the company or take the pip. I interviewed for another role but did not get it. My boss never asked me about it, and I beer brought it up so I let it go and hoped the pip wouldn’t come back up, but I took it seriously and buckled down at work. They waited until after the new year to bring it up. At this point I was 6 months pregnant and already very stressed about losing my job and benefits. They gave me 60 days and outlined what actions I needed to take on the pip. At my 30 day check in last week (which was recorded) they said “you have been doing a great job with the action items on the pip, but it’s the intangibles that can’t be measured that we still aren’t seeing. These are soft skillls that don’t happen over night and won’t happen over the next 30 days”. To me that says “ you did everything we asked, but in our subjective opinion you haven’t improved, and won’t have time to do so”. I feel like there is no chance in me making out of this pip and their minds were made up. I told all of this to HR and sent them the recording. A friend of mine who works in HR told me the head of HR said “we can’t consciously fire a pregnant person” but ultimately it’s my bosses decision.  Side note, my KPIs are better than anyone else on my team and I had a client visit last week and gush about me in front of my boss and my CEO. Of course it was extremely validating and of course my boss said nothing about it.  Anyway, I’ll post an update on a few weeks. I’m just really hoping to make to mat leave.  "

I tried a hot water bottle, a bath, and pills. And it’s still so stiff. I had to let her know there’s no chance I will be going in. 
The guilt is honestly eating me alive I cannot deal. I feel so bad even tho my neck is killing me.

A few years ago, I was the virgin shift leader with a little too much ambition. I always came in on my days off and made people feel bad for not doing the same. I was too flirty with some coworkers and completely an asshole to the rest (flirting with coworkers is gross and asshole-ish too). After leaving that job, I found this subreddit and I began to realize that life is not about working. People need time off, and people need mercy. I got fired at my next job, because I was misguided in my understanding of antiwork. I stopped doing my job all together aside from coming to work. Some days I wouldn't even do that. Now, I'm back at it again and I got promoted! I've learned what you guys have to teach and I hope to use my middle-management powers to fight for the little guy. When I hear coworkers talk crap about somebody because they called in sick (but don't have doctor's note from three specialists and pictures of the infected area), I remind them about the time they called in sick. Thank you guys for helping me understand more about how the world works and how it works against us. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do in my position to lead more people the antiwork direction."

I worked hard, got amazing performance reviews, took on extra projects/cross trained in other areas, networked internally for the next role I wanted, and basically did everything “right”. 

I found out the team I was on when I first started was being offshored; I was incredibly sad for them and it really started to change how I looked at my company. And then my new team found out we were being let go a few months later (someone from my first team managed to land a job on our new team after first layoff rounds were announced, so she had to go through this process twice - she says this has changed her into a very bitter person).

All of our jobs were being moved to India and Mexico and we we would be responsible for training the people replacing us. They stated over and over again that it was all for efficiency purposes. Well, that just didn’t sit right with me - how is it possible that all of this complication leads to better efficiency? Even worse, all the internal roles I was networking for were being offshored as well. 

So I set up a meeting with the VP of our department to seek clarity (not that I was expecting it). But even I was surprised at how cliche her answers were.

“People at banking jobs were really upset when the ATM came around cause they were worried about losing their jobs! But we forget that those ATMs also create new jobs for people to service them, etc.” (never mind that the banker losing their job probably wouldn’t be qualified to do that but okay). 

And then she hit me with such a laughable answer I don’t know how I kept myself from smiling. 

“Try not to look at this as a job lost, but an opportunity gained. Every job you have gives you more tools to add to your tool box that you can bring to your next role!”

I asked how I was going to bring those tools to a new role when all of the roles I was qualified for were being moved overseas. She didn’t have an answer. 

This experience was the kick in the ass I needed. I have a job and manager now that I really like but I will never go above and beyond for a company again."

He was diagnosed with dementia in early 2021 and so I stayed home with him until summer of 2022 when we ran out of money and I had to sell my childhood home for him so he could move into assisted living. 

I have spent the last 15 months applying to jobs in anything education or non profit related (5+ years of experience there too) to no avail. I have changed my resume countless times, had it looked at professionally, I even made up a job title for when I was taking care of my dad so there is no employment gap. I have networked, gone to local temp agencies, used LinkedIn, Indeed, and I've started applying to jobs I am seriously overqualified for because I need the money and it's all crickets. The only ""employment"" I've had is as an online tutor for an education start up, which I love but it's like 5 hours/week at most and I've had no students since November. It looks good on my resume as current employment, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything. 

I do not have the spoons to go back into the classroom. Working as a teacher at the beginning of the pandemic - and into 2021- made me never want to go back into a school. I know this is an anti work group and I absolutely love the sentiment here. I'm hoping that this group is less competitive (capitalist) and someone who has a background in education/non profit work and has successfully gotten a remote job in the last few years would be willing to share their resume with me. I need a visual to see what is *right* because having other people tell me what is *wrong* with my resume has yielded no results. The r/jobs sub has a few templates but I want to see the exact language used for someone with similar experiences to mine to see if that's what I need to change. I have also recently found a non profit agency that does individual job counseling for people with professional degrees who have been facing long term unemployment. But I would greatly appreciate knowing what actually worked for people who got their WFH jobs after 2022."

2,2024-02-18,"It's time to stop ""resisting"".",u/ThreeStepsFar,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1atwbyo/its_time_to_stop_resisting/,antiwork,"There's a certain trend I've noticed among antiworkers and our allies to consider ourselves a resistance movement of sorts.  We defy those at the top and work against their efforts - both passive and active - to further the exploitation of our fellow workers.  However, in pondering our situation and our ultimate goals, I've come to a curious conclusion: is not the idea of being a ""resistance"" in itself a trap?  Permit me to explain.

The idea of a resistance movement is most often portrayed as a force that opposes those in power, primarily the government or ruling body of a nation.  In our case, we oppose those billionaires and CEOs that seek to treat our fellow humans as disposable slaves and mindless machines.  However, I posit that by considering ourselves a resistance movement, we do in fact acknowledge those very enemies as ""those in power"".  In other words, by considering ourselves to be ""fighting the power"", we inadvertently consider those we oppose to be powerful.

This is not so.

Consider the pyramids of Egypt, formed of blocks all nestly and painstakingly arranged.  The block at the top may think itself the greatest and most important block of all, for all other blocks are beneath it.  And yet, to remove the top block from its place changes nothing but the aesthetic.  It is easily replaced, and the process of doing so has no effect on the rest of the structure.

Now imagine the bottom, where removing even a few blocks could threaten the stability of the entire structure.

My friends, we are not resisting the ones in power.  We *are* the ones in power.  By our hands do these supposed titans of industry succeed.  By our labors do the rich gain their income.  And by our unity could we threaten to topple every last industry in the nation.  Behind the billions of dollars mortals no different than you and I, most of whom would be in the muck and mud beside us but for a circumstance of birth.  They have only that power which we allow them to possess.  And I believe it's long past time that we remind them of this truth.

Stand your ground.  Form your unions.  Discuss your wages openly and honestly.  And if those above threaten to dismiss you for it, stand together and threaten *them* with the end of their industry.

Remember: we are not opposing those in power.  We *are* the ones in power.  It's time to stop ""resisting"".  It's time to rule our own lives."

There's about 25 of us total ranging from writers, social media, web people, designers, etc.

We had a 1.5 hour meeting last week led by our VP and the head of public safety about procedures during an active shooter. We briefly in the beginning went over the obvious Run, Hide, Fight things. However, the meeting was focused on the WORK we have to do if there's a school shooter. Here are some of the highlights:

* We were told ""we signed up for this"" since we decided to work in comms in higher education
* If we're remote that day, we have to come IN to the office
* If there's a scenario where the emails/phone systems go out (like if the shooter is an ITS genius) then someone has to RUN across campus to deliver handwritten notes

Important information: WE do not handle the text messaging/phone calling system that's used when there are active shooters, public safety handles that. This meeting was dedicated to the other work that ""needs"" to be done such as posting on social media, posting on website, answering media calls, etc. Not saying that that's not important work, but it's not 25-people work and it's not on campus work. 

Let's just say a lot of people left this meeting looking to apply to new jobs."

I loved the manager I was hired up, like actually. She was a good lady and treated me like… a person. Rare find, in my experience. 

Anyway, current manager is simultaneously “hands off” (doesn’t want to work with us) but also extremely particular with how she wants things done, and how we (or just me, maybe?) communicate with her. Wants to know why/when we’re doing anything but the caveat is that she is difficult to get ahold of. 


A month or so ago I got very sick, and had to call off a shift I had agreed to trade with another coworker. Coworker didn’t inform manager, but that was apparently my fault. So she told me I was on thin ice and if I called off incorrectly again she would write me up. 

Then she put her phone on “do not disturb”. Mind you, my shifts start at 5:30 AM. If something happens in the morning and I need to get ahold of her, it’s going to be around four in the morning. 
So! Two weeks ago I’m heading to work and the brakes go out in the car while I’m driving. I call my boss, and… it goes straight to voicemail. Called my coworkers, one was out of town, the other didn’t answer. I’m the only person scheduled that day and can’t get ahold of anyone on my team, but I have an emergency to worry about. So I go to it. Text my boss and say a little prayer and start worrying about my car. 

An hour after the shop is meant to open I get a call from a different manager who proceeds to chew me out for my lack of consideration. “We’re running a business” “why can’t you take an Uber”(I didn’t have the money, have to scrounge to get brakes fixed) “it’s always something with you”. The call ends when she HANGS UP ON ME.

Meanwhile, at my work place three other people tried to call my manager multiple times and no one was able to get through to her. 

I got written up for this improper call off. 

Anyway, I have an interview tomorrow. "

It would render swift judgements, already a rarity when concerning employer/employee judgements, nonexistent and force employees through arbitration or civil court, a process countless individuals cannot afford.

16,2024-02-18,Fired for being unhappy,u/ImaginaryJello,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1au0x7s/fired_for_being_unhappy/,antiwork,"In October 2022, I was offered a job at a compounding pharmacy. Since I went to college, I always LOVED doing compounding so I was ecstatic to start a job doing specialized work that I learned about in college.

Unfortunately, the place wasn't very good. There were a lot of issues with it, so much so that I developed anxiety and depressive symptoms over both my progress within the pharmacy (I was told my training was going to be 4-6 months, and my first year anniversary was at the end of October 2023) and due to the toxic workplace environment. I also have back issues so my back was killing me on a daily basis from standing up with low counters so I would be slouching a lot and stools that couldn't support my back or chairs that couldn't support my back properly, which was draining me mentally. I also was (and still am) dealing with other health issues (but those are whole different stories with different things that were said to me).

The issues ranged from lack of training procedures and consistency, lack of salary increases (from speaking with other employees, one of them has worked there for almost 15 years and has gotten maybe 3 raises. I always felt like because we're doing such a high-stress, high-stakes job (we did sterile compounding as well) that we're not paid enough. Some jobs require much less training and would pay much more than this one did), lack of compensation ([typical promises of pizza!](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/439676251201077259/1208831913087864924/20240218_122902.jpg?ex=65e4b773&is=65d24273&hm=e0a97182d4c2cb5d15c84dd7397d4af35d1387060b97b058c5cbfcef2610391f)) and recognition for the employees, poor division of labour (jobs done by techs that could easily be done by someone who is not a tech), too much work for too little staff (workload keeps on increasing despite everyone complaining that we're short-staffed), no opportunity for growth (no senior tech position, no specialized tasks for senior people), people in managerial positions are not trained managers and therefore lacks structure so the pharmacy isn't very well organized, owners yelling and speaking badly about their employees out in the open, employees being scared of talking to management about issues.

So with all of that happening, I was taking some days off to take care of myself because my anxiety was too high. At the same time, I was looking for other jobs in other fields because I've known for a while now that I wanted out of pharmacy.

On November 17th, I went home early because I was having really high anxiety. One of the owners tried to get me to call him and even called me but I was in no state to talk. My boyfriend eventually ended up calling him from my phone to explain what was going on, to which the owner said to take my time and to come back when I felt better.

The next Monday, after reflecting on what could be changed in the pharmacy over the weekend, I made the list above and sent a long text to that same owner. The main reason why I did that was because he usually doesn't let us speak when having a conversation with him, and I'm also not very good at speaking about this face-to-face, especially if the people have a ""well, people never complained about it before, why should it change?"" attitude. He never responded.

Come Tuesday, I was sitting on the couch, trying to rid myself of the anxiety and preparing myself to go back to work on Wednesday. I hear a knock at the door. It's a delivery driver handing me a letter addressed from my place of work. I was confused but I signed the delivery slip, closed the door and opened the letter. It's a letter of dismissal 🙃 The reason? “It is clear that you are not satisfied with this job and that you are not happy with it.” I laughed out loud. The anxiety instantly was taken away from me.

I mean, they're not wrong and I did have a foot out the door but I had to secure another job (which unfortunately still hasn't happened so now I'm looking to go back to school). But what irritates me the most is that instead of taking all the points I brought up (and they do encourage the employees to come up with changes that could be made in the pharmacy, which was a part of our ""self-evaluation"" we had back in June 2023) and working with me to help improve the environment and making the place more organized, they let me go.

I honestly see this as a scare tactic for other employees because it shows that if you complain, you will be punished for it so you better shut up and keep working.

Unfortunately, because I worked there for less than 2 years, I was not able to report them for wrongful dismissal.

tl;dr: Worked in specialized compounding pharmacy, highlighted everything wrong with the workplace, got dismissed."

1,2024-02-18,What happens if an employer frames it’s employee at work; how challenging is proving pretext in such scenario? 🇺🇸,u/Skyoff_Lyfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1au156y/what_happens_if_an_employer_frames_its_employee/,antiwork,"Okay so I’m familiar with the concept of pretext in employment law, where an employer creates a reason to legitimize their real and illegal reason for terminating their employee. *What if* an employer went above the typical accusation of misconduct against an employee and staged a crime and then intentionally falsely accused and reported that employee to police?  To illustrate my question I’ll use a civil case as an example but reposition it to an employment law scenario. 

There’s the case of Michelle Hadley a woman living in California with her fiancé who was US Marshal Ian Diaz. When the two broke up Hadley moved out of the condo they once shared and there became a dispute about the condo. To circumvent issues regarding the condo Diaz, who soon after married Angela Connell, then created fake online profiles and ads, posed as Hadley. The couple then obtained restraining orders against Hadley and continued to report these fake emails and online ads to police until Hadley was arrested. 

In an employment law scenario say Diaz and Connell were Hadley’s managers or supervisors and they stage the vandalism of Diaz’ office in the workplace and report Hadley to police for it. But because their goal in this scenario isn’t to have Hadley arrested (in order to take possession of a condo) but rather to humiliate and fire Hadley- for making a harassment complaint at work, so they decline a police investigation/ prosecution. 

In this scenario Hadley has no criminal history, and also had an amazing professional reputation with the employer meaning no write-ups, consistently outstanding metrics *and* consistently favorable evaluations, but yet was reported to police as a “problem employee” by Connell just a few weeks after reporting Diaz (in writing to HR) for sexual harassment. 

Would pretext be difficult to show in this retaliation/ wrongful termination example? Also, the real life Diaz and Connell were charged and convicted for their crimes in manufacturing evidence and making false reports against Hadley could a similar outcome happen in an employment law scenario; such as when a trucking company becomes a participant in the criminal prosecution of it’s truck driver employee?"

Ahead of the announcement they shared a new updated org chart showing the management structure and after the re org there are now 3 new layers of management that didn’t exist before. 

How does this make sense? They need more capital so they’re gonna hire more managers who get paid a lot more? And how do you justify hiring more managers when you’re reducing your workforce?   And they way they talk to us like we should all be happy because the RIF will result in more capital for the company which is the ultimate goal.

I also know it's frustrating to be fixing other people's mistakes, but I am really trying. I'm really dreading tomorrow because I am going to get my butt chewed out again.

Advice?",u/macdennism,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1au4u38/work_had_no_water_but_theyre_making_us_take_the/,antiwork,"I am genuinely asking for help/advice. Please don't just say ""quit""/""find a new job"" etc. That is obvious. In the meantime though I still have to work here and need to know if there is ANYTHING I can do.

I work at a very small beverage production facility. We get unlimited PTO, and 40hrs of sick time that resets at the start of the year. Those 40hrs of sick time have been described as ""more than generous."" 
However, you cannot use PTO unless you give a **minimum** 2 weeks notice in advance. This is a brand new rule they are now claiming has ""always"" been the case. 

That is a lie. I've been here for almost 2 years and there was SEVERAL occasions where my general manager approved PTO less than 2 weeks out. They never once told me I couldn't do that. Now that my requests get sent to a new Assis Manager, suddenly we are going by the rule book. After I requested ONE hour of sick time, they had a whole meeting stating how awful and completely unacceptable it was for [me] to request an hour the day before leaving early. This was literally never an issue for me in the past, I genuinely didn't know this was a rule. They said it was ""in the handbook"" (I never got one).

This is a timeline I need to lay out for maximum clarity/context for the rest of the post. Apologies for this being long-winded. 

**Some time last year:** a water main burst around 730a.m. our facility completely lost water. No water means we can't produce, clean, wash hands, use the the bathroom, drink, etc. Obviously we can't work without water. They sent us home and said that would pay us for 4 hours. Fair enough.

**Mid January:** another water main break around noon. They sent us home,  unsure about what they would do about the pay. We now have multiple shifts, some start at 7, some as late as 9. They paid everyone a full 8 hours. 

**The Tuesday before last (the 6th):** the glycol pump that is needed to keep liquid cold went down on Monday. They told us we could not report to work on Tuesday. We were either forced to take the day unpaid, or use our sick time to cover the day.

**Last Wednesday:** Massive water main issues affecting a large part of the area, including us. Sent home early. I assumed we would be covered, since we were last time. I got a call Thursday that we have water for bathroom use, but it's not safe to run production. If we want, we can come in and do maintenance work, but it's fine if you want to take the day unpaid, or use sick time. I took the day, because I had just been woken up by this call, was very tired, and it's not my job to perform maintenance. And plus, free day off. Most people stayed home. I also assumed they would cover the rest of Wednesday. 

**Last Friday (the other day, and also end of the pay period):** I am asked to come into work 2hrs earlier. New AM is there even though they work 4 10s because the other AM had the day off. We run a product that *technically* doesn't need clean water because there is no rinsing process prior to filling. However I'm personally concerned proper sanitation couldn't be done but whatever I guess. We are running it anyway.

I find out we actually ran that product the day before (Thursday) uh ok. I would have COME IN if they told me they were running production. But this wasn't communicated.

On our last break, AM casually tells us we are NOT getting covered for Wednesday at all, and we only have 2 hours to put in our sick time since this is the end of the pay period, and they are going to submit our time cards. 

Unfair, seeing how half our crew comes in 2 hrs later (so we had less time on the clock before they MADE us leave) and also because THEY PAID US LAST TIME! I ask why, AM says, ""I don't know."" They also play dumb and act like I'm making it up when I say they paid us for the full 8 hour day when this happened last month.

They look at me confused like they don't believe me, despite the fact that THEY and the other AM came and asked me if I noticed I got the day covered, to which I said yes and thanks etc. this was quite literally only a month ago, and only like 2 weeks since we got that paycheck. But clearly I am lying I guess. Because they're like ""umm I don't think so..."" Whatever. I have the paystub to prove it. 

So to sum this up payment wise, I am still 6 hours short for this 80hr pay period, and I've used so much of my sick time covering the COMAPNY not letting ME work that I only have 8 hrs of sick time left. FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. Since I also now have to use it for emergencies when I need to leave work early for whatever reason. 

I'm stewing about this for the last two hours (other coworkers are rightfully pissed as well) but ultimately, hey. This fucking blows but there's always overtime, right? AM works TONS of (truthfully unnecessary) overtime and it is extremely seldom I DONT get overtime. this company LOVES making us work late. It's slow at the moment, but still.

At the end of the day, I ask AM about maybe coming in at 7 or 8 instead of 9 next week because I'd really like overtime. They, once again, look at me like I'm crazy and say, ""overtime isn't allowed right now""

?????? This is NEWS TO ME. For as long as I have worked here, overtime has NEVER been closed. EVER. 

Then they continue, ""no one is allowed to get overtime. Well except for me.""

😐 (Seething with rage) and I'm like uh. Okay. Well. You guys wouldnt let me work and I can't use ALL of my sick time and I'm going to be short this paycheck and I really need to make up that money.

To which they're like ""eeehh yeah it's a sticky situation"" and shrug me off. They offered to text our GM to double check. I'm like it's not necessary but they do it anyway. They are the type to twist context and throw folks under the bus so I can only imagine how they worded it. GM isn't answering so I leave and then get this text: ""Just heard back. OT is not open"" 

Do I have ANY options here at all? Legally?? Anything?? I feel like we are getting MASSIVELY fucked over and treated SO unfairly and they clearly do not care. There are tons of other personal reasons I'm really starting to hate working there but I feel like I really need to try SOMETHING. This is not a mega corporation company, it's tiny, local, we all see and can converse with the CEO directly. We know everyone in the whole entire company. Idk if that makes a difference. 

**Tl;Dr: Work didn't have any working water in the whole building. They forced us to go home. Now they won't cover us, and they won't let us use PTO. We HAVE to take it unpaid, or use some of our yearly 40hr sick time balance. Is there any way I can fight this?**"

Literally the only reason I do it is because it's free food and drinks. So I enjoy the FOOD, not THEM.

I love to go out and eat, drink and partying with my actually friends who are fun to be around, playing video games and listening to some good music. 

We have agreed to socialize soon, and one of my co-worker said she has to work (because some of us have two jobs), but my boss said: ""Oh but you can just switch shift with one of your co-workers, it's still a month until we are going out for dinner and drinks so your (other) boss should have plenty of time to re-schedule your shift""

If I simply say I have other plans, the boss will simply ask me ""can't you just change your plans?"". Why can't you just respect a freaking NO? Co-workers are NOT my friends, I really only like a couple of them. Why should I socialize with a boss who expects everyone to work their ass off while she almost never do the work we are supposed to do?

0,2024-02-18,I'm trying to shift public perception on a lot of issues. I've decided to start making videos and would love input.,u/Nvr_Indxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1au5wkl/im_trying_to_shift_public_perception_on_a_lot_of/,antiwork,"**(This is targeted to several different subreddits, largely because these issues overlap like crazy and I want perspectives from a ton of people from different backgrounds if possible.)**  
Starting a year ago, I became hyper-aware of, well... a lot of what's going wrong with the world.   


For the past six months, I've been trying to think of ways to actually make a difference as a low-income citizen with zero connections and effectively no social network. The average worker, basically. And as everyone here is well aware, the average worker views themselves as more or less powerless on their own (acting as a collective = the only way forward). 

But I have a few skills that may be helpful to subs and communities like this-- one of them seems to be an obsession with the interconnected nature of the problems discussed here and elsewhere. I want to frame the most significant ones in ways that don't leave you feeling hopeless, **in ways that demonstrate progress can be made (and how best to make that progress).**   


There are a lot of moving parts, and this post doesn't need to be an essay. To start with, I'm going to build a social media presence that acts as a unifier for discussing tech, socioeconomic dysfunction, the climate crisis and other ecological disasters, and the manipulation occurring in each of those vectors. This will ideally lead to crowdsourcing research, cooperatives, etc. The first content slated for release on social media is a series that I've nicknamed ""The Problem Series"", eight episodes running 45-60 minutes each. Here's where I'd love some input! Let me know what you think of the following topics/premises, whether they accurately portray the biggest problems we're all facing, and if they seem compelling enough to gain traction:  


(Episode titles are intentionally clickbait-ish to accommodate audience demographics, suggest a different order if you strongly feel that a certain sequence of information presentation would be more logical...)

1.  **Problem #1: Capitalism's Death Spiral:** Breaks down why the vast majority of human-created issues now stem from unregulated corporate practices. This includes wage stagnation, wealth consolidation, climate change, the plastic/waste crisis, the housing crisis etc. The intent here is to provide an abstract-level overview that will touch on core problems while illustrating their intersection with one another. 
2.  **Nobody is an Island: The Myth of Rugged Individualism:**  Drawing on historical analysis, sociological research, and personal narratives, this episode examines the myth of rugged individualism and its role in shaping Western society's values and attitudes. The idea that we should deify those who successfully carve an outsized portion of resources for themselves (the ""self made"" billionaires and friends) is inherently toxic and enables extreme levels of passiveness in general citizenry as we watch a select few bleed us dry. 
3.  **Your Landlord is a Robot: Notes on Our Next Housing Crisis:** The title here takes aim both at the actual AI-driven real-estate bidding wars expected to escalate across the next decade as well as at the current practices of ""human"" landlords running rackets on millions of low-income citizens world-wide. Here, we examine alternatives such as selective applications of communal infrastructure and other collectivist ideals, regulatory measures to eliminate the practices discussed, and other municipality-level approaches that yield more security for at-risk populations.
4.  **Co-op 101: Building a Better Future :** This episode deviates somewhat from an immediate focus on problems and instead tries to paint an anticipatory picture of what some of our core infrastructure, utilities, and modes of business might look like in a highly-regulated flavor of capitalism (one that leverages the principles of things like ""universal basic utilities""; water/electricity/food are treated as basic human rights in this hypothetical). 
5.  **Skepticism 101: Let’s Dissect Corporate (Lies):** Dedicated to taking aim at corporations and monopolies whose legacy of moral bankruptcy continues to harm everyone outside of a minuscule segment of the global population. The aim is to objectively categorize and examine the strategies used by these entities to persuade citizens to ignore the social, financial, and environmental costs incurred by their self-centered practices; the motives that drive these levels of apathy, and what effective organized responses from those impacted would actually look like. 
6.  **Working Until You Die: Income Inequality Explained:**  The title here is pretty self-explanatory imo. The intent is to explore the existing trends tied to retirement and the cost of living, and examine what happens in societies that have eroded their social safety nets-- what happens when you simply cannot afford to age out of your work or become disabled? This absolutely stretches beyond retirement, but it's a very potent image to consider since this has historically been the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" for those below the upper class. 
7.   **Every Purchase is Violence: The Real Cost of Consumerism:** The title may seem hyperbolic until you realize the percentage of the labor/supply chain for consumer goods that are built on outright slavery or extreme animal cruelty. This is another very difficult-to-look-at global phenomenon. But as I mentioned in the intro to this post, I will also deep dive into the lovely handful of companies that are thoroughly pursuing solutions to these issues, and illustrate how other companies can be pressured or convinced to do their part (no, this isn't just boycotting).
8.    **Forever Automated: AI Wants to Replace You at Work:** More clickbait phrasing, but the crux of it is proving to be exceptionally accurate. We are set to witness the permanent down-sizing of many creative and white collar industries... but we shouldn't be surprised in the least. This episode examines why the writing has been on the wall for centuries when it comes to automating every available function within the workplace, and why objectively different rules apply to the worker displacement seen during the industrial revolution versus the AI and computing revolutions. **Remember: if you can describe your jobs as a series of steps, a robot or AI-augmented system can and will take it.** 
9.  **You, Me, Us : Fighting for Today instead of Tomorrow:** I have to end it on a high note. This has to be a series that provides some kind of ray of hope for people like me, the ones waking up fucking sad everyday when we think about what the world is turning into. This is the start of a project that proposes to incrementally shift the tracks until our runaway train is diverted onto a safer path. An exit ramp strategy, if you will. This isn't holding hands and singing ""We Are the World"", this is a declaration of organized resistance built on extending compassion and thoughtfulness into structured change. 
10. Thank you for coming to my ted talk

If literally any of this grabbed your attention, I'd love to hear why, and whether you have more insight in specific areas. Sources, examples, proposals for content. All of it is welcome. If you think it's stupid, cool; I'd love to hear alternative approaches or methods of constructing the beginnings of a grassroots collective. 

**TLDR; I'm making a video series examining all of the global problems and putting them into a framework to see what existing strategies are missing. Then, running social and economic experiments to test what's actually effective. This will require a shit-ton of crowdsourcing, but I know I'm not the only one looking for something organized that opposes the sea of greedy bullshit we're all wading through.**

After the meeting, we were all going to attend a Major League Baseball game in the afternoon.

I was relatively new to the company at this point & when I got to the meeting my manager tells me they are one ticket short for whatever reason and I’m not gonna get to go. This is already shitty because the group was just gonna be in the cheap seats & he could’ve just offered to buy me a $10-$15 ticket. So I plan to just leave by myself after the meeting. Then, in the middle of this all he tells me one guy in the group didn’t show up & I could use his ticket. He hands me a ticket. So I was like okay guess I’ll go. Then, at the end the missing guy turned up & I had to give the ticket back to my manager. On the way out he has the audacity to tell me to go back to the office. I went home instead. I don’t say stuff like this a lot, but that company was full of sh*theads…

TL/DR: I was supposed to go with my company to a MLB baseball game after a Friday meeting. They forgot to get me a ticket & didn’t offer to buy me one for $10-$15 in the cheap seats.

1,2024-02-18,I am absolutely Enraged by how my Friend is treated at Work,u/ILVANIME,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1au65xu/i_am_absolutely_enraged_by_how_my_friend_is/,antiwork,"TW : Sexual Assault 


For context I work at a Mexican Restaurant as a Dishwasher and about a Year in my friend was talking to me about how she wanted a job and I offered to help her get a job there so she could get her own money. She is also Undocumented so she doesn't have many options for Jobs. This is in the USA.

While I have my own gripes with the place (Coworkers, and how overwhelming the job can be) I wanted to talk about how my Friend is currently being treated. This past Saturday we both worked all day and she needed to rant to me about the day after I dropped her off at her house. (I drive her to and from work). She explained to me that during the day she is absolutely floored with tasks that she needs to do for the restaurant. She works as a person that takes Chips to tables for to the tables. From what she explained to me she has to worry about taking the Chips, to-go orders, prepare Salsa and clean the bathrooms and part of the kitchen floor at the end of the day, now that wouldn't be as bad if there was another person helping her but SHE WORKS BY HERSELF on Saturday all day! This has made her back hurt terribly at the end of the day, especially yesterday. She works on Tuesday too but it's the same situation where she works by herself.

Another reason I was angry about this job was because of how my Boss ""took care"" of my friend being SA'd. The day that it happened I thought it was just a normal shift and by the end of it my friend wanted to talk to me about how one of the cooks had given her hugs and kisses on the cheek without her Consent, this lead to her breaking down after that shift was over and made her feel unsafe which led to her buying Pepper Spray and asking me to go with her whenever she has to go to a more secluded area. When I told her to bring it up to my boss, she told me that my boss said she had to ""stand up for herself"" and didn't even fire the Cook who did it. I WAS ANGRY like how the hell do you tell that to one of your employees and not expect to be angry (my friend didn't get angry at my boss but my boss deserved it).

All this and she only gets paid 8.50 an hour, what a disgrace.

TLDR: 
My Friend is overworked and can't do much about it because she is Undocumented in the US and was Ignored when SA'd by a Co-worker."

The only thing I don’t know how to do is use a POS.

1,2024-02-18,Manager at Job instituted “Punishments” for “Insubordination”,u/Andrea_030,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1au770q/manager_at_job_instituted_punishments_for/,antiwork,"Hey gang, wanted to see if anyone knew about the legality of what my bosses are trying to pull. 

So, I work at a gym in Texas. We’re a franchise under very loose control both from corporate and really just our owner as well. My manager is kind of a dickhead and still doesn’t know what he’s doing for the 4 years he’s been in charge. I get paid enough that for the most part I’m fine to just deal with it.

All the way back in August, we more or less hit a full staff turnover aside from myself and two others. It’s been a mess. They’re ALL high schoolers in their first job, and they just don’t care. On top of that, my manager doesn’t train people so much as he just schedules them and expects them to pick it up from other people, which doesn’t help when almost everyone is new at the same time.

So, it’s 6 months later now, and we’re at our top-of-the-month staff meeting (well, I wasn’t there, but I heard about it, which is important). There are numerous little rules that constantly go unrespected, most of the time because they’re stupid. Some of these include:

- No sitting on the job (it makes us “look lazy”)
- No phones on the floor (that’s a given, but we are allowed to have them on the floor)
- No swearing (there’s a pretty high amount of traffic from the 5-12 yr old crowd)

And you know, I thought there would be more, but otherwise, it’s a lot of very specific closing stuff to clean. The bit about sitting really takes the cake.

Anyway, let’s wrap this up; at the staff meeting, our manager said he would be handing out Burpees to employees that were not following the rules and not closing properly, etc. I wasn’t there myself so I can hardly say whether or not this was a joke from him, it very much could have been, but either way it is clearly ludicrous. 

That was a couple of weeks ago. It’s become kind of an in-joke with the rest of the staff because of course we didn’t take it seriously. And to his credit, he hasn’t actually tried to make anyone do a burpee. I’m just wondering, since Texas is Right to Work ( :/ ), can they actually force us to do Burpees out of nowhere like this? What would happen if I quit on the spot, if he tries to make me? Can he withhold my pay?

Anyway. He’s pretty toothless when it actually comes down to it. I’m not really worried about doing burpees, but I was just curious if someone could provide some insights about a boss trying to humiliate employees in a Right to Work state. Thanks."

The terms are as follows: 

-I cannot work for a similar company for the period of 1 year after termination at the company. 

-The geographical location is the entirety of the United States. 

This company is based mainly in the western half of the US. If I were to move to somewhere they aren’t located, is their non-compete still enforceable? I have a hard time believing they have the power to prevent me from utilizing my skills throughout the entire country. If they do have that power, that would be extremely worrisome, as my skills are very niche and I would then get a temporary job at McDonald’s if I can’t work in my field.

55,2024-02-18,"To American Workers on Here and Hell, Even Their Bosses too!",u/rbnrthwll,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1au850a/to_american_workers_on_here_and_hell_even_their/,antiwork,"Today (February 18, 2024), I have seen no less than 3 to 4 panic ridden posts about workers calling off and being attacked for it. For clarification I consider guilt tripping an attack because it is, you’re playing on someone’s emotions to get them to do what you want. 

“Guilt-tripping occurs when a person makes another feel guilty, to manipulate them into doing something. It is a form of passive aggressive behaviour that results from the person's lack of ability or unwillingness to communicate openly, honestly, and assertively.” (https://talkyourheartout.com/guilt-tripping/, July 13, 2022)

You should also know that passive aggression from a person in authority is a form of abuse. 

“Is guilt tripping toxic? Guilt tripping is often designed to manipulate other people by preying on their emotions and feelings of guilt or responsibility. This can be a form of toxic behavior that can have detrimental effects on a person's well-being as well as their relationships.” (https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-guilt-trip-5192249 , Apr 4, 2023)

Now we’re all adults, we’re not children. You should not be made to feel bad for doing what you need to do to support your own wellbeing or your family’s needs. NO ONE HAS THAT RIGHT. Now you may have signed some paperwork/contract that you will abide by certain rules and regulations. Fine. Abide by them then. 
But you absolutely do not have to explain anything to your manager. You need a mental health day…you have a family emergency…this is more than I would say. 

If you are using PTO (Paid/Personal Time Off) or Vacation Days then you don’t have to explain anything because that is your time. YOU EARNED IT. Yes, ideally your vacation time should be scheduled in advance but in the case of an emergency and if your company allows it…

But the thing is America, Capitalism really, functions on stress. High stress, and I assure you, they don’t care about you. If they did they would recognize that virtually all of our country’s medical issues can be traced back to stress, and they would do something about it. 

Heart disease, ulcers, heart burn, heart attacks, obesity, and hell even diabetes because who the hell has time to cook after working these hours?! Also, in the Great Inflation who the hell can afford healthy food? Fast food is actually cheaper than groceries and is all we have time for!

And because we were raised with deadlines and the pressure to try harder and be better, but without being taught how to de-stress in healthy ways and so we developed hobbies and vices that could become quite negative.

Video games, collecting things, etc…not too bad. Living beyond your means…you’re skirting that edge. Alcoholism, illegal drugs, etc…are you catching my drift yet? All of these are people’s efforts to deal with pressure and the stress of living like this.

Your manager may act as your buddy and at one time may have even been a friend before becoming your boss, but they’re not your friend. 
If the company cared, they would insist that you take your vacation. When you call off, citing a family emergency that would be the end of it beyond them asking if there was anything they could do. But they don’t care. You’re a number, a dollar sign to them. That’s all.

Now I know that we have been programmed to behave a certain way, but we need to break free.
For our HEALTH.
For our SANITY.

To all of the very young workers just entering the workforce and are intimidated and not sure of what to do: 
Follow your handbook. 
If your company has a union, join if you can. 
Learn the basic labor laws that are hot topics right now.
Your parents may mean well but if they’re Boomers, they may still be drinking the kool-aid, so be patient with them. Management/Administration are not your friends. They are not on your side.

To the Managers who frequent this sub to incite trouble:
Everything I said was true and you know it.
I honestly wonder how you sleep at night.
You should do better."
5,2024-02-18,Virtual recruiter experience ,u/mattkaru,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1au8bs6/virtual_recruiter_experience/,antiwork,"Y'all. I just had my very first virtual recruiter interview, it was through Staffmark. I have never felt so frustrated at a job interview process as I have this. One of the questions was asking me if I've applied for any other jobs recently. I straight up said, ""I don't see how that's anyone's business."" Then the virtual recruiter started saying, ""Okay, I will make a note of it."" to every response I had that and other questions, which grinded my gears for reasons I don't even understand.

Then when it came time for me to ask questions, I had a solid question about the specifics of the job and day-to-day work I would be doing, a normal interview question. It gave me a three-word job description that I was already aware of. I asked for further details. ""Sorry, I don't know it"" was the response.

When I asked almost the same question in a different way I got the same response. And then asked if I had anything else. And I said ""I want you to note that I asked why this company has me speaking to a virtual recruiter that can't answer my questions about the duties and place I'd be working for."" Got a boilerplate apology and then it asked me again if I had questions.

It's giving Brawndo on the crops energy. Hate it all."

Since day one I've realized that this company is not a good fit. I took a base pay cut with the understanding that with commission I would actually be making way more than what I was at with my previous job. I've never worked anywhere with commission so I was hesitant but I was shown excel sheets and pay trends so I went forward with it. The company however did not disclose how poorly they were doing overall, meaning that my commission is leaving me making less than what I was making before.   


There are tons of other issues with sexist comments, micromanaging, and very toxic/inappropriate conversations about other employees. I was planning on quitting this week in person but things just took a turn and I need help with how to respond to this.   


The owner was gone at the end of the week and finally got back online late Friday night. He started sending me Slack messages about random things, nothing urgent and nothing client related. We were at dinner so I didn't respond, he then text me asking one of the non urgent questions again. While I am salary and do check in on accounts + respond to clients on weekends - these were not even company related questions and could wait until Monday (we're a normal 9-5).   


Early this afternoon he Slacked me again with just a ""?"" and the immediately text me asking if everything was okay. It has been three hours since then and he has now called me, text + immediately called my direct report, found my husband's phone number and text him, and also found my husband's coworker and text him as well.   


Most of my issues have been with the owner micromanaging and having trust/control issues but I never expected something like this. I'm torn on how to respond to him - do I just respond casually and then still quit in person this week or should I just do it now? I was planning on quitting on the best terms possible but I have no idea how to handle this now.

&#x200B;

Part of me really wants to make it clear that he has crossed a boundary by reaching out to so many people. All of his messages are saying he is just worried about me. If this was a situation where I just didn't show up to work I would get it, however this is just that I haven't responded to him over the weekend, which we do not actually work. But I also don't want to start an argument, I just want out asap.

I'm currently the most senior ""Support"" who's meant to do half of the back end stuff.  
4 months ago I got put under a new sales manager who doesn't do his work sits on his phone 80% of the day, gets sales by promising things there's no way we could do and fails to fill out paperwork properly, so I'm basically doing all his work for him to keep jobs coming through.  
Not to mention I not only trained him and the other sales managers, he was basically given the job I should have because he's buddies with one of the new higher managers.

I joined this company because I was told promotions was a big thing they did and thrived in, rather than getting in new hires. Then 6 months ago management changed and continues to change, they've told me just before Christmas that they're no longer promoting internally and if I want to move up I'd have to change to another company and then come back.  
Who the f\*ck thinks someone would come back to a company if they're told they wouldn't promote them?  


Best news is I had a few other companies reach out a couple weeks ago for a sales manager position and I can't wait to tell management I'm leaving and going to another company as they suggested. 90% of the workers in my area have only been her a few months even at my level while I've been here 4 years and constantly asked how to do things still.

49,2024-02-18,Coworkers called me stupid and incompetent behind my back.,u/ThrowRA_electrical,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aubjod/coworkers_called_me_stupid_and_incompetent_behind/,antiwork,"So, I found out that two coworkers (one of them being a superior but not my direct supervisor) called me stupid, incompetent, and continued to trash talk me to a bunch of new contract staff. They mentioned private messages, questions I’ve asked them, and personal hobbies I have outside of work. I found out all this because someone involved in the conversation called me and told me everything that was said. 

One of the two coworkers have always been extremely short and rude to me, to the point where I’ve had to adapt and message them any questions I have because if I talked to them in person they’d be really dismissive and passive aggressive. The other (the superior) has said some passive aggressive stuff… but is usually fine. These two coworkers are bffs and hang out constantly outside of work AND the superior is the other coworkers supervisor.  

I’ve been here for slightly less than a year, but have been feeling overworked and under appreciated as of late. I’ve been suspecting that people are starting to give me THEIR work because they can get away with it, and my duties have expanded out of nowhere, and I am now expected to keep up. The position is entry level and doesn’t pay a ton, but the work load is huge and I’m required to attend lots of after hours events. They say I can flex my hours, but folks CONSTANTLY give me last minute requests with 24-48 hour turnarounds which makes it hard to flex. Unfortunately, the job is salaried so even though I feel like I’m working overtime, I’m not getting paid for it. Also, I just don’t love the job. 

I was already one foot out the door because of the reasons listed above, and after hearing about what happened I just feel like it’s a hostile work environment. The worst part of all this, is they have been lying to my face. They say I’m doing a great job, my direct supervisor praises me, but then these two say I’m terrible at my job but “not bad enough to fire”. They also complained about mistakes and slowness I’ve never been informed of. 

I reported this to HR since I believe this directly violates our anti bullying policy. I was planning on putting in my two weeks notice this week. I don’t have a job lined up because this came out of nowhere, but I have enough of a financial cushion to be okay for a few months. 

I wanted to post about this situation for some opinions and maybe validation. I’ve seen a lot of stuff online regarding workplace gossip saying to just “stick it out and ignore it” and I’m unsure if I’m overreacting or not."

As I am filling out FMLA and short term disability paperwork, it asks me if it’s a work-related illness or injury. I’m worried that if I say “yes,” that my company will make my life miserable. I’m having issues finding a new job, so quitting is off the table (for now). I believe you all when you say that HR isn’t my friend, so I never have made any formal complaints. Does anyone have any advice? I did reach out to a worker’s rights attorney, but I am waiting for a reply."

I've never taken a job that didn't offer better pay than wherever I was before. I've worked myself into exhaustion to get raises, bonuses, and overtime. I'm sore and tired every single day of my life.   
I have nothing to show for it. I make a considerable wage, but I cannot afford to be independent. I am 26, living with my parents and relying on them and its fucking unacceptable. Knowing I cannot afford even the basics despite working my hardest is embarrassing, disgusting, and downright disgraceful. 
I cannot afford the combination of rent, food, bills on my own. It amounts to far higher than I will ever make. I have to fight tooth and nail just to keep my head above water meanwhile the cost of everything keeps skyrocketing. 
Even if I do manage to save money what little I have disappears almost instantly for one reason or another. This time it was my car breaking down. I need medication to maintain my mental health but I can't afford that here either, because yay america. 
I have come to the sad conclusion that I will never be able to afford to live the way I want to. I will never travel. I will never marry. 
I will never have children because money will keep it all beyond my reach. Every time I get closer to the finish line of stability it gets moved beyond my reach and I'm done. 
And I'm done chasing the carrot. I'm done working and working working and working working and working working and working working and working working and working working and working working and working working and working working and working working and working working and working my whole life with nothing to show for it. 

I have no future because I have no money. I will never have enough money. I'm starting to feel like it is far more kind to end myself than to continue working toward a goal I will never, ever under any circumstances meet."

",u/pixiegoddess13,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aucmet/be_available_at_9_but_dont_clock_in_before_9/,antiwork,"I WFH in an hourly call center type of role. We were recently told we needed to be logged into and ""available"" in our call program at our shift start time: so ""available"" in the web-based software at 9:00 if our shift is 9-5. Before this many of us were logging on at our start time and therefore often not set to available until after our official start time. My manager explicitly said this might mean we need to log into our computer 5-10 minutes before. I rolled my eyes and complained to friends about this but malicious compliance engaged and started logging on ten minutes early and putting it on my timesheet. This has gone on for about a month and suddenly today I was told my manager will approve this pay period but I have to log my start time as 9:00. 

I know this is a matter of minutes but the principle matters to me and it adds up over the course of the week. Basically now I am being told to get logged into my laptop and the program so that I am set to ""available"" to take calls AT 9:00. But I'm also being told I cannot log anything earlier than 9:00 as my start time on my timesheet. It's literally not feasible to get logged into my laptop and get the program booted in one minute. I fully refuse to work off the clock especially considering I am hourly and very poorly paid.  I suspect if I go back to what I was doing before--i was ready AT 9am to boot my laptop but not fully into the software for a bit longer--I will just get in trouble for that.

My manager apologized for making me do this and I really like them, but know they are getting lots of pressure from above on this. But it's ridiculous to expect hourly employees at our pay rate to be working off the clock. Even when I worked retail it was expected we would clock in on time or about on time, and then take a few minutes to actually get to the register or whatever. 

I cannot lose this job but I also know I am a harder worker and have better customer satisfaction than many of my coworkers. I will not work off the clock. Does anyone have ideas here? Suggestions for what I can say or do? "

I tried to humour him and tried talking to him while working but I can’t talk and type at the same time so I just kinda let him talk and pretended to listen as I was working.

When he was done his rant he came up to my desk and asked me if I could look up a restaurant in our area that he wanted to go to for a late night dinner. I showed him the website and it showed it was closed. He asked me if I could call the restaurant to make sure and I put my foot down and said “no… they would have changed the hours on the website if they were going to be open late.”

He finally left. And I closed my computer and left on time thankfully.

It pissed me off though I didn’t let it show. How dare he talk to me like a secretary! I moved up the chain before he worked at the company so he wouldn’t have known me as a secretary.

I’m now wondering what my job description is. I do have one that I could ask HR for but all job descriptions are vague and say “other tasks that your manager assigns you” like how am I supposed to know when to put my foot down. I get behind because people (other than my manager) ask me for things right then and there, like your urgency doesn’t constitute an emergency on my end (or whatever that saying is). I’m the only one that can give them the information though. It still pisses me the fuck off!

And I've just been struck again by how awful training processes are in general for new employees.

Some examples from current and previous jobs:

- Been set tasks without any accompanying guides, based on a process I shadowed over 3 days during my first week. Expected to magically remember every step and complete it alone

- Asking questions and having to wait 1-2 hrs for a response on Teams

- Manager not tracking progress. No notes on where I've started, where I should be, how/ if my confidence is growing in certain areas

- Training left to others employees on my level and not undertaken by management (or little input from management). These employees clearly have not been giving any guidance on training either (I would also expect no pay incentives as well)

- Being left alone for hours as management figure out what to do with me/ are too busy to interact

- Processes not written down anywhere to follow


I would assume the answer to this is essentially money (not investing in training materials/ staff) and overworking management, as well as negligence in particular managers. Just ridiculous that its the same with every job I've ever worked.

I live in the UK, not sure if its the same elsewhere. It is absolute havoc on my anxiety/ overthinking and makes me feel like an idiot.

I enjoy working I don't enjoy being stressed and paid not enough for what I do however.   I work in the trades my job title is a welder.  BUT I do allot on our (non union) shop I run a piece of equipment called a tube Lazer it supplies allot of material and work for other parts of the shop and we have had someone quit so it's down to me and essentially one other guy to run it and we are backed up.   

I have many responsibilities other than just running it.   Set ups tear downs move material with a overhead crane. Use fork lifts.  There is equipment that I know better than most people in the entire company ( probably 70 in total ).  I can be placed just about anywhere in the entire shop and get something done.    I'm not the fastest or most efficient employee but I also feel (and know they don't give a shit about us lie to our faces during quarterly meetings)  

My point and what I need help with hence me talking about being ""autistic"" I do genuinely struggle socially especially in a situation where I get anxious or haven't experienced allot of like our yearly ""performance meetings""    everyone gets a ""standard 3% "" and it's bullshit     I make about 19 an hour (remember my title is a welder they are paid the best out of everyone to begin with plus everything else I'm able to do ).     

So I'm wanting help when my meeting comes around I would love to know how to negotiate for more money so I can afford to eat and maybe move away from my parents (in my late 20s now)    

If I could have dialogue boxed pop up with things I could say like in fallout or something then I think id be better at stuff like this.       Anyone have scripts or tips and tricks,   I've been looking at working somewhere else closer to home because I can't afford to drive 30 minutes to work anymore.     

I'm sorry for the long post I type in a ""stream of consciousness"" style. Whatever I think goes down.   I try and proof read but I generally end up adding more bullshit.

My health has slowly declined ever since I started work in the corporate world after college. Thr first year was fine, but I have changed roles a few times and as they’ve increased in “difficulty” (mostly chaotic), my health has plummeted.

Mental health ebbs and flows—I certainly miss the old me and don’t have any sparkle left. My work meltdowns depend on the chaos.

What I’m concerned about is my physical health. I developed horrid GI issues, which has really taken a toll on mental health with brain fog, body issues, etc, but my chronic stress levels are now impacting my hormones. I found out I don’t have any progesterone which makes me, by default, infertile. The hours of sitting has ruined my pelvic floor, ugh.

The problem is I want to like my job. I always knew it wasn’t forever but it’s a very rare opportunity that’s hard to get into if I leave it. I live in NYC so the high rent and need for an income has me in a chokehold.

I know at my core my body can’t keep doing this but I don’t know if my mental health can take leaving it with no financial security.

I've always wanted to develop my own app, hire a team to do so and put my own internet venture out there, and as soon as I hit that realization i emailed my boss and formally announced my resignation. Its funny because i studied for 4 years in this college to have a job as good as this one, I stayed there for 8 months only to realize this is not the life I wanted at all, i honestly don't see myself doing this for 40 years. I'll try best to become financial independent and analyze my options, my parents are obviously disappointed but this is the first time in my entire life im doing what i want....wish me luck in doing so 🤞"

I've been at my new job for 12 weeks now, taking a leap of faith and transitioning to a different industry after two decades. However, it feels like I'm navigating through a maze blindfolded. Why? Well, for starters, I've never met my line manager. They work in a different branch, and their whereabouts remain a mystery to me.

To add to the frustration, I haven't been assigned a desk or computer. Instead, I find myself scavenging for available workstations left vacant by absent colleagues. Sometimes, I'm even forced to switch computers multiple times a day based on availability. It's hardly conducive to productivity or a sense of belonging.

Initially brought on board to cover someone's holiday break, I find myself in limbo now that they've returned. No one seems to know where I fit in or what tasks I should be tackling. It's a disheartening experience, to say the least.

To top it off, there's talk of relocating me to another branch—an hour's commute each way. Yet, even there, I'm told there won't be a designated workspace waiting for me. It's like being a nomad within my own workplace.

Feeling lost and forgotten, I took the initiative to reach out to my manager last week, expressing my frustrations and even offering a solution to contribute meaningfully. Unfortunately, it seems my message fell on deaf ears, as my manager was on leave and didn't bother to inform me. They returned today, yet my plea for guidance remains unanswered.

So here I am, reaching out once more, not just for assistance but for a sense of direction and belonging. If anyone out there has been through similar experiences or has advice to offer, please lend a helping hand. I'm ready to contribute, but I need a roadmap to navigate this unfamiliar terrain."

The job has been hell since day one - sexist comments, micromanaging, control issues, and totally inappropriate critical conversations about other employees (think degrading, not constructive criticism). And on top of that they didn’t disclose that the company was doing poorly, so my commission is much lower than what they originally said it would be. 

I’ve been planning on quitting at some point but I hit a breaking point today. We work 9-5, and while I’m upper management, I try to have healthy boundaries with work. I check accounts and respond to clients after hours and over the weekend but I try to keep non emergencies/non urgent convos to at least the work week. 

The owner of the company Slacked me late Friday night asking if I had a calendar invite he could send to an acquaintance so they could meet me. He then followed up saying it wasn’t urgent. About ten minutes later he text me saying the same thing. 

We were at a diner so I didn’t respond to him and planned on discussing it Monday morning. The owner then reached out this afternoon asking if I was okay and proceeded to text and call multiple people at work to see if anyone had heard from me. 

He then somehow found my husband’s phone number and text him asking if I was okay, emailed him, and also text one of my husband’s coworkers. 

This was a total red flag for me so I ended up texting the owner and president that I was putting my two weeks in.

I know this might seem like a dumb reason to quit, but this was definitely just the final straw. I’ve never done something like this and I just feel so relieved for standing my ground. 😭 "

I received an invitation to a business trip from my company, which was clearly sent to me by mistake. However, upon accepting the invitation, I was able to see all the details about the trip, including the expenses and budget involved.

What shocked me is the amount of money being spent on this trip – we're talking about a budget of around $100,000. Meanwhile, I've been feeling increasingly frustrated about being underpaid for the work I do. Seeing this kind of expenditure just adds fuel to the fire.

I'm at a loss for what to do next. Should I bring up my concerns about being underpaid alongside the issue of extravagant spending on trips? Or should I tackle these problems separately?

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? I could really use some guidance on how to approach this delicate situation without causing unnecessary conflict.

Thanks in advance for your help and advice!

I tried to look the question mention above up online and it seems like a lot of the articles don't apply to my situation, especially when you throw the pandemic and then just not being able to find work in my field, and having to deal with finding out I'm hard of hearing for the first time\* and the subsequent training thrown into the mix. 

I have been driving a carpool for my roommate and partner, but outside of that I haven't really been ""working"". I don't consider carpooling work since I don't get paid more than to cover the extra gas. Should I add it to my resume, and how would I describe it at an interview, if I did add it to my resume to cover the work gap?

I live with AuDHD, so I tend to over-explain things a lot of the time when I really shouldn't, and my brain will talk faster than my filter, so I'm trying to cover all my bases ahead of the curve this time. Once I actually find work again, I'd like to try not to give too much information out for a change, unlike what I used to do, because it has backfired more often than not outside of the public sector, unless I'd find someone decent which seems to be missing more often than not in the private sector.

\*Basically, I was diagnosed for the first time, I knew there was something wrong with my hearing all my life, I just didn't know what was going on except something is wrong and I'm falling behind my peers. And once I had to start relying on captions, I really knew it had something to do with my hearing, but I finally found out that I wasn't imagining what was happening to me. Basically I can hear perfectly, just had a problem in my brain with how it registers what I hear."

There are 3 to distribute their work evenly so everything gets done. But bc we are short staffed they help us out with our work so we dont get packed with the custumors and the daily chores we got to do. 

So most of the times only 1 teamleader makes the schedules and upload them to the app. We have an app where we can ask days off, give our vacation, and see out schedules. But we also have the schedules in paper were everyone is on and that is hanging in the breakroom. We have this because sometimes we switch shifts and this would be noted on the paper one, but not immidiatly on the app bc we are all busy, I get this.

But for this weekend i was off the whole weekend. And one of my closest friends is gonna celebrate her birthday this weekend and wanted to make it into a slumber party. I said i can join and will be there.

So last friday night when i had an evening shift i saw on the paper schedule that i was planned to work on sunday, but this wasnt put in the app. So i said to the teamleader who was with me that i didnt even knew about this shift, and i already made plans for that day so i cant come. I showed him the app to confirm that i wasnt lying just so i could get out of a shift. He saw what the problem was and all he had to say was ""i didnt make the schedule so you should talk to the one who did."" 

He also explained that it wouldnt be a problem that i wouldnt be comming bc they have plenty of time to figure something out. So i wasnt worried.

Now this morning the teamleader who is responsible for this schedule added the shift for sunday on the app and said in the group chat that there has been some problems lately with the app so if we wanted to know our schedule we have to keep an eye out for the paper one. 

I know i may be over dramatic, but i had problems with this teamleader begore. No one likes her, and even some of my co workers went to HR about her. I also filed an complaint but that has bever gotten further then my region manager. Im just scared that they will use this bug as an excuse to force me to come in on sunday when i literally cant. So i just want some advice on how to go about this conversation and how to handle it when they wont give in that they made a mistake.

Thank you in advance

There is so much to life that this world could be giving us, yet there are so many reasons that every single person is ultimately trapped in serving a system that's fundamentally unbreakable, unchangeable, the world of business has become absolutely engrossed in every single facet of our lives, every single thing we consume has some form of branding, every piece of art is owned by a company, the places we live in? We're given those only by the generosity of banks. This system is enforced and keeps the status quo by an upper class of elites who want nothing more than for their material wealth to compound, grow and hoard. Private interests practically own numerous politicians, funding their campaigns and rarely making an impactful change in our lives all in the service of keeping the economic machine growing, for what? In a world of over eight billion people, these eight billion are just supposed to uphold this status quo, for eighty million scrooge mcducks? Eighty million people hold half of our world's wealth in their pockets, while the rest of us literal billions are left to fight over the rest. 

Picture this, the country of Germany holds just over eighty-three million people, now imagine this single country holds fifty percent of the world's wealth and dictates how the rest of the world works, acts, what we eat, what we enjoy, while the rest of the world serves their beck and call while they simply get to keep growing that wealth while they wine and dine. This is literally the world we live in! Except those eighty million people stand at the highest tiers of the most powerful countries, enforcing their will on us while we sit back and just move through each day, letting this systemic injustice continue to happen, all in the name of a system that will continue to exploit us until the final stages of our lives. People say we're long past the days of kings and queens, absolute power in the hands of single individuals who reap all the rewards of their servants' work. I would say these people simply changed from kings and queens to CEO’s. 

Our world is dying, our inaction in letting the capitalist machine grow is not only impacting our ways of life, but it's destroying the world in which we call home, in our lifetime we'll be past the point of no return. Billions of people will inevitably die all in the name of the fucking dollar. This 1% doesn't care, they'll keep enjoying the finest lives until the well runs dry and their inaction and ours kills the rest of us.

I just don't understand, why does everyone stand for this? Why can't everyone wake the hell up? Realise that the system that we continue to participate in is going to be the system that kills us. We spend our lives being caught up in battles of right versus left, religion, race and all of these things continue to get shoved in our face by media companies that are at the beck and call of this 1%. Hell I'm literally posting this on a page worth more than ten billion.

People will read this and a good chunk of people will say “Oh this guy's a lunatic.” I just don't understand why so many damn people are just okay with this? Why the hell doesn't this world rise up and take back what belongs to the rest of us? Let the damn world work towards fixing our environment, spreading across the stars, letting art blossom and grow, let humanity be the utter best it can be instead of it being put under the damn designer boots of some guy who hasn't known a hard days work in their damn lives.

I'm just so tired, I know we're just on a trajectory for destruction and everyone being so wrapped up in their lives that are created for us by the machine of industry will be our own downfall. I just wish the world could wake up and save itself.

1,2024-02-19,(Rant) I hate my coworker,u/Apexpred1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1auly6z/rant_i_hate_my_coworker/,antiwork,"I had a “clopening” where I worked late last night and had to be back early in the morning. I agreed to that; ’m in school right now so that was the only way I can get my hours .

But needless to say I get very little sleep this semester and I was only going to be able to get 4hrs of sleep max and that was if I fell asleep right away last night.

Anyways it’s midnight, I feel myself finally getting asleep (sand crusts forming around my eyes, about to enter that rem cycle). And then I’m awoken by a sound of a text (yes I could’ve silenced my phone but no one ever texts me after midnight if not serious-plus I’m a lead occasionally someone will text me they quit so I do want to know if there is coverage on the overnight). 

So I get up thinking this must be something about someone quitting or calling off. Nope it was my old clingy coworker I had just seen a few hours ago texting me “hey you left without saying bye!”…

I didn’t even reply cause I was so mad I was woken up over that stupid sh*t and didn’t want to reply something mean like stfu. Couldn’t go back to sleep cause she had me heated over this nonsense. Like first of all i don’t have to say bye to anyone (I say bye/good night to people in my vicinity, I’m not going to another room to find you). Second of all it’s late, why are you texting people stuff like that so late (idc that she didn’t know I had to be back at work)?

Just ugh. Should I say something? I haven’t seen or spoken to her "

How many stones do recruiters want to put in our way? 'People don't wanna work anymore' my ass. When I asked why they didnt make an appointment with me they said 'its our way to make sure people can't prepare too much'


That's straight up unfair, or am I just soft? I get wanting the raw truth but i apply for several jobs at once.I HAVE TO. My literal life depends on it. You cannot expect me to immidiately know shit while I am having my breakfast coffee.

193,2024-02-19,[Teacher] I was fired for putting in my 2 weeks and my students were punished for no reason,u/Achrias,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aumni5/teacher_i_was_fired_for_putting_in_my_2_weeks_and/,antiwork,"As of this week I am officially no longer a teacher. I spent 5 years with a nonprofit after-school program in NYC. During this time I taught at 5 schools per week and answered to 5 directors, only one of whom had any teaching experience.
I submitted my two weeks notice, a unique letter to each of the five highlighting the things I've enjoyed across our five year relationship, and for one director, I added that I was hurt by her asking me to find my own replacement after admitting to her last year that I was considering leaving because I was verbally abused by both a coworker and a director at another site, had it recorded, got threatened with lawyers by the org for having it recorded, then got kicked out of that site once they realized it was legal to record in NYC just to sweep it under the rug.

I received a response from only 2 of the 5 directors I sent these letters to. Classes went smoothly for the first two days of classes with directors who did respond, the third made the excuse of being too busy to respond, but that night I got an email by upper management explaining that I needed to call them ASAP. The next day I was informed over the phone by the creative directors who oversee my directors that I was not needed at my final two classes because I had been replaced. When I explained that I wanted to say goodbye to my students in person and would prefer to finish the week, I was told no need, it's covered, explaining that me coming in would only muddy the transitional process of the new hire and they then hung up.

I am a game design / digital media instructor. My classes are project-based and my students work extremely hard for months leading up to the final class where I hold a convention where teachers, parents, and students can come see their projects and it's always a blast. My resignation letter explicitly asked for additional space this year if possible so we could end my final classes on a high note. In my head, the situation sucked but even if some random took over the event at least the students would have their moment to shine.

My coworkers at each site reached out to me at both sites I was forbidden from attending letting me know that my classes were cancelled, no replacement was ever hired, and my students were placed in study lab which is just everyone on their phones. Their projects were never showcased. The students were told by management that I left without warning. Additionally, the directors were openly talking horribly about me, one going as far as calling me a ""bitch,"" claiming that ""everyone has been trying to fire him for ages now"" even though as one of the only tech teachers in the program, I work the most hours for the most sites. Teachers and TAs were also lectured to ""maintain professionalism"" and to ""never sour business relationships."" 

I reached out to both the directors and upper management, no response. I was not expecting some grand farewell celebration but I DEFINITELY wasn't expecting to become public enemy #1 after years of holding such a high reputation at this organization, let alone watch my students get punished as a consequence.

Does anyone else have any experience with this kind of situation? What kind of action can even be taken here?

Bonus detail: We made $18k-22k annually and raises were forbidden. Directors regularly received bonuses.

(I will also gladly name the organization if the mods allow it so that any NYC parents in the sub can avoid it at all costs)"

I decided to Google some of the financial statements of these companies, and I found out that most have tens of millions in assets, including tens of millions in the bank alone, while also receiving tens of millions (sometimes hundreds of millions) in revenue! 

These statements conveniently don't reveal how much the CEOs or executives get paid. So I had to Google this instead, and I found out that in some charities were paying over $350,000 per executive!

So now it just seems super weird to volunteer all that time and effort. I know that volunteering for charities has non-monetary benefits, but I can't help but feel that they're abusing our kindness with unpaid work, especially knowing the piggybank they sit on and allocate to themselves. It just doesn't sit right with me that they can't pay me even $20 an hour to volunteer at a week-long festival for 6 hours a day."
1,2024-02-19,Cursing at work?,u/Royalewithnaynays,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1auo2jy/cursing_at_work/,antiwork,"For slightly-irrelevant context, I am quitting this job due to an injury I sustained on the 11th that renders me incapable of working for the time being.

Now to the meat of it. 

The week before last, on the last day I worked, I got verbally reprimanded by my supervisor for saying a single curse word in earshot of one of the higher-ups in the company. 

In this job, for two years, I have been a contract part-time employee at the lowest possible rung of the company. There has never been any problem with my language before, but the PM supervisor (she is relatively new, hired in October last year I believe) is a bit controlling. For example, she pushed forward an SOP that said you had to call off a full week in advance for your scheduled shift, or you would be given one strike out of four, and the fourth you get terminated. I have migraines and back problems and other health issues that can pop up unexpectedly, but she is unmoving on the policy and currently I'm sitting at three strikes because I had one bad week and had to call out from a shift I *volunteered to take to save their asses*, and then the strike three was me calling out for last week due to the injury. Just an example of how she's changed our once-chill work environment. And despite my health issues, I hate missing work because that's missed pay that I need.

I was on the end of my lunch, which I started 5 minutes late, and I heard my supervisor say something with my name from the other room. I am autistic and ADHD, so my brain to mouth filter is poor at best. This supervisor and i and i usually have a good rapport, so I said ""heard you were talkin' shit!"" jokingly. She didn't seem to have a problem with it at the time, and came to hand me the keys for the company vehicle. I told her I had 5 minutes left and she made a face and asked me why. I explained that I was 5 minutes late due to having to pull the vehicle into the garage, and I wanted to take my entire break. I've always been assertive about getting my full lunch. 

After work, it was just the four of us closing up, and she seemed in a rush to get me out the door. Before everyone else got back to the office, she pulled me aside and reprimanded me for cursing. She told me it was unprofessional and I upset the higher-up, quoting her title like I'm supposed to care in my position. God knows that higher up doesn't even know my name and probably doesn't care if i live or die. She added that I need to be more professional at work, and with my coworkers, and that I need to show the best face possible for our site and our company. 

My issue here is that I was on break. It's a small office, so there's nowhere for me to sit and eat that isn't in earshot of everywhere else. I don't think I should have to be perfect while I'm eating my lunch. 

Besides that, who even gets upset at a single curse word? Is this person so removed from reality that she thinks we're a corporate office? 

I'm remembering it and wondering if, when I am able to work again, the current company can ""talk shit"" about my professionalism. 

I am (was) the top performer on my shift, professional while I was on the clock, dress moderately and keep myself clean of course. 

Am I overreacting? Please be kind."

Is there anything I can do?,u/TessyBoi-,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1auoo2q/job_is_cutting_ot_and_forcing_us_to_give_up_a/,antiwork,"CONTEXT: I am a social worker in a group home. I work with behavior analysts, assist my residents, follow behavior plans, do chores around the house, administer medications, etc. The company I work for (company A) provides the operations to live: house, food, transportation, managing residents’ funds, setting up appointments, etc. We work with another company (company B) that provides services for our programs: counseling, behavior plans, med reviews, services accommodating for needs residents might have. I work in the behavioral home. We see violent behaviors, and because of that, we are paid the most out of the rest of the homes. All of the homes/programs except for mine are funded by company A. Company B funds my house. I’m not too sure why it’s that way, but it is. 

Company A has made the decision to cut all of our over time and to also cut one shift a week. To compensate being short a shift, they’ve told us whoever is cut that week can pick up a shift at a different home. This is a ridiculous compromise because none of us are trained for any other program. That means we would have to be re-trained for that house—and it wouldn’t even be the same person every week because the shift that is getting cut is random. So one week it might be me, another week it’s someone else. Not only is it a headache for us and that other program, but we would be getting paid our same wage—meaning we would be getting paid more than the workers who’ve worked in that house for however many years. A total slap in the face. 

The reason we got for these decisions? The office told my managers to tell us “budget concerns.” How is it budget concerns when we are not in company A’s budget? This has to be a bold face lie. I’ve already told my managers I will not be going to another program or giving up my shift until they come down and give us an explanation. I might even go to the office and ask what is going on. 

I’m looking for other jobs but it is impossible to find anything that pays as well as I’m getting paid now. So for the mean time, can y’all help me out? Do I have any rights in this situation? Can I demand transparency? Or am I just fucked?"

I was an overachiever in school, great grades, teachers pet, top achievements, awards every semester, football top scorer in the school, districts top scorer, graduated from best university in my country. 

I joined the workforce with the same mentality and attitude and boy did I pay for it. I started off, learning everything, working overtime, kissed the bosses shoes, jump onto work that was not mjne, carried it all on my back, salary increased 10 percent over 6 months. Had my career path all planned out, I wanted to study masters degree while working full time, worked out every morning at 545am went to work at 830 on my feet till 530, jogged in the evening, came back studied for work the next day. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. 

Few months into this started to get anxious as my bosses told me I am due for a promotion to lead the department by the end of this year, they told me this right after getting my salary. Then, life threw, a middle finger at me. I had to go for an eye surgery from a previous injury, literally the night I was discharged, one call after another. I made my team mates depend on me too much. I jumped into every job I got. Let me do it, let me do it, I said everytime. Right after coming back from surgery. The burn out hit. 

Project after project, calls after calls, I messed up, I carried too much on my back. Bosses started to put too much hope in me. Then my team started to drop, from 6 people, to 5, to 4, to 3. Workload double and triple. 

I snapped, I returned the project from another department I took to the boss, he was shocked. I started ignoring call for problems that they can solve themselves. But it was too late. I already sold all my hobbies, stopped playing games, stopped doing fun stuff, sold my PS5 that was so hard to get last time. Damage was done.

I burnt out, crying everyday, getting treated like shit by clients and inspectors, demeaned. Fear of failure everytime there was an acceptance test. I was at my limit. Shit why did I try so hard. Fk the career, I just want to do my job and go home and do fun stuff again. I want to live again. I want to feel human again.

Sorry for long post

TLDR, I fked up, worked too hard first 1.5 years at work, now its biting me back, scared to go to work, crying everyday. Dont know how to solve this. I dont wanna quit, I want the money. I want the balance, I dont want to give too much at work anymore. Im tired, fk expectations.

I've tried to wreck my brain all of last night on what to do. Both parents are telling me to just ""deal with it"" and I feel like an absolute idiot because it feels like I'm not even trying anymore. But that's the thing, even though it's part time work, I'm already burnt out from season change overs, not having a consistent schedule and getting paid very little, then dealing with my supervisor's passive aggressive behavior or lack of response because she's inconvenienced from me calling out. I understand the frustration and inconvenience, I do but there's things like the flu or personal matters that I can't control from happening. 

I wanted to go MIA today because this shit is just too overwhelming right now. It shouldn't be. It sounds so stupid too. I feel like not returning either. I don't even know what I should tell them anymore. If I quit before getting another job, I'm screwed. It could take months for me to find another job on top of that.

Long story short, we are two salesman at my work, and our boss wants us to put units on marketplace. According to him, it works, and we should use it as much as possible. As most know, people on marketplace are an absolute pain to deal with, and getting message after work is very annoying. 

One of the employee doesn't want to do it and is being threatened because of it. To add to this story, my boss got locked out of marketplace for what I believe was posting too much stuff on it. Another reason why the employee doesn't want to do it. 

Are we wrong for thinking this is a very stupid situation and he cannot force us to use our own social media to share stuff for work..? As much as our income rely on sales, I don't think its the way to go."

Usually when I take time off, it's to visit family, which I'm sorry to say is usually not a relaxing endeavor. I took time off for me, and I see things so clearly now. I knew I was unhappy of course, every day had felt monotonous and empty, I was coping with weed and alcohol to get through the days, feeling stuck and hopeless as a waitress.

But over the last week, I went on a 45 minute walk every day, went to the gym a couple times, had friends over, tried new recipes and cooked a lot, played video games and watched anime, basically just let myself do whatever simply because I wanted to. My low libido issues also disappeared in like two days. It's been fucking incredible.

I even got started converting my basement into an art studio, because I've been neglecting my creative side since I keep only thinking about what I want to do with my life and career instead, that toxic ""if you're not being productive you suck"" mindset. 

I don't want to go back to work. I don't want to lose this newfound sense of happiness and revitalization. I tried shrooms for the first time last night which was amazing and solidified my desire to stop caring so much and live for myself instead of a capitalist society.

We were all employees classified as “seasonal workers” (it is bananas to me how few of the labor law protections apply to this classification of worker) with 7 month contracts. We were were allowed to sleep in a bunk dorm at the office for free. We were paid a flat day rate “per trip”. Any time not working there was no pay. One of the things stated repeatedly by the owner and manager was: that you do not leave town just because the schedule doesn’t have you running a tour because it is subject to change it any moment. The owner put in writing (emails) to multiple people that there are “no second jobs allowed and no one is allowed to leave town without approval.” 
Management has since fired almost all of their senior tour leaders. One of them has approached me about joining a lawsuit he wants to spearhead for no “on-call pay”. I have enough ill will towards these people after a season of toxic management that I am inclined to throw in with this thing just on principal BUT HERE’S MY REAL QUESTION: am I looking at an emotionally brutal, uphill battle just to attempt justice for a thing that has a snowballs chance in hell of winning? I’m guessing whatever lawyer takes this it will go to arbitration not a courtroom and the company will have significantly better resources to tie it up and drag all involved through the mud until it goes away.

I asked if I was being promoted to that same pay level. Was told no due to the type of work I did.  For the next year I consistently asked about moving to that pay level. Was always told no.  I always had great reviews and helped the new hires often with what they were working on.

Hi everyone. I am just looking for a bit of advice before I raise a bit of hell on my end; because frankly… I am pissed. 

This year we did not get Christmas Bonuses, instead we were all invited to a Christmas dinner at a restaurant instead. The dinner landed during one of my shifts, and I was told that if I wished to attend not to worry about my shift, that it would be covered and I could work my partial shift and the rest would be taken care of. 

My shift was 4 hours instead of 10 hours, and I was paid for only 4 hours. My dinner cost maybe 1.5 hours of my wages. I was never told I would be forfeiting 6 hours of wages for a “bonus” dinner. For other company dinners others have been compensated for their hours they were scheduled for to attend the dinner / meeting. 

Is this a loss I should just bite the bullet for, or is this worth going to management and trying to get compensation for? I feel like I ended up paying for the “bonus” dinners for 4 other staff members as well as my own when I could have just stayed and worked my shift. 

I’m in Canada if that helps for labour laws. "

I have a fucking Masters degree. I graduated and couldn't get a job anywhere in my field and got tossed around in interviews for months. They all wanted experience, which I had no way of getting unless I got a job there. And I even was told I was overqualified and got sent to a different place that rejected me. I ended up working at a grocery store and stayed there last a year despite how awful it was and how terribly the store was ran by our old manager. I dealt with so much shit there but most of my coworkers were great, they were the one thing keeping me from completely losing my shit. I eventually got a job few months ago in the field I wanted to work in. Honestly I like my job, I get a lot more down time and am significantly less stressed because I don't work at a fucking grocery store where I get yelled at for romaine not being in stock. The problem is, I am paid way less here. I don't have benefits. My paid time off is nill for the first year. I work 8:30 to 5 Monday through Friday so anytime I need to go the doctors I have to eat that out of my own paycheck. I'm chronically ill and I never talk about it because I'm afraid that's going to make me a liability. I've just learned to live with it because I can't afford to live any other way. The only way I can afford living is because I share a one bedroom with my partner. We get free food through his work, which is also slightly above minimum wage. We never eat out and only subscribe to one streaming service. I've debated going back to working grocery just to be more financially stable. My commute is killing me with rush hour traffic. I can barely even boot up video games I used to enjoy. It takes me weeks to finish one art piece anymore. How do I live this? How does anyone live like this? I don't see a way out of this. I am dead in the water and I am only approaching my mind twenties."

Can I take legal action?",u/SAMPAI1337,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1auuuz5/working_for_a_corporate_hospital_a_food_service/,antiwork,"&#x200B;

Hello everyone! I work as an NSA (Nutritional Service Aide/Retail Food) in a corporate hospital down in PA. I have been for a whole year now and I witnessed something very alarming that could've very much been prevented when it happened the first day.

About 2-3 weeks back, we had a corporate manager come down to ""help"" with our cafeteria (Metz is the name of the food service, they're pretty much contracted to provide for the cafeteria to help reel in some money for our President, if he has any concerns of profits, the Metz Manager comes over to see how he can ""help""). His help usually just consists of moving things around, changing what we sell without going through proper channels, and causes chaos for our other divisions of retail food service (Trayline, Cafeteria, Commons, etc).

The corporate manager had the bright idea of removing our oven from its original correct placement to the other side of the grill and smack on the middle of our station. My coworkers were very against the idea and quickly voiced our disagreement and said it wasnt safe, especially me the most; I told him it wouldn't be great and would hinder a lot of our already quick and fast movement throughout the lineup of our cafeteria. Our middle food station has our hotbox/warmer that holds the extra food, to replace the main plate if the sides or entrees are all eaten, and holds our tenders and fries that me and my co-worker make, then put in to store while we're making more, its our hotspot. I continued to him that it would very much cause burns and heavily congest that middle area, removing our quick and fast workflow. He didn't take our advice and didn't listen, the very next day, my co-worker and I clock in and walk into the cafeteria to start setting up and see the oven in the middle area.

The first day was brutal, prepping was horrible and too cramped since its literally not meant to be there. I had to dodge hot 400 degree trays my co-worker had while I'm stocking items. A huge problem that I called out, was how when I was bending over to pick up some meats in our grill drawer, the 400 degree steel metal oven door can swing out and directly hit my face. After that ordeal, it got worse when I was taking out some bacon from the oven, the oven door bounced back due to the improper placement and tons of hot grease splashed on my hand. Luckily, I had gloves but if I didn't it would've for sure been a nasty 3rd degree burn. I complained to 3 of our managers, that this needs to be moved back to its correct placement, one of them was concerned and said they'd notify them and order the oven moved back.

Yesterday though is the real kicker. We work every other weekend and for the weekend, we have to clean the back of the grill which is fine. I was cleaning the last half of the grill when I noticed a rectangular shape and thought it looked like a power strip. I turn it over and was fuming with anger. it was a power strip, a cheap one that looks like you'd but it for 10 bucks, plugged onto the original outlet the oven was hooked up in without a strip and the oven was plugged into the power strip and then the oven. Mind you, our oven is gas powered right next to a gas power and behind the wall of our cafeteria is a closet of CO2 tanks meant for carbonizing our sodas. “This could’ve probably killed us” was the thought that all of us were saying and freaking out about when I brought it to them.

We contacted, security and they said they shouldve contacted the engineering divisions of the hospital to even approve something like this, but they wouldve declined the idea cause of the safety hazard. The strip was CAKED with grease. Now, my co-workers were saying how I could sue since me and my co-worker are usually the main ones working the grill and for 3 weeks straight they never told us about the strip until I discovered it.

Is there any grounds for me to file a lawsuit? Would I and my girlfriend (whose my co-worker) even win in this situation?"

I work because I have to.  I hate every second of it, I think it’s a waste of oxygen, and wish I didn’t have to work, period.  However, I also would not find work “enjoyable” or find any valor in it even if employers upheld a social contract and tried to promote a healthy working environment that fostered a great “work/life balance.”  I have no passion to do anything that puts me on a schedule, that makes me beholden to someone else. In my opinion there is no pot at the end of the rainbow for a lifetime of hard work.  There is no emotional fulfillment from it.  We’re all going to die, I don’t believe in an afterlife, and ideally I’d like to have a lifetime of 100% fun. 

Of course, if I want to have a lifetime of fun and be a full-time consumer, someone has to be working to provide that for me. My having a fat bank account means nothing if no one else is willing to work either.

So yeah, how do you wrestle with these thoughts?"

Why don't companies make it so that you are paid based on completing your work rather than the amount of time you are physically on site. Like ive completed all my work for the month and you want me to come in here and sit for 8 hours a day for the rest of the month when I've got nothing to do. But no instead I have to sit at my desk and appear to look busy...

I’m currently manning two “departments” (quotations because I’m solo in one of them) and basically just received a somewhat livable wage that I asked for. I was doing the same job minus one task for 2 years on a poverty line wage (thank god for my husband). I spin circles around almost everyone here, yet I was guilted for needing TWO days off… a total of 5 for the whole year so far (we have 20 days we can take). He said he needed to remind me of it being the busy season (it literally has not stopped being busy for over a year now) and that my role and responsibility falls on the company. He also brought up how I asked for “so much pay” (laughable imo bc it’s JUST on the livable wage line) and I need to do the job I’m paid to do. 

If I didn’t need my salary, I would’ve quit right then and there, but I can’t until my husband lands a new role (he’s been applying to several and interviews are coming up, send him luck!!) or if I have another position in line. 

The sad thing is that I am moving up in roles, but all while still helping at the bottom of the totem pole. I basically have two full time jobs. 

Just needed to vent. I cannot believe everything I was told in our conversation. I’ll admit, I came on a bit strong willed but necessary when I bust my a** daily and during the holiday season, I work 10-12 hours daily! I’m so burnt out, I could cry. I worked my a** off for this treatment and still sh** pay! "

My OCD coworker was being annoying. I waved my finger no apparently so I think she made it up. I don't remember waving my finger. But I know I did it vertically to prove a point like a true academic. 

My boss is a headmaster like elderly  lady who is a task master.

I'm a 30 year old guy. I was mrely trying to work out the training given to me by the ocd coworker . I had to sign the probation extension which was not a good day for me.

I passed my probation  before christmas first stage. My probation got extended at my employment for another 6 months. I think with a little training, unreasonable demands, they think it motivates me. The senior i very talented at his job so its a bit sh't. He now openly gives me direction which is better, but it is the fact, on Friday, I find the material is low in stock. Senior coworker is off. Comes in Friday and knows about the issue so quickly . I planned to sabotage him, by not telling him until last minute. Since they give  me feedback last miniute, so that as defence, He does not go to the boss to tattle again, which he did. 

My senior coworker who kept ratting and tattling about my errors who has been here a decade blamed me for lack of  lab material, i kept overusing it. Which is true. I am 7 months into this job. They just want an improvement of body language  I think. On Thursday I Was hiding from my boss because she was in a foul mood the entire week. I hit my goals. I am an introvert, so I now have to shake my head like ronaldinho the brazilian footballler at work and pretend all is  good . While I interview elsewhere and plan another job. I just find some coworkers are assholes. This work is very fulfilling, highly technical , I would stay on permanent contract, however, I think for my mental health.

I had an LCL shipment that delivered last week. When I went into our system to check to see which trucker to use, there were two listed, numbered #1 and #2. We have been told numerous times to always go with the number 1 trucker unless they can't do it, or we've had a lot of problems with. I dispatched to the number 1 trucker. However, I didn't check that quote against our quote for our client. It ended up being $50 more than our quote to our client, leaving us with only a $40 profit (there are other charges separate from the trucking.) At most this was 50% my fault for not checking, but I received 100% of the blame. The quotation department is responsible for labeling the truckers, but they didn't receive any of the blame.  


On Friday, my boss sent me an email saying she would deduct $50 from my paycheck for this mistake, and that going forward all mistakes would be deducted from my paychecks. She seriously has it out for me. Despite all her efforts, some mistakes will always be made in this industry. You can't eliminate them all. I have even seen mistakes she has made that cost the company money, though being the owner, she would never admit to it. I don't make any more mistakes than anyone else, yet she always singles me out. This isn't the first time I have shared blame with someone else, yet received 100% of it. I had to send her a screenshot showing that it was illegal to deduct mistakes like this from our paychecks. She wasn't happy about it, but cut me a check today for it."

2732,2024-02-19,"My boss takes me off a project to punish me, I end up working on the same project at a different firm and watch the old firm burn as we save the project. ",u/xoxogossipcats,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1auzum7/my_boss_takes_me_off_a_project_to_punish_me_i_end/,antiwork,"Around a year ago I (F27) was working for this narcissistic, retaliative, bully VP (F55)  at an engineering firm. Finally, a year later, I get to watch her pay for her mistakes from the winning team. 

I was working as a junior project manager and had been working there for 2 years. I got asked to help out on 2 projects I was unfamiliar with since the PM was leaving and the projects were wrapping up. I was helping them format and compile their final reports the week before Christmas and put a lot of OT in. At the same time, the reports were being reviewed for their content by senior engineers. Those reviews came back negative, stating the reports were missing key information and that they were just copied and pasted from precious projects and a lot of errors occurred as a result. The VP sends me an email and rips me a new one. She blames me for allowing the reports to go to the reviewer with so many mistakes. I explained to her I was not involved in the projects, had no information about the content and was not asked to review the content, I was helping with formatting so we could get the reports out on time. I told her to reach out to the PM and the director (my direct supervisor/useless moron, M48) who had been leading the projects for months and who had clearly neglected checking the reports before they went to the senior engineer for content reviews. She was pissed at me but dropped it.

Come January, a new project starts, lets call it project X, that had been promised to me for a few months. I was under my utilization target and getting in shit from the VP for not having enough work. I was looking forward to getting started on the new project and getting her off my back. 

I was told I was no longer being chosen for managing the project. This was a very important new client and they needed to make sure the project went perfectly and under budget to get their foot in the door. If they succeeded on this project, it would line them up for years of future work with them. They wanted to run the project ""lean"" and couldn't afford me on it (even though I am paid the least of everyone in the company). Instead they placed a guy (M40) from another department with no PM experience or certifications and said he will use this project to trial being a PM... definitely not a waste of time or money to have a completely inexperienced person trial a new role on this project. Not to mention, he didn't want the role since he had his own full time job to do in his own department. 

This guy was floundering, had no idea what to do or how to set up a project for success. So he asks me. I start walking him through it. This is second day since the project started. I start telling him about the software we use for project management and that includes records of meeting minutes. He has never used the software and I am the company's resident software expert, often giving presentations to clients on the software for other PM's projects. The VP gets wind I am helping this guy and calls me into a call that was already going on with a few other junior PMs, and it was obvious they had been talking about me. She asked me what am I doing getting involved in this project. I explained I'm teaching the PM the software since he doesn't know it and asked me for help. I also said I am not billing the client for this time so need to worry about the financials of me helping him for a couple hours. She then asks me how he will record meeting minutes (why does she care, this is way below her paygrade.... micromanager!!!) I said he will use the software since that's company policy. She said no I want them in Word format. I know she is terrified of new technology so I explained that the software is valuable because it keeps everything together, the client can access them whenever, better for everyone, and it's company policy. She told me I need to learn my place and asked another junior PM (M27) to help onboard the new PM instead of me. I got off the call and was so upset by her shaming me in front of my colleagues and removing me from the project I was really looking forward to working on and had been promised for months. 

A few weeks later, I spoke to my boss/director that I thought the VP was upset with me and I don't know what to do about it. I asked for him to look into it for me and he said he doesn't want to be involved and I need to figure it out on my own. Then a month later I reach out to our 1 HR guy (M55) and explain the same situation - the VP is continuing to be hostile to me, my boss refused to help, and no one will assign me new projects. HR guy says I need to have more compassion for leadership since they have never had management training. No help.

Fast forward 6 months and I was talking to my director/boss about the promotion he had promised me before Christmas and never provided. He said he doesn't know anything about what I'm working on so he can't validate giving me a promotion. This guy skips all our one-on-ones, ignores me emails and messages, and has straight up told me he does not have time to be my boss. I told him to talk to the senior PMs I work with daily and they can advocate for my performance. He did and I heard about the conversation afterwards from the senior PM (M65) who was mentoring me. He informed me that my direct boss told him I was not being considered for a promotion because the VP was vetoing it. She had told all the leadership at the company that I was not fit to be a project manager and should switch to being an administrator - and referenced the projects I was helping format in December and how the content was bad.  Apparently it did not matter to her that I was not the PM on the project even though I had explained and she seemed to comprehend at the time. My mentor also confirmed that I had not been given any new projects for the same reason. It had been 6 months and I was asking for new work weekly and also getting regular nasty emails from the VP about my utilization being under target. This was beyond messed up to me since it was her job and my director's job to assign me to work and they had been purposely withholding work from me. I guess their plan was to get rid of me for being under utilization but couldn't as long as I was asking for work? 

Luckily, I was in the final interview stage for a new job at that point. It was with a competitor and I took it. I gave my 2 weeks notice and VP told me that I was going to be gone by the end of the day. I rushed to say bye to my coworkers before I was booted off my email. The HR guy asked me to do a survey monkey exit interview. I asked him if he remembered our conversation from earlier in the year where I told him how I was being treated. He did. I told him I'm not wasting my last day doing an exit interview for a company who can't action on direct feedback they received months ago. He was embarrassed and said he understood. 

I started at the new firm in August and realized quickly that they were working on project X, the same one I had been removed from for defending the usage of project management software at my previous firm. It's a small industry and we had overlap with my previous firm on several projects with different clients.  I heard that my old firm was fumbling and their project manager was terrible. Wssnt surprising to me since he had no PM experience, no support, and no interest in the job. At my new firm, I stayed away from project X for a few months to reduce the risk of working with my old firm and avoid the possibility of getting some type of legal retaliation for moving to a competitor. I consulted a lawyer and was assured that they had no grounds to come after me, but I knew they could still find ways to make my life miserable in this tiny industry, so why risk it.

Now its been a year since I was first kicked off project X and I am now working on it at the new firm. The project is approaching its final deadline and my old firm is nowhere near where they promised they'd be. They fucked up the project so badly that they are being replaced... by my new firm. The client had calls with us on how we can transition to their role and take on the scope they were not able to complete (almost all of it). There are 4 weeks left until the deadline and probably 4 months of work remaining. My firm is sending a quarter of our resources to the client site to do damage control, working 12h days to clean up my old firm's mess. They lost the client relationship. My old idiot boss has to report to my new boss (M34)  to close out the project. The VP is flying to the client site to kiss ass and beg for forgiveness. I am watching them burn, comfortably, from my new desk with my 20% raise and bonus, preparing the damage control schedule to close out the project. It is so sweet.

TLDR; my old firm took me off a project to punish me, their inexperienced PM let the project catch on fire, and my new firm is being given the scope of my old firm. I can't help but gloat knowing I never would have let this happen if they gave me the project as promised. I get paid more and get to watch the VP and director lose it all while my new firm is being reveled. And the VP couldn't keep me off the project after all - I just get to work on it from the winning team instead of the losing one. "

I worry that he is making me interview someone to essentially replace me. At the same time, he wanted me to create a dinner reservation for himself, a contractor and myself as the only employee for the company. I have strong suspicion that he wants to replace me, but then why would he host a company dinner party? Would he really take an employee out to an expensive restaurant just to fire him by next month? Maybe he is just handing the promotion over to someone else, but the job itself has a smaller salary than what I have now, so I have no idea why he would offer a project manager a base pay of $25-35k, while I sit on my ass and make 45k…. It would make sense that he would want to fire me to replace me with someone who can do more work for less pay, but to have me interview the candidates? I could just lie and say they were all terrible…. Would he think I am obviously or maybe I am overthinking?"

I’ve been searching for a new job opportunity for a while. I keep getting more and more ‘tests’ to complete. I’ve done a few of them. Many are personality tests and some are cognitive tests. I don’t input my name or other personal details; however, it does appear to have tracking embedded in the link. How else would the company that you’re applying to know it was you?

These sites are always 3rd party providers that supposedly analyze your answers and tell the company if you would be a good fit.

Here’s the problem. Between LinkedIn, Indeed, Dice, Monster, etc., along with these “Test” companies, I believe there are massive databases being established for each of us and will be sold off to the highest bidder, if they haven’t already opened it up for profit. I know they already mine data, but it's expanded beyond the usual basic info. Waaay beyond!

How far are we from having companies know your exact personality type, your Myers Briggs, your IQ, your political compass, and what you had for breakfast, the second you submitted your resume? Not to mention AI. I'm sure they've already started leveraging AI to spit back your ""social score"" within a few seconds. 

I’m going to start refusing these tests, personally. Companies can actually read my resume if they are capable and worthwhile. My resume and experience took me years to build and perfect, if they are sincerely interested in hiring a good candidate, they can actually read it. "

Short version: My manager stole my sale after snapping at me in front of a customer when she told me to clean some earrings. 

Aii so boom,

(BACKSTORY)
I (24F) work in a jewelry store and we recently got a new manager. This new manager (28F) has been causing a lot of problems with everyone on the team. Not only is she new to the store but she’s new to the company and new to the industry as a whole!! Why they hired her?? IDK!!

The rest of the team has been working together for over a year. We are a really close knit team and have always been very professional with each other despite us all being 20 something-year-olds. As a team, we always preformed well  and consistently placed amongst the top 10 stores in the company even when we didn’t have any type of management. That is until she started.

I think there’s a lot of reasons for this. Ever since she started there’s been a huge cut to our shifts. One of the stylists who’s been there for the longest had to leave not only the job but the whole state bc she went from working 40-50hrs a week to working only 4 or 5!! No one can afford to live in the city with a pay like that! The new manager loves to play favorites and uses her power to do so. 

Although I never liked her, I used to fall under one or her favorites because I have always been a top seller and stylist for the store. I also like to think I’m pretty professional and know how to be cordial
enough to keep my personal feelings out of the work space and overall mask my distaste for her better than some of my other coworkers. All this changed when I became pregnant. I’m about four months pregnant and have been having a rough pregnancy. Come to find out she’s been talking shit about me behind my back!! When I found out about this it really lit a fire that only got magnified today when she stole my sale!! 

(MAIN STORY)
I was working on the floor by myself bc my coworker had gone to the bathroom or went on lunch or something. Idk I was too busy working to be clocking what other people were doing. At first I was working w this lovely lady who wanted to look at some fine earrings. I pull out a couple of pairs for her and place them on a tray. Bc I had some pretty expensive pieces pulled out. I had to give her my full attention even when more customers started coming in. It wasn’t until another customer came up to me and asked for help with a return and broken piece that I stepped away to help her. It was easy for me to do so because the front desk was right next to the case with earrings so I was able to keep my eyes on the tray and help out the lady in front of me where as the other two customers were next to our fashion collection on the other side of the store. 

As I’m helping out the lady at the register my manager comes out of nowhere n interrupts me and I can tell she’s trying to take over the conversation. I jump back in and proceed to finish my conversation with the client where I’m explaining to her that the piece of hers tht broke we no longer carry but I can issue her credit that she can use for new pieces. She says she wants to look at earrings so I walk her over to the case with the earring right next to my previous client. 

At this point I check in with my original client n we narrow down her decisions. She’s now deciding between two earring. I grab another tray for her n put her two options there for her and take the tray full of the other more expensive earrings with me to the desk so I can work on issuing the credit to the other lady and keep my eyes on the expensive pieces. As I’m working on issuing the credit my manager comes up to me and tells me to focus on one task at a time and finish helping my client. I tell her that I am and that I am working on issuing the credit because my client is still deciding between earrings with her friend and so she asks me what’s up with the tray of earrings. I said they need to be sanitized before going back in the tray but because we are busy it’s not top priority. She rolls her eyes and asks if she can help sanitize them, I give her the tray and continue with my task.  

Before I can finish creating the gift card for my second client, my first client decides on a set of earrings and asks to look at some fashion pieces so I direct her to the other side of the store while
I grab her earrings at this point my second client asks my manger a question bc she sees I’m busy and my manger gets to helping her out. I don’t think much of it and finishing ringing my client out. Then I go to them and explain that I am
Now free and can finish up working with my second client. My manager snaps at me and says that she got it and told me to clean up the tray. It is a company policy that when customers are in the store we save tasks such as cleaning earrings until the store is clear unless they r needed. 

Because I know this and am good at my job  I go back to issuing the gift card for the client which takes precedent. By the time I finish issuing the gift card my manager has brought my client up to the desk and proceeds as if she is ready to check her out. At this point I say, I just finished issuing the gift card and I’m ready to check her out. My manager turns to me and says very rudely “I got it. Just clean the earrings.” at this point she has snapped at me three times and so I start to lose my temper. Because the customers right there I choose to keep my mouth shut and just clean the earrings, looking over my shoulder to see if my manager uses my register code to give me credit. Of course she doesn’t and just uses her code instead or else I wouldn’t be here. 

It ended up being an 800$ and she doesn’t even get commission. She’s been doing this a lot to everyone on the team and I’m sick of it. I want to write her an email because I don’t think I could have this conversation with her in person and keep my cool. Reminder I’m pregnant. These pregnancy hormones are no joke. Please help."

The system allows you just *enough* to keep you surviving.

It’s never going to pay you enough to achieve autonomy. It’s never going to help you get more education without saddling you with life-long debt. 

It’s never going to **empower** *you*. Full stop. 

It needs to keep you at the base level of [Maslow’s Hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs)—so busy trying to keep your head above water that you have no energy, time, or drive to do anything else.

We don’t *need* corporations.

Corporations need *us*. 

They need enough human ballast anchoring this system to keep it afloat. 

You, and me, we’re the *ballast*.

We’re the *chum bucket*—the **lure** to keep people above us from straying out of bounds. They smell *our* fear—and they don’t want to lose what little more they have than us—they wish they earned more, but they earn more than *you*—and that comparison is enough to keep them in check. 

The system uses you and your desperation to train the others just above you—to stay in line. And the others above *you* are used to keep those above *them* in line.

It (the system). Does. Not. Care. About. You.

But, we all just keep showing up day after day like scared, obedient serfs.

I wonder if it’s possible—conceivable—that we have more than enough resources amongst each other—that if we actually turned *inward*, towards each other—if we organized with each other—we’d find that there’s more than enough to sustain us?

One of you knows how to weld. One of you knows how to cook. One of you knows how to grow food. One of of knows how to sew clothes. One of you knows how to do accounting. To build websites. To fix vehicles to keep them running. To do handy maintenance to homes. To make music. To nurture land. One of you knows to manage resources. One of you knows how to **lead** *in service of others*.

Our own isolation, lack of connection, lack of organization—is what’s killing us.   


So what are we going to do about it?

I could use some advice.,u/kikalara,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1av50tc/pregnant_and_cant_afford_to_quit_i_could_use_some/,antiwork,"I'm in a really shitty situation at work and unsure of how to get out of it. Figured I'd post and see if anyone had any tips, tricks or suggestions. 

I'm pregnant and about to go into my third trimester. The job I'm at I worked for 4 years previously. When I went out on maternity leave for my first child, Because of some complications I was out of work for a lot longer than FMLA covered so there wasn't a job for me when I can back. I loved this job though, so I let them know if something opened up to let me know. This was in 2021. 

In July of last year, I ended up being offered the AGM position at this job and after some deliberation, I went back. It started off okay, but I realized that it wasn't the same place that it had used to be. Ive had so many issues that will take way over my character limit to get into. It got so bad that our GM who had worked here for 19 years ended up walking out without telling anyone. 

I want to quit. I'm so stressed out. I'm not eating. I'm not sleeping and im constantly getting yelled at by my doctors because it's affecting my pregnancy. (I'm on restrictions at work, and while they're making sure that they're legally followed, they're taking it out on me in ways that I can't legally prove). I'm trying to hold out until I give birth then I'll have time to find a new job while I'm on my paid leave, but each day that's proving harder and harder to do.  I'm not worried about finding a new job. I know I can find one really quickly. My biggest issue at this point is paid leave for when I have the baby. I get it through this employer, but because of how close I am to giving birth and NY state regulations, even if I start a new job tomorrow, I will not qualify if I go somewhere else. I can't afford to go 6-8 weeks without working. 

Is there a way around this? Something I'm not thinking of? I need to leave this place but I'm not sure how I can at this point without royally screwing myself over."

he then tells me that they have to let me go because i was working too slow and that they gave me a warning about doing so, keep in mind the only “warning” i got was them telling me that it’ll get busier in the spring and this was my first and only “warning”

 i have never let a job get to me but this had really pmo because it seemed like i was doing everything right and that i was well liked. ig this was just a reminder to never trust any manager at a job no matter how nice and down to earth they seem."

About two weeks before that date we all get the good news of “everyone is getting a raise and more work life balance!” BUT they end up taking our pto. We now start the year off with zero, earning a max of five days per year, so a couple hours per check. So needless to say they took some benefits pto wise, and also extended our work week by 2.5 hrs as well as more frequent saturday shifts. I switched jobs in the first place for more work life balance and took a pay cut and benefit cut for this but honestly this feels shady. Am I crazy for thinking g that’s shady and I don’t want to work for that kind of company? I feel like they sprinkled glitter on shit and figured most people were dumb enough to fall for it as ice cream. If they couldn’t afford to give people a company wise raise while keeping the measly 10 days pto after a couple years of employment they were not in the position to give raises in the first place. Not to mention they asked us if we wanted to roll over pto or cash out about a week before telling everyone the new pto policy so some people really did just send that pto into the wind.

I’ve recently started a new job after graduating from Uni and my coworker in my team asked me if I wanted to take over her responsibilities organising charity events being run by the company. 

She was reading through a few things she had helped to run (bake sales, silent auctions etc)  and then popped the question. I asked if it would take a lot of time and sensing my hesitation she started attacking me. She said she was surprised, that I was showing no initiative, it’s like I barely want to do a full day’s work, I’m content doing the bare minimum. 

I asked her why she didn’t want to do it anymore then and she mentioned her doing her MBA (she hasn’t started yet) as well as her doing 60 hour weeks meaning she has little time. I know her ‘60 hour weeks’ are nonsense because she pretends to be working on the train and gets in and leaves really early because she lives so far away.

Unfortunately she sort of projected her voice so everyone could hear and it came as a surprise to me. Maybe I should have taken the initative but I have stuff in my own personal life without having to take on additional responsibility in my third week of starting work. Eventually I said can I think about it and left it at that."

I'm afraid that if I bring it up, my manager (who is toxic as hell) will ask to convert me to exempt. I never take lunch, I'm so busy, and I'm usually working late. At the bare minimum, I acquire 5-9 hrs of OT per week. On most, 12 hrs OT. And she discourages lunches.

When I switched to this team from my old team, my new manager told me I'm exempt and should only put 40 hours for my timesheet. The last team, where they always assured I took lunch, got vacation time, etc, never had the OT issue come up because I was never made to do extra work.

I do believe my manager knew because my training manual, made by the last girl in my position, has notes that specify how to record OT if we acquire any on Friday because we put in our timeshares on Thursday. So I'm also pretty confident that my manager knew and SIGNED her timeshares with OT. 

I'm now trying to figure out how to broach this subject. My manager and her manager are both very entitled. They asked me why I don't just buy a new car, they both own multiple Porsches and Mercedes. I've had to miss in-office meeting due to my 22yr old truck being undrivable. So I know if she wanted to convert me, her boss would also agree. I hope they cannot convert me without telling me...

I'm listed as non-exempt on my offer letter and payroll says I'm still non-exempt. I'm just so broken hearted. How do you hear me lament about my truck and not say anything? How  do you see me move over an hour away to a dinky little town so I can afford rent and not say anything? I'm hoping my manager didn't actually know.

28,2024-02-19,working 10 hour shifts no break because they feed us during “staff training “,u/h3llh0unds,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1av7yqn/working_10_hour_shifts_no_break_because_they_feed/,antiwork,"so my job closes for a 2 hour period, 1-3pm,  for “staff training” once a week in the middle of the work day, we work before starting training at 7am and after at 3pm. during that training we are provided food, usually pizza, but we are expected to be doing training that entire time while trying to finish our food. last week our meeting was on how to use different equipment in the facility, we spent 30min at 4 different pieces of equipment while we got shown how to use them, basically like a round robin type deal. after this we reopen and go back to dealing with clients. in total it’s at the minimum a 10 hour shift if not 11 some nights. as a ND and disabled person especially, i need a break from all the corporate nonsense and to eat in peace.

my question is if this is even legal?? we cannot take additional time for lunch, the training time is considered our “paid lunch” so there’s no rest or personal time that day pretty much🫶 if it isn’t, how do I go about reporting this? I can’t afford to lose my job I’m in DE and can’t seem to understand if by law this is permitted.."

I had been there for 1 year, 4 months, and 13 days. It was fun while it lasted, but things are changing now, starting this week. Our team met with our 2 managers last week about cutting hours, and everyone was required to take an hour's lunch. Beginning this week, everyone on my team must take an hour's lunch since we're getting our hours cut starting on March 4, 2024, due to the low workflow and business driven by the office firm. Our managers are trying to get more workflow in, but it won't come until June 2024, with cutting hours affecting everyone. My hours got cut from 25 to 20, but I would be required to do 2 more processes besides letter printing and uploading and email data tagging. If I were only doing the letters and email data tagging, my hours would be under 20.

Last Friday, I signed out early, and an hour later, my manager texted me: Hi there - ""Did you sign out early?"" I didn't text my manager back and deleted the text message conversation from my phone. I'm feeling a lot better and happy overall right now.

What should I do tomorrow morning?

1) Should I sleep in?

2) Should I block my manager's phone number so she doesn't text/call?

3) Should I log on and find myself having a meeting with my managers?"

I work full time and each time anyones away you have to get a medical cert or a signed statutory declaration proving you why you had to be off - unless you’ve notified them a month in advance. 
So I call up my work the day after I found out about my dad and the first thing that’s said, ‘can you please get a med cert for today and tomorrow as you won’t be at work.’… I immediately broke down with the idea of having to organise an appointment with the doctors, over the phone or not, I was shocked. 
Am I in the wrong for thinking this process is beyond dehumanising? 
Because I wasn’t able to get one for yesterday as I’ve been waist deep in planning and calls I now have to print out a stat dec (I don’t own a printer and have no idea who does) and go to a chemist for someone to sign this. So a random chemist is much more believable than an employee they’ve had for over a year with an amazing leave history. 
I’ve also been told I can take leave for the next week instead of personal but only if I send them a photo of his funeral planner booklet on the day of. 
It’s so stupid. I can’t even begin to wrap my head around it. I’m going to have to do this all while planning and attending my dad’s funeral. I feel like I’ve lost all hope for my work and the people that work there in management. 
There is so much more that’s happened as well, I tried to show up last week but got bombarded with micro management because my KPI’s had dropped. I’m expected to work to my absolute full extent and if I can’t the message is don’t show up. I feel so stuck. It’s made the process so so much harder. I’m 21 years old, give me some fucking breathing room."

So she marked me at the lowest possible grade, just to be safe, also, even tho she does see me improving my work performance and my shifts are going better every day, it's not to *her* standards, so she marked me as unable to use feedback. 

These decisions impacted my raise, and I was given a 2% raise. Tomorrow is her last day, however, and then I get yet another new boss in less than 3 months, if it wasn't for that fact, I wouldn't have even come in for my shift today.

3,2024-02-20,My awful job story,u/CryptographerOk8678,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1avbg0g/my_awful_job_story/,antiwork,"I've been wanting to make this post for quite some time. It really is just a long (*very* long) story/rant about my last job and my horrendous, wicked boss, so if it isn't your cup of tea go ahead and keep scrolling. If it is your cup of tea, hello! I promise you things were a million times worse than what I'm describing here!

I (25F) started working at a personal injury firm when I was fresh out of college. The firm was very, VERY small - just me, my former coworker, and the attorney. I applied through LinkedIn and had a phone interview with the attorney's (let's call her ""Miranda"") husband. He was very kind and told me they were looking to replace a girl who ""just wasn't a good fit."" He then told me that his wife was a very, very hard and good worker - it was a fast-paced environment because of how many clients she took on. He even told me that some attorneys believe that the more they work, the more money they make, and his wife fell victim to that. Both of these were small red flags that I chose to ignore. 

After a Zoom call with the only other coworker (the paralegal), I was invited to meet the attorney. She was so sweet when I first met her. She told me about how important breaks are, how she values a comfortable work environment, and overall made it seem like a really great place to work. I was hired within three days of me submitting my application, so it's safe to say they were desperate for a new worker. I had no idea what I was in for.

Miranda showed her true colors on the third day of my working there. She had asked me to ""confirm the letter"", which no one had told me the meaning of and I hadn't been trained on. I simply responded ""okay, how do I do that?"" and was met with a death glare. She just repeated ""confirm the letter"", and we went back and forth like that for a full five minutes until she got frustrated, rolled her eyes, and stormed off. To this day I still have no idea what she meant. This was minor, I thought maybe she was just in a bad mood, so I decided to ignore it. It was just the beginning.

Everything immediately got worse. If I had a question, she stared at me like I was dumb and then answered the question with a smile on her face, like she was talking to a child. She threw tantrums - literal tantrums - over the TINIEST mistakes my coworker and I made. I distinctly remember one time I asked what a legal word meant and she threw a fit about me not knowing what the word meant. In my defense, NO ONE knows what that damn word means. She was very good at making me and my coworker feel small and stupid. I said ""Jesus Christ"" once when there was an issue I had to fix, and she got mad because I swore around her (I can understand that many people may not like this, but the way she freaked out about it was unnecessary). I once put a semi colon instead of a regular colon on a draft of a document, it was the worst thing imaginable for her. Another time, she threw a tantrum because I said ""yeah"" to a client instead of ""yes sir"". Every tiny mistake turned into her screaming at us, talking to us like children, and then storming off. I would like to mention that I am NOT dumb, and I do have a rather impressive educational background and resume. But man, did this lady think I was dumb for the tiny mistakes I made, though she made LOTS of mistakes herself. Maybe even more than my coworker and I did.

After about a month of my working there, she had a talk with my coworker and I. Miranda had just come back from a business trip with other attorneys and told us that ""we should see what the other attorneys make their workers do"" and ""we should be grateful she doesn't put us through half of the stuff she wants to make us do"". I was immediately thinking, **you don't get an award for being a** ***less bad boss*** **than other people.**

One time, Miranda sent me something to print out. She came over to my desk, I handed it to her, she immediately started claiming that I changed something on the document because it was incorrect. I said it's exactly what she sent me and I didn't change anything. She started yelling ""no, no, NO!!"" While she was screaming in my ear, I pulled up the email she sent with the file, opened the file, and pointed at the incorrect paragraph and said ""see?"" She just stared at it, said ""oh"", and walked away. Not even an apology. 

Another time, I drafted a letter to send out to a client. I had written tons of these letters before so I was confident with them but I still had to give it to Miranda to review. Miranda took one look at it, said ""no"", handed it back to me, and went back to working. I made edits, showed it to her again, and all she said was ""try again"". I asked my coworker for help, my coworker and I drafted a completely new one, showed Miranda together, and got nothing but a ""no"" again. This went on NINE more times, until she finally told us what was wrong - and you guessed it, it was a tiny, tiny problem. Could have been solved if Miranda had just decided to use her words. Shouldn't have been that difficult, considering she is an attorney.

Then came the chaotic Texas freeze. If you're not in Texas or don't know anything about it, you should know that we do not know how to drive on icy roads here. We don't have any of the proper equipment because we never thought it would be a concern. Miranda told us we didn't have to come in to work if we didn't feel safe, but it was in a tone that told us we would surely regret not going. I didn't want to risk my life (we worked out of Miranda's house and she was in a high-risk area) so I didn't go. A few weeks later, I asked a question, Miranda told me ""I usually encourage questions but that was a stupid question"", and then told me I was ""going to learn a lot with this job"" and ""eventually you'll learn how to drive on a little bit of ice!"" She didn't even have the courage to drive on the ice, it was not ""a little bit"". I was not going to drive across the big city on icy roads with other people who can't drive on ice to her house in a high-risk area. I feel that's valid.

I was getting really, really fed up, but I was very determined to stay because I was going to move within the next year and didn't want two jobs on my resume saying I only worked there for a few months (Miranda and what ever job I would've got if I had quit before moving). I'm also really, really stubborn, and felt like if I quit Miranda would just say ""OP just wasn't brave or tough enough for the job"" and I didn't want to give her that satisfaction. I knew that if I had even talked back to her she would be satisfied, she wanted to get to me, so I didn't let her. I normally would, I've very outspoken myself and not afraid of conflict. Sometimes I even worry I might be TOO aggressive with people, but I shut my mouth up with her because I knew she would love to know that she bothered me. I kept quiet BECAUSE I hated her and didn't want her to be happy. One mistake on Miranda's part was giving me the Outlook account that every other person in my job position before me had. I started searching through really, really old emails and found that the only person who had stayed at this job for over 6 months was my coworker. People were leaving this job CONSTANTLY since she first opened.

This post is already really long, so let me just list a couple of other things she's done/said:

1. I didn't know how to do something (that most people who aren't attorneys can't do), Miranda asked ""didn't your parents ever teach you this?"" I am from a non-wealthy, immigrant family. She knows this. I made a joke about it and she said ""well I made sure my children know this stuff"" very, very rudely. I'm sure you did, English-speaking, wealthy, white lady.
2. She once made a joke about how she doesn't offer benefits. Forgot to mention that, yeah, there were no benefits.
3. Client files were in her garage. I offered to organize them because I was the one who would have to file things and was sick of the mess and she agreed. Sometimes when I didn't have anything in the day left to do, I tried to go down to her garage in the Texas heat and organize, and she yelled at me for organizing them (though she willingly said I could) and said I need to get back to work. I was only allowed to organize them on Fridays, then, and it took weeks. At one point, her husband saw me working in the heat, whispered something to her, and THEN she offered to open the garage door, pretending she cared that I was all sweaty from physically moving heavy boxes of files around.
4. My keys are on a lanyard with some charms and a doggy poop bag. I was leaving the office, stopped to tell her a run-down of the day before I left, and she glared at my keys and in a gross tone said ""you have a looooot of stuff on your keys."" Who cares? Does that have anything to do with my job?
5. My coworker had his one-year meeting with her. A few months later, coworker told me Miranda hasn't even filled out the paperwork she said she was going to or given him a raise.
6. I once heard her say on the phone, ""I demand you to give me a refund"" to someone. TOTAL Karen.
7. We had so, so much work that she wanted done by the end of the day, but if we took ONE MINUTE of overtime, she threw a tantrum. Made us write out exactly what we were doing that took so long and told us that we wouldn't get paid for going over time without her authorizing it anymore, but we were still expected to finish our work. Our overtime amounts were literally under $10 a week because it was MINUTES of overtime. Miranda charged over $400 an hour, she could afford to pay us our overtime that was just enough for a happy meal.
8. Someone was trying to fax something over to my email, we didn't have a fax machine. So my printer/copier printed out a fax attempt page three times, she made my coworker shadow me to see if I was doing anything wrong because Miranda was insistent that I was doing something incorrect that lead to the waste of three pieces of paper.
9. After I quit, I emailed my new address to Miranda to mail my final check to. She sent it to my old address and made it signature required. After I told her about it and gave her the new address again, even offering to drive back into town and just pick it up, I had to wait an entire month before she finally sent it to the correct address.

I lasted about 8 months in that hell hole. I am genuinely convinced that Miranda was an evil, wicked person. The lady never even made time for her family, I heard her daughter call her a bitch and complaining to her about it once. Before I handed in my (very nice) resignation letter, Miranda was particularly stressed out and beaten down like I had never seen her before. She said she needed a glass of wine and seemed actually SAD, and then I gave her my resignation letter. She looked even more defeated and I really, truly believe she deserved it and worse. I felt triumphant.

Now here's the kicker: My Outlook account (that I shared with all of the people who used to have my job) would open to a specific inbox with emails from the girl who worked in my position before me's time every single day. On my LAST WEEK there, I glanced at the subject line of one of the emails and saw it read ""termination of my employment contract"". I opened it. It was Miranda's response to the girl who has my position before I came in's resignation, so I could scroll down and see what the girl said. She sent it to Miranda on a random Thursday right before her lunch break. The former worker said she was going to lunch and not coming back, due to Miranda's vile, disgusting, condescending, and toxic behavior towards the workers. I. Was. Floored. It was my LAST WEEK there and I had JUST seen this, even though it was on the screen that I opened every single day, right in the middle. Like I previously mentioned, I had gone through lots of old emails to look at the previous workers' names, but I never opened this one. If I had seen it the first week I worked there, when I first witnessed Miranda's evilness, I surely would have left earlier. I still can't believe I missed that. Everything I needed to know about that job was right there in front of my face and I had never even known.

If you read, thank you so much. It's been a year now since I left and I feel amazing. I have unfortunately fallen into some habits after working that job that I would like to get out of, like feeling shocked when my current boss thanks me for something or my fear of asking questions and being told I'm dumb for it. Old coworker left about a month after I did, and I have no idea how Miranda is doing now, but I really hope she's doing awful and getting karma for the way she treated people."

I am pregnant I just found out. I work 4 days a week 10-12 hour shifts and it’s pretty much every other day. But I close sometimes and it’s hard to wake up early the next morning to do stuff in usual people hours. 

Since the beginning of the year I’ve been asking for time off. I got sick, I saw a doctor twice the second time he said I had a sinus infection. But both times I had to show up so sick to work I could not work, and even the second time I was coughing so hard I pulled a muscle in my neck and back. Even then my boss was complaining about me as I was at urgent care. 

I took time in March for two doctors appointments, one for an ultra sound and one to see my obgyn (also I can’t take anti biotics because I’m pregnant but I’m still sick.) . My husband wants to come to the doctors and my schedule is already tough and these days work for us. I came in today and on the large calendar board no one’s been using the second morning I asked off a very important meeting had been scheduled. I asked to come 30 minutes late to the meeting (it’s a 9-5 meeting) and my boss told me no. 

But I work in a stressful job and I want a doctors note to prevent me from having to strain myself. I know Wednesday I’m scheduled for very stressful work even though my boss knows I’m pregnant. I’m only like 5-6 weeks and I want to keep my baby and I’m just wondering if all of this is just valid to quit?

I have my husband and I can always look for another easier job but I’m not the bread winner. I just don’t want to abandon my other supervisors. I just want support I suppose "

I recently, Feb 1st, got moved into a different department with a little extra pay rate, just wanted to do something different. In my previous job I worked 4x10 M-Th from 5:30am-4:00pm. When I moved departments I was told that I’m able to choose any hours I would like to work that is within reason, at least work 40 hours a week, and 5x8 M-F. Though waking up for 5:30am sucked I still chose to come in at 5:30am and leave at 2pm. I really enjoyed the extra time after work. I communicated this with my boss and he was fine with it. 

At my new job, I have a 1 on 1 meetings with my boss every Friday at 2pm (I don’t mind staying a bit longer) to see how I’m doing with my new position, usually takes less then 10mins. These meetings are optional and he said I’m able to cancel these meetings anytime for any reason. Come Friday last week I couldn’t come in because “I was busy”, I didn’t give a specific reason because what I do after work isn’t his business and it’s the end of my day. 

This morning I got called into my boss’ office to discuss where I was at work on Friday. I told him I left cause I did my full 8 hours for the day and had something to do after work, it was to take some family member to the airport. Apparently, after a good 1 hour I told him I was busy and couldn’t come in the meeting he was trying to find me. He was mad. He thought when I said “I was busy” he thought I was busy doing work. I just apologized and told him it was a miscommunication from each of us, he didn’t like that. And I guess to punish me he told me to change my hours from 7:30am-4pm cause I’m in too early and leaving too early thinking I’m not able to get trained since the people I’m learning from get in different hours. There’s two people I mainly work with to get my training done, one comes in at 5:00am and the other in at 6:00am. What the actual heck is this? I did everything right, asked all the right questions to make sure I’m okay, I get my work and training done, I hardly slack off! And I have to get my hours moved because a 70 year old manager got all BH cause I didn’t want to see him. I regret applying for this position.

My anxiety is high as I lay in bed, thinking about the meeting I have with my supervisor in the morning. Been trying all weekend to figure out an excuse for not finishing a project that I was supposed to two weeks ago. 

I'm just so disengaged. So checked out of work. I feel miserable. My fiance sees how much I have deteriorated. I even have the luxury of working from home but I'm too social so the isolation is hard. My drinking has been getting bad again too. Just anything to numb myself during work. 

I miss my old team, I miss feeling wanted or even just being seen. I hate my weekly 30 minute meetings with my boss because it's just telling me a list of things I need to do. Nothing personal. Nothing to get to know each other. I even told her that my old team had a system that helped me with motivation but she just said ""that's nice"".

My old team left our division two years ago. I miss them so much. Anytime I see my old boss at random and rare work functions I start crying. Heck I'm even crying now thinking about who I was when I was first hired and where I am now. 

I feel completely wilted. I'm so anxious for tomorrow. I don't know what I can say about my unfinished project. I already got in trouble last week."

I've joined an organisation that fares extremely well as far worker's satisfaction goes. They're like top 5. 

However, my division just isn't it. Since I've joined 6 months ago and this is my first job ever, I'm not sure what to do. Most days, I just sit around. Not only they would not assign me work, I get off handed comments that I don't work, especially during company dinners/events (drunk co-workers). 

They give me the cold shoulder, say that I don't show initiative (I don't even fucking know what initiative they want), shoot down all my ideas before I can even develop. My anixety levels have raised to the extreme; one of the contributing factors being that I feel that I might get laid off. 

Another problem is that everyone, expect for a handful of us, like at least 20+ years older than I am. I'm not sure if it's their propensity or they in general, behave this way towards younger colleagues. I don't know if they're threatened or just plain mean. I feel super odd. Since I've just joined, I can't just quit. 

I feel stuck, scared and just unhappy in general."

It’s finally at a point where my gallbladder will rupture at any minute if it’s not taken out. I work at very physical job as a baggage handler and my doctor informed me they would recommend I be out for 6 weeks.

Im 3 months shy of hitting 1 year with my company so unfortunately I’m disqualified from any paid medical leave ( I live in Washington state). That means if I were to inform my job of my surgery I would be out of work for a month and a half without pay. My savings can’t cover all of my bills and rent. And I only have enough pto to be out a few days.

I brought up the situation to my employer a few months ago before I knew the actual state of my gall bladder and they confirmed my finding that yes they would probably approve me for my leave but it would in fact be without pay.

But now a few weeks ago a gall stone forced me to go to the ER where the doctors actually wanted me to wait around so they could take it out that night. But I couldn’t miss work. So instead I scheduled it on my weekend. I’m forced to go back to work less than a week after my surgery because I have no choice. I’m hoping for the best. My wife is stressed for me but I have no choice but to tell her I’ll be okay. I don’t really know if this is even the right place to vent about this, but I hate this system I hate having to worry about this."

The schedule worked great because that’s the days I’m available and the training is for 10 weeks so I expected to be trained on those days only. I’m disabled and can’t work that much. Since I started almost two months ago they have been making me follow my trainers schedule and it’s way earlier then my start time. They expect me to come in 5am every morning on the dot so I have to pay for a lot of ubers and Lyft which I have struggling with because it’s so expensive but I do get vouchers for being disabled but it can’t cover the whole month. I have to stand for 10-12 hours and get yelled at if I try to sit down or do my online training: I’m starting to think they want us to do their job and don’t care if we pass the training to get hired because we are never allowed to study or go to the training centers to practice we just clean machines all day and get patients prepped. They keep canceling are training and my trainer is really rude to me when I try to take a break and study. She says I’ll tell you when you can study and they keep pressuring me to talk about my disability because there are days I have to come in late or can’t come in because of appointments or have to go to the hospital for not feeling well. I regret telling them about my problems. The other people I’m training with are saying that there looking for other jobs because they don’t feel like they are learning anything and we have a few weeks left till are test and I don’t know what to do. I just moved into my own apartment when I was living with a roommate and I think I might need the job to pay bills. My boss who’s the same title as me yelled when I said I can’t work every other Saturday just some Saturday. She twisted my words and has been acting strange. I feel like I gave in and don’t know what to do. I feel like it’s hard to get jobs that are paying this much. I do want a administrative position but haven’t had any experience haven’t got a degree. I don’t want to work in retail or a warehouse because it’s too hard on my body. I’m still on disability and can pay this next month but need to find a job by next month.

How to recover from this?",u/Interesting-Market-6,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aveyjk/i_lost_my_job_reputation_and_mental_health/,antiwork,"I’m a 22 year old woman who’s pretty much self made (no degree, lived my life as an orphan, no assets / relatives) and I live in Asia. 

I became very accomplished in 2 years through sheer effort and ambition. I’ve been recognized as a top performer and a strong personality at my workplace. Until my new manager changed and was a 45 year old man who were some reason did not like all the praise, recommendations my female bosses gave me. He’s been flirtatious with me, I didn’t think much of it. He said “come to me for anything don’t be shy” 

I found out that he tried to lay me off during a re-organization but it was not possible due to my achievements. I then found out through a “friend” outside of the company that he’s gossiping about me, and is saying that I’m doing “bad” things to get ahead in my career, he said the most awful things about me, used others to bully me, and when I opened my mouth to speak up - he took complete offense and punished me by compiling my “mistakes” in the past 2 years to discredit me. I was crying everyday, and quit without notice because my mental health was impacted and I am diagnosed with depression. People are gossiping about how I left and that I burned bridges. It hurts because I worked so hard to build myself only for one man to completely take it away. He’s known as someone who’s sexist and short tempered. I don’t know why the company let him do all this. 

I did the best I could do but I did make mistakes like crying in front of HR about his behavior, and appearing unstable. 

Lastly, he created a fake account to stalk me on instagram everyday and I had no idea! He messaged after I resigned “I hope you learned your lesson” and “I don’t like you having so many men as your friends. This is how you get jobs, being around men” “I could’ve helped you find another job but you involved HR” I blocked him. 

I feel like my career has no future, everyone who loved me turned against me because he accused me of everything under the sun. I resigned without a job, too. 


Will I ever recover from this trauma?"

Some variants include,  'As I've said a thousand times before', 'As I've said over and over again', 'As I seem to keep having to say'.

Which would be understandable, as no one wants to have to keep repeating themselves to their staff. Except for the fact that 9/10 times no one remembers what he said previously because it was so long ago or in passing, or they simply weren't there, he 100% did not say that thing previously, or we remember what he said but it was nothing related, or totally counter to what he's saying now!

A couple of examples are, 'As i've said a thousands times before, we are  an x company, we need to focus on x' (which totally counters what he said we need to focus on yesterday).

'As i've told you guys multiple times, I want to be asked for approval in advance of everything that goes live' (after he once said he wanted to approve a particular feature, not every single thing, we are a tech company by the way).

We all feel like we are being persistently belittled & gaslit by a pretty much constant barrage of lies, half truths and conflicting statements that leaves us questioning ourselves, wondering how this could have happened, what we did wrong for him to address it this way, it's absolutely exhausting!

Does any one else get hammered by this kind of redundant vocabulary?

I got a first written warning today because I had my 5th sick absence in 12 months (365 days) last week. We have HR meetings for every sick absence. Most of them were related to the stress this company is giving me. I sent out some applications today because I'm fed up with this circus. 

In January the company failed to be transparent to us and let us know their outsourcing payroll company fucked up previous taxes, so we all had double taxes taken in January and nobody told us until WE brought it up to higher management. 

The only german speaking person apart from me has handed in his notice (good for him), but instead of replacing him with another german speaking person who can handle complaints and do the quality assurance, they gave the role out for an English speaking person only. So I'll be alone on the frontline handling all the complaints and dealing with the internal quality assurance on top of my senior tasks. 

Then they also failed to pay me my agreed to and paid overtime correctly. I had a panic attack and was unable to work on Tuesday because of the anxiety even thinking about working again caused me. 

And now I'm being treated like I committed a federal offense because I was sick 5 times in a span of 365 days. 

Wish me luck these applications get me anywhere. I don't want to do this anymore."

This means at least another two months where my employer can sack me with less than a weeks notice.

There was an exceptionally busy period 2-3 months ago where I had a lot of plates to spin and some small plates were dropped, like rushing a report and when it was reviewed there were a few more mistakes in there, or some things were prioritised over others and I should have communicated it better. None of them were considered particularly egregious but things to work on none the less. My line manager mentioned them to me in a sort of mini review, I didn’t make any excuses and made sure they didn’t happen again. 

On Thursday I had my review and my line manager agreed I had addressed everything that she had mentioned and that I was performing well. Ultimately though my probation would be extended by at least two months.

The reasons she gave was that I was not investing enough of my free time into developing my skills related to the job, like joining clubs, or generally using these skills more, she did not have any concerns about the level of my skills, just that I should be exercising them more outside of work. They needed guarantees I was committed to this field, a field I studied at university and have worked in for about 7 years.

I’ve bought a house recently and she basically said that I had been spending too much time working on the house with my partner (it’s a bit of a project) rather than spending my time improving skills that can ultimately be monetised by my company.

I had quite liked my boss before this, I thought we got on well and that was a caring considerate person. But how can I trust her now that she has chosen to prolong a precarious employment situation over such nebulous reasons that had not been mentioned in earnest prior?

Apologies for the long post, just wanted to get that off my chest.

TLDR My probation was extended because I was spending too much of my personal time on renovating a house and not developing skills for my employer."

Thinking back, I was my happiest (mentally) when I worked evening shifts in retail. I'd come home exhausted and depleted, get a little food, and then crash. I'd sleep in until I was comfortable enough to get out of bed and I'd have a nice slow morning/afternoon playing games, watching tv, and sipping coffee until I'd have to go back to work.

I've been at my first menial 8-5 desk job for the past four years and I've never adjusted to a ""proper"" sleep schedule. Now, I'm in one of the worst places I've been mentally and I want to try something different. I've been wondering how I can make my morning desk job more like my evening retail job, until I realized... What if I just went to bed around 6pm-7pm and just slept until I was ready to get up (4am-5am)? I haven't tried it yet, but I want to know if anyone has tried this/is doing this and what their thoughts are.

Finding a new job sounds like it's more work than what it's worth, and I really don't have the energy to market myself."

Side note, I'm looking to get fired eventually anyhow....so I really don't care what happens. 

Back story - The two 70 year old ladies running the kitchen are just evil. They see me as a threat and are just awful to me. 

I can't be awful, it's not in my nature... But I am learning to stand up for myself. 

A month ago, one of them asked me to take her shifts for 2 days while she had surgery. Even tho I was salty about the horrible way they treat me, I couldn't say no, because I'm nice. 

2 weeks ago, the other one absolutely freaked out on me over something without even talking to me first (she made assumptions), it was so unprofessional I went to higher management. Screaming at me to ""just go home"" (trying to get me to quit, per the usual). 

Her idea of revenge, was to take those 2 days I agreed to work for the other lady... (assuming I needed the money and this would hurt me). 

Only problem is, the surgery didn't go so well.... So now this spiteful woman has been working straight for 10 days (legally, she can't work tomorrow). 

So the big boss needs me. I'm the only one who can cover it.... 

I told her I lost $500 last week because of that ladies spiteful behavior, what's the incentive for me to cover for her tomorrow? 

*it's assisted living. The CNA's are constantly offered incentives to cover shifts because they're always short handed. This is in the kitchen... But same company. 

Am I wrong to ask for incentive pay?

I have FMLA pending, but I've already gone past the allotment this month.

I just don't care anymore. They are having system issues causing lost sales which means no bonuses for anyone basically til they fix it. I've decided it's not even worth it. There is a lot of shady shit at this company and I was uncomfortable with it from the start. Customers getting clearly ripped off and the company's approach is basically ""You can't prove anything, lol!"" This happens a lot, too.

On the plus side, they don't seem too concerned with many things that simply wouldn't fly at other jobs, so it's nice to basically ""do what I want"". However, the whole thing is SO disorganized it drives me crazy! And also, it takes zero mental focus (all scripted short conversations and endless repetition) so my mind is constantly elsewhere and I tend to always feel I should be doing something worthwhile with my time.

Finally starting to look for a new job. I gotta do something with myself! I doubt they will fire me. In the 9 months I've been here I haven't heard of a single person being let go. But I'm at the point the pros no longer outweigh the cons. Time to move on."

I don’t know where to go from here because most all jobs in this country are working for people at the top that exploit us. I truly don’t know how to survive end-stage capitalism. 

I’m working “for myself” through 1099 gigs, but ultimately, those are still huge companies exploring our labor. I don’t need much, I don’t live extravagantly, I just want to live. I need shelter and food and those things are going to run out on my current path. 

* I am also so fed up with moving, chasing $ and shelter I can afford. I have lived in 15 homes (6 cities), twice back with my mom from 18-32. 

*I have a bachelors and those same years, 18-32, of experience in my field. My pay has roughly been the same since 2018. I have moved up within companies and job hopped, raises are minimal. I can not break the barrier and don’t think I ever will; this is how the system is designed for most people. 

* not to mention I have never been able to afford health care as a working adult in this country. When I finally made enough to enroll at all, I still couldn’t afford the deductible or co-pays, let alone any medications or actual care I might need.

So I am in the fortunate position of having a fairly cushy job. Generally, I get on well with my colleagues, work remotely 3 days a week and in the office for 2. 
My partner works in a field that requires her to start early. Because of this, I tend to wake up and start work early.

So while normal office hours are 9-5:30 with an hour for lunch, I typically work 8-4:30pm. 
This has worked well for months. I typically have work done for when my manager enters the office so she isn’t waiting for me to begin her work. 

Recently we got a new office manager who seemed fine but took issue when she realised me leaving early was a regular thing.

She started off just being snide, saying things like “sneaking off early are we in a half jokey way”
Recently though it’s gotten worse and changed to things like “I hope other people won’t have to cover your work” and “we’re you out drinking last night?” Which is wildly in appropriate.

Anyway, eventually she called me into a meeting and informed me that it was no longer acceptable that I leave at half four as it would confuse the new hires…if we hired new staff.
I argued that I shouldn’t have to adjust my schedule based on hypothetical people, and that seeing that people were being rewarded for consistent good work and not forced into meaningless presenteeism would be more appealing to new hires than anything else.
She said it wasn’t a good look for me professionally and could hold back my career.
I was calm but asked her what part of my work had not been acceptable and mentioned that all my previous performance reviews had been great.
She just kept talking in circles until I just said okay, I’ll work normal hours.


Skip to three days later when she calls me in again and tries to explain that our boss is cross and confused about why my work isn’t ready for her when she arrives. 
I reminded her that she had told me I was no longer allowed to come in early or leave early.
She laughed and said that I was of course allowed to come in early, I just had to stay until half 5.

I asked why I would do that if I wouldn’t be paid for it or have anything to do in the last few hours…
She was speechless for awhile. She didn’t tel me I could go back to leaving early  so I kept coming in at 9. It took another full week  before she let me know she had managed to get me special permission to arrive and leave early. I politely declined and thanked her for giving me my mornings back. I told her I had learned to enjoy my morning walk.

Started a new job in June. My dad died in September last year. I had some PTO scheduled but had to change my vacation plans. My manager at the time seemed annoyed that I would be out of office during quarterly closing. I offered to WfH while I was with my dying father and they responded coldly, “I would rather you come back as soon as you are done and get on with the work.”

I remember thinking it was an insensitive thing to say but whatever. I didn’t know at the time but when I got back, I would be on their shit list.

For 3 weeks they made non-stop snide remarks at me like “it’s been a whole month since your dad died why do you still look sad in the office?”, “my daughter has mental illness I really don’t need to deal with your mental problems too”. I was getting assignment on Friday afternoons with deadlines set for Monday. I tried to treat them as legit criticism and improved on my performance. But before I had any chance to react, I was fired due to “performance issues” in November.

I even had a full week of bereavement leave entitlement that was “forfeited” for me because I got fired before I could take them. I was in office 4 days a week and never took another extra day off. But was told my ex-manager was “unhappy with my work ethic”.

I got a new job in February. I could have gotten the job in January but the offer was delayed because my new employer did a thorough background check. My ex-manager ignored requests for references for months. When cornered, they told the reference checker that I had “low motivation, low stress tolerance and poor work ethic (in their opinion)”. Luckily all my other references that are extremely strong and I got the job anyway. The hiring manager was like “who stays motivated when a literal parent died? What a strange opinion.”

I know this industry rewards psychopathic behaviour. But I always try to be nice to others as a means to protect myself. I never thought I would have something like this happen to me. And I hate the fact that we as employees get instantly disqualified when we badmouth a former employer. But employers are somehow allowed to knowingly try to end someone’s career. I still don’t even know what I could have done to set them off to the point of wanting to end my career.

I tried to give myself credit for showing up for work every day and putting in the effort even though I was extremely stressed. But an experience like this really fucks with my confidence."

Companies, state departments, etc have all done the same thing in that they can change pay rates, job titles, benefits, etc at any time for any reason. I show up and do my job as originally agreed on, am told in reviews and followups that I'm doing wonderfully, but then they decide to simply not pay what was originally agreed on. They don't have the money, changes in worker participation needs (goodbye, PTO banks, comp time, etc). whatever bullshit excuses they can cook up with, and it's all legal in Texas.

Too many of my roles have resulted in this and it's gotten to a point where I don't see any other option but to leave. Unemployment reiterates businesses have all the options and workers just have to gulp down all their crap and be happy about it.  


Is there anywhere in the US where that's NOT legal and I might have recourse?

These are areas that have been hit hard by closures of coal mines, and in an ideal world the investment in green energy could help offset job losses.

Instead, what's happening is that land owners are selling carbon offsets, in which they are paid to agree to not develop forested areas, which the companies paying them can then use to claim carbon zero or whatever. Obviously, just agreeing to \*not\* develop an area provides zero jobs for the people who live in that area. The land owners get paid a lot simply for owning the land, and the locals get next to nothing.

I’m 25 years old, 0 kids, 0 savings, basically living check to check in south Florida. I’ll add some context to this story and how we got here.

I started this job at a company selling industrial ovens and freezers last year Jan 2023. Prior to that I sold cars & did electrical work but stopped due to an on the job injury. My company is a very small company with only 4 people running it. You have the owner who takes all the sales calls (we’ll call him Greg), the operations director who manages the payments for orders (we’ll call her Meg), the web designer & me the customer service / warranty dept. we used to have a sales department but About 6 months ago Greg had a mental breakdown and fired the other 2 sales people we had. When he hired them He promised bonuses and percentage increases if they hit their quotas & made it nearly impossible for them to hit it by adding stipulations to the bonuses. My buddy who got me the job and did sales, was starting a streak of hitting his bonuses. Our boss fired the sales team without notice one day and said he couldn’t afford to pay them. Then offered to hire them back if they accepted a 30% pay cut and worked without bonuses. They did not accept the offer and found other jobs. At the time, with our 2 sales reps & the owner doing sales, we were averaging 230-300k Gross profit monthly. After firing the sales staff Greg was now making 30-50k gross profit monthly which is a dramatic decrease in profit and not sustainable for his lifestyle. On top of the loss of profit, Greg would make careless mistakes on his purchase orders and send customers the incorrect units. The countless order mistakes would cost 2-3k minimum to correct. He wanted to let go of sales to cut expenses but shot himself in the foot doing so.

The summer was brutal and each month we made less and less. Around September the owner had let us know that he was closing down in October. In a last ditch effort, my manager Meg, convinced Greg to switch to a new marketing team and we start to see a little bit of progress. Our company is starting to show signs of life again for the holiday season and then the sales start to dwindle again in the new year. 

Recently in the beginning of February, greg messed up a really big order and lost 3 really big deals he was working on. I offered to assist with the sales in the past but Gregg does not want anyone doing sales but him. Now he’s given everyone a two week notice. I have 40 hours pto that I will get in a check, but I don’t know anything about how severance pay works or how unemployment works. Is my company legally obligated to give us severance pay or is that avoided by how small the company is? I am still shocked and lost about all of this. No savings so I’m a little flustered, any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!"

I am currently in the process of transitioning from my product development role to a role with the federal government. Unbeknownst to me, despite not reporting to my new job until the end of March, the DoD sent my current manager a letter on 2/1 that I was starting a new job and needed their referral. 

I had been verbally told that same day that I was receiving a $20k raise and level promotion.  My manager confirmed that day that if I chose to leave the promotion would be in effect either way.

They have generally been good to me, and as the technical lead on some high priority projects I went ahead and submitted notice of my decision and consequential last day a whole month in advance. I wanted to give them as much time as possible to prepare the team for the transition. 

Well jokes on me, as soon as I submitted notice, HR and my manager changed narratives to my promotion being a counter offer and no longer an opportunity.

Fast forward to yesterday- he insisted I go on the paint line. He put me with a guy who only speaks Spanish and said “he will show you” 
The guy is big and just pulling these 80lb iron pieces off the hook like nothing. I hesitated but I didn’t want to argue with my supervisor and get fired as I’m new and I am on probationary period. I lifted one and strained myself. The hernia which I had for a few months is now the size of a golf ball and is causing me a lot of pain. I came into work today and once I got moving around it was very agitated. I went to the other supervisor agitated and angry, and told her I’m leaving the to the hospital. I clocked out and here I am sitting at urgent care. 

It is also to be noted I told him about the strain and he took me off paint line, it’s also on my work sheet for yesterday, in his handwriting that he had me on paint line for 3 hours. 
I also have 3 witnesses from last week who seen me tell him I cannot work on paint line.

1,2024-02-20,I am forced to promote LGBT in company,u/StepBackJanez,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1avw4fi/i_am_forced_to_promote_lgbt_in_company/,antiwork,"I work for a reputable global company (Fortune Global 500) as a Head of department with a bit less than 40 associates from different countries. A few facts about myself:

- I am ok with and support LGBT apart from the latest “transgender kids” sex change surgeries madness. I have a friend who is gay and at least 1 of my team members is as well.
- I try to lead by example and more importantly see my role as trying to create an environment, where my team members can be their best version of them selves. Creating inclusive environment is important.

BUT also:

- I support LGBT more passively in a sense that I am not against it, you could also say that I do not even care much what is your sex orientation, especially at work. That does not mean that I do not care about personal wellbeing of my team members. I am not an active supporter, because I spend time on other things that are more important to me.
- I believe that creating an inclusive workplace environment needs to consider all “groups” and not just one privileged one, while others need to just suck it up. My department and the company consists of Muslims, Christians and also some older members, who are more on conservative side. For me it is important that everyone feels ok.

What happened?

Company created Diversity function/department within the HR. Although the purpose of this function should be to bridge the cultural/social gap between associates coming from different countries, different languages, religions, ethical differences, sex orientations, different professionals profiles, all that they have been doing, has been agressively pushing LGBT agenda to the point, where if you are not actively(vocally) supporting it or if you critize just a little bit, you are regarded as homophobic.

On regional leadership team meeting the Diversity representative suggested that this year they will request from a couple associates that have either shown anti-LGBT or they suspect that they are against LGBT, to request(force) them to raise LGBT flags in front of company buildings and record a videos of them, telling why supporting LGBT is important. Among those suggested were also some Christians, Muslims and people that simply do not care about LGBT (they just come to work to do what they are paid for and are not interested in corporate culture, activities, etc).

I raised my voice, telling that I was strongly against it, saying that this is not how we create an inclusive environment. Nothing disrespectful or containing inappropriate language.

What happened next really surprised me. I have done many “brave” things in this company, even telling my boss to go F himself, but I have never had to sit down with HR and take a disciplinary measure. Immediately the next morning, I had a 
“urgent” call with HR and my boss, where I was told by HR person (trans female) that my behaviour is unacceptable and that it is very concerning that I as a leader do not support company values. She also gave me a speech on how she felt as a LGBT representative when she heard what I said and as funny as it sounds now I will be “required” to come to flag raising in June and they are planning to do a video of me storytelling on what I do in my day-to-day on creating LGBT inclusive environment in my department. Cringe as fuck.

My boss and my peers kept their mouth shut, other than saying “be quiet, play the game. This is company primary and foremostly business decision to be seen as LGBT friendly and thats all, because LGBT loby is so strong.”

Such a BS."

End of last year he was at the end of his 6 month probation and they were considering terminating him but he ""Stepped up"" for about 2 weeks.   


Each sale I make $100 as a commission for my part, his making around 5k per sale, he offered me $100 (Double my commission) to help him when needed and fill out 1 quick form for him on each sale which I don't mind anyway it takes 5 minutes.   


Since start of the year this has turned into me doing 50% of his paperwork and moving the other 50% of his paperwork to our temp that comes in 3-4 days a week meant to only be a face and organize paperwork for us and take leads.   


He went off at me last week saying his job is to only get the sale in and that's it, now 99.99% of people in his position are demanded to do all the paperwork too and I'm so fed up, I'm doing my part of the job where I NEED his paperwork to do, but he just makes me do my part without it making my job 3x harder. But I just had a job offer this morning from 2 companies (Both offered at the end of each meeting) wanting to hire me basically for his role elsewhere.   


He's in for a world of shock, as NONE of his sales from this year have their paperwork done because he's the one instructed to do them and trying to force them on me, He went off at me an hour ago about us needing to work on a new formula on how we're going to proceed and get things done right away! I'm handing in my resignation in the next day or so when I get my offers in writing and confirmed hopefully tonight and I CANNOT wait to see him shit bricks, and honestly wouldn't be surprised to hear by the middle of the year he's been let go.

I am not the big dog but I comanage a store. It’s not a long-term viable option, but it’s what keeps me afloat along with insurance. I have a question I’d like outside opinions on. 


The other manager overheard that one of our team members has a second job. She told me in concern and said that I should talk to her about it; I said something like “It’s not our business what she does outside of here,” and was met with, “But we give her more hours than other folk (usually an extra shift or two in comparison to others), that’s not fair if she is making money elsewhere. She also doesn’t pick up any shifts. It’s probably because she works there on the side.” 


Our employees mostly consist of younger folk, ages 16-25, myself and rest of management in our 20s. The main position, “team member,” is definitely a temporary job for most folk. When we hire, we are very transparent about our pay, raises, typical hours, etc. We aren’t going to hire someone who isn’t able to function in this world, especially if they communicate they aren’t 100% in for it. There’s little benefits. We *get it.* I mean, I’m the one who has to remind my boss we give biannual raises….


I understand the concerns, but honestly, it’s not our business. It’s never conflicted with her shifts, she’s never called out, and she is never late. I mean *never.* Impressive. There is no reason to make a deal out of nothing, you know? Especially someone who’s performance is fine? I don’t plan on asking about it unless it raises concerns or conflicts with her current schedule. Plus, I know this second job pays more than we do. Why question the “extra shifts” when she obviously needs it? 


Am I being stubborn for not asking her about it, rude for not being concerned..?

They’ve been messing with my schedule way too much, just this past year my schedule has changed 4 times and my physical office building has changed twice. 
I sold my car and was biking to the office pre-pandemic, and had a baby during the 100% remote portion of the pandemic. Ignoring the fact that returning to the office is dumb in general.
My wife started working again later in the pandemic, and we had a great balance, She worked 3 days and I was in the office the other 2. Perfect balance. Then they required teams need to be on site together. Boomer teammate(my 1 and only teammate) refuses to work with me. My wife swaps her work schedule to maintain our 3/2 balance for our baby. One week after my wife swapped her schedule they send us an email that our office is no longer ours and we’re being moved across the city. But wait, remember that new schedule you planned around? Ignore it! It’ll just be 1 day a week, the day I already was in the office.

6 months pass, and they announce new in-office days, and shocker it’s a different schedule. At this point, I actually complained to my manager, allegedly, she took it up the chain. Short was answer: too bad to deal with it. And dealt with it we did. Just happened to coincide with our other kid starting kindergarten, my wife reduced her workdays and started volunteering at the school since she works only 2 days/week.
5 more months pass, I’m dealing with my commute changing from a 2mile bike ride to an hour long train commute. The job pays for Transit and there the office has a station right next door. Then the email that in 1 month we will move to another office location, AND they’re not just adding a day, they’re rearranging the whole schedule. With a promise to “ reevaluate in three months”.
They are completely fucking up my schedule again, mid school year and then promising to do it again in three more months.

There actually is a union who represents my job code, and there was a meeting about the newest relocation. It’s just a bunch of idiots complaining that they might now have as much light as the newer building has. Or what if the bathrooms aren’t nice… our original office was a temporary trailer 20 years past its due.
I spoke up, and they threw my direct manager under the bus saying days are set by your manager. When I have emails from the C suite decorating the days.

today, I went to put my paycheck in the bank, (the one my company uses as well) and the teller told me that they cannot do anything with this check and to talk with my employer. I think their account has been flagged for writing too many bad checks. I am thinking of putting in my resignation for my last day on Friday. Is it asshole-ish to only give three days resignation and do you think I will be able to get unemployment? 

I feel bad and conflicted because we have/are losing more people, and in general, it just seems like a very chaotic sinking ship. my leaving will put more work on other people. My coworkers are the only reason i’ve stayed this long and I feel bad putting more on them when there’s already so much on them. But I can’t continue working somewhere that has this type of instability. Advice? lol. "

Yesterday was the first exam and I spent all day grading from 08:00-17:00. The professor would not let any of the TA's leave to get food and we literally sat in a locked room grading. I almost collapsed because he told us that leaving to fill up our water bottle is not a valid excuse to leave. Unfortunately our graduate union is unable to help us TAs even though we have complained many times. The professor is able to exploit one sentence in our contract to the fullest and we end up working about 35 hours a week.

8,2024-02-20,At what point did squashing (actual) bad behavior in the workplace stop being widely considered part of a supervisor's/manager's job?,u/SerenityFailed,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1aw2sl8/at_what_point_did_squashing_actual_bad_behavior/,antiwork,"Just what the title asks. Horseplay, unsafe practices, verbal abuse between peers, harassment, gossiping, (actual) insubordination, (actual) laziness, etc. The whole realm of ""hostile work environment"" issues. It's frustratingly always been like this at my current job, but I'm seeing and hearing about the same bs more and more. 

Is it laziness (definitely the primary factor at my job)? Lack of training? Some new bs strategy from some overpaid think-tank? It certainly not how I was raised/taught how to be a supervisor/leader. I was always told maintaining a civil workspace was a huge part of your responsibility because it significantly increases productivity.

I'm currently in  a ""lead"" position, so give out tasks, but cannot give out any disciplinary actions. I've had one of my team members has been openly hostile/disrespectful/insubordinate/verbally abusive for a few weeks now, and apparently I'm just supposed to take it. I can't bark back/discipline as I  have no ground to stand on, but my supervisor just says it's not her job and ""we just all have to be adults"". It may shock you to know that said team member and supervisor are legitimately best friends.....(and yes mgmt is aware of that and allows it to happen, but that's for a different rant). In fact, every other person in the dept has had significant instances of poor treatment from the team member in quest, but still nothing. 

Even for issues with other people though, the supervisor sticks to their narrative.  What's worse is that it's even worse in other departments and some managers and hr people have the same attitude. Yet they all complaine about the high turnover of good workers (again, shocking. I know).

I brought up another incident with my supervisor today, but she just got pissy with me. Between being a former supervisor (who carried significantly more responsibility than just about anyone at my current job) and the stress of it all, it's tearing me up. Unfortunately though, because of some ongoing health issues, it would be almost impossible for me to find something else period, let alone in the same pay range. 

I've really rambled on with this, sorry. Thanks for letting me rant.

Luckily just tendinitis, but my work is super repetitive. I’m in manufacturing making cannabis vapes. And for 5-10hours I’m picking up each vape and putting the mouth piece on then putting them back. And of course it’s all about production we’re been making so many vapes. Like too many like we’re not even keeping up with packing them. So that’s fun for us. 

To add to that fun a manager (not my manager) told me to smile one day last week and I brushed it off. But last night while walking through the hall, minding my own business, he told me to smile again. I was just having a neutral face. And I asked him if he knows how annoying it is to have a man tell you to smile for no reason. And then he said “well frown bitch”. Then gave a small giggle as if we were friends and it was a fun joke we were both in on.

I emailed HR right away and dealing with that on top of navigating workers comp bologna makes this a great week. Really trying to find a new job but I have no idea where to try to work where I won’t be miserable! "

But to do that I first want to really understand what kind of issues you run into in the workplace, dealing with management etc.

I would love to spend 15 to 20 minutes on a Zoom or Teams call with you, if you experienced some of the following types of abuse in the workplace:  


* Psychological (eg. bullying, toxic politics, sexual harassment, perpetual stress)
* Physical (eg. repetitive strain injuries, psychosomatic issues) 
* Spiritual (eg. meaninglessness work or even negative impact on society and environment)

It'll be completely anonymous, just interested in hearing about your experience.

For context, I'm doing this as a little side gig besides my meaningless office job. I'm not in a position to reward you for your time sorry. Just hoping ppl would like to help someone trying to make a difference for workers worldwide! :)

I'm a long time lurker but I'm posting here for the first time hoping someone can advise me.
I have been working at the same company fully remotely for the past 2 years. My team works crazy shifts (imagine waking up for work at 4 am one week, then 4 pm the next) and it seemed impossible that they would force us to return to the office. Yet, they tried.
First, it was 2 days in an office. Nobody complied. Almost all of us continued to work remotely without any sanctions. At the time, I spoke to my boss and warned him that I cannot work hybrid shifts due to health issues and if I am forced to be in an office - I will have to quit. My job is very specific and due to that my notice is 3 months (yep, insane). 
My boss was very understanding and assured me that I can continue working fully remotely as long as I maintain my good results. 
That was until a few weeks ago - when the company announced a mandatory, strict 4 days in the office, even aiming for 5. This time if we do not comply, there will be sanctions, HR meetings, lay-offs, etc.
I spoke to my boss who told me our agreement is no longer valid and I would also be expected to return to the office. I'm based in Europe, I asked around, turns out my case would be suitable for unemployment benefits if my job lays me off, now I am heavily considering asking them to do so.
It seems like RTO is forced upon a lot of us right now, so I am hoping someone here can give me some advice. Thank you in advance!

Some details omitted because, duh. I’ve been in a new job for nearly a year now and today my manager handed me a PIP because she wasn’t happy with how long a task took last week.

 I was tasked with editing a document that a client had put together and I went ahead and did some fairly extensive edits while leaving the overall structure intact to keep the lead on the project’s contribution intact. When going through review with my manager she was “alarmed” at the state of the document and blamed me for several deficiencies. When told her the PM wanted a cursory overview and shorter review and not a rebuild of the document she suggested it was reckless of me to “punish” the project budget for implementing the changes she asked for and if she were in my shoes she would’ve just worked the hours on the project to overcome my own deficiencies without billing the time I put in. 

At this point she has set up a meeting for two months from now that if I’m being honest I think is railroading me into being fired, so I have updated my resume and started applying to new jobs. Personably my goal is to never go to that meeting I two months and instead start working elsewhere. 

A word to the wise it doesn’t matter how well you get along with coworkers, project managers, or clients on a project, if a manager wants you out they will find a way. 

Fuck this place, and here’s to hoping I can get out sooner than later. "

I was job hopping every year. Amazon warehouse, CVS retail, Starbucks, Boba Tea shop, and another warehouse. 6 years of hopelessness and pain.

Recently, I got hired into a corporate office job and thought it was another dead end job. 7 months in and I'm actually happy. I make $120,000 /yr and its 4x higher than any job I ever had. 8am-noon is busy, a 1 hr break, and 5 hours of down time just looking at my phone while waiting for someone needing help from me. 

Most of my office co-workers really really hate this job because they had been here for decades. They get tired from boredom and annoyed by long calls. 

From my perspective, retail work is way worse than this. I could get fired any minute and get burnout everyday. Here, im chillin because my boss is chill and no one here has gotten fired in decades. Everybody here looks at their phone when they're bored, so I'm enjoying what I always do at home."

TLDR: manager wants me to change what days I work, despite it not working for me for several reasons listed below.

------

For background context, I'm a full time receptionist at a dealership. There are typically 2 receptionists, as the days are usually between 9-10 hrs each, so we both work about 4 days a week, or work together to accommodate each other if we have appointments, etc. I typically put the schedule together for the month, with input from the other receptionist (R2). The managers don't get involved nor do they care what we do with the schedule as long as one of us is here each day.

Sometime in January it was confirmed with management that R2 would be transferring to another location. She and I got along well so she had told me about the potential of transferring back in November or December.

At that point, I planned on changing my availability as soon as we got a new receptionist (R3) so I could go back to school online full time, as well as try to get back to seeing my psychologist and psychiatrist regularly. My classes start March 3.

 During this time, I'm working typically Wednesday - Saturday. R2 works Monday - Thursday. During the winter, we aren't open on Sundays, but we are going to be open again starting in March.

R3 comes along in the middle/towards the end of January and R2 trains her for a week or two. Everything is pretty much fine. The first week is normal as I had been told R3 would be training Monday - Friday. Okay cool, I'll work my normal days bc we need one of us here for Saturday. No worries. I do change my availability in our schedule's excel sheet.

R2's last day is January 31, so I create the schedule for February. I take Monday - Thursday, and schedule R3 for Wednesday - Saturday, as I had been told that R3's schedule is ""much more flexible than [R2]'s"". R2 had also been going to school and was available every day except Friday and Saturday. 

I finished the schedule and showed it to R3 and asked if it would work for her. She said it was fine.

Until a week ago I get approached by the BDC manager (BDM) (who isn't our direct boss, but she takes care of us so the GM has less on his plate) and she tells me that R3 is unhappy with the schedule and that the GM had promised her she wouldn't work weekends, or every weekend. Not sure which as this detail is a little fuzzy, depending on which manager you talk to lol

Anyway, I protest a bit but I'm not rude about it, though I express my frustration a bit. I end up agreeing because I do ultimately want to be cooperative and make things easier for everyone. R3 and I try to come up with a schedule for March that has us sharing weekends- me taking Saturday and Sunday one week, and her taking them the next week.

Before I tell you what the schedule is, I want to preface it with saying I have some really bad ADHD and suspected autism. I'd like to seek out an official diagnosis for the autism, but I know it's expensive typically. My reason for saying this is because I cannot function with wonky schedules. I need consistency each week, or as close to it as possible. This includes having my days off be consecutive. Its been this way since I was 19, and I'm 28 now lol

Anyway the best possible schedule that we came up with [can be seen here](https://imgur.com/a/Cn6pqej). 

Like I said, between my nuerodivergencies and my activities outside of work, I cannot function with a schedule like this. 

I tried going back to our BDM after I had thought further about the schedule for a day or two, and tried explaining this all to her. She basically said ""I can't do that. If you stick to this schedule, I can see about giving you a different position that will better accommodate the hours you're wanting."" I was reluctant but ended up agreeing to try, because I'm dumb and just want to make everyone happy. 

I went home and thought about it some more. I remembered how hard of a time I had doing online school while I was working for Starbucks with their wonky scheduling. I remembered how I neglected my personal needs and necessities just to go along with the schedule I was given that ultimately didn't benefit me. I talked with my husband about it. We talked about how I was basically a zombie after work each day. 

I decided to approach my GM and explain the issue and explain how I wanted to make things work, but the most flexible I could be was to work every other Sunday. He said he didn't care what we did with the schedule as long as it was fair, and that would talk to BDM and R3 tomorrow (which, at the time of writing this at 3:30 AM is now later today LMAO). He also said he didn't know about my availability change. Bc why would you? You don't interact with me if you don't have to and you didn't ask to double check it before hiring R3. However, I'm 99% sure I had told the BDM that I planned on going back to school soon.

This is really one of my first times trying to put my foot down about my needs at work, so I'm nervous. I know you shouldn't be friends with managers bc it makes things like this difficult , but I don't want the BDM to be upset that I'm walking back my decision AGAIN and I went above her head to the GM. But I didn't feel like I was being listened to or that my struggles were being acknowledged.

Is what I'm asking for too much? Should I just suck it up and deal with it? I have a hard time telling when I'm being taken advantage of or telling when I'm bending over backwards for someone to make their life easier if it makes my life harder. 

Idk y'all. I need some outside perspective. Thank you so much if you read all of my ramblings lmao much love"

Not this time though... The energy already felt a little off, but I didn't know anything yet. Just before the meeting started, a couple of guys in nice suits who I've never seen before came in with the guy that normally gives the meeting. As he starts talking, after introducing one of these men as the CEO of America (haha it's funny because he must be so important as the CEO of America) he said something that made me say aloud ""it sounds like we're about to get laid off."" And I'll be damned. About a minute and a half later, he actually gets to the meat and potatoes of his announcement, which is the this factory is shutting down by October 2025. The first line will shut down in 6 months and the rest will gradually phase out over the next year and a half-ish. 


It fuckin sucks, yo. I had no idea this was coming. At all. The company has had this location here for like 25 or so years. They just bought the building next to it within the last year or so. Though, I get the impression it was tied to this company some kinda which way before they bought it and just under a different name, so that could just be part of the phasing out process. 


I've never fought so hard to make it through a shift as I did tonight. Shit damn near makes me want to walk out into traffic. It ain't *that* bad, but your boy is sad. Even if I have the whole year and a half, this is still daunting. It's sad for me and it's also sad for the area. I love looking at empty factories all over the goddamn place. It's my favorite"

Something succinct.

I believe it all starts when greed and/or selfishness begin to feed people's definition of ""worth"".

Every person hired is (or should be anyway) essential to having the business run and make profit. Therefore, everyone equally shares the profit.

An owner's idea is useless without the employee to bring to fruition. The employee needs the owner's idea to make the money they need. 

A janitor is essential to making the environment of work comfortable so it can be done. The basic employee makes it run. The manager ensures the employee functions optimally. The executive ensures the overall idea and direction are sound. 

Profit is divided equally because everyone is essential in their own way.

While heirarchy is essential to a smoothly running business...it all falls apart when people feel ""better than"" others. Having a higher rank deserves more, the owner deserves the most...why? No logical reason other than Greed & Selfishness.

Many feel the amount of learning equals greater worth. No. The additional learning should willingly be done to increase personal opportunity and enjoyment of work, not profit.

The janitor requires little knowledge, but they sacrifice learning for enduring. Enduring more of what is unenjoyable by many.

The educated works more to gain more knowledge for the benefit of escaping the unwanted duties of other jobs.

Sure, you can have bonuses and rewards for exceptional contributions to profit, and the more educated job will give more opportunity for that, but there is no reason, outside of Greed & Selfishness to not pay everyone an equal share. To be fair.

This is long-winded enough, but the other problem with work is time. Everything should be balanced.

But no. Soon I get up to spend a large amount of time getting ready to work, because my employer is selfish. To work for less than I should make and for longer than I should, because they are greedy."

To which I clap back at this asshole, saying okay we’ll I’ve  asked for a schedule every week and you never give me one until Sunday night at 8 pm, which is completely unacceptable. 
This must have blown his mind that I didn’t let him berate and walk all over me, because he continued to curse and  yell at me with his office door wide open,with my coworkers in the other room. 
After 10 minutes of me defending myself, and him finally calming down , as well as myself because of how heated this had gotten, he goes “okay now that’s behind us let’s move forward, and this is water under the bridge” and I said okay and got to work. 

This guy really shot himself in the foot because business is getting really busy, and he’s going to be back down to two staff as soon as I head in and leave my keys. 

I’ve never been verbally abused and berated by an owner/ceo of a business before, especially as an inexperienced 1 month new employee. 

The job hunt will continue. 

Oh and the business in question is a laundromat. "

What I propose is engineering a solution to life's main problems. The biggest problems are housing and food. If these problems can be solved in an affordable manner then it frees the person to focus on higher level aspects of life. I believe I can engineer a solution to this but I can't do it alone. If you are interested in collaborating, view my profile and links to see what skills I offer. I'm looking for smart people with different skills.

I work in the US for a well known  confection company.  At work there “job codes” that are based on your labor grade which affects pay rates. We are required to change job codes every time we switch jobs. Some jobs pay higher some lower. All jobs start at the entry level pay but can range up to $10/hr more. 


My issue is with my paystub. It doesn’t show any rate of pay. On a typical night I will move jobs back and forth 4-5 times. It’s a very fast paced environment, there is no physical way to document how much time you spend on each job unless you carry a pen and paper with you.

Yesterday I lost my job after working for 14 years. It's not important what it was, except that it was very important to me and I loved the work.

Last year I dealt with some health issues, specifically a back surgery. The back issues were caused by the work. No accute event, just the constant wear and tear over the years of doing it. 

I had surgery and took some time off to recover. No problem. Well the surgery didn't go as expected and made things worse. My few weeks off turned into 2 months and I'm not getting better.

My work people are telling me it's a mess without me. My one man department is getting messed with by my boss (who is new). I fear that the reputation of my department is going to damaged if I stay out much longer.

I see my Dr. Again and he agrees to give me a ready to work letter, even though I'm physically not ready. I make an appointment with another Dr. Second opinion.

Meanwhile I go back to work and it's rough. I'm not ready. My whole body hurts and I can't think strait because of the pain. I make mistakes. I own them.

I get a second opinion and the new Dr. Said the first surgery messed me up worse and I need another one to get me strait. 4-6 week recovery, minimum.

I go to my boss and explain the situation. He accused me of lying to him because I have a letter from previous Dr. Saying I'm ready to work. ""Why get a second opinion?"" He sends me home with pay, to consult with HR and the lawyers.

So yesterday we talked and he offered me a compensation package if I resign. At this point I'm heartbroken and frustrated because of everything I gave to this job. Relationships, my mental health, my literal body. I don't want to work for an organization that would treat me like this so I accept the money rather than fight it. I sign something saying I won't talk about it. 

Now I don't have insurance for the upcoming surgery. I'm in my 40s and I can barely walk or stand strait.

14 years of service, to a job I loved and cared about and wrapped my whole identity in. My mistake. Today I learned a job won't love you back."

I've got several physical and mental issues going on and now have a whole family too (never planned on having kids and was told would never, both kids were extreme surprises after many many years of unprotected fun time with the same partner so don't judge me plz). One thing I keep running into is that I start off my search knowing exactly what will work for me and what won't. For example, 2-3 part time set days a week, no weekends, no being on my feet the entire day, not extremely detail oriented, permanent employment, 20 ish hours a week and for the love of God no more sales or temp marketing jobs 😮‍💨. I had one position that was a temp marketing gig that ended up lasting me 3 years, but most last about 6 months, which sucks because the schedules and types of work are actually perfect for me. As time goes by and finances start to dwindle I find myself extremely anxious and incredibly desperate so I throw myself at the first opportunity every time. It's usually something sales oriented (I've only ever done sales really) something with a shitty 💩 retail schedule involving long days, late nights, weekends, changing schedules, over 30-32 hours ~4 days per week or worse another temporary marketing gig that could end at any time leaving me still anxious and frantic searching for a ""real job"". I usually last about 1 - 3 months before I physically and mentally can not take it anymore at these wrong fit jobs, my family begins to suffer, my physical and mental health suffer, my job performance suffers (especially if the job is extremely detail oriented or physical), and I am all around insufferable to be around. So I quit, usually with the support of my husband too because he's so tired of me being miserable. And thus the cycle renews itself. I'm so tired of being stuck in this loop."

They have more needs, more fears.

They lose control over meaningless petty shit and they clearly feel like shit most of the time.

I go to a pet store in my neighbourhood very regularly, and the staff recognise me instantly. The manager had previously told me to drop off a resume, but it was for Christmas time and I didn't want to just get thrust into the busiest time of year at a super busy location, so I declined.

I asked her at the beginning of Feb if it was still an option. She said yes, they have room for a part time person. I told her about my disability, and she didn't seem fazed, and told me again to send it in

So I did! I got home, edited my resume, included a cover letter about what we spoke of - and I outlined the accomodations necessary forms to work there.

I have to sit down if I feel dizzy, and I can't stand still for 10 mins or more. I need to walk around a bit, or take a quick sit down to rest before standing back up. I'm talking like... a 1-2 minute sit when I'm having issues, which isn't all the time, just for my balance that gets out of whack. There's a large space behind the counter (plenty of room for a small stool) and a back room, where I would want to work more anyway, and I told her to her face, and she smiled like it was all okay.

I got a response that night shortly before the close time of the store. Guess what it said?

""We don't have any available positions but we will keep your resume on file.""

... sigh. I want to live in a world where people don't lie to a disabled person's face and cause them stress and effort they probably can't afford. I wanna live in an honest world where someone can say ""no"" instead of kind of screwing me over. 

Anyway, I have applied for so many jobs, got no replies, even without divulging my disabled status up front. Time to get denied disability thru the government, I guess?

I just want to buy new leggings and underwear without having to do a deep budget. Sigh."

Used it for almost five years doing environmental cleanup work for banks, oil companies etc. That was a mix of office and working outside in NE US. I was to slow, and bad at the office work. 
Moved on to excavation and utility work. I loved being outside more but eventually found that fixing the equipment paid better especially doing the winter and rainy days. Spent five years there but again too slow and bad at the little bit office work
Went to work just turning wrenches on rental construction equipment and loved it. But it was 2+ hours from home and the benefits were trash. But also they told me I was just mediocre at the job. 

Basically 8 employers in 13 years doing various different kinds of work and not one place have I found success or what I should be doing. Everyday is a battle, wear and tear on your body or on your soul or both. 
Shit managers who could not do your job but want to tell you what to do. 
Before I had a wife and a kid I enjoyed traveling for work and being outside as often as possible but now the best part is walking in the front door to my family. 
I wish all of you young people on here good luck in finding your career that is a good fit but I aint there yet.

1,2024-02-21,Does anyone have any suggestions for a career path for a 28 year old nonbinary person?,u/ciaklivian,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1awkfkp/does_anyone_have_any_suggestions_for_a_career/,antiwork,"(Note: Both my wife and I are nonbinary and use they/them pronouns.)

I am 28 years old with a Bachelor's degree in theater (I know, a useless degree and if I could go back and do it differently I would) and do not know what direction to take my career path. I currently am a private nanny but it only pays $20 an hour and has no benefits. I have years of experience in childcare (nannying, daycare, teaching dance classes), customer service, and food service. I have my own passion projects and hobbies that in a dream world I would be able to make a living doing (streaming on Twitch, YouTube content creation, film making, podcasting, voice acting, theater, etc.) I don't believe it's completely out of the realm of possibility (though I know it is not anywhere near easy) to one day make a manageable living from doing stuff like that but I know that I need some kind of career path to fall back on in the mean time or if it never works out that any of those things makes me any income. 

I don't want to be rich, I just want to be able to earn enough to live comfortably with my wife and hopefully one day have a small house and raise a family. I also don't want to have to give up doing things I enjoy and having free time to spend with family and friends and a good work life balance. Even if I ended up with a job that I don't particularly ""love"" or feel passionate about, if it made enough to live on and I had some spare time to live my life outside of work I would be fine.
I have considered so many things, to the point where I feel like I have to be completely forgetting or missing so many options. I am a quick learner, have interest in many things, and I'm willing to go back to school if I have to. I am just so worried about investing time and money into a path and then realizing later down the line that I made a terrible, irreversible mistake that won't serve me the way I want in the long run. I have considered teaching (my wife is a middle school teacher), dental hygene, cyber security, IT, marketing, mental health work, and everything in between. One of my biggest worries is that I am nonbinary and starting HRT soon and getting top surgery is in my five year plan and I know in a lot of professions looking obviously lgbtq+ can really hurt my chances of getting the job or progressing to higher positions in a career (or even put me in harms way.) I feel like I have decision paralysis and can't just decide what next step to take, instead I'm just stuck in the meticulously researching all the possibilities and options I can think of to the point where I end up talking myself out of every idea I come up with. I know that a lot of people's advice here would to be to just pick something and make a next step so that I don't just become stagnant and never make any progress but I am terrified of wasting any remaining resources (time, money, willpower) I could possibly scrape together to put my life on a better path and then not getting another chance. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for careers I could go into either with the education and skills/experience I already have or something I could go back to school for that doesn't take a crazy amount of time/money to start? I live near a major city if that makes any difference.

There should be a law (Canada) that states if you work more than four or five days in a row, for more than 6 to 8 hour shifts, you should legally be required two consecutive days off for rest time. I don’t get rest and I’m burning myself out. 

The responsibility of my job is killing me. Since Christmas when I got promoted, I haven’t had time to think or rest!

On the flip side, despite being intentionally kept in the dark on most things, I learned a lot by working under near-constant pressure from this manager.

After a few years, I’m at a point where I would not do well in a new role and would benefit from rest instead. Not a one week vacation, but a real break.

How much in savings might be OK to consider resigning and just live life for a bit? I have more than one years worth of savings if nothing catastrophic were to take place.

I'd like to keep developing the skills and knowledge I've gained, which are pretty marketable if I do leave.

I’m just wondering if this is something I should bring to HR, or report elsewhere for slander. I can’t afford this. Cost of living has skyrocketed and I’ve already burned through all my savings just to keep afloat. I’m so fucking livid I don’t know what to do.

1,2024-02-21,A lil rant,u/Whisperfights,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1awnz4n/a_lil_rant/,antiwork,"Someone at work sent me a message with a very aggressive tone. I sent back my normal annoyingly peppy response that I wouldn't get them exactly what they wanted but I was working on the request and would have results asap. They then responded very aggressively that if it wasn't done exactly as they wanted, they would take the task from me. 

1. The CEO gave me this task and took it from you
2. You are not my boss
3. You don't get to talk to me like that

So I responded that I didn't appreciate the tone but this could be a conversation. If it was to be a unilateral decision, like it or not, it's mine to make. If they didn't like what I did last time that's okay, so I asked for precise feedback.

They said there was no tone. Okay, you threatened my job but okay. And then said I didn't know what I was talking about and everyone says how much they hate what I did last time nonstop. So I investigated. 

""Hi team that this decision actually directly effects- what changes would you like to see as I'm ramping up the next round?""
The team responds- ""nothing, these are great. No changes or maybe do the same thing but more of it.""
""Are you sure? I'm ordering special versions for other people so any requests or feedback is welcome!""
""Nope, thanks for asking though""

So I go back, 'I don't think everyone hates it. Happy to make changes for you but understand the feedback you hear maybe isn't the only feedback out there.' (Plus you are such a a negative ass all the time, if you tell staff something is bad, people agree with you to get you to leave.) Everyone has complained about their attitude but there's nothing that can be done, they're too important to the operation.

Radio silence since and it's been 7 hours. Bro why is it like this?? I don't want to waste my boss's time with petty shit but omg this person is always like this. Coined the phrase 'equal opportunity asshole' because they treat everyone like this.

It's a small company so there isn't a hr, it's just the CEO (who is actually like the best guy ever) ughhhh

Sorry I just needed to rant. What would y'all do?"

I’ve been working as a freelance artist since December of that year. I also serve part time in the army reserve.
   Between the money I make freelancing and my pay from battle assembly I’ve been able to live my life the way I want to and enjoy it. 
Even though I’m self employed I always keep my resume updated. Recently I got a job offer for a sales position at a print shop. Normally I wouldn’t take the job but It was something I was actually interested in and was exited to do. 
  My first red flag yesterday was that they only did contract employment and not w2 so they didn’t pay overtime. Second they had me sign a non compete agreement which the language basically specified I couldn’t freelance outside of work. 
  Yesterday they left me at the front all by myself and barely helped me learn any of their payment methods. Which is three separate sites.  
    I came in with a built in customer base from painting signs and also working in the music industry as a promoter. I tried to give them business cards for stores in my area that want signs. As well as let them know that I have 2 alternative rock bands and a YouTuber that we’re looking for a supplier for new merchandise.
     Today after sitting through about 6 hours of training videos and restocking shelves they told me I wasn’t a good fit and to go home… 
   I guess this is my sign to stay freelance."

I'm pretty sure I lost to a no-show in court today. I was fired after I was hired to work remotely at the beginning of the pandemic and refused to go work in the office after 3.5 years of remote work. I was fired for insubordination for not going back to an office I never worked in... It drives me nuts that unemployment insurance tax is taken out of my checks, it is completely worthless."

Though My Boss Did It In A Back Handed Way. ,u/TylPlas26,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1awplhv/been_in_retail_since_2009_im_finally_out_though/,antiwork,"I’ve been in retail since 2009. And my now last job, I was there since 2014. I won’t go into huge details about about the work environment. A lot of that can be seen on my profile of other job posts. 

But to summarize, in the whole time I was there my Boss, despite always saying family time is important, he would always screw over my personal time off. Couple with that, and childish and immature coworkers who threw tantrums and gave silent treatments, I was at the end of my rope. 

My job mostly consisted of delivering building material. I had a certain certificate to operate a certain type of delivery truck. The certification was going to expire at the end of the year. 

About a week or so into January, HR came to do a review with me. During the review, they mentioned they are holding a course to revalidate the certification for everyone in the company in two weeks. They said “It’s on your weekend off, but are you able to attend?” I looked at my calendar and said I had plans booked that day, so it doesn’t work to my schedule. 

My company wanted to get everyone done at once, that way they save money on group training.

HR just said “See what you can do to attend.” And I said that the plans were set in stone, and things were left at that. 

About a week before the course, HR emailed again, saying this course is critical for my job, so to try and attend. I replied it doesn’t work for my schedule. That I’d be happy to do it any other day, but this is going on during my weekend off, where I made plans well in advance, so it doesn’t work for my schedule. 

For a few days, there was nothing else. My boss owns a few stores. And one worker came by that was also going to the course. Told me he had been making plans with his fiancé for the last several months for that weekend, but had to cancel them because they suddenly revealed this training course and had to attend. He wasn’t too happy plans he made for months had to be canceled. I said nothing to him, figured it was his choice if he choose to do that. 

Then suddenly my boss began phoning me two days before the course. I recorded the conversation. Maybe in the future I’ll upload it, but for now, I’ll just transcribe what was said. AB will stand for A**hole Boss. 

And just for some context, earlier that week, I got a work truck stuck in the snow, and called a tow truck to pull me out, and paid for it myself. It will be important for what happens next. And this is roughly how it went. 

AB: Hey OP. HR tells me you are unable to attend the training course.

OP: That’s correct. I unfortunately made plans in advance so I can’t attend.

AB: (After a moment of silence.) I need you to get this training done.

OP: I understand that. But I made plans well in advance, that I can’t just cancel.” 

AB: Ok. You realize when we notify you two weeks in advance, it doesn’t mean it’s optional. This is mandatory.” 

At this point, I was starting to get mad. 

OP: I understand that. But I’ve been planning this weekend since early December. I’ll be out a lot of money if I cancel. 

AB: What are you doing?
 
OP: That is a private matter. I can’t discuss that.

AB: (After a moment of silence) OP, how much is that towing bill costing me? 

OP: I paid for that myself because that was my screw up.

AB (Silent again for a few seconds) Ok. Then you’re gonna have to do this training on your own time and your own money then. 

The training itself cost only a few hundred dollars, but by this point, I had it with my boss. 

OP: Well, we will cross that bridge when we get there.” 

AB: (Silent again) This is pretty rich coming from you. 

OP: Well, I’m sorry. But I received no heads up, no communication this was being planned for that date. 

(I know there were plans to do the training early December, but never heard anything about it since either September or October.  

AB: (Silence again) OP. I’m not happy right now. 

OP: Well, I’m sorry. But I have a life, and I can’t just cancel things.

AB: Ok. Good enough. Bye. 

OP: Bye. 

So for a week, I heard nothing. Continued my job as normal while looking for a new job, because I had it with my boss. 9 years of all this, I had reached my breaking point during that phone call. 


And then one week later, towards the end of the day, HR showed up. They informed me they were “laying me off” due to extremely slow season, with hopes of having me come back in spring. 

I said nothing, choosing to leave on a high note. But I knew it was really their way of firing me without firing me. That way, they avoid paying severance which would have been in the 10’s of thousands of dollars. I estimated between 10 and 40 000. 


I already looked into it. Unfortunately I have no real way of proving this is retaliation. All their paper work, though I know a lie, say I was laid off for lack of work, etc. The only proof I have is recently, I had to contact the insurance provider for my company to get a letter of experience from them. The agent I spoke with said he recognized my name, saying my now former employer recently removed me from their insurance coverage. 

Other than this back handed move, I’m glad to be out of there. I was unhappy, stressed, and fed up. I’m using the time to advance my driver’s license to have the highest one I can get in my country. 

If anyone is curious to know what stories in my profile pertain to this company, feel free to look, or message me, and I’ll tell you which stories they are."
1,2024-02-21,I Laid Off Entire Department and Replaced It With My AI Agent,u/johnrushx,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1awpr8c/i_laid_off_entire_department_and_replaced_it_with/,antiwork,"I've been launching AI Agents for years.  
At first, I thought of it as an experiment that has limits and I'll end up having just pretty useful tools on the market which may generate some passive revenues for me.

As AI advanced, the tools advanced too.

In my HoldCO I had a marketing department that was burning half of my revenues.

I set a goal of simply looking at the work done by every human in the department, and automating it.

Here are 2 stories, where my AI tools took away the human jobs.

1) SeoBOT AI.

One of the heaviest marketing efforts we've done was around SEO.

We had a bunch of people doing keyword research, article brainstorming, and actual content creation.

One article normally takes one person about 1-2 days. So One human could produce 2-3 articles a week. The average salary is $40k a year for about 120 articles produced, which is $333 per article.

The AI Agent I've built ended up making slightly worse quality than a human but only for $2.

First I run both the humans and AI agents next to each other. Eventually it was obvious to me that AI agent was a way better value for money. So I laidoff entire department, keeping just the main guy, who runs the AI agents and moderates their work.

It's been almost a year now, and I've saved huge amount of money.

&#x200B;

2) ListingBott.  
Another job I had inhouse was about internet listings. The people would be going around the internet, finding places where they could list our links to earn relevant DoFollow backlinks and click traffic.  
There are trillion sites in internet, so it's pretty heavy work to find those places where you can list your product.

So I built another AI agent + Browser Robot. That does this work on its own, 24/7.

Long story short: same thing here, AI replaced my entire department.  


So after all, I'm having nearly passively run business, that will soon just be totally automated, so I can practically retire.

But ethically, I'm wondering, is this the future? Are all these jobs gonna be taken away by AI? If I'm having the facts for this. It has happened within my org.

355,2024-02-21,Fired for Asking for W-2s,u/Noidstradamus,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1awptbk/fired_for_asking_for_w2s/,antiwork,"Reddit,

This is a sticky one.

My wife works for a business owner who owns a playschool.  We will call her Sarah for the purposes of this story.  Throughout 2023, Sarah paid my wife her hourly wages through five different payroll sources.  They started the year with Square, switched to Gusto after a few months, then switched back to Square (on a diff account) for the last part of the year.  During such time, Sarah also occasionally paid my wife her wages via Venmo from both the business account and from her (Sarah's) personal account.  We are fixing to do our taxes for this year and we only have two W-2s for her.  One for Gusto and one for the most recent round of Square.  We are missing tax documents from the first round of Square and for all of the Venmo payments.  I (husband) politely and professionally and with my wife by my side, requested further tax documentation from Sarah.  Sarah got upset.  Sarah admitted via email that if she was forced to provide such documentation, then she would have to ""eat a lot of money in taxes.""  Which translates to:  ""I didn't withhold employee taxes, nor pay employer taxes for the Venmo payments, and I don't want to"".  I'm no expert, but to me, that sounds like tax evasion.  Anywho, after reading her angry emails and responding professionally, we have reached a point where Sarah is no longer returning emails.  And........here is the kicker, we are 99% sure she has fired my wife.  Sarah texted another employee that my wife works with, that she has replaced my wife on the schedule.  And that employee contacted my wife.  My wife has NEVER had any adverse action taken against her for ANY job.  She is a model employee.  In fact, Sarah has repeatedly mentioned how this business is basically still alive because of the work my wife puts into it.  Do we have any kind of recourse on this?  


TLDR:  My wife and I requested missing tax documentation from her employer, who got upset and very likely fired her for asking."

I don't want to continue doing deliveries, and with my relationship almost at an end, I foresee issues trying to rent a flat or even a room because I don't have a) references from work and b) references from a landlord.

I don't want to make a desperate plea or suggest that being dishonest is my only option, but I need a) to secure a job and b) to find a place to sleep. There's a subreddit called /bemyreference where, although someone might be willing to act as my reference, I feel it's not my right, and I'm concerned that the reference might not be sustainable.

Given this, I googled for a solution and came across workingreferences.co, but after a Zoom meeting and further research, I believe it's a scam. My purpose in posting here on Reddit is to find out if workingreferences.co is legitimate or if there are similar legitimate services in the UK.

Again, my apologies, I'm facing a difficult situation, and I just want to improve my life. I have skills and responsibility to offer beyond delivery work. I'm simply seeking advice on whether workingreferences.co is okay or if there are reputable alternatives in the UK.

I don’t wanna hear the ol’ “you have to eat green apples to survive” 
“Well what am I supposed to do without green apples? Starve?” 

I mean this is the kindest, sweetest way. If you hate your job, boss, coworkers … Quit! I urge you all to take the leap (have trust you won’t fall/ you’ll be caught)  - I did … and I’m never looking back

Live through your true interests and passions - your innate traits and skills - your values… goals… there’s only one YOU and YOU are actively doing a massive disservice to humanity / the collective consciousness/ the oneness within all of us is … if you aren’t actively tapping into this unique separate self and authentically presenting it to the world (through work) 
Use your will and push yourself towards the life you dream of. It’s possible!

However.. it’s Not possible when you’re messing around at a job anyone could do. You know what your soul’s capable of, you know where your purpose and passion collide … lean towards THAT. 

Start a business - alone or with someone 

Research into the things that make you feel alive 
For some of us it’s baking 
For others it’s hiking 
For others it’s mathematics 

Make connections with these people you find in your research 
 
Work for yourself 
Not someone else 

Choose your “uniform” or role you play 
Choose your hours 
Choose your environment 
Choose your life / reality 

I believe in you, please if you’re looking for a sign THIS IS IT 

Okay, I’m done. Lol 
Break free fellow work haters

I wanted to say, ""that has nothing to do with the position I'm applying for,"" and move on and not answer the question, as I feel like it's a bait question.

To me, it seems like they're trying to poke around in my life outside of work. Like they want me to say, ""yeah when I'm not at work I have a side hustle. I'm always on the grind, I dedicate my life to work!!!""

Some years ago I started a business with a partner. I’m essentially sweat equity and own a fraction of the company and get paid less than I should. After years of arguments and disagreements it came to a point where he demanded my key and told me to go home and not come back. When I went to comply he sort of back peddled and said he didn’t mean it, but degraded me in front of the staff nonetheless. I decided at that moment I was out. 

I’ve accepted a job but they need me to start immediately. The thing is, my current employment agreement says that I must work 90 days after having given written resignation. I will absolutely be breaking this. The thing is, the same employment agreement says that the company should have been paying my taxes, something that it has never done, and subjecting me to yearly reviews, something is has also never done. 

I can’t imagine that one cancels the other out. It can’t be that simple right? Do I need to be worried about legal retaliation? 

As far as ownership goes, I have no idea what happens to that. We never made a profit even though the business is doing fairly well. I would be working for a competitor, something that is stated in the operating agreement as something I cannot do while also being a shareholder. I sort of expected to walk away from this ownership percentage and vow to never take percentage of a company in lieu of fair pay again, but if there’s any insight on that I’d love to hear it as well.

I went on a trip to my country to see my grandma who is sick and I advised my job that I’d be out for a grand total two days. I let my job know of this months ago. 

A week prior to my trip I get COVID and I inform my job. I am told to isolate for 5 days and return to the office after. After being clear of COVID I return to work for a day, catch up on as much work as I can and head out to my trip the day after. I ask my coworker to tell management to give him my work for the days I will be missing. They assure him that won’t be necessary and I will be able to complete it as soon as I am back. 

I clock into work today to several emails from my bosses. Important deadlines were missed and it’s my fault- somehow. The deadlines weren’t even missed really- the insurance carriers we deal with are just saying they were. 

Now I’m pretty sure I’m in the hot seat and my managers are really bad people.

It just doesn’t seem right or make sense? How can someone be with a company and have experience for 30 years and not make that much more than the relativity new guy? I get minimum wage is higher and I’m sure inflation plays a role. But shouldn’t those loyal employees have there pay rates bumped up a bit as well?

It’s starting to be clear why companies don’t want their employees discussing with each other how much they make. 😂

I also noticed a lot of places would rather hire new people (and pay them more) than to give raises to their current employees who are already doing 2-3 people work because of being short staffed.

This VP told me that my backpack makes individuals feel uncomfortable and that it is a political statement and that I can't have my backpack on premise. After this verbal conversation I wrote an email.

I wanted to make sure that I understood our verbal conversation this morning. Am I correct in understanding that the lunch bag stating ,Respect everyone, be kind, end sexual harassment is deemed as a political view and disrespectful to all employees? Would I be correct in my understanding that per my vp there should be no statements about sexual harassment on the premises of said company, and that written statements about sexual harassment are deemed disrespectful, political. Am I correct in understanding that per this conversation there should be no written policy or statements about harassment on the portal , or in the building due to the fact it is deemed a political statement and is disrespectful to all employees?

If the above statements have to come off i will replace them with the companies harassment policy.

1. I interviewed on Tuesday and was pretty much hired on the spot, contingent based on passing the background check, which I did. So far so good.
2. They told me I'm required to take the certification for CPR, which I paid for, which is fine. That's understandable.
3. On Friday, they organized a zoom meeting training which I had to call off my other job in order to go to. After this, they sent a link for a quiz based on the training. I got a 91% because the one question they missed wasn't information they covered. Then, they said I had to take another quiz in order to start picking subbing assignments, but by last Friday, they never sent it. They said they'd send it Monday.
4. On Monday, I called inquiring about the other quiz and it took calling them 6 or 7 times before they finally provide me with an answer, telling me that they'll send the link for the second quiz on Monday. They also told me that they sent the link to everyone else but somehow forgot to send me the link. They  also contradicting themselves by saying they ""still haven't made the second quiz"", so at this point , they aren't telling a story that adds up. They said they would have it by Wednesday, that being today.
5. Today, I called and they told me that they've ""decided to move on with other candidates"" but they encourage me to ""apply for the upcoming school year"". Mind you they've already made me a hiring offer, gave me stuff for the training, had me pay for a CPR certification, took one of their quizzes, and then suddenly got dropped before getting the chance to take the second quiz. I'm not sure what went wrong and it doesn't seem like it was me considering they encouraged me to reapply at the beginning of the next school year. Of course, I will not be reapplying for this company in the future because I wouldn't want them to waste any more of my time and money."

It was a toxic environment with a lot of in-fighting, unsafe work practices, and zero empathy from management. Whilst I'm happy to have left, I still hold issues with some of the workplace rules.

One rule that pissed me off is ""walk time"". The supermarket chain I worked at had a rule that your break time includes ""walk time"", which is the time it takes to walk between your department and the break room.

The break room at my old store was in the furthest back corner accessed through the back dock, and if you were working in the bakery in the front corner of the store, it took you 3-5mins to get there (especially during busy periods). So if I was working in the bakery for 5hrs and had a 15min unpaid break, I would get maybe 5-7mins of actual break time before I had to pack up, wipe down and walk back. The managers would also get pissed if you didn't help customers that stopped you, and they counted the time you helped a customer on-break as ""walk time"". Which is bullshit, because that's work!

I also kept getting shifted on for deli closes and no one would come to relieve me for my breaks, so I was essentially forced to work unpaid through my breaks. If I left anyway, I would be reprimanded for leaving the deli unattended and was incessantly called over the PA until I returned. If I asked for help, I would be told that no one else left in the store was trained to operate in the deli so tough luck! Let me point out, as I did at the time, that there was no requirements to be deli-trained to simply serve a customer from the case. The only requirement was a hairnet, hand-washing and gloves (which there was plenty of). I was ignored.

One duty manager that regularly worked evenings outright refused to work in the deli because she didn't like the ""butchery"" smell and it gave her the ick. The other duty manager would tell me to just leave the deli unattended to take my break, but would also immediately call me back over the PA to serve the single customer standing there *that he could have served, saving a whole bunch of time for everyone including the customer and himself*.

I was reprimanded on at least a weekly basis by the store manager for either racking up overtime hours (which I had to do every time to complete the close), OR for leaving the deli incomplete and going home on schedule (to avoid racking up overtime). Suffice to say, we were consistently understaffed and had a high turnover rate.

As a massive ""fuck you"", I quit during the worst period the deli had ever seen. Including myself, there were only three senior deli-trained employees available to work including the dept manager (who managed two different depts AND was only part-time). They had *just* hired three new employees for deli, none of which were up to speed. AND it was during the school holidays, coming up to a national holiday. I only made a small impact upon leaving, but it was apparently a disaster for a short while.

I guess my point of posting is to discuss these retail rules around breaks, particularly unpaid breaks. It's a system that seems built to diminish and punish employees. Even the smallest things like the silly ""walk time"" rule really whittled away at my morale. I wanted to be of help, but I felt taken advantage of at nearly every corner. I would take criticism onboard and try to do better, just to be criticised for doing the opposite. Given some distance, I would call it insidious.

Now I face the prospect of ending up in another customer-facing role, suffering from the same awful retail rules as before. How do you challenge these rules that seem designed to break your will?"

15,2024-02-21,Don't Ghost me to reject! TELL ME WHY!!!,u/Siletrea,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1awxzje/dont_ghost_me_to_reject_tell_me_why/,antiwork,"longtime lurker and first time poster here! I'm (27F) a professionally trained Autistic 3D generalist in modeling and animation!  


I graduated animation in 2017 and modeling in 2018 (never had a chance to get to an internship due to being physically held back by manipulative Narc parent)  


by the time I finally gave up on ever getting into the 3D industry, I had been sending approximately 10-15 resumes/custom cover letters/video reels/portfolios and CV's every single day for 3 and a half years. that's around 12,775 to 19,162 applications that were sent out nearly worldwide to try and nab a job in 3.5 years.  


unfortunately the ""Ghost Job"" practices to my knowledge started up around 2016 so by late 2022 they're the majority of the listings, now with AI the companies scalp through applications looking for keywords and art styles and delete everything else before it even makes it to a human inbox or desk!  


Ghosting is now a common and demoralizing/insulting thing that just happens in this day and age, it's to the point where I now live as a government parasite off of a disability cheque to survive with my skills rotting in-between hobbyist crafts and the occasional commission. I am now afraid to ever promote my work or try to inquire about a job because I feel my skills will never be worth any monetary value, my self esteem is ruined and now that I've been living like this for a little over a year I find my love for my craft very slowly returning and my willingness to try to reach out to a single indie company for an animation gig slowly overcoming my anxieties.  


my biggest fear though is being ghosted or the dreaded template of a rejection letter that I've witnessed so SO many times that I have the formatting memorized, that haunts my dreams and stains my feelings of worth and creativity, for this reason I reach out to my fellow redditors with an idea of mine in hopes I get feedback to see whether I should try 1 last time, or just slink away and try to enjoy living on less then 1,600$ per month for the rest of my life.  


the most demoralizing thing was the lack of communication! the ghosting and RJT (Rejection Letter Template) hurt me so much. So I was wondering, if companies can make us check little check-boxes for survey forms, why can't we do the same? why can't we in out application put in a ""if you feel I am not a fit for your company please fill out a 1 minute survey to tell me why, so that I may improve as an artist""  


questions I would put in would be:  
**whats the name of your company?**  


**can you summarize why your not hiring me?**  
*(please check all that apply)*

* we already found someone else for the position
* this is a Ghost Job application so we're not actually hiring at the moment
* your Resume has redundant information that makes you look unprofessional
* you did not provide any examples of your work in your application
* we have already filled our disability quota 
* your art style does not fit with our current projects
* that fact that you made this feedback survey in the first place
* we feel you are too green in your field and should further develop your skills before re-applying
* we are not hiring remote right now
* we as a company would get in trouble if we hired below minimum wage even if you ask to make less then a certain amount monthly  


**Can you specify where the problem areas are that are keeping me from being hire-able?**  
*(please check all that apply)*  


**Application:**

* wall of text, it's too wordy and nobody wants to read it.
* post it note, nowhere near enough information.
* braggart, we don't need your life story or to know you won a spelling bee in 3rd grade.
* frivolous, your resume is full of grammar and punctuation errors and we fear it will affect your quality of work
* too honest, you let us know your disability's and other issues right away and that honesty scares us
* unprofessional, the template/style you used for your resume is convoluted and/or childish/nearly illegible 
* boring, the template/style you used for your resume is nearly nonexistent and the lack of effort reflects poorly on you  


**Portfolio:**

* video editing skills need improvement in your reels
* a link to an art-station is not good enough to showcase your work
* the layout on your website for your portfolio is convoluted/unprofessional
* we do not accept social media sites as portfolios
* you did not include contact info in your reel
* your reel does not require that much information
* your reel is far too long
* I'm not a fan of your music choices in your reel

**Animation:**

* weak silhouette
* choppy and/or sloppy transitions between keyframes
* timing needs refining
* clipping issues for props/environment
* facials need refinement
* you need more practice swapping IK/FK smoothly
* you need to animate more realistic things for your reels

for other things please add them to the notes section at the bottom of the page

**Modeling:**

* Topology needs work
* Textures need further refinement
* your workflow takes too long 
* you need to work on your anatomy
* you only have 1 style 
* you cannot groom the models you make
* you only do creatures/monsters
* you refuse to model anything with detailed genit\*li\*
* your work looks like it bathes in the hot-springs of the uncanny valley
* you tend to put in unnecessarily tiny details that only a lore hunter would appreciate
* you need more anatomy practice

for other things please add them to the notes section at the bottom of the page  


**Notes Section**  
*(please tell me anything else that I need to know to improve myself for future applications)*

  


  


so yeah what do you guys think? what would you add to this/take from it and do you think it's a good idea? I personally would love feedback to improve myself rather then getting the invisible middle finger constantly!"

Why are these things mandatory to go to?,u/Shot_Parking4676,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1awyaca/companys_upcoming_work_trip_has_been_stressing_me/,antiwork,"So for a point of reference I currently hot hired onto a company which they are based in New York. I reside in California and all the new hires have to go on site for 2 week training program. I knew this prior to working but really was desperate for remote work I just took it thinking I could overlook it. I didn’t think it would come up that quick and here we are 4 weeks almost later. 

I think the whole idea is quite frankly ridiculous of forcing us to drop everything and travel for two weeks. There are 10 new hires and just for hotel and flight alone it’s $3,000 a piece x 10 people and all food expenses. They could easily be saving so much money by not implementing this. We all have a company credit card with a 5k limit on it. 

With everything being computer friendly it makes zero sense as to why I have to travel across country to go to a computer in office for two weeks. I was contemplating making something up but am worried the ramifications. 

I really hate flying in general and the whole idea has been giving me major anxiety. I don’t even have office attire because my last job was 100% remote.

53,2024-02-22,Internships should be PAID,u/Neverfail100,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1awzyqz/internships_should_be_paid/,antiwork,"
🚩1. One of my duties was supposed to be picking up lunches, but I stated I wouldn't do so in my car due to liability issues. I compromised by offering to pick them up from three specific fast food restaurants next to my downtown high-rise apartment if needed.

2. The duties I'm performing involve tasks for which I have received an associate's degree and certificates, primarily administrative duties. Today, I created books for their classes, which haven't been updated for a while according to their Chief Communications Officer (CCO). Additionally, I compiled a spreadsheet from their business card client binder with contact information, intended for future use such as sending invitations via email. I believe I should be compensated for these tasks since I have the skill set to perform them, and neither the CCO nor the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is capable or has the time to do so. If someone were to organize their house, would they expect it to be done for free?

🚩3. They were discussing asking for [1 MILLION Dollars] from an investor or several investors representing a city, in front of me. If they can secure that much funding, why can't they pay their interns?

4. They recently acquired a client who paid for outsourcing an intern to manage their social media, which was mentioned in my presence. They joked about needing someone almost like a hacker for the task. I believe they will struggle to find a computer science major or graphic designer willing to work for free. It's perplexing that the company can accept payment from clients for interns but cannot pay their own interns.

5. They receive $250-$500 from banks or businesses to host classes aimed at helping them obtain a business line of credit eventually. However, the interns teaching these classes do not receive compensation for the first 180 hours, even though the classes typically last about four hours.

6. My internship only requires 125 hours, but interns do not get paid until they have completed 180 hours, earning $50,000-$70,000 for teachers. Despite the payment, I am unwilling to drive all around the metroplex in my own car. I would do so in a company vehicle, not my own. I don’t want to be a teacher. Either an executive assistant or I’m not interested in working full-time for their company.


7. I feel demotivated to limit my expertise because, I'm not being compensated. There's no incentive or reward, and I'm only doing this internship to fulfill the requirements for my bachelor's degree.

8. In one of the classes I attend, I'm being prepared for obtaining a business line of credit of $75,000. While this opportunity is beneficial, it's essential to remember that a line of debt must be repaid; it's not money earned.

9. Despite my aspirations to open my own nonprofit tax clinic and mentor children in a counseling center, I also intend to leverage the executive assistant skills I've acquired through my associate's degree. However, I feel the need to support myself financially and pursue a job as the realization of my business goals may not happen immediately after graduation.

10. Tomorrow, I have a meeting with a potential mentor who runs a nonprofit center and mentors youth, but I intend to continue with my current internship for now."

Over saturated rules.,u/SuddenBlock8319,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ax0jhq/clock_in_and_clock_out_over_saturated_rules/,antiwork,"I work here at this warehouse where if you clock in a bit early…such as 9:44 then that’s an infraction. Clock in a bit late such as 10:01 then that’s an infraction.

Plus if you go past the hours you’re suppose to clock out then I was told you don’t get compensated for that time (even though at times I volunteer to stay over and I still got paid for it). 

Right now. We've been having a bunch of turnovers lately. One coworker no longer works here because she was sabotaged by a supervisor. plus she was close to getting hired on.

As for me. I’ve been here for 5 months. I was told after my 90 days that I would get hired on. Never happened. So I am grappling on until I find another job that pays well. Other people after me was getting hired on and she was one of ‘em’ until she quit because of what I explained earlier. Supervisor stopped her hiring process. And now he’s acting way more eerie because he is losing people.

One coworker switched shifts and works the weekend now. And a couple of people that I use to see…I don’t see. 

These bullshit rules that were implemented are now digging in deep with how we do our job. We follow protocol but they act as if we’re not doing enough. 

I was told it wasn’t like this in the past before I got here. Now it’s strictly robotic. The irony since they have robotic machines doing the work now. But we’re treated like we run on batteries. 

When I say certain jobs play with your time and life is getting ridiculous. That’s why I’m giving myself 7 to 8 months."

I don't want to age anymore as I already feel old but people don't take you seriously as a young person. People have a tendency to call me sweetheart or sweetie even though im well versed and very experienced for my age. Everywhere I go it's the same story. An older man in his 30s is married to his wife who hadn't been in a real relationship before them yet tries to find young girls at work to cheat on her with.

  their wife waited their whole life to be married before sex and the guys just cheats on them anyway. I understand this could go both ways but this is from a female perspective. Makes me want to stay single forever. I don't understand why some older men always go for young girls when I could never date someone more than like 3 years max of me. my personal opinion.

  of course if I deny going on a date or show polite disinterest I'm a bitch and they want me fired. I can't win. I just had to quit a job because my trainer showed me his wedding video and then I assume he had a crush on me because he kept talking to me and wouldn't leave me alone and you can tell if someone likes you by them blushing and vibes. It just disgusting and I just want to be treated like anyone else

I have a feminine voice I guess that makes me sound available when I'm not but I can't change how I look or sound. i just want to work somewhere fair and equal. working with all women is worse in my opinion because if you just have 1 immature girl on your team they start drama and ruin things for everyone no matter how emotionally mature you are. Atleast most guys in their 20s don't flirt if they're in a relationship and are actually nice to work with and no drama

And if a really attractive woman (not me) starts a job anywhere all the men talk about her like they're predators and try to see who can date or fuck her first. I've also seen older women talk about younger men and I found that gross too. All I know is, things should and could be better. Work shouldn't be a hunting ground. Work should be a professional place to communicate effectively with your coworkers to get the job done. Not lollygag or talk with coworkers so much you forget to do your job or treat it like it's tinder

When I take jobs that seem easily replaceable, occasionally I'll just do things like this to see if anyone is actually paying attention, so far the answer is a resounding no.  I've been in my position for four months now and never heard a word about it from HR or my boss.

Now I did realize I'd be spending more. But not more than my vehicle payment on insurance. 

I know you'll be like oh well it's a truck

ITS A HONDA RIDGELINE. It's literally a minivan with the trunk cut off, and a bed was put in. It's not a massive lifted brodozer that's broken down all the time.

It has one of the higher safety ratings, and reliability ratings out of most trucks in the category.

I'm 30
Zero accidents
Zero tickets or times being pulled over
Excellent credit, and a perfect credit history
I drive less than 7k miles a year on average
I don't live in a high crime or theft area. 
I live in the country. 

We've never used insurance for our house or her car either. 

It's bundled with my wife's car, and our house.
And her family has been with them for like 40 years. 

But because it's a truck I guess I have a massive payment now lmao. 

You know my payments have never actually gotten cheaper. It didn't matter what car I had, or may age. It just keeps going up nonstop.

January 1st I got a call from our landlord that he wants to see the townhouse we live in, and we had 2 months to move out. This was scary, sure but it was fine. Manageable. I had a job that paid well. So we decided to shop around and buy with FHA. 

Well, nothing in the area was worth buying except our current townhouse. We made an offer to buy it from our landlord... and then February 1st I was laid off.

My manager KNEW I was in the middle of buying a home. She KNEW. Anyone else on the team would have been fine, and I wasn't a slacker, in fact the opposite. I went above and beyond for my team, constantly training them too. 

I don't know what to do anymore. As of now we only have a few days before we were supposed to sign the house agreement, or be out of the house entirely. At this point the broker knows I don't have a job. I'm at my wits end with this crap. 

Does anyone have any advice on what to do here? I'll add clarification edits if necessary. "

At first I didn’t pay it much attention, since I knew I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but a couple days ago the manager referenced my private conversation with another employee about me looking for another job, that just so happened to be caught on one of the cameras, and it made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Another coworker also said that the owners tried talking to them through the camera as well, so now we know they actively monitor us all the time we’re there.

Is it just me or is it time to start looking for another job? I get that it is a private business and they can do what they want there, but it just seems extra for a business that pays less than minimum wage and doesn’t have direct deposit and pay stubs, as it is a pretty small local owned place."

Sorry for formatting, I’m on my mobile.

 I was working part time over the summer and two weeks ago accepted a full time promotion at the same company for a management position. I accepted the job because I need a full time position and I didn’t have any other options. 
I do like most of the people I work with and the field but the organization itself is run incredibly poorly. I am being paid extremely little and expected to work on one weekend day every week (schedule is Tuesday-Saturday), which means I miss out on a lot of weekend adventures with my friends, family and bf. There is very little for me to be doing so I find myself feeling bored and unfulfilled during the day.

 I accepted the job knowing I probably wouldn’t make it through the summer but just yesterday I got an offer to interview for a position with better hours, flexibility (wfh option) and salary. (Also not what I want to do forever but it’s better than my current position)
 I will have been at the company for a year in April but have only been full time for under two weeks. 
 This field I’m currently in is sort of related to my degree and experience but is not specifically what my degree is in or what I want to be doing as a career for the rest of my life. 

My question is: how soon is too soon to leave a job for a new one? How does that look to the new potential employer? Originally I was planning on staying at my current job for at least three months not only to get a small bonus after 90 days but also to make it look like I spent at least some time there. Ideally I’d like to find a job that has some flexibility, pays better than what I’m getting now and is something that I’m interested/exciting about doing. Should I stick it out for a few months here and apply elsewhere later? Or should I take the opportunity to interview elsewhere now?

I’m also happy to hear any advice on how to go about this; I’m very non-confrontational and struggle with doing anything that I feel might hurt/inconvenience others (I’m working on it and have improved) so the thought of having to talk to my superiors here about leaving so soon is definitely anxiety inducing and I feel sort of embarrassed by it. My HR admin is aware that I am unhappy with the salary.
Thanks for any advice!!"

We have occasionally some posts saying ""Everyone knows it's bad, but what can we do about it?"" I want to share the idea of RIC (Referendum initiated by the citizens) as a possible solution. The RIC was the main demand of the movement of Yellow vests in France. Of course the media made their best to talk about it as little as possible, and in as bad light as possible.
So what is the RIC?
A simple but genious idea which is to simply include in the constitution the possibility for every citizen to demand a referendum on any subject, and at the same time obliges the government to comply with the results of the referendum. How does it work?
Every person can propose a referendum on any subject on a specially designated official public internet site. The proposals which gather a certain number of votes/likes within a given period, get to be voted by the people in a national/state /city referendum, and the decision taken by the people gets implemented by the institutions. 
So for example if a proposal receives 500 000 positive votes/likes on this internet site within 6 months, it will be subjected to a national referendum. And every 6 months there will be a referendum on the proposals which have gathered the necessary number of votes/likes on the internet site.
Now you're thinking: this is too easy, everyone will vote to stop paying taxes, or to immediately cancel all debt, etc. 
Few people know it, but Switserland has been governed by referendums for many decades now and they have found ways to prevent this from happening. They have institutions which are charged with consulting experts and preparing lists of the positives and negatives from each possible decision, and communicating them to the public before each referendum. So for example next week i must/can vote on whether to make all public transport in my city free. I receive an email saying for exemple: if we chose to make public transport free the positives will be: - cleaner air; - less/no traffic jams; - many families can choose to own less cars/no car, etc. and the negatives will be: your taxes will increase by 10%; - ?? I can't think of any other negatives to free public transport;
So everyone can read this short analysis created by experts and decide on how to vote.
Why do i think RIC is such a genious idea? because it  is a peaceful way to transfer the power from the polititions to the people without violence, it suffice to find a political party willing to propose RIC to be legalised, and to vote massively for that party. Then we will have a means to change everything we don't like legally, without violence and without the need for protests, strikes, boykotes etc.
 In my opinion RIC is the reason why the French polititians were so scared of the yellow vests movement, and this is why the movement was so brutally and violently crushed by the government.

I informed her that it was our agreed upon day off and I would not be going in as I had prior commitments. She responded with ""I know, but you need to come in."" Now for the update:

I responded with:
As I explained, I won't be able to. I will see you on Thursday when I am scheduled to work.

I did not receive any additional messages. I did not show up yesterday  (my scheduled day off). I did come in today, and nothing at all has been said about me not being here yesterday. 

To those saying I had a right to sue if they fired me for this, unfortunately I work in a state that has laws prohibiting any legal action against this, as well as supporting management for changing schedules even the day of the change. 

For everyone who said I'd get fired. Not if they fired someone else first and left me and one other person in a 4 person department, which they did. 😅

The hospital where she has been a nurse for the last 24 years is saying they are going to buy out her pension for $93,000, and framing it as “an opportunity to control your own money.” But, by her math, they are ripping her off by nearly $200,000.

If she lived just 20 years post retirement, she would make nearly $312,000 off pension payments at the $1,300/month rate. But with $93,000, she is looking at monthly payments of newly $1,000 less per month. 

This seems like a non-negotiable thing from the hospital. Does she have any leverage in this situation to ask for a higher pay-out? And if not, how can she best work with the buyout of $93,000?"

Just wanted some unbiased opinions on my new job

To start with I’ve been at this job for about 5 months now. It’s my first time doing this type of job and it’s not something one can go to school for. I’ve been working since I can remember and this is truly the grindest job I’ve ever work. The pace is constant high pressure to provide a service for thousands of people daily. I am the youngest employee and I am also the only black female working in the entire region. The rest are white men with the exception of two Hispanics men. Admittedly; when I started I struggled horribly. I had to adjust to the 3am start times and dealing with the pressure associated. Even now I still make mistakes; however since I went solo I ranked #1 a total of 7 times (numbers determined on a weekly basis). In a company of 17. A few of my coworkers have been working this job longer than I’ve been alive. The rest are at least 38+ that have been working in this field for decades. Only one other female works on my position but she’s 5 inches taller and also has been working the job for 10+ years. 

The problem is how hard I feel my bosses are on me compared to my coworkers. And when I tried to address it; they gave me the “we see more potential in you to go further in the company, so we push you harder”. While I do see the benefit ; I am a young determined person looking for a career. But I can’t help but feel a gnawing annoyance when I’m criticized. They’ll pinpoint very small details/mistakes and say I’m embarrassing them. This could be because they’re talking highly of me to my upper bosses but that’s a hypothesis. 

When they criticize me I feel very disrespected because I feel I am still adapting to the job and I should have the grace of learning casually from my mistakes. It makes me feel uncomfortable and disheartened. It’s to the point that I’ve started to look around my job field; but in the same breath I don’t want leave for a baseless feeling that I have. 

Just to clarify I’ve never accused any my previous employers of discrimination nor do I like to throw around the word. I don’t like to view myself as a victim which is why this has me conflicted. However I have always been very insecure about my color. I don’t let it interfere with my day to day but it’s something that bothers me. I’m not sure if that insecurity is clouding my judgment. 

Feel free to ask any questions and thank you for reading!"

2,2024-02-22,Help me convince the Village Board to reduce my hours? ,u/emehav,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1axfv5r/help_me_convince_the_village_board_to_reduce_my/,antiwork,"I currently work 40hrs a week and I have health insurance paid by my village. 
i sit in the office for all 40 hours but for a total of 9 hours throughout the 5day week I’m required to be here, the office is is closed to the public. 
during my 40 hours, I’d say at least 15 are wasted on me really not doing much for my community. I would like to keep my position but I would also like to reduce my hours to further enhance the skills I could bring to the village. I have drafted a letter below, but it’s not full enough. It doesn’t convey what I hoped it’d convey. Is anyone willing to rewrite or edit my draft as a letter to the Board Members for this proposal? 
for clarification, the personal development I am looking to gain is learning Spanish, expand my website design skills, undergo municipal trainings, and even develop my home life more where we can support our community with fresh produce and meats (we are building a home farm) ultimately I want to be able to really utilize my skills and put my best foot forward, not watch time go by as I hope a task lands in my lap. My worries is if I cut down to 35 hrs a week, I will lose my health insurance, which I don’t want. The Affordable Care Act states full time starts at 30 hours a week, I’m requesting a reduction down to only 35 hours. Anyways here is the letter : 

Dear Board of Trustees,
 

I am writing to formally request a reduction in my work schedule from 40 hours to 35 hours a week, which under the Affordable Care Act, constitutes enough hours to be deemed full time to maintain my health insurance coverage. This adjustment in my work schedule will allow me to utilize the additional free time to further enhance the benefits I bring to the village as an employee.

 

I believe that by reallocating some of my work hours towards personal development and expanding my skills, I can contribute even more effectively to the growth and success of our community. This change will enable me to focus on professional development opportunities, training programs, and projects that will ultimately benefit the village and its residents such as municipal trainings, learning Spanish as a second language, and website design among other goals. I would be happy to elaborate on how my personal development goals could benefit the individuals in our community.

 

I assure you that despite the reduction in hours, I remain fully committed to fulfilling my responsibilities and delivering high-quality work. I am dedicated to continuing to serve the village with excellence and professionalism.

 

As someone who is passionate about personal development and contributing positively to our community, I believe that there is an opportunity for me to grow in areas that align more closely with Village interests and goals. I kindly request your consideration and support for this proposed adjustment to my work schedule. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to discussing this further with you.

 

Sincerely,

That's also when the sexual harassment by the kitchen manager began. For context I am a straight cis male and supposedly so is the KM. My question to this sub is has anyone dealt with something similar and was there an avenue available to you to report it? I'm one of many at this restaurant who have experienced this type of harassment. Hence why there were nearly 40 kitchen staff to start and then quit over the past years.

[Hello reader, wha-at’s happening?](https://preview.redd.it/zpymqkqvz6kc1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1a7a9c6c7a0e94610daf4259769fd725ad35a9b)

Commercial real estate has lost its value.

Since the pandemic, only 50% of employees have returned to the office.¹ The demand for office spaces has drastically dropped, and many corporations and banks now risk going bust. This is why they want us back in the office.

To save themselves.

# ------------------------------------------------

Imagine you’re a company.

You invest $100 million in an office building financed with a loan. Your business goes as planned, your employees do well, and life is great.

Suddenly, boom: pandemic lockdown. The working-from-home era begins. Several years later, only half of your employees have returned to the office.¹ Since you no longer need all your office space, you look to sell parts of it. You quickly realize other companies are doing the same and that the market price of your asset has drastically decreased.

So far, it’s okay — they’re only unrealized losses. But, if you were to sell today, you would go bankrupt. 

Meanwhile, your bank is sitting on something worthless: no one wants a loan where the debtor is at risk of default. And if a bank run starts, they would be forced to sell at a loss — causing them to go belly up, 2008-style.

So, what’s the plan?

Force people back to the office. Bring everyone back, restore solvency, and draw a sigh of relief. Meanwhile, tell tales of productivity and company culture. 

Say whatever it takes.

Just don’t tell anyone we’re trying to save our asses.

I had to choose between eating and paying my auto insurance, and because of the missed payment Geico dropped my ass as quickly as they could (apparently auto insurance has become effectively the hardest thing to obtain in CA??). 

Fairly certain that as an extra-help worker in CA, I'm basically unprotected by the state and have no right to file a claim.

4,2024-02-22,MY Manager takes things personally.,u/GreedyLab6927,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1axg5nd/my_manager_takes_things_personally/,antiwork,"So the company has had layoffs and stuff, they mandated hybrid work, which I only showed up at work once at a week, my workload has quadrupled and things are a mess as usual after a layoff and my pay hasn't changed a single cent even though I have great evaluations and have shouldered en entire groups workload individually . I'm leaving for masters in 6 months anyways so it's not worth changing jobs now and I'll be able to cover rent and bills with the salary for next few months. 

My manager acknowledges that I have really great performance and respect and stuff, but she is only a year older (26), she is bringing up this mandatory work from office three days a week thing all the time. Rarely people in department show up even. my I objected that after layoffs moral is really low and there is no much confusion, like I've been put on a different role but on the old payrole with no raises, is this going to change?

I'm angry and I want to call her out or address this professionally so she don't not play this game with me, it's my pet peeve.

However, on my days off, I had the expectation that if called and asked to come in and I responded ""sorry, I have plans"", that would be respected. I also expected that fellow workers would realize that not everyone existed to pitch in and take their shifts.

Admittedly, there were bosses who understood that no = no, would accept that response, and move on to the next person. Coincidentally, these were the same people who seemed to acknowledge there was life beyond the store we worked in and that most employees had plans beyond permanent employment in retail.

However, there were numerous bosses and coworkers who simply did not- or would not- acknowledge that no meant no, and was a complete sentence.

One memorable experience was when I worked at a grocery, with itchy, hot uniforms, customers who were on the brink of a meltdown, and bosses that seemed divorced from reality. It was nearing the end of another 8-hour shift, and I was ready to leave the second the clock struck 8 and I could scream into my steering wheel for a few minutes. Along came one of the worst people to work under, who we will call Mrs. S, who asked if I could stay late for a few hours.

I responded with ""No, I have plans"" instead of ""I refuse to take any unnecessary action that benefits you in any shape, form, or fashion, you insufferable condescending bitch"", which I felt was a herculean act of civility. She continued to press, saying I needed to 'step up'. I continued to refuse, citing times I had come in on days off or stayed late and had been treated horribly for doing so.

After five minutes of back-and-forth, she seemed to get the hint and wander off. Then she came back with one of the assistant managers, and tried her routine again. At this point I told the manager that I had refused her multiple times, and that the reason I would not stay late nor ever again come in on days off was because I had been verbally abused and overworked whenever I did come in, often by Mrs. S herself.

Both of them gave me blank stares, like ""Of course we treat you horribly when you do us a favor. That's how this works."" Mrs. S pushed the issue several more times until I started to raise my voice, getting the attention of some customers, and they finally backed off.

It's one of the many, many reasons I don't miss retail at all.

I'm in the UK. 

Yesterday I was told about a potential cleaning job, I was apprehensive about it because I've only worked jobs in retail before, and I'll be honest I'm not the best at cleaning my own home. Wasn't raised being taught to clean, something I feel ashamed of not knowing.

Last night he calls me up and says I can go for a quick informal chat with the woman who owns the company, it's a small business so I was sent to her house. It's not far from my house so I can easily make it, I checked their website and kept seeing the owners name refrenced alot. #bemoretracey was used on the website. Oof already.

I'm unsure still but I decide well if I'm able to, I'll go talk to her. I don't have much time in the morning so I feed my cat and think it won't be long, I'll eat when I get back. I was meeting her at 9.30. Told I'd need to cover my tattoos on my arms because of the potential working with elderly or vunerable people and they can find it intimidating. Bit bullshit I think, but if I'm in their space I don't want them to feel uncomfortable around me.

I get there, she seems nice. There's a dog. Bonus points. We talk briefly, she introduces me to another worker. I ask what training would be provided, I'm told just do what this worker tells you. Like okay. Shadowing. 

Then she says ""you'll be doing a end of tenancy clean today"" and I'm like huh. I should have said something then, I know. I'm really not good with confrontation, I know I should have said wait this isn't what was discussed with my work coach, what's the deal?
Follow the other two to the car. Had no idea I was expected to do anything. I stupidly go along with it. Hadn't discussed pay or anything else important. I follow the other two to the car, we drive 30 mins to the nearest city, collect keys from the landlord and go to the property.

The other workers phone is ringing constantly with another employee asking for information etc. She's trying to use her phone as a satnav and relaying directions to the woman driving. Apparently they only hire women which at first I was like that could be nice, or it could be a catty hellscape. 

We go, I clean. I feel like a lost wheel for some of it because I'm mostly scrubbing banisters, skirting and cupboards. Also cleaned out the fridge. 

All the cleaning supplies and everything are provided, but they don't have gloves. Neither of the other workers are wearing gloves either. NO GLOVES FOR A CLEANING COMPANY? My nails are fucked, my hands are not pleased they were crying out for hand cream.
 Saw the other worker in her tshirt, she has visible tattoos and I bring up that I was told to cover them. ""Oh yeah Tracey doesn't like tattoos"" the other worker adds ""yeah but she says yours are classy"" I think they mention something that they usually do cleans like this more often, but tbf I don't remember.

One of the workers gets called by Tracey about a complaint recieved by the nursery. She's being told she needs to change mop heads and water for each room to clean. She gets 1hour 30 mins for this clean, I think with another cleaner. She says ""I'm not breaking my back for an hour and a halfs pay"" 

We have a cig break at somepoint. Finish just after 3.30pm, I get home at 4pm.

See my work coach texted me around 10am, then 12pm and also tried to call. I reply to him when I get back saying quick informal chat my arse. I explain what happened and he calls me apologising profusely, had no idea she was going to spring this on me and never would have sent me if he'd known. He's aware of my autism, and knows this wouldn't be good for me. I'm supposed to go again tomorrow, I have no direct contact with any of them as it was arranged for 9.30. My work coach said ""if you want to go again you can, but I wouldn't advise it"" - I don't think I want too. 
The other worker was annoyed about having to spend time with Tracey before leaving for the nursery clean and I think that says it all. 

I feel really silly for going and not standing up for myself tbh. I went in my own clothes and I was pretty uncomfortable in them. They did mention they had someone else do one day and not turn up again. Wonder why.

It’s more messed up than I imagined.,u/flavius_lacivious,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1axge3x/kind_of_figured_out_what_boomer_bosses_issue/,antiwork,"This might be too far off-topic for this sub. If so, I am sure the mods will take it down.

I had lunch with a wealthy Boomer yesterday and he was speaking about a mutual acquaintance named Dustin who was one of the bigger employers in our community.

Dustin is the quintessential capitalist misogynist dickhead. Once he told me women shouldn’t be allowed to play golf. His abusive behavior with his staff was legendary. People literally had a toast hoping the next heart attack would take him out.

It was such a problem, he had to hire outside the small community from the metro area and then move workers in. He paid top dollar, gave generous bonuses, and his multiple businesses were thriving. But he would drag workers into his office and launch tirades about how the fuck they graduated college being that stupid. Like horrid verbal abuse every week, getting screamed at in front of coworkers, but nice as pie in public.

The people I knew who worked for him told me they were suicidal, had panic attacks on Sunday night, and all of them wanted out — except they couldn’t leave unless they moved back which was difficult, expensive and time consuming. 

I did not work for him, and I could not understand why he was so abusive toward me. It was because I was not wealthy.

Even Dustin’s kids talked shit about him. His wife hated him, thought he was mentally ill, but was trapped.

Anyway, my friend mentioned how successful and rich Dustin was and the great moves he made in business. 

I said, “Yeah, that’s terrific and all but he treats his workers like shit, is abusive to his family, and is generally a horrible human being. I don’t think we should celebrate folks like that.” 

I learned from my Boomer friend that his generation believes **wealth is a virtue.** 

Basically, being rich *excuses* any shitty behavior or underhanded things you did to get there. It AUTOMATICALLY makes you a good person. 

My friend said that it didn’t matter if Dustin was terrible to his kids. That his smarts at exploiting his workers or situations means he is a good person and should be admired for that alone. Money was the reward for hard work and good decisions. Virtually nothing was more important than money. Oh and he doesn’t believe parents should help their kids financially.

But the best part was that I was not in a position to criticize Dustin because he was insanely wealthy now and I am not, therefore, any observation or opinion I had was not valid. Because if I was smart and worked hard, I would be rich, too. 

Our criticism of these rich assholes are invalid because we are not their peers and *our opinions of them do not matter*. We are poor and losers and can’t possibly understand how great they are.

So until all the billionaires start criticizing hoarding wealth, it’s just sour grapes from lazy stupid people."

The job may be harder after training but so far the tasks aren't too much and the pay is pretty good, specially for a teenager it's a flex to not have a job that includes the names like ""McDonald's"" , specially for me who has is depressed and fatherless and antisocial so it's better just entering and starting doing tasks by hand, finish and leave rather then forcing my self to say ""How are you doing today 🤓"", might go to community college in the future to study for a more relaxing job though but it's still good for my age, i prefer to be studying and more relaxed and enjoy my life and take classes at 12pm so I'd sleep long right now but since I don't have parents support I can't do anything and just work for now  still pretty happy so far."

Manager - Also to give you a heads up - the blitz day we had in the office today is going to be recreated remotely with our team on Tuesday. So your one day in the office this month will be then with the rest of the team

Me: Thanks for the heads up, although last time you said this, I had booked my ticket, I booked my hotel - and now I lost my money, I don't have any more funds for a trip to the office this month and I didn't say anything because what done is done, but it was a bit frustrating

Manager - Which time was this?

Me - You told me last week that I should come to the office for this thursday, so l planned for it and on Monday, when XX and XY were in the huddle, you said we didn't have to anymore

Manager - Yes that was everyone when it was going to be the whole of corp, but as this was just for UKI it was then split out for next week as well

Me - I understand that, but that's still what I was told - I'm just saying I don't have anymore funds for it and my money was lost

Manager - We weren't made aware by (company) that it was UKI only until last week when the invite was amended. We would never have wanted you to lose money so why didn't you still go in the office with the rest of the Adobe team? I'm sat with Jo and Matt and we're struggling to understand your rationale here

I did not reply to his last message because it infuriated me - 0 accountability, 100% shifting blame. What would you reply?"

3,2024-02-22,Selling without commission ,u/Isaiahsancho,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1axh62w/selling_without_commission/,antiwork,"Hello fellow people of reddit. 

I have found myself In a bit of a predicament within my current position at my company.  I will try to make this shorter then I intended, so please bear with me.  

I have recently been shot down for a promotion to a TSM position at my company for a new hire. I have been with this company for over 3 years and I must admit that it has left a bitter taste in my mouth. Especially since I had to train the new guy and he has no knowledge on our industry and what we sell. 

About 6 months before, I was told I was a good fit for the role and started training with the TSM that was leaving. I trained with him and our other TSM for months. Within this time, my boss put me in a ""temporary"" position so when the TSM training me left, I could jump into that role right away. 

Before the TSM left, my boss broke the news to me that he was actually going to put out an opening on indeed and look for someone new to fill the role. When the TSM left, I temporary filled the role and was expected to sell to customers. I did literally everything that the TSM is expected to do and I did it well. 

Now that we have this new guy and he has taken over the position, my current responsibilities are to simply assist the TSMs with their customers. The thing that sucks is they rarely need any help and this leaves me stuck at my desk with my dick in my hand for most of the day. 

The thing that pushes me to make this post is the last conversation I had with my boss. 

Other than helping the TSMs, he wants me in front of customers selling.  He said to ""dress for the job you want, not the job you have"".  

He mentioned me starting a 3rd territory and gave me a thin packet of our zero accounts. If I do this, I will be selling for my company and not getting an incentive. I have already proven that I can successfully interact with customers and sell. 

I feel like I am being taken advantage of and this role that I am in is something that makes me disposable if they decide to not go with a third TSM and just give the accounts I successfully bring up to the other TSMs. 

Am I in the wrong for feeling like this? Should I just sell to further prove a point? Should I start looking for other jobs already? 

Thanks to whoever responds. "

The job that concerns this story takes place at a semi-popular tools store, of which I have nearly worked at for two years. Yesterday I was conversing with my boss (44M) about how I was excited to apply for a full time position at my other job (a well known coffee company). He likes to put me down a lot and dismiss me, often asking, “What are you doing with your life?” or “Good luck with that.” In a condescending tone. Even when I was in college and excited to start my education he would tell me my aspirations would never become reality. Anyway, he of course couldn’t be happy for my news and instead reminded me that the local chicken slaughter house is always hiring full time. I showed a face of disgust because I could never imagine myself working at such a place. This is when it gets sour. He asks me with a grin on his face, “You would never consider being a chicken choker?” For those of you that do not know, because I didn’t, ‘choking the chicken’ is a term for jerking off or if you will, beating meat. I’m often clueless and sometimes don’t pick up on jokes like these, like I said, I didn’t know what it meant. Instead, I’m humored by the thought of somebody choking a chicken and laughed. I respond, “Yea I guess I could go for choking a chicken!” I don’t know if he picked up on my cluelessness or perhaps thought I was amused by his dirty jab, but he ran with it. “How many hands would you use to choke a chicken?” At this time I started to feel that swirl in my stomach and realized where this was going. Still, thinking I might just be dirty minded and twisting it wrong I responded, “Um, both?” He smirks and goes, “Mnn yea. That’s the right way.” Followed by a laugh. Am I wrong for being so disgusted? I didn’t realize what he was insinuating until my mother explained it to me. He also has made comments about my weight a lot recently, I went from 110lbs to 146lbs in the span of a few months and he just loves to bring it up. As a bonus I’ll add that one time I slightly lifted my shirt to put my magnetic name tag on to which his eyes instantly fell upon my stomach. He made a comment here again about my weight. When I acted upset he simply responded, “It’s okay, guys like to have a little something to hold on to!” I won’t even go into detail about the subtle comments he’s made about my butt getting bigger. Anyway do you guys have advice? I’ve been dealing with these kinds of things for a while now and don’t know what to do. I feel if I complain I will somehow get fired.

TLDR; My boss asked me how many hands I would use to choke a chicken and I didn’t know what it meant.

I work at a non-profit. I’ve seen the skit TikToks of how horrible it can be but my GOD this is a stinky little corner of hell. We unionized a year ago, and now we’re fighting in court. They lawyered up HEAVILY, employing amazon-level busting techniques and have successfully destroyed most of my department’s mental health. All the while, holding the company’s financial losses over our heads in all-staff meetings. I can go on forever about the things they did to ensure that we were uncomfortable, tired, and on edge daily. 

These oppressive acts were masked by the sheepish and quirky millennials that run our organization. There are no confrontations, discussions, instructions, etc. Most days, these people that are single-handedly responsible for wrecking our life-work balance exchange silly smiles and ‘hey how are ya’s in the hallways with us. Like nothing happened. My personal manager likes to send passive aggressive text messages to us when she’s in a bad mood, and then weep on team zoom meetings about how overwhelmed she is/how amazing we are. Most of the time however, she is cooped up in her office. We run our team ourselves, she just makes the schedule. She has this weird energy to her that you feel like she may break into tears at any moment?

Recently, I asked to switch to a four day week because my mental health is declining. I’m diagnosed with BPD, depression, and anxiety. I am thankfully working on myself and have gotten to the point where I can hold down a job, but I’m not perfect. I’m losing it lately, and I expressed that in the email I sent to HR. She responded within the hour, which was surprising because every other attempt I’ve made to contact her in the last 2-3 months have been ignored. Looks like you only get a response if you sound like you’re about to be enrolled in a Girl, Interrupted Academy for Wayward Divas. She immediately declined my request, but allowed a meeting. During the meeting, she just said no again. Did not hear me out. At all. Then gave me a write up because I was leaving early that day after my manager approved my early departure!

This place is rotten from the top down, and I think I’m finally ready to quit. My only concern, is that I don’t think I can mentally handle jumping out of this shark mouth and landing in a new differently shaped shark mouth. Do healthy work environments exist, and are they accessible to me? Asking for a friend xoxo."

Well, it was meeting about finding failures and proofs to fire team member. I politely told manager probably they dont like each other and I cannot give good advice.

Another story: when we wanted go to restaurant he told me on private message that the best place is near his house and he will have short trip. I told him its better to make pool and decide where is best place. I had feeling he doesn't respect team member as people ...


If he had issues with team member then he should Ask upper management for help, not me !

When I had first one to one with manager I had gut feeling I will have issues with that person and IT was true. I thought im just anxious as always.

I applied for unemployment and thought it wouldn't last long because I had a job lined up already.

The trainer told me how they get yelled at quite frequently by customers and that's something I can't handle. 

I didn't think it was a big deal because I was still in the interview process for unemployment. They called me and I gave them my schpiel and they denied it. Flat out. I tried to appeal but haven't heard anything back for a week and a half. I had a couple of job interviews lines up last week that went very very well but got told an hour ago they decided to go with someone else and the other job just isn't responding to emails anymore.

My last job made me want to kill myself, they were racist, would talk shit about you to your face and call you names, they were actively breaking labor laws and I could go but since a doctor didn't advise me to quit, they denied it. 

What the fuck am I supposed to? It feels like I'm just going to lose everything I've worked for and I don't know what to do about it.

Sincerely, an employment law attorney",u/childhoodsurvivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1axke7m/yall_motherfuckers_need_to_learn_the_difference/,antiwork,"First, let's get a few things out of the way. 

Disclaimer: Yes, I am an attorney but NOTHING I do on reddit is legal advice. Also, **DO NOT CONTACT ME FOR LEGAL ADVICE.** For starters, I doubt I will be licensed in your jurisdiction. Secondly, **this is all the advice you will receive** - contact your state bar association for a referral. 

Now, the matter at hand. At-will employment means that employers may fire or employees may quit ""at will"" - meaning immediately, with no notice - FOR ANY OR NO REASON THAT IS LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE. (This is where the concept of ""two weeks notice"" comes in but that is just a courtesy and not required.)

Wrongful termination is when an employee is fired due to an illegal reason. 

**Pretext** is when an employer fires an employee due to a seemingly legal reason in order to cover up their illegal reason(s). 

Y'all, I'm tired of the legal misinformation perpetuating in this sub. It is damaging and harmful. I have seen comments saying that people - who were clearly fired for illegal reasons, like talking about your wages (protected concerted activity) - have no recourse because they live in an at-will state. ABSOLUTELY, THE FUCK, NOT. 

How damaging is this advice? If someone delayed pursuing legal action due to this advice they may be barred from recovery entirely. Why? Like plenty of other actions in civil law, there are statutes of limitation involved with employment law actions. (For example, if you were fired due to discrimination based on a protected class then you have to contact the EEOC within **180 days** to get a ""right to sue"" letter.) Once the statute of limitation has run, you cannot sue and are thus barred from recovery. 

This is also a good time to mention that every plaintiff's employment law attorney I know works on contingency and first consults are free. It costs you literally nothing to speak with an attorney but it may cost you plenty if you don't. Often times just making the phone call will give you your answer and you don't even need an appointment. 

There is plenty of other misinformation I would like to address but this post has gone on for long enough and I don't currently have the time. 

Sites you should have bookmarked for worker's rights:

1. www.worker.gov

2. www.dol.gov

3. www.dol.gov/whd (This is who you report wage theft to.)

4. www.dol.gov/wow (Check to see if you're owed backpay.)

5. www.nlrb.gov

6. www.eeoc.gov

7. www.osha.gov

I’ve been with the organization for two years and my manager has been here less than a year. Turnover is pretty high. And I’ve been doing work that is beyond the scope of my job description to cover the gaps. 

On top of this, I’ve been advocating for a reevaluation of my wages for 3 months, HR is slow to respond to my requests for meetings. 

We hired someone this week and I found out today that she’s making $6/hr more than I am. We have the same level of education and experience, aside from my addition of 2 years with the org. 

WTF do I do here? 

My manager has been supportive of me trying to get a raise and agrees I should be paid more, but she’s not a decision maker in this. And she’s overall supportive and not the problem. 

I’m not in a financial position to quit on the spot, but I am applying for other jobs. I’m at a loss of what to do in the meantime.

They gave me a pay cut. Because I'm not a manager so it's not right to pay me like one, and they rolled back those manager bonuses I get. With a 4% raise and the cut in my bonuses I'd have taken a 1-2% loss.

I lost my temper. I threatened to quit. I was so ANGRY. I called it bullshit. All my carefully prepared arguments disappeared in a red haze of fury.

An hour later I was told I got everything I asked for. A real raise and no change in my bonuses.

An HOUR. It was all a fucking test. A mind game. An attempt to see if I would roll over. There was no ""good faith"" to be found. They were trying to save money by seeing how weak I was. And I let them get to me. I let my emotions get the better of me.

I got everything I asked for and feel like I lost some self respect. And I'm fucking insulted.

But more and more, people are losing those homes, not paying rent/mortgages, and doing all they can just to survive, which is not nearly enough as when they had consistent food and shelter. 

So why are those in power not even giving us basic support systems to find work? Why is unemployment constantly on the rise? Why??"

Factors to consider:
Unemployment is low here, about 1,200 monthly, but covers my rent. It’ll leave my savings largely untouched. 
15k emergency fund, earning about 4%. Can access with 1 day notice. Regular saving acct 3k.

If your coworker is a dumbass, unproductive problem maker who creates more work for everyone, you can’t fire them. And if you were to try to socially force them out, well that’s just immature, right? No, the “proper” way is to go to another authority and tell on them, like a good girl or boy. Likewise if your manager is a bastard idiot who hampers your productivity and makes you and your coworkers miserable, you can’t fire them. You’re not the one who gets to pick who leads you. Again, if you want a solution, you’re expected to find some authority to figure it out. Or leave and cross your fingers you have better luck next time. 

And if you act up—maybe talk about your wages—you’re in danger of being tattled on. Can they *legally* do something? Ehhhh…if they can get away with it. 

And somebody else decides what time you are at work, regardless of if you’ve finished your tasks. And they decide where you sit. And they may even decide how long you get to poop. All of it decided by some authority— who maybe you have some say in choosing, if you have the luxury and leverage to change jobs. So if all that is decided by an authority above you, who you don’t get to choose or change by some democratic process, then it’s pretty hard to say your work situation isn’t authoritarian.  

And sure, it doesn’t *look* as authoritarian as getting tossed into a gulag for political dissent. And yeah we can definitely talk about the inherent authoritarianism of capitalism as a whole, but I just want to talk about your work place. Because it’s a bit more insidious, and maybe just as injurious to your personal agency as if it were a more familiar kind of authoritarianism. 

You see, you’re not really considered an adult. The adults are the owners and the executives. The management is kinda like a middle school baby sitter; some are cool, but there’re more than enough assholes among them. At any rate, they’re in the position to be assholes, and there’s not a whole lot you can do about it…it would seem to you, anyway. 

It makes you wonder, if some adult is treating you like a child, how do you respond to them? How would an adult respond to them? Because going to the teacher to whine doesn’t seem like the adult thing to do."

I end up not getting the job because the HR manager hired someone else before the interview-house recruiter put my resume in front of him. Ok that’s understandable. But then they have a new opening for Jr role. Pay still amazing. I apply and get a call that I am going straight to the hiring manager because they really like me and think I will be a great fit. I speak to the hiring manager and he loves me. Get a call back three days later basically telling me the job is mine and I got it. 

Keep in mind I am only waiting for the offer letter at this point because thats what the second interview was about the hiring manager wanting to know if I agree to the terms before making it official. 

I of course agree because the opportunity is amazing!! 
So I of course tell me current job and put in my notice. This Wednesday as I am going on vacation because I was allowed to still keep my PTO days since I put them in months ago. 

On my first day of vacation while I am in the airport about to board my plane I get an email stating they gave someone else the position. I wasn’t given an offer  letter because the last interview happened on a Friday or Thursday and of course Monday was a holiday. When I called I was told someone else had applied with a better resume and they were given the job.

My whole vacation has been ruined and I can not tell you the level of heartbreak I have experienced. That was the type of job that when you start your career you dream of. I thought I had finally reached my goal and would be able to buy a house and have children. 

I can not count how many times I have cried since 1) Thinking Ingot the job 2) since finding out it was not to be.

I almost wish I can sue for emotional damage or something, but WTF!!!!! How is that even possible!!!

THEY GAVE ME A FUCKING START DATE OF THE 15th!!!!

The rug was pulled right from under me and now I have to try and salvage my current job if its even there when I get back!!

FUCKING JOBS!!!!!"

Is it right for me to stop coming in? ,u/FatherOF_wolfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1axtl0q/cant_get_paid_from_work_but_its_not_the_work/,antiwork,"I’m with a hiring agency. I was asked to sign up with them so I could get some extra work with the hospitals I work between. Got a job offer a little while ago, said yes and was hugely rushed to get to work. It usually takes 2 weeks but this was within 4 days. 

Because of this rush a lot of stuff was missed including how I get compensated. I have to log my hours with the agency, the manager at the workplace approves it then I get paid. But there’s no option for me to log the hours, therefore no pay. Checked with the manager and they never got word about this. So between emailing everyone that was relevant all I can do is wait. 

Now it’s come to the next work week and I still can’t be paid. There’s no telling how much longer it’ll be but I don’t want to keep working for nothing. Even so it’s not the fault of the workplace, they’ve helped in every way they can and honestly they really need everyone they can get. Being a hospital and all. 

I drafted up an email for the manager explaining my situation and that I don’t feel comfortable coming in if I get nothing from it. As much as I want to help them I gotta look out for myself. Feel stuck on what I should do.

I've never had any proper training in management and this company is so shit that they just chuck people in and if it works great, if it doesn't sack em and chuck someone else in.

I have a lead by example policy and don't expect staff to do something I wouldn't and for the most part it's fine.

But as I was promoted internally with no training it's a fine line between yeah I'm your mate but I'm also your boss and then to top it off the new GMs laziness/lateness/standards is rubbing off on the staff so general standards are dropping.

I decided I'd go back to do further education, which would ultimately make me more valuable to the company (naturally, they didn't even think about corporate support of the endeavour...) but since they refuse to raise the wages adequately enough, they couldn't find a replacement for me. Since they have no replacement, they have decided to close the office I worked out of (which they have done before in a somewhat similar context), which meant all the work I did getting educational leave of absence forms in, letting the company know I would be doing further schooling 6 months in advance, etc. Was all for nothing, since I'd have to move offices to areas where, if I lost the job, I'd be fucked because there isn't adequate local competition so they'd basically get to own me. 

At least I'm doing something else for the time being, all the people working for me will be out of work as well now too and they don't have any where near the experience I do. 

Basically, this is a big get fucked. Not really a unique problem, but a bummer nonetheless. Presumably from the upper management perspective I have been selfish for getting more education. To save the contacts I do have, I'll probably tell them I'm not coming back, as much as I would love to say that I'm moving to one of the other offices until the last minute and drop off.

We all have seen a lot of gurus promoting the usual:
""Be your own boss.""
""Don't work for someone else's dream, work for your own.""
""Quit your job and escape the 9-5 rat race.""

Sounds cool, right? After all, who doesn't want to be his own boss and avoid being like a rat in the process :D
That is what this thread is about, it is intended as open advice to newbies who haven't made it yet, and as an open invitation to BHW veterans to share their experiences and stories on what they did until they were able to make a living online.

Firstly, to the newbies who are trying to make it online:

Having the wrong mindset/expectations:
No doubt the internet is packed with ways to make money. And yeah, we've got some badass success stories right here. But keep this in mind, those stories didn't happen overnight. It took them a lot of time, effort, consistency, and strategy to get it figured out.

I don't want to speak on behalf of BHW members, but if this thread kicks off and we get a few of them to share their experiences and explain some of the mistakes they made, you will see how having the wrong expectations about making money online can delay or even prevent you from achieving anything.

If you have one of these mindsets, you might be delaying your success online without knowing it:
I will never work for someone else.
I will make it online no matter what.
My time will come.
I just need to find a hidden/secret method

you are serious about it, you end up working hard, and trying many methods but you are hitting roadblocks mainly because you have no budget and therefore you can only work on stuff that requires no budget which is going to limit you a lot.

If you are lazy, you spend most of your time reading this and that without doing anything, it's like you are sedated and months after months are passing by.

Why you need a job:
Before you quit your job or embrace the ""I will never work for someone else"" mindset, consider the following:

Job = Safe Money: Your job gives you that paycheck* while you're trying to make it online. It's not safe nor wise to just rely on a new and unsure source of money.
paycheck*: even if small, remember you gotta start from where you can and then work on developing yourself, don't stick to one job, and always be on the lookout for something better

Cash For Your Business: Starting an online business ain't free. You gotta have some money to cover stuff like setting up a website, marketing, and maybe even inventory if you're selling something. Not to mention, there might be unexpected costs along the way. That steady paycheck from your job? It's your best friend in this phase.

Almost every way to make money online will require some tools to make what you are doing easier and save you hundreds of hours. Without that job, you will be wasting a lot of time.

Stress Alert: If you say goodbye to your job or if you don't have any source of income, you're gonna need your new business to start paying up fast. This is when things get tough. Imagine all that pressure to make ends meet with a business that's still finding its feet.

Stress levels hit the roof, and when you're stressed, you're more likely to screw up. You might rush decisions, overlook important details, or even make risky moves that could backfire. So, hold onto that job or steady income source until your online venture is solid enough to carry you.

Trust me, your future self will thank you.

Learning & Experimenting Time: Starting an online venture is like learning a new language. You gotta learn stuff like how to market, maybe even some tech stuff. Plus, you'll be testing out ideas, tweaking things, and finding out what works and what doesn’t. It's a game of trial and error.

All this figuring out takes time. During this phase, you might not make much money, if any. That's where your regular job comes in. Having that steady income means you can afford to take the time you need without stressing about how you're going to pay the bills.

But hold up, I'm not telling you to stick to your job like glue. The plan is to move from your job to your own thing online carefully and smartly.

7,2024-02-23,Being ‘Managed Out’,u/Low_Addition_7445,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1axxbly/being_managed_out/,antiwork,"I’m in an hourly, PT (29.5 hours per week, so they don’t have to give me benefits) position that’s in office twice a week. I work on a team where recently half the staff left—including our team leader. Our day to day manager (below the team leader), who has been with us all of two months was promoted to team leader.

I’m not the kind of person anymore who finds fulfillment in work or who goes above and beyond. I’ve been burned one too many times and prefer to spend time with family/friends and in my community. That being said, bills gotta be paid and me and my spouse can’t afford for me to not work at all. My current job had promised (albeit verbally) flexibility, and I took it hoping that was true. We have two young kids and that often comes with unexpected sick days, challenging drop offs, etc.

Our previous team leader was understanding and even though there was some inflexibility about “hours are hours” and I wasn’t ever allowed to make up the 15-20 mins I was late, she at least never hassled me about it. I don’t want people thinking I am late on the reg, but when you have two little kids and are in office only twice a week, any time it does happen is emphasized.

Had my one on one today with our new team leader and she brought up “timeliness” and asked what “we” could do to make sure I’m on time more? I expressed surprise and gratitude that the company would offer to help and asked what options were available to me since I didn’t even know the company would be willing to do that. How had the company, in the past, help folks with challenges like mine? (I know that this is a warning from her, BTW, not dumb, but she knows that I have kids and am not purposefully late.) Dumbfounded by my question, she mumbles something about reviewing my morning routine and when she stops I respond that there doesn’t seem to be any flexibility or understanding that the company is able to offer and the onus is on me to reflect and make changes—which I assure her I will do and thank her for bringing this up. Later, she emails me the EAP line, which is clearly a tactical move so she can say she offered something—even if it’s a worthless lifeline.

Now, to my question, this feels like the start of being “managed out.” Am I wrong to be concerned? She and I have not had the best relationship, but I do most everything she asks and defer to her and the rest of management on decisions (to the detriment of my projects) because that’s how they want to manage, and I’ve been told as much. If folks do think I’m being managed out, how do I combat that without being perceived in a negative light or is that even possible?

(As an aside, I am looking for a new job—so folks can refrain from that suggestion. I need to maintain this one though until that comes to fruition.)"

They started to ask for a little more paid time off, you gave them more work, more responsibilities and more grief when they took any time off instead. 

They asked for better insurance, you decreased coverage but raised prices instead. 

They asked for better retirement plans, you took away pensions instead.

They asked for better bonuses that may actually amount to something, you gave them pizza parties. 

Every time there was an employee feedback meeting and a caring employee risked it all to ask for better treatment or pay or something that would help the company, that employee would then get shitty treatment by their supervisor instead. 
You ALL had people that wanted to work, people that cared about their jobs and the company and their role in it. Each and every one of you had that. But your years of not hearing when employees would tell you things that were bringing general morale down and you laughing in their faces and continuing to do the same behaviors have caught up with you. 

Now you're faced with the ""employee shortage"" and cut this narrative of ""nobody wants to work anymore"". 
Once again, you had thousands of people that wanted to work and wanted to see you succeed. Thousands that got ignored and laid off so that you could take care of a shareholder who gets a dividend check instead of investing that money into the people who drive your company forward. Maybe all you companies should tell all your shareholders that ""we're a family here"" when they bitch about why they don't have a dividend check this quarter because profits dropped. Maybe give those shareholders a pizza party. Maybe tell them ""we're sorry you all don't get raises this year we had to cut back"" as your ceo gets an extra $6 million dollar bonus. If the shareholders don't like the fact that nobody wants to work ""for you"", you can tell those shareholders ""don't like it, find another company"". That's what we always heard. And thats what we all did. 


Sincerely,


One tired person who doesn't want to work anymore.

Someone reported this & they moved the wife under a different manager, but this doesn't address the actual coi: she's still in a position if unlimited access to my manager to cheerlead for her husband (who's recently been promoted) & who knows what she's about the rest of us?

It's like any other place. Everything that should be important isn't, & everything that shouldn't be important is...

You can have a banner year yet be surrounded by people who seem to get promoted for showing up. 

 It's not enough to do your job well, you have to be able to sing your own praises from the mountain top...managers don't care about the legions of people your efforts help, because they're not technical enough to understand your work. Nothing new...Harry Markopolos dug through dumpsters 9 years & handed Madoff on a platter to the SEC,  which is full of corporate lawyers who didn't even understand what he was showing them or care.

Not long after my co-worker's wife started this role, I noticed indicators that my manager's perceptions of my capabilities we're inexplicably waining.  I automate a lot of processes that saves time & $,  but in my recent review my mgr found a way to discount all of that.  I got an increase but not the one I deserved. Others are mad too.

 The best I can do now is file a grievance, whereupon I'll have the unenviable task of trying to convince my manager's peers & superiors that my manager can't consume data & arrive at a reasonable conclusion.  You can win the battle but this is scorched Earth so you have to have some places to migrate to...

 I'm wondering if there's an ethics hotline or whistleblower hotline to which I can anonymously report this severe conflict of interest & see what happens."

16,2024-02-23,Canceled shifts are driving me nuts.,u/matizuwinsatlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1axz7wu/canceled_shifts_are_driving_me_nuts/,antiwork,"I'm employed for a company as a personal assistant (assisting disabled people), meaning I drive to customers' homes to spend time with them and help with whatever. The job itself is chill, some customers just want company to play video games with, or they need their wheelchair pushed to the store, or they require help with an equally simple task. I do enjoy the work. The pay is not great, of course, but it's just enough to not die from the lack of money.

But what absolutely ruins the otherwise decent job is the abundance of shifts canceled last second, and the law that fucks over both the customer and worker in favor of the company. I'll give an example, similar to what happens weekly.

My customer has a panic attack an hour before my shift is supposed to start. They're in too bad of a shape to accept an assistant, and are forced to cancel the shift. And as their cancellation wasn't informed of 24 hours prior to the shift starting, **they have to pay the full price to the company.**

So what about me then, the assistant whose shift was canceled? I get informed that my shift was canceled, and I have two options. I can either sit at home and receive no pay, or I can accept a completely different shift offered to me by the employer. Rejecting this also means zero pay.

By accepting the make-up shift, I can expect to be sent to a different end of the city, on a random date sometimes a week away from the canceled shift with no guarantee that this shift won't be cancled too. I get absolutely zero compensation, despite the customer having paid the shift's full-price to the company, including what should have been my portion of the hours.

* Hired July 2022, told I could be hybrid up to 2 days/week although I preferred being in office
* Worked from home a couple times, and then Oct/Nov of 2022 I was informed they (our office manager) don't think I'm working at home and made a big deal about it. Partners confirmed they offered me hybrid and weren't back tracking and let me leave
* Firm asked me to mainly be in person during our transition (moved to a new office building) and I did
* Worked from home *maybe* 10-15 times in 2023
* Now we are fully settled in the new office, they let our non-local employees drop down to in person 1 day per week and have finally hired a person to help that starts in June. 

  

Good morning, Partner#1 & Partner #2,

I wanted to reach out to ask about being able to work from home more consistently going forward. When I was hired, I was initially offered a hybrid work schedule and to work from home 2 days per week. I haven’t been working from home very often, but I would like to start working a hybrid 2 days at home, 3 days in office schedule. I would like to start this after I move, the week of March 11th so I can make sure I have everything ready and set up. 

I think it would make the most sense to work from home on either Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Fridays, and I can always adjust based on vacations, events, and just general office needs. I would also be flexible with Coworker being on maternity leave and can make any adjustments as they arise. 

I think I would benefit from having some extra sunlight during the week since my desk does not get any natural light (not even indirectly), be able to balance my work and home life and needs more efficiently and catch up on chores in the time I would normally be getting ready and commuting. I think my productivity would be better because I would not have any distractions and interruptions at home so I can be completely focused on the task I am working on.

Please let me know your thoughts on this and I am happy to have a call to discuss! 

Thank you. "

It's a local business that's doing really well and my coworkers are great. 

My 1st pay wasn't until the 15th of February. This pay was for what I worked between Jan 15th-31st, (I'm hourly). I was expecting the 64hrs I worked on my pay stub, but it read 96. At first I thought maybe they added some of the days I worked in Feb, but it still didn't add up right. I thought I'd bring it up because its my first month here and I was worried they may have mixed my hours up with someone who did work the full pay period. 

Payroll, who is bosses wife, said yup! That's correct! And I'm like ?? And she said she put the 4 extra days on my pay, despite not working it because she wasn't, in her words, ""I'm not gonna lose sleep over the 4 extra days.. are you?? 😏"" And I said.. ""I mean I definitely won't, it helps out a lot, so thank you!""

I’ve been job hopping since about September because Pennsylvania is a horrible place for trying to find a decent paying job. Min wage here is I think 7.25 or 7.50 per hour. Also, I’m high risk for Covid. I’ve tried recruiting companies, temp agencies, and even just plain old telemarketing with an unethical construction company (I did not know they were unethical at the time, but as soon as I figured it all out, I walked out)
My newest venture is finding a Remote Job, and so far no luck, but I had an interview today and I need to ask some questions to my well trusted anti-Work community. 
1. Is it normal for recruiting companies to help you edit your resume, and if so, why do they want you to go back as far as high school jobs? why does that matter now? COVID changed my life I cannot do what I dreamt of anymore my body can’t handle it physically, so I’ve settled for call centers & reception work. 
2. Why are they asking to see my previous W-2s? If I’m not willing to do W-2s, it states I could do old paystub’s, but either way like I said I’ve been Job hopping😜😬
3. Is it even legal for them to ask for my W-2s? 
4. Why are they drug testing for a Remote Job ? I’m not bothered by it but I need to get my medical card updated and I can’t really afford it right now. 

I’m also trying to work from home for mental health reasons but I sadly live with family so I will be in my room but I’m okay with that I’m mostly in here now letting Indeed & Ziprecruiter steal my info. lol. 
To be clear this is a simple customer service job/CONTRACT job, for a company working from home so I just don’t understand why they would need to see that type of info especially if I said I’m unemployed which I did because I am….

Doing so damages my soul.

It feels as if there is something wretched inside of me that comes out and causes me to fall apart.

I fear the flow state.

I cannot bring myself to focus too hard. Too much detail lives in the periphery to ignore.

It strains the eyes.

Here is what peak performance looks like: I break, I disappoint. I become severe and uncompromising, as much with myself as with others. I am prone to anger, and I lash out.

I place on others the expectation of perfection that I hold for myself and enforce its will on those I love.

We are not made to be cruel. We are not made to do harm.

We are meant to heal, to love, to hold space for others and to be kind.

When I make myself a tool of capital, I embody its harm.

When I succumb to its violence, I become its tool and hold its power within myself.

I resist domination as an act of desperate love.

I resist so that I might someday look power in the eye and on behalf of all humanity tell it ‘No More’. That it might dissipate and — in its void — call forth something loving, pure and kind.

May we act justly.

May we move slowly.

May we trust each other.

May we love ourselves.

May we resist.

**I need inputs/ideas on how can subtly delay my resign for 1 more month i.e. 3 months on bench**. Once i resign i will be on a 3 months notice period.

Their argument is we don't have any opportunities for you and you have already spent 2 months on bench. Their goal is to save 1 month's salary by asking me to go early.

* HR and HR Generalist are sleazes and most of the unionized employees don't like them
* I was present at the termination of an employee this week. HR thought we were out of the meeting and the HR-G said ""IT is turning of his laptop right now"" but she could barely complete her sentence because she was belly laughing. 
   * Then the HR-D started laughing too. 
   * Then the employee being fired said ""yall know I'm still here right?""
   * Myself and the manager who was present as well stayed stone-faced
* In addition to this, HR tried implementing a remote work policy and setting a deadline for all employees to sign, meaning they disregarded the contract. now our union had to step in to threaten to file a labor practice violation
* This on top of several other things they're doing like passing up current employees for promotions, withholding resumes of applicants who were referred by someone internal, messing up people's FMLA pay and hours, etc.

**MY QUESTION:**

Should I reach out to the Executive Director by phone and let her know at least about the laughing part and the policy? 80% chance she has no clue about the policy and 100% chance doesn't know about the laughing. About 5 months ago she cancelled a meeting with the union where we were to discuss some of the things happening then. What are your thoughts?"

7,2024-02-23,TIL my coworker makes more than me,u/spyty27,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ay6k16/til_my_coworker_makes_more_than_me/,antiwork,"So today I learned that my coworker makes more than me and we perform the same job. For some background, I am 22 (23 in two weeks) and I work at a small business. This small business is a holistic pet supply store, which I have been at for about a year and a half. I have been in this industry since I was 16. I have almost 7 years of experience in customer service and 7 years worth of knowledge on holistic pet supplies. My coworker is 27, a vet student, and has no prior experience in this industry. She has been here for just over a year, having started at this store about 4 months after I started. We have the same responsibilities and job description, and receive raises at the same time as each other. For the longest time, I thought we both made the same amount of money hourly. We just received a raise at the beginning of the year, which should have put us both at $21/hour. I don’t regularly check my paystub, but I did today and saw that my hourly rate was only $20. I thought that maybe my boss forgot to put in my raise and so I checked my paystub from December and saw I was only making $19/hour in December, meaning that I have been making $1 less than my coworker for months now and I don’t know why.

For some more context, I’m not saying that she deserves to make less. What I’m saying is that I don’t know why I don’t deserve to make the same as her. I came into this store ready to go, pre-trained on all the products we sell and only needing to figure out the register and things specific to this exact store. She came in after me with very minimal product knowledge and had to learn the same things I did, but somehow makes more than me. Furthermore, my boss has to regularly reprimand her on her customer service performance. Just 2 days ago, our boss took each employee into the office for a one-on-one performance evaluation and told me point blank “You are doing fine, I don’t have anything to say. I just needed to bring you in here so no one felt singled out.” 

What do I do? Am I overreacting? I’m angry and sick to my stomach because I feel cheated and taken advantage of."

1,2024-02-23,Trauma Informed Insensitivity - Nasty Boss Lady,u/GreenWitch520,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ay7vf4/trauma_informed_insensitivity_nasty_boss_lady/,antiwork,"Please dont be too mean or critical about my letter. Ive been through enough as it is. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Im sorry its kinda lengthy. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  

In regards to the recent incident, the initial issue was not about ABC’s experience being exposed; I trust that none of us would share such personal news without proper consent. The situation is unfortunate, and I believe we all share empathy for her family during this time.

The primary concern comes after receiving an email of that nature. It’s unsettling, particularly considering the choice of words used, especially those related to loss.

The message could have been more tactfully conveyed. A simple *“a member of our team and her family have recently experienced a loss and are currently grieving”* would have sufficed. Then an offer for us to extend our condolences by signing a card placed in the conference room. This approach would have maintained sensitivity.

I was thinking of texting XYZ about the sensitivity of the matter but decided maybe I should keep quiet because if I were the only one feeling this way I would just take it up on my own or with my Therapist. At that very same moment, I overheard the two co-workers express the same sentiments. They don't want to see the card and that this would be hard for them. 

I decided to reach out to XYZ about it because she mentioned that the card would be circulating, emphasizing the keyword ""circulating."" This has consistently been the norm here. Every birthday, anniversary, or wedding card has been passed around the office. I texted XYZ expressing my concern that the card could be triggering for some individuals including myself. Shortly after, XYZ called me into her office. Once I sat down, it was evident that she was upset –it was evident in her tone, her glare and body language. Her communication was sharp, rude and short.

There was no attempt to discuss the message in the text. She didn't ask for elaboration on my feelings or details. The moment I sat down, she began talking, and I was never given an opportunity to express my perspective. Her attitude was evident, making it challenging to engage in a constructive conversation. I have no intention of engaging in a conflict with my boss or anyone here. I don’t want to jeopardize my job. I recognized that responding would not lead to a productive outcome, just more bad behavior. After hearing what she had to say, I simply acknowledged with an ""okay,"" got up, and left her office.

Moments later, when I reached my car, I sent her a text apologizing, stating that I'm sorry if I upset her. Unfortunately, she has not responded to the message as of now, leaving a sense of unresolved tension.  

I believe it may have been more productive to have this conversation at a later time, allowing XYZ the opportunity to cool off. The way she addressed me, with her harsh tone, glares, and body language, was unwarranted, inappropriate and unnecessary. I feel uneasy and would rather not engage her until this is blown over. 

I did come across the email where she apologized to the entire staff, and it clarifies that she had permission to share the details of ABC's situation. Im under the impression that she may believe that the concern is being centered on ABC's privacy. It’s not. 

The lack of emotional intelligence and sensitivity in this case says that leadership is not a “safe space.” It raises questions about the level of comfort safety here for all. One might be hesitant to express concerns or opinions freely. The reactive behavior, instead of a more responsive approach, creates uncertainty about how one might react or speak when thoughts, concerns and requests are shared. That challenges the trust and openness that should exist between a leader and their team. 

At this time I'm uncertain if my perspective has landed. The lack of sensitivity to the diverse experiences some may have lived indicates that our workplace is not trauma-informed. Without a trauma-informed approach, it becomes challenging to meet the needs of employees and create an environment where they feel comfortable and safe. If these needs are not met, 123 cannot genuinely be considered diverse, equitable, or inclusive. Excluding those who have been affected by traumas means that not everyone is being included. Clarifying and addressing these concerns is important for fostering a more understanding and supportive workplace experience for all.

For me, this issue isn’t a personal one; I genuinely like everyone here and would like to move forward as a part of the 123 family. This is a learning and coaching opportunity for all in regards to diversity, equity and inclusivity. XYZ didn’t not demonstrate sensitivity and compassion for what I was trying to convey. Some individuals in our workplace have experienced the pain of loss. A more considerate and sensitive tone from XYZ would have been appreciated.

Furthermore, I'd like to draw attention to the inconsistency in the standards of communication and behavior. In our work environment, we provide both external customer service to callers and internal customer service to each other. If I had treated a customer on the phone in the same manner as my interaction with XYZ, disciplinary action would likely have been taken swiftly. This discrepancy raises concerns about fair and equitable treatment 123, which is important for maintaining a healthy work environment.

If I had treated a customer on the phone in the same manner while addressing their request, there would likely be swift disciplinary action. However, it seems acceptable in this case because she holds a managerial position. If I had communicated with XYZ in the manner she spoke to me, employing the same body language, it would not have been deemed acceptable, and disciplinary measures would probably have been taken. I am convinced that if I were in upper management or an equal colleague of XYZ's, she would not have addressed me or handled the situation in the same manner. This inconsistency raises concerns about fair and equitable treatment within the workplace.

I hope we can address these concerns collaboratively and work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive workplace for everyone. Thank you for your understanding."

I’ve been applying to jobs for months trying to get out and if I could leave the U.S. altogether I would. But these problems are prevalent in a lot of countries thanks to capitalism.

1,2024-02-23,I just got fired for saying something about my boss. Was it justified?,u/Internal-Mortgage635,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ay7zx2/i_just_got_fired_for_saying_something_about_my/,antiwork,"I was working for a company for a little under a year. They paid more than my last, and the job title and skills I thought would be solid to do for a year for ye ol' resume. It was a Electronics recycling biz, I was a ""Computer Audit Technician"". They make money mostly on big corpos closing office. We take all their tech, servers, data, laptops, hard drives, phones, you name it. Everything. We wipe the data. The electronics are then sold in wholesale to whomever or scrapped and recycled to other facilities for cash. It was an easy gig actually. Just an awful inept terrible owner that ran the entire place. 

So here's my termination. We moved to a new warehouse and are setting it up. Boss has terrible ideas but we all follow. Come in one morning and Team lead says we can no longer have personal affects or tools or anything really on work stations. ""Boss"" wants everything clean and uniform. ""We can provide carts to put your things. On. Also ""Boss"" wants the entire audit room done by today. I made a comment saying, ""yeah well, I want 'boss's 'name' to eat my asshole, but that's not happening. I wasn't hired to set up facilities and have zero background in that. I'm an auditor"". 

So the work day goes on. We're all plugging things in, screwing desks together, making sure everything works. Around afternoon I get asked to sit for a convo with HR. They ask about it. Team lead that heard it repeats what I said. I say that's like calling the kettle black because I don't really respect people on leadership positions cussing and being ""vulgar"". We go back and forth and they tell me I'm terminated for what I said. I basically say whatever and ask if I need to sign anything or can I grab my stuff? They allow it, request that I don't speak or make contact with other employees doing so.  Wham bam, I clock out and leave. 

It sits wrong with me. I've never had a warning or write up working there. To be fired for that? Also not sure if team lead went to boss directly, or if boss man heard it over cameras. We just moved into New facility, boss installed cameras with audio hook-ups. We weren't told this or consented. Just is what it is going in. That's fishy. The whole place is a disaster. Last audit we had they threw out 30k worth of equipment and jobs we had spent 2 months working on. So there was nothing illegal to trace.

Other things this guy has done that I don't like.

Late summer last year while Temps were 97 degrees in warehouse with humidity, he got rid of swamp coolers because he didn't want to pay for them any more. So we had like 3 months left before it cooled down.

Then, one of our Required PPE we need is rubber gloves while we work. Homeboy decided he doesn't want to pay for those any more. It's on us if we want to safeguard ourselves against toxins and dust.

There are tons of safety OSHA violations. But the biggest one is he'll send dumb early 20 year Olds on a box truck with a shredder in the back connected to a generator. The shredder is missing a shroud that safely connects to a Gaylord and gets all debris into the box. Instead they ducktaped some haphazard cardboard together as a chute to a Gaylord. So these young dudes going into this truck in 100+ degree weather with nothing but warehouse fans and this shredder. They stand there shredding hard drives while micro plastic and mercury and God knows what else in those things Flys around inside this hot tornado wind tunnel for these kids who just work warehouse positions breathe in. No PPE. No effort. 

Anyway, I digress, owner is just an idiot that has zero regard for employee well being and health and is straight greedy and fragile.

I live in Arizona, a right to work state. Obviously a case is lost there. But do I have a wrongful termination case??"

This is from my February paycheck. In no way do I have a bad life ofcourse. But this is what it costs to get: 'free' healthcare, social security, a pension, good infrastructure, cheap schools,    
maternity leave, paid sick leave, about 30-35 days off per year and bad government.

From the money I get I still have to pay:

* About 300 a month for healthcare. Even if i don't use any
* About 200 a month for city taxes
* About 100-150 a month per car I own
* 21% on every purchase I make.

It doesn't come cheap and gets more expensive the more you earn.

56,2024-02-23,"""Your work alone merits a raise, but there's a few reasons you're not getting one.  Firstly, you need a haircut.""",u/atmack-wil,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ay8sko/your_work_alone_merits_a_raise_but_theres_a_few/,antiwork,"Ok quick catch up.  I work for a small (9 employees) construction company.  The owner/boss has by and large been very good to me, like letting me use the company truck for 6 months as a personal vehicle when my car blew up and I couldn't afford another one.  There have also been some downsides, like when I had to go in and fight to get holiday pay since the new policy only gave holiday pay to salaried employees and not hourly, despite me having a cell phone to be on call with all day every day.  

The last time we spoke about me getting a raise was a year ago, when I was pulled into the office and told that I couldn't get one as we were extremely slow for the next month and a half but once we picked back up I'd be getting it.  That was around 2/15/23.  I was called into his office this morning and told it was my review.  Bear in mind I've been waiting for this for a year, I just hadn't brought it up since I didn't think we were doing very well.  

He starts off by saying that my work is great and that I've shown definite improvement even though there wasn't anything wrong before.  He also thanked me for being willing to go above and beyond my job description (he does believe that since it says ""other duties as needed"" I have to do whatever he asks)   And I have.  Coming in Saturdays, spending 10 hours installing insulation (I'm an estimator and office worker, not a field guy) making trash runs, being the entirety of the IT department, everything.  He said that based on my work alone I absolutely deserve a raise.  He then said that he wasn't giving me one because of five reasons.

First up, he thinks my hair is too long and it's unprofessional.  For the record, I am a guy with medium length hair that in the front only comes down to my eyes.

Second up on the list of things to work on: I wore too much cologne one day and it's a problem.  Don't know how I can work on my personal choice of scent on a day in the past is something I can work on, but sure I guess I'll give it a go.  

Thirdly, I take too many bathroom breaks in a day.  He had our HR person keep track and I took 3 entire 10 minute bathroom breaks one day last week.  I have IBS.  The company is aware of this.  If I need to use the bathroom, I'm going to use the bathroom.

Fourth, he wants me to continue coming in on time.  Not make an effort to be on time, but continue coming in on time, as I've done for the last six months since coming out of a depressive episode.

Lastly, I take too many smoke breaks.  I could see this being a legitimate complaint about an employee, if not for two things.  We had a meeting two months ago about my smoke breaks where I was told to take 2 before lunch and 2 after lunch.  I started doing so and haven't stopped since that meeting.  I'm also almost always on the phone with a customer or writing a text or email to a customer when I smoke, and have my office phone forwarded to my cell so if anyone calls me I can still answer.  

So, yeah.  Honestly just needed to rant and this seemed like the place to do so.  I don't think there's anything for a labor board since I'm not mandated to have a pay raise or anything, and I don't know if I want to actually leave here since there are benefits and some extra freedom in not working corporate, but tbh if I knew I'd still have a roof over my head a month from now I'd have said this isn't worth 22/hr and 10 total days of PTO per year.  Any advice for either resolving the situation or if I should just cut my losses would be appreciated.

TL;DR - My boss told me I deserve a raise based on my work alone, but wouldn't give it to me because he thinks I need a haircut and wore too much cologne that one time.

Do not start explaining what happened or why you need the time off.

Do not ask permission. You aren't asking for it off, you are notifying them of your taking the time off.

Do not respond to messages you get in return that badger you about it or try to make you feel shitty for it. No amount of reasoning, pleading, or begging will change your supervisors/managers mind. 

So with all that in mind, here are a few samples of good messages to send when calling out...

""I won't be into work due to a family emergency. I expect to be back Friday, but will communicate further if that changes.""

""I am unable to make it into work today.""

""An emergency has come up and I will not be able to make it to work until XXXX.""

16,2024-02-23,My elderly mom is having her pt job threatened while she is in the hospital fighting MRSA in her foot.,u/BellowsPDX,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ay997h/my_elderly_mom_is_having_her_pt_job_threatened/,antiwork,"Yeah my Mom is working at an older age partly for the money but mainly that she just enjoys having the job to go to so she can interact people. She works as one of the Costco Sample People and the manager she has constantly harassed and bullies the mainly elderly workforce. My Mom has told me stories of other people just walking off the job, which she should have probably done, but she likes her coworkers and she likes talking to the customers. She's also afraid of how difficult it would be to get another job at her age while being handicap.  

My Dad had a heart attack back in November so she took some FMLA days to help with his recovery and just went back to work a month or two ago.  

Everything was fine then around Monday she went into the hospital with intense foot pains which turned out to be MRSA which is a pretty nasty Staph Infection. She's diabetic so naturally this is a big thing to be concerned about since it often leads to a blood infection and possible foot amputation.  

She had one surgery earlier this week where they cut into her foot then left it open and packed with gauze. Then today, just a couple hours ago, they did another surgery to see if the infection is still persisting. I don't have an update yet since I'm still at my job.  

She called her boss a couple days ago and was threatened to be fired due to attendance. My Mom told her she's literally on the hospital but the manager cut her off and said she doesn't want to hear it. I'm guessing she just doesn't believe her but it's really bad and made my Mom feel shitty.  

This whole thing is frustrating because a lot of these sample people are elderly and it makes me wonder how many of them are abused by their management. It's bad enough to be at a job when you are old but then to be treated like shit at that age?  

I don't know if this is even the right place to post this but I wanted to get it out somewhere.

Then, he spoke with my mom and asked her to join him. He hired her and she put in her two weeks notice at her old job.
She was hired as accounts receivable for the new company. They had her working outside of her job description, doing HR things like conducting interviews. They also had her purchasing things for the company with her own money. They reimbursed her, but she should've never been asked to do that. She basically helped set up this company. She hired people, organized things, purchased things, had access to monitor their cameras and more that I can't remember. She didn't tell me any of this happened until she was laid off so I had no idea she was doing more than she should've been doing. Her friend that hired her laid her off maybe two months into this job. She told me he did not give her a reason. I know she was a great employee. A year later she finally told me that they laid her off because she's having issues with her memory, but that she's all good now (she's not).

She's having trouble concentrating and remembering things. Since losing her job she has no insurance to see a doctor so she's just been getting worse. Her resume looks great, she gets interviews, but never gets a call back. It's incredibly frustrating and I'm full of anger for her. She tried to go back to her old job (they left on great terms) but they sold to new owners and aren't hiring. Last year she did Uber and only made $12k because of car troubles. This year, she was able to get a part time job with a tax company that shall not be named but can probably be guessed. No benefits. They had her train herself using a book and nothing more. After she got her paycheck she discovered that she only gets $8 something an hour while in training. The real pay she's been getting (can't recall exact amount) after training isn't much better. This job is seasonal so she'll be jobless again soon. 

Currently working on getting her to a doctor but that's not the point of this post. I'm just so full of anger at how badly she's been treated by these companies. I understand you want an employee who is coherent. What I don't understand is why she was used to set up a company and instead of talking to her and telling them they're concerned and that she should take some sort of LOA to get checked, they straight up just laid her off. Used her, then sent her out the door. Every time she talks to me about money I just get so so angry at how she's been treated. Fuck these companies"

Bob Moore, of Bob's Red Mill, died on Feb 10 at the age of 94. Maybe you've seen his grain products on the shelves of your supermarket.

It's not widely known that Bob created an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) that transferred stock to his company's employees. Today, Bob's Red Mill is 100% employee-owned.

bobsredmill.com/employee-owned

To be clear, Bob did not ""give"" the company to his employees. They bought him out, over a 10-year period (2010-2020). But the buyout was Bob's idea and Bob would have made much, much more had he sold out to one of the big corporations that were constantly making overtures to him.

Employees behave differently when they own the company and have a direct stake in its future. I do not know what Bob's Red Mill management structure is or whether all the employees have a say in the control, or if control is with a few. But, all Bob's employees receive company stock each year and they all have a vested interest in the profitability of the company,

Bob's Red Mill has about 700 employees. Only around 8,000 companies in the US operate on the ESOP model. According to Inc Fact, the company earns annual revenues between $100 and $500 million."

Essentially, give us your morning, afternoon, *and* evening. It's 9hrs but you'll get 1 hour to yourself. We need you 5 days a week all the time, or until you don't need us or we don't need you but guess which will likely happen first? The capitalist standard is 5 days a week, 8 or 9 hours jobs so pick your poison. It'll be hard to find flexible schedules, and even harder to find respectable pay. 

Y'know what's a more appealing and reasonable standard? A 9am - 2pm shift, or any 5-6 hour shift. $25/hr+. 3-4 days a week. 

Our government (and others across the globe) can afford and manage distributions of wealth, resources, and labor to achieve a more ethical and progressive standard and operation of labor and laboring others. The current standard (working multiple jobs, long shifts, slave wages) isn't flawed under capitalism because corporations need to eat up our days to regulate their system. 

Keep in mind in the 1930s we had to fight and sacrifice to achieve the 5 day work week we have now, and we continued to fight until enough bills and restrictions were passed to stomp out our labor liberation (union busting, lobbying to keep wages low, taxes etc). We didn't choose this, capitalism is forced onto us through violence. There's no way we'd advance this far in technology and the richest country of the world has people in an economic crisis by accident or simple failing. It's intentional. It's necessary for the profit motive. 

The standard shift should and more importantly *can* really be no more than 6.5 hours. All the studies show that it's better for our health and productivity. Of course there should/will be jobs with longer shifts but *most* jobs can be arranged this way. People who enjoy working longer shifts/more days can still have these opportunities, so I don't want to see the workaholics fretting in the comments or the bootlickers who are proud to work 15hr+ days. 

It's just so depressing. 11am - 8pm. 9am - 6pm. All day. Every day. Increasing the retirement age. Removing remote jobs to flex their power further and restricting our freedom of choice, knowing damn well we highly prefer it and data shows it's better overall for our health and their benefit. "

19,2024-02-23,Ever treated so bad you changed your entire career? Here's yet another horror-story of a public school teacher/band director.,u/GoldRoger3D2Y,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ayd0ro/ever_treated_so_bad_you_changed_your_entire/,antiwork,"This happened in the Fall of 2021, but I've sat on it long enough that I want to share with others. Those in public education might particularly identify with these struggles.

TL:DR; First-year teacher when the covid pandemic began, then things gradually became so bad that I was a full-time teacher for multiple campuses and treated like my time and compensation didn't even matter. I'm doing better now.

I went to college as a music education major with the sole career goal of being a public school band director and eventually graduated at the top of my class. I began teaching high school band in the fall of 2019, and anyone who's worked in education knows how hard it is to be a young teacher. I had my struggles, but I was patient with myself and formed great relationships with my students and their parents. I wasn't perfect. I was massively exhausted (marching band is a b\*\*\*\*), but I was growing and succeeding. 

Then, the world stopped in the spring of 2020. I'll keep this part short, but I'll just say...covid sucked for teachers...but even this wasn't enough to deter me.

We had students fully back/some hybrid/some online by fall 2020 (yay Texas?) and we were hit with a slew of extra responsibilities that we were completely unequipped for. Hours were even longer, stress was higher, but I was still patient and understanding. I kept telling myself *""I'm young and this is an unprecedented situation. It won't always be this bad.*"" It was during this 2nd year of teaching that I knew band directing wouldn't be my entire career, but I could make do for a few more years before considering becoming a school administrator.

\*\*\*Super quick background on teaching high school band in Texas! It's very common to have close relationships with the feeder middle schools. Almost daily would I drive to our two affilitate middle schools and help out however I could. Our school district, however, took this to mean that we were 100% responsible for these programs. This is obviously ridiculous, as it would mean managing almost 1,000 students across three campuses, but poor school districts cut all the corners they can.\*\*\*

S\*\*\* really hit the fan with one of our feeder middle schools in fall 2021. This campus was a very difficult, very poorly managed title I school with a *less-than-stellar* teaching staff. They'd had two band directors for years, but as one of these directors was retiring the district took it as an opportunity to downsize the staff to one. Problem was...**the remaining director was going on maternity leave August through November**. She had communicated this for months, so we knew the shenanigan that the district was about to pull...

We HS directors were told to handle it. This meant picking up 8 additional classes per day on a completely different campus while also teaching our own courseload at the HS, including an entire f\*\*\*\*\*\* marching band, concert bands, jazz band, theory class, and much more. The school put in zero effort to finding a short-term replacement. If we weren't on that MS campus, the students were literally left with no adult supervision.

From August through early November, I worked from about 6:00AM to 7:00PM every day teaching about 10 different classes of completely different material with no lunch break. This was on top of Friday football games and all-day Saturday marching contests (remember this!). I even had to use my own gas money to drive between the campuses. While it is normal for teachers to teach 6-7 periods a day, it's almost always the same 1-2 courses. This allows you to align your lesson plans, BUT NOT THIS TIME BUCKAROOS! HERE'S 10 ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CURRICULUMS FOR 1000 STUDENTS, GO F\*\*\* YOSELF! 

Lesson planning went completely out the window and the classroom experience suffered for it. The students knew we were exhausted but we're honestly amazing to us. Though they deserved so much better.

After all the b\*\*\*s\*\*\* with covid, completely inept administration, and a literal doubling of our workload with zero extra compensation, I had snapped...sort of. I knew that I was done with public education. I knew that I wanted out, but for our students I would finish out the next couple of years. Then the final straw came...

For anyone in American HS marching bands you have an idea of how BIG marching contests are. Most schools only attend these events, which takes about 3-4 hours on a Saturday. *Hosting takes about 14-18 hours on a Saturday.*

Hosting schools will typically host 1-2 contests a year at most, but our district expected us to host 3. It's hard to stress how insane this is to outsiders, so I'll just say it's easily 300 hours of extra labor upon a staff in just the months of September and October alone. We were one of 4 high schools in our district, so we constantly asked the other schools to take just one of these contests off our hands, but they knew the work it took and avoided it like the plague.

The moment of truth came when I was about to finish yet another 13 hours of work and was gearing up for our friday football game just a night before one of our three Saturday contests. The turn around from Friday night to Saturday morning is brutal, often going to sleep around 1AM and waking up at 4:30AM to open the stadium back up for setup.

It was at this moment that my head band director filled me in that **it was now our responsibility to clean the stadium after the football game**. This would mean basically not sleeping while performing a straight 40 hours of work, much of which is physically demanding.

The district believed that because they couldn't find workers to clean the stadium for minimum wage (shocking), it became our responsibility. Not the football team's of course, because they'll be too tired after the game!!! After years of covid, poor management and unrealisitic expectations, my job responibilities were now: HS teacher, MS teacher, counselor, therapist, instrument repairman, event organizer, pandemic cleaning crew (don't even get me started...), and now stadium janitor. My compensation had risen 0%.

The directors of the other high schools were so stupid they saw this as an OPPORTUNITY because the district agreed to provide us with $500 in our band budgets. But we were already severely underfunded, and this was the labor of about 200 students and their parents! $500 was an insult! They thought I was taking crazy pills when I complained that we were already stretched too thin, and that it wasn't our responsibility as teachers or students to be picking up needles and glass bottles in a parking lot midnight beforer their biggest contest of the year! Another band director even had the gaul to come up to me at midnight while we were cleaning the stadium, put his hands on my shoulders, and tell me that I was being ungrateful for this amazing opportunity for FIVE HUNDRED MEASLY ASS DOLLARS WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU JOSH?!?!?!?!

This happened in October of 2021. This event told me that even if I didn't have a new job lined up, I would be leaving and figure it out later. I'd rather be homeless than disrespected so severely. 

We were a staff of three on our HS campus, and all three of us found new jobs. I finished that school year and am now a university major gifts fundraiser making $10,000 more a year than I ever did before and with much better career prospects. In a way, I was lucky to learn this lesson early...

If you don't respect your time, neither will others. Set your standards now, be consistent, and value your time above all else, as it's the only thing you'll never get back."

I currently work night audit at a hotel and put in my two weeks notice (tonight is my last night). I am leaving because the pay and the hours suck, plus staying up overnight isn’t sustainable for me anymore.

 My manager wanted me to ask around for anyone I knew that could replace me, which I happily let her know that I have someone that can come in for an interview right away! He is my friends boyfriend and they had recently had a baby together and she was already having to work a week postpartum. So I of course wanted him to get the job. And not long ago my manager said that she prefers to hire thru employee reference so I figured it would be the perfect opportunity to help a friend. He is also sociable and a quick learner from what I heard. 

Turns out my manager hires some other dude. A little annoying, but whatever! I was open to whoever she chose since I wont be here anyway. Lets call the new hire Mike. Mike is extremely socially inept. And I say that as someone who has social anxiety and highly masked ADHD (and probably some other stuff thrown in the mix lol). I completely understand what its like to be socially anxious and I really do feel for him. However, the hotel front desk will suffer the consequences of my managers choice and so will the rest of the team. He is also averse to any feedback. We created the list for due outs (people who are checking out). He spells it “Do out”. I simply corrected him and he said in his slow drawl of a southern accent “I mean its pretty much the same meaning”…
No. It is not. 

He says he was in IT before this. I do not believe him. He types VERY slow like he doesn’t know where the keys are. 

Someone called and he was so hesitant to pick it up that his hand was hovering over the phone for a good 8 seconds before picking it up and nervously stammering “Uh..[hotel name].. what? ss- ..I cant uh.. what did you sa-… can you?” It was literally just one of the housekeepers calling in and I calmly advised him to let her know he would inform our manager and to have a good day. He says it, and then just sits on the phone for another good 8 seconds while I am assuming the line is quiet. I told him he can put the phone down and he finally did.

And I just want you to know that I am not taking my frustrations out on him. Although I am screaming internally. He takes up a lot of time with people and gets easily overwhelmed, which is fair, the systems can be hard to learn at first.

However, he has had about 6 days of training. 4 of those days being on day shifts so that he can learn about different scenarios. But he still cannot seem to be able to check someone in which is the most common thing we do.

Lastly (not all there is but I need to find a stopping point), he doesn’t know how to clean. We are expected to clean the lobby. I asked him to sweep. There was dirt and crumbs and it basically looked like he hadn’t touched it to which I had to explain that there is a breakfast area that needs to be up to standard in cleanliness. The second night he still did not do it right and I had to tell him again what he needs to clean and how to clean it. 

I have made a new guide that is up to date for him and easy to understand. Hopefully this helps. And hopefully tonight is better! 

TLDR ; replacement that I am training does not listen and seems incompetent 🤦‍♀️ just a rant and it will not be my problem soon"

And the more of a national and overtime international movement it is the better things will turn out with new companies not on stock market that stabilizes all of us

Search up ""Unionized Cooperatives Resources (Your Country/State/City Name)"" they teach you to be management, how to make a unionized cooperative with others in, and how to get funding.

P.S. Best based on research is for the Unionized Cooperatives having it where you're working only 4 hrs each day for 3-4 days each week and having it where you are making as you would from working 40 hrs each week (And making way more since it's a unionized cooperative)

Lately I've been telling people that ""I'm honest, to a fault.""

I've been through enough to understand, at least for me personally, that honesty and being true to myself and all others, allies and enemies alike, is the only way to truly be happy in life. I don't have to remember the lies I've said, and to whom, I don't have to stress about webs I've woven and how to navigate them. I tell the truth, plain and simple, and  the facts, as well as reality itself, backs me up 100%.

Unfortunately, I've come to the conclusion that doing this causes me financial burden in the context of applying for jobs, doing interviews, and even holding onto jobs I've gotten. I feel like it's a constant uphill battle to be truthful in my career path and businesses; I can either be 100% honest with everyone and never make it to the next level, or I can lie my ass off, like everyone else, and get rich.  Is this really how it is for everyone, or is it just me?

I'm being vague on purpose btw, if you have specific questions let me know but honestly (npi) it shouldn't matter what the specifics are in my own personal situation."

Friends, I hardly look up from my desk to talk, or away from my computer out of fear something will be said.

4,2024-02-23,My mom got unexpectedly fired and it's bullshit,u/John_Rustle98,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ayfesz/my_mom_got_unexpectedly_fired_and_its_bullshit/,antiwork,"Okay, I know getting fired is unexpected anyway, but my mom had never gotten any warnings or write-ups. She'd been talked to at one point, but I'll give context on that in just a moment. She worked at a pathology office, doing bills, claims, etc. She's been a medical biller for almost three decades. She'd worked at the pathology lab since August 2022. I'll admit that this story might get a bit jumbled because I wasn't entirely familiar with everything they were wanting her to do on top of her original job of working on billing and claims, but I will do my best. 

So the talk that mom had been given by her boss was shortly after she was forced to go back to the office after working from home for only a few weeks. Right when she had been approved to work from home, she had been given additional work loads (ON TOP OF HER ORIGINAL JOB) that she hadn't been totally familiar with. My mom was extremely open about how she was struggling and needed more training, yet the higher ups never made time to actually train her. As a result, her productivity quota suffered and so she was forced to go back to the office. It was at least somewhat nice that her boss (we'll call her Lynn) actually apologized. Lynn knew that it looked like they had set her up to fell, so Lynn felt bad about that. Mom continued to ask for help and proper training even after going back to working in the office, but they never gave it to her. They didn't give her the tools to succeed at her job. Meanwhile, according to mom, they were giving the new hires all of the training they needed and required while mom got diddly-squat. She was pulled into her boss' office yesterday and was fired. She was told that ""She wasn't working out"" 

I'm angry because my mom now feels like a total failure. I've reminded her constantly in the last 24 hours that she isn't a failure. It was her EMPLOYERS that FAILED HER. They didn't give her the proper tools to succeed at her job. This also couldn't have come at a worse time because my dad is currently out of work because of a bad back injury he sustained at work a few years ago. He and his lawyer are working to get what his work owes him. He's also filed for permanent disability, but God knows how long that's going to take. This whole situation is also like salt on a still-open wound because we lost two cousins and an uncle a few weeks ago. 

It's really mind blowing to me that there isn't some sort of legal requirement for your employers to give you a two week notice of some sort. Even more infuriating is that her benefits through her old job only last until the end of the month. The assholes waited to fire her a week before the end of February. This means, as a result, she will lose her health benefits and thus lose the ability to pay for medicine that she desperately needs (like her depression medication). I'm just very nervous about what the future will bring. "

At this point it’s pretty clear she’s trying to push her out, and if she isn’t intentionally that’s almost worse

Right now she’s looking for another job. It’s unfortunate since she left her old job for this one because the boss didn’t appreciate her, her loyalty, or the work she did, and now the new boss is miles worse. Not sure how to help her at the moment, but at the very least I’ll keep asking around for her.

5 years working for this company and nothing but empty promises. 5 years of snubbed raises. 

Last year we had our best year on record. Most sales ever. I went above and beyond, gaining new skill sets, going to trade shows and taking on extra responsibilities. Last week our company purchased one of our competitors in the same selling space as my department. Our team of three tripled our client list and we received 4 employees with the merger. 

My opportunity for financial growth was taken away from me since the only way to make real money in this company is in sales. My professional growth is on hold.

Today I had my 5th year of perfect reviews and got a 4% raise. The consumer price index went up 3.7% I'm my already high cost of living area. It's like I didn't receive a raise at all!

When given all this information to my manager as well as reminding him I'm their biggest resource of operational and technological knowledge in our department, I was told it was a company wide 4% and there was nothing he could do. The owner of our company just bought a new apartment in New York City's upper East side to the tune of millions of dollars and I can barely make rent. 

Tell me where working hard makes sense anymore? My linkedin banner says open to work, the owner of my company as well as my direct boss is a connection, I hope they see it and get worried. Their lives are about to be miserable when I find a new job and quit after taking all my PTO.

Earlier this year I was laid off a well-paying restaurant position after one week of work and so I asked friends for work, and my friend who does OnlyFans offers to have me manage him. I’ve known him for about a decade. I’m paid 30% commission on certain sales and make about $2,000/month (about 22% of his total income) which isn’t amazing but I love the flexibility and the possibility of turning this into a business and getting other clients. 

The first week was shaky but now I’m doing really well, breaking sales records, establishing good rapport with his fans, also working as his assistant and collaborator hunter and spreadsheet manager (they had nothing organized, ever). I have hope that soon I can save up enough for my own place and be independent and work with my buddy long-term and maybe even expand! And then yesterday he tells me that he’s broke (how he manages to make $8000/month and spend it all while not having to pay rent is beyond me), and that he’s going to hire someone from the Philippines to do it for $4/hr. That he’s happy with my work but that it just makes more financial sense and it’s an offer he can’t refuse.

I had to negotiate a 5% commission cut just so that he could keep me on board till the end of March. And I need to train this new guy how to do my job. Also I may end up homeless if my ex decides to throw a fit because I don’t have a pot to piss in right now. And he “feels terrible” that knowing my situation he still needs to make this decision."

Asked if I was required to have my own workplace set up (first company to ever require this) they said yes. 

Not an issue, but the third nterview out of six was 2-3 hour technical assessment. Fully remote. 

Their job description never implied that I was to have my own equipment. As this was uncovered, they also required me to use my own resources for lead generation. (sales role) 

Is this common? Just felt it was a waste of each other's time, glad I had the experience to ask before going all the way.

Hello all , here’s my case: pls advise if there is scope for negotiating redundancy pay and how to go about it.

I have been notified that my position is at risk of redundancy. No hard feelings , I’m honestly done with the company. This is a US based company and have been working out of US for 3 years and got transferred to UK last year( with a 50% pay cut) as my visa didn’t come thru in US. So total of 4 years of service. 

All statutory UK redundancy pay is calculated on weekly basis per year of service ? Can I use the point that my prior 3 years of service was US based so this calculation might not favor me? Company is also paying 2 weeks additional per year of service + 4 weeks pay ( which I think is notice) 

I would ideally like to go for a settlement and emphasis how they already cut my pay and they were supposed to transfer me back to US on a work visa and we had begun discussions with lawyer on this. Do I have a valid claim and or how should I go about it ?? Thanks in advance for anyone reading/suggesting anything!

I’ve been a software developer for about 10 years. I’ve been a lead/sr for about 4 years. I just got offered a job starting at $120k for a LEAD developer. Software development just isn’t worth it anymore. It doesn’t pay what it used to. I’m not trying to dissuade anyone from following their dreams, but if you’re chasing this for the money, I’m sorry to say but you’re out of luck. 

I was talking to my cousin today about the economy, and he had some good insights: “if we just tax the rich more, they’ll continue to pass the buck on to the middle/lower class”… he’s right.. but my retort was “there was a time when the middle class was booming, when Teddy Roosevelt introduced antitrust laws”. Raegan gutted those laws. 

I guess this isn’t just about software dev after all… but my question is: what laws were gutted that enabled the US middle class to prosper, and what laws need to be reenacted?"

Pretty much saying he needed him there if he wanted to get promoted and that he could take two days off but thought the two weeks he was requesting was ridiculous. Being 8 months pregnant I was so mad and emailed his HR department (I know, I know, it’s his job and I had no right to butt in.) I’d like to blame pregnancy hormones but right now I’m so angry for him and venting here instead so I don’t go doing the same thing.

It’s a year later now and guess what, they promoted someone else instead of him. Well now his boss is back to waving another promotion in front of his face again and telling him he needs him to start coming in on Saturdays for a full shift. Yeah, we could use the extra money. But I want my husband to have time with the kids and our family. And I just really can’t stand his boss. He works for the city in their landscaping department and so they try to not contract out their work and have their employees now working on a highway without proper equipment or the necessary safety gear they should have. This same boss also got onto my husband when he had to take a day off because the kids were sick, and then turned around and told his coworker how great of a dad he was to put his family first when he missed work for the same reason. They also allow the employees to take courses for various certifications that my husband has repeatedly expressed interest in but they continue to push him off and let others take the courses. I really wish he would leave and find something else. They’re doing their annual reviews soon so I think that will determine if he starts looking for a new job.

Also the bonus structure is shite. 

I explained to my manager and the director of the team why I’m leaving (better bonus + more long term growth) and thanked them for everything. The director handled my resignation decently well, asking if there is anything that could be done to change my mind and said we shouldn’t end this on bad terms and have a farewell drinks next week. 

My manager the whole time looked like 😟 and barely said a word. A few of my work friends reached out once the news was announced but that’s it. Only one person from my team reached out. When I went to drop off my things, a lot of the senior people ignored me. That was hurtful. 

I also found out the story they’re giving to my company has been twisted to make me look, well, stupid. I made it clear I’m joining a well-established team covering the products my old company covers. Instead, they’re telling everyone I am starting a whole new desk/portfolio, which is risky since I am very junior. Honestly why would they lie - when I announce my new role on LinkedIn everyone will see that isn’t true.

Since my last post, they changed my schedule for the first time in weeks. I was scheduled to work on a Tuesday the week after next. I have told them before that I cannot work on Tuesdays or Thursdays since I’m in class all day. So, I call my boss, and talk to her. She says “I don’t have that in my schedule, I have you listed as open availability”. Ok….I never said that, but go off. So she changes my schedule. 

She schedules me that Wednesday morning….10 minutes before another one of my classes ends. I have never worked a morning shift in my entire time at this store. You think there would be a reason for this right? This was my last straw.

After not having me work for 3 weeks in a row, prior to that only one day a week, you schedule me for two times that I have explicitly said I cannot work. 

So, I call again, and say I am resigning effective immediately. She then goes and says “we don’t have the ability to view your scheduling history so you should have made me aware of in our last call. It says open availability on my end.”

And of course the one manager who can back up my story is on vacation. As if she would anyways. She literally wrote my availability on my resume during my interview. 

I said thanks for the opportunity and all that shit, and she says “well, if that’s how you’re choosing to quit, you will not be leaving in good standing and will not be able to work at Sharshalls or our sister businesses”

Bold of her to assume that I would dare applying to any business vaguely related to that hellhole.

I have always done well in service jobs before this, I do all the tasks I’m told to do without question and I am polite and friendly with everyone I work with even if they bug me I usually don’t take it personally. 

When I started the job I liked it but there was definitely some awkwardness because my coworker who was supposed to be training me really didn’t teach me what to do at all. She showed me the morning and evening recurring opening/closing the office tasks but there would be large stretches of hours during the day where she would be working on her schoolwork/browsing her computer or phone for fun/chatting with friends in the office. During this time I really didn’t know what to do and would often wander aimlessly trying to find tasks and be productive. 

When I would browse my computer or check my phone for brief periods she would always make a point to tell me I can’t do that and suggest something to do (like walk around and ask if anyone needs help with anything) instead. These things she would tell me to do instead would never take up more than like 10-15 minutes. SHE GETS MAD AT ME EVEN WHEN SHE IS DOING THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME. She would sometimes print out task lists for me with huge projects that I wouldn’t know how to even begin without showing me how to do any of it and just expected me to start doing those things. 

After a few months I would start really drawing the projects that I was taught how to do by doing them slowly. Being away from my desk for hours because there is nothing for me to do there. Then my boss is mad she can’t find me/ my coworker doesn’t know exactly where I am in the small office, I haven’t left or done anything wrong, I’m working on these projects away from my desk like my coworker said I should. They all have my phone number and could text me if they really can’t find me.

It came to a head when my coworker went to my boss and told her that I’m on my phone too much and told on me for taking a 10 minute personal call on the clock (which literally everyone at my work has done including her, several times). My boss says I need to communicate better and tell her if I need to take a call but she never tells me when she leaves to takes a call. I don’t know what to do or why she hates me. On top of all this now that I’m trained on opening and closing the office she will almost always let me do the entire process alone without lifting a finger to help. This is my coworker and we are supposed to split these tasks, she isn’t my supervisor. I keep my head down and work quietly all day. I don’t use my phone more than she does.

They offered me a 40% salary increase as a counteroffer, which I, of course, rejected.

I was extremely frustrated when I didn't get the promotion, but now I feel like that was the best thing that could have happened to my career. Otherwise, I might have received the promotion with only a 10% - 15% increase and twice the responsibility.

Yay, they get scheduled for 3 days starting late February. Then suddenly they are off again and that whole training group that was told their jobs were safe get laid off. Why? They were told bc tours were low this season. The real reason? They knew since last year that once January hit Westgate wasn’t allowed 1099 workers they had to be employed with westgate. So they thought it would be easier to lay them all off. And here’s the kicker. They have yet another training class scheduled soon. Good luck. Oh.

Many of these business owners on there are really rich and just demanding more free money. One guy has pictures of two Teslas and a BMW SUV in his drive way but can’t pay his loans, wants it for free.

Another one has a $2400 handbag, 7400 sqr foot house. Flies to Japan with a family of 6. Can’t repay their loan, needs it for free!

I'm the type of person that's always early anyway, but this combined with a couple of things during orientation has rubbed me the wrong way.

My former employer was always shady about calculating hours worked for paychecks, they used an obscure online clocking-in system for construction workers. I was a project coordinator working in the main office.   
We had calls from workers on sites all over the state, every week, of people complaining that their hours were incorrect and that their punches in and out on the system were sometimes removed. The timekeeping system was a black box from the actual payroll department, and only 1 person knew how  it worked. That one person was the Owner's niece (privately owned company). She constantly fielded complaints and phone calls from workers about it.  
I received late paychecks there a few times, which was the only time in my life I've personally experienced that.

Bottom line, I guess I'm getting my piece of the high-six-figure settlement.

Fuck capitalism. Billionaires and corporations are fucking thieves. There is no ethical way to become a billionaire. The only way to become that rich is to steal the value of many people' labor.

Excerpt from the settlement:

    Defendant violated California state labor laws as a result of its alleged failure to, among other things: 
    (1) pay minimum and overtime wages to employees for all hours worked; 
    (2) provide employees with meal and rest breaks; 
    (3) timely pay all wages owed to employees during each pay period and upon termination of their employment; 
    (4) reimburse employees for necessary business expenses; 
    (5) pay reporting time pay; 
    (6) provide employees with accurate, itemized wage statements; and 
    (7) maintain accurate time and payroll records. From the outset of this litigation, Defendant has denied, and continues to deny, all the claims presented or any wrongdoing whatsoever."

We work to live, not the opposite.

When you work to survive, a loss of pay is not a loss of money; it’s a loss of life. It’s time spent with family, friends, and the other things that make life worth living.

Some of that time must be sacrificed due to necessity. Not only are millions poorly paid, but their pay is often stolen from them. In 2012, US wage theft surpassed all robberies, burglaries, and motor vehicle thefts combined.¹ Companies know that few have the time and energy to fight back — which they exploit to the max. A stolen month constitutes 0.1% of a person’s lifetime (assuming they reach age the age of 70) — so three months of wages represents 0.3% of that person’s life.

We have a limited time on this Earth.

We want to spend it with those we love, working on meaningful projects and growing as people. But, thanks to our economic system, we must sacrifice more than necessary of this non-renewable resource.

Then, as a cherry on top, employers steal it.

When they do, they’re not only stealing money.

They’re stealing our lives.

6,2024-02-24,I was terminated on Thursday after calling out a hostile work environment ,u/outtathisworld385,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ayzt18/i_was_terminated_on_thursday_after_calling_out_a/,antiwork,"I had a stressful week. I spoke to HR on Tuesday about how my boss has made me feel me uncomfortable after unfairly giving me a poor performance evaluation. 

I had started my job in October and hadn’t really done much due to how slow things were so 90% of my tasks was just sending over meeting minutes. My title was a senior account executive and I was making 85k. During the performance review, my boss told me it was a common 90 day check-in and I shouldn’t not worry but then sent me an email saying I had two weeks to improve before my performance was reviewed again. My training began after my poor performance review.

The whole thing was shady and I guess HR could sense my frustration despite saying they could see how things could be perceived as hostile and need to further investigate. 

When I was terminated, I was put on garden leave so although my last working day the 22nd, my last day with the company is March 1st so I get to keep my benefits through March.

I don’t have it in my to actually sue and I have already been interviewing with other companies. It’s a shame what happened and I handled it the best I could.

What do I do now?"

She typically just writes me a check that isnt taxed, however, yesterday (Friday) when I gave her the amount of money she owed me for the renewals she said she will “pay me Monday bc she forgot her checkbook” which I already know is BS bc it was payday and she wrote checks for all of the subcontractors right in front of me. With that being said, I doubt she will remember Monday so I will have to remind her. I dont know why I always feel so guilty and embarrassed though having to remind her to pay me. Part of it is that she is a not nice person and everytime someone asks her to do something simple she acts like a total b**tch. Im leaving this job as they for a multitude of reasons are completely unethical and participate in illegal behavior that I want no part in so I got a new job and do not plan on giving two weeks notice bc they do not deserve it. But for that reason, i feel like I have to stay until she remembers to pay me this money or I may never see it since i didnt give notice. Yesterday was actually supposed to be my last day because I anticipated on getting my check for that money I was owed and then letting her know I was out end of day once I recieved it. How do you typically going about reminding your boss to pay you? I’m trying to get out of here as soon as possible, but I also don’t want to miss out on that money."

This job just sucks. Management is completely incompetent. The pay sucks and there are not any promotion, learning, or advancement opportunities unless you decide you want to work for free in your off time to help out a different department. They treat their customers like cash cows and lie to them every single day just to pick their pockets.

I want to write a resignation letter that I can also send to my team as a farewell since we all feel the same about this dump. The people on the team are wonderful, but management just sucks ass.  I will not be giving them a single minute of notice since I have no interest in listening to their BS beyond that day, and I will be dumping my laptop on the manager's desk with this letter as well as sending it to every person on the team.  

I don't care about ""burning bridges"" because I will never see or speak to anyone from this company ever again, and I don't need a job reference from any of them.

I just need help writing something pithy, but very pointed about how they suck.  I have tried writing the letter several times, but it just comes off as bitchy.  I need something that is epically sarcastic and sends a message with my tongue planted firmly in my cheek.

Any suggestions?"

I spent over 10 years working for a university pharmacy. Towards the end of my tenure there, I noticed an issue with a cancer drug that was costing the university hundreds of thousands of dollars. They checked with other institutions and realized they were all having the issue and losing a lot of money, collectively, and they decided to file a multi million dollar class action lawsuit vs the drugmaker. I sat for a deposition with an attorney about a month before I left the company, and explained the situation and gave all documentation that I had. A couple months later, I turned in my two week notice in anticipation of starting my own business but during the first week, they told me it would be my last day and they didn't want me to serve out the rest of my two weeks. So I left the company and contacted them a year later, to sign a form that would forgive my student loans (public service forgiveness), but they ghosted me for 2 weeks and I was not able to get the signed documentation needed to have the loans forgiven. 

Last week, I was cleaning my car and a dude pulled up and gave me stack of papers and said he represents the drug company and that I am subpoenaed to attend a deposition at the lawyer's office. A couple days later, I got an email from my old employer's lawyer saying they wanted to represent me, as a former employee of the university, and that I should come to a preparatory meeting at their office, and they would represent me during the deposition. I still hold resentment for the university for not letting me finish my 2 weeks and not helping me get my loans forgiven. At this point, I am thinking I do not want the university lawyers to represent me, I do not want to meet with them to help their case, and I have done nothing wrong so I don't even need representation. Is there any reason I would want to volunteer my time to help their case? 

Thanks in advance for any perspectives you can offer! "

I recently took a job about 6 months ago to work at a state institution. All look ok when I got interviewed and signed my contract. My contract shows that im supposed to work 0700 to 1530 at building A. A month or so after I get hired, my boss starts asking if I would like to rotate monthly to building B. Building B is a bit further away and their schedule is from 0730 to 1600. Theres no shuttle from the parking garage I park (and pay for monthly) to building B in the mornings and the scheduling is honestly inconvenient as I have younger siblings and other responsibilities outside of work. 

I told her no and that was that. We recently had a meeting and we talked about being fair on assignments (out unit in building A is divided into 4 different areas but not everyone is getting rotated around fairly). In this meeting, she said there wouldn’t be exceptions when it comes to the scheduling in building B, meaning we HAVE to work the 0730 to 1600 schedule. Nowhere in this meeting did we agree to “be in fairness and start rotating a different person daily to building B”. She texted us our schedule for Monday and had me down as the person for building B. Keep in mind, I’ve never been nor been trained in building B and I would be alone to do my job there until 1000, when the second person arrives. This was our text exchange:

Me: “Hi boss,
Im seeing that im being scheduled to work building B on Monday but im really having trouble with transportation as I already have an agreement for transportation according to my contracted hours as I dont live near
job where I can take public transport. I would really appreciate if you could take into consideration my situation and Im open to talk about it in detail if need be.”

Boss: “We plan to rotate you all and we're all for fairness.”

Me:”Ok I'lI try to work out something in regards of transportation and I'II be going ahead and asking HR for a copy of my contract as im really trying to work with management in regards to my schedule and see what the terms are for my contracted hours.”

Boss: “Yes go ahead”

I genuinely find her very inconsiderate of my circumstances as I carpool with family who also works at this facility and nowhere in my contract did it say anything about working a different building nor other time schedule. There’s no public transportation from my job to my home, getting a rideshare app is too expensive and parking at that building is $30 daily. I’ve reached out to HR but I doubt they’ll get back to me in time. I refuse to work anything outside of contract and offer letter (I emailed HR for a copy of both days prior just in case).

Im at a lost because I dont want to lose this job. It has great long term benefits but I refuse to be pushed around."

This is now my third time being scolded for something that miscommunication between higher ups caused. I haven't been here very long, but I'm thinking maybe it's time I just quit and look for a different job.

6,2024-02-24,"I know it's my fault, but...",u/Sturdybody,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1az3nkr/i_know_its_my_fault_but/,antiwork,"So I've been getting hammered at work lately. Nearly every day I'm being reprimanded, scolded, whatever you want to call it. And I know it's my fault. I am making mistakes, and I am doing things wrong. But they're minor and with a few exceptions they haven't caused damage, they haven't even caused loss. 

But my manager and the owner, especially the owner make me feel like absolute shit almost every single day. It's almost like they can't help themselves. I have more responsibility than everyone except the manager and owner so I'm held to a higher standard and I get that, but I don't want this and they don't pay me that way anymore and I don't get hours to reflect that anymore. 

I was formerly ""on track"" to be the inventory and online sales manager at a small retail store, and I was super happy about it, I got paid better, and I had 30-35 hours a week so it was pretty close to full time. I was making enough to tread water. 

But I was getting burned out and my mental health was falling apart because of personal life, and also because I was getting hammered about any and all mistakes big or small. I told the manager and the owner that my mental health was falling a part and I was burned out and that I wanted to take a day off my schedule. They warned that if I did that I'd no longer be on track to be manager because I wouldn't be full time anymore and my hours and pay would be cut accordingly. I had to do what I had to do for my mental health. (it helped a lot as an aside)

It's been about 2 months now since the hours changed and they cut more than one shift, they cut 2, and just recently they cut a third every other week to save money because we're not doing so well as sales go. And I am still getting hammered by complaints near daily, I am requested to do more than everyone else I work with except the manager and owner, like significantly more. I make calls and emails and process items in ways that no one else does and I am held FULLY responsible for any and all things I do regardless of if I want to do them or not. 

On Tuesday I was asked to add some items to inventory and I did on Thursday my next shift. I changed the cost of the bulk version of the item but not the singles of the item to reflect the bulk cost change, leaving the prices the same as old items from the same brand. I got in trouble for this, and I explained what happened and the more I explained the more it got me in trouble. 

Like an idiot I was doing this off the clock in work discord, but when it got too frustrating and I felt too belittled I just said ""It's late and I'm happy to talk about this more on Tuesday when I'm on the clock"" - The owner makes another jab at me and then says ""Also, I asked you above to respond at your convenience.  You've chosen to respond now indicating this was at your convenience. I am also awake having to fix the problem, so I'm able to discuss it. If you'd rather not discuss this now then don't.

I'll see you Tuesday with Manager""

I've been on edge, and frustrated since. I want to quit this job because I'm tired of feeling like shit every day, and I'm tired of having more responsibility than everyone else and not being paid that way. It's like I'm under a microscope and I can't do anything small or it leads to a complaint, and I know it's my fault. I'm not stupid and I know I'm making mistakes and doing things wrong, but I'm so tired of everything being serious even if it's not. I've got two write ups for insubordination and not turning on the alarm one night, so if I get written up again I'm just fired. and honestly I kind of just want them to fire me at this point. Get it over with, if I'm so awful at the job just fire me and let me drown. I just don't care anymore."
8,2024-02-24,Office Mandatory Overtime for 6 Months and still going,u/KayakToad,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1az3u51/office_mandatory_overtime_for_6_months_and_still/,antiwork,"So this is more of a rant for me to blow off steam as I'm in the middle of a breakdown. I am actively job hunting and even have interviews already lined up for the next few weeks to better my personal situation. I do not have kids or room mates. I marked the area for when I get into the over time with \[\[OVERTIME PART\]\] if you want to skip to that or just the tl;dr at the bottom.  


I got my first office job and the place was amazing. Love the people and work that I do. \[for the context of what I do won't matter for this post\] however the owner wanted to retire so he sold his company to do so and it was pretty intact for the first year as I imagine paperwork and analysis was going on.  


2020 hit so still no real changes were made but we were told to work from home. I lived in an apartment at the time which my building was ALSO changing ownership. So for the next year I'm dealing with 7a-7p renovation construction around me as well as neighbors blasting music, other neighbors fornicating very loudly. The people above me had 4 kids in a 2 bedroom apartment. Noise. so much noise and I had no escape. This was because despite having my own (had a door) office, doing all the pandemic procedures required to return to the office and was willing to wear a mask, I was refused while I had friends/coworkers that had never left the office and didn't need a reason to return.  


So that pissed me off. My job requires me to be on the phone but we'd get in trouble for having ""lawn mowers, cars, music, children, etc"" come through the call. Mean while I left a voicemail for my \[really cool, love her\] supervisor of hey, my neighbors are fornicating again and here is a recording of it so it can be escalated or used as evidence of why I need to be allowed back in the office. (Spring 2021)  


Nothing. I then go buy a house to get me out of the situation \[no regrets on the purchase just don't like having to be pushed into it\] but that left me (on paper) homeless for a month because of situation with the apartments wanting me out to renovate and repairs needed on the house so I stayed at a coworkers house.  


(Summer 2021) I THEN get a call saying I could go into the office. So I'm like fucking finally. But its to retrieve my personal belongings. Mind you, people including the friend I am now staying with for a month, have never left the office and are not being told to leave. So I told my supervisor that I'm going into the office and will retrieve my personal belongings but as I will have no means to WFH without a ""home"" to work from and I have jumped through all the rules and hoops to qualify to return to the office that I'm just not leaving the office. This of all *fucking* things, works.  


\[\[OVERTIME PART\]\]  


During this time we have optional/offered overtime which I would partake in a little here and there. I was also diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder that I brought up to my supervisor but never filed or brought up to anyone else intentionally as it was not really interfering with my work yet but I did have like a weird month of adjusting to treatment were I needed to take more breaks so I just broke up my provided 15 minute break over smaller 3-5 minutes through the day. My supervisor was cool with it and all was good.

(2023) My senior co-worker moved and was never replaced as well as a few other people that just left on their own. It wasn't too bad as our workload through the year fluctuates where its super busy and all the optional overtime is usually May-August every year. I was still doing a little bit of optional overtime but nothing crazy, like maybe 4-5 extra hours a week. (August 2023) Everyone is kicked out of our building to permanently WFH as the company is selling it \[its still not sold but it still houses our servers with one IT guy in there to this day\] and during that time the company has been doing a lot of very fast paced restructuring with department and duty reconfiguring.

This is when 4/5 of my department is (not officially) demoted and my workload with 3 others is tripled. One of these people was promoted and is not completely trained to do all the work so its really a new department of 2 and a half. \[They are still not fully trained\] and with this tripled work load came mandatory overtime.

I've been working 70 hour weeks for a job that pays half the market wage since September (maybe August its so hard to remember) and I finally was about to go to 50 hour weeks for then last week to be ramped back up to 70 hour weeks. My gross take home with that work is still below 2k per check (or 1k per week of work) 

I had been advocating for a 4th person as a regular hire for months since we have people trained but just demoted to a lesser role who are willing to return. They are ""looking into it"" and that was October.

My supervisor had permission to have some of the demoted people ""cross trained"" to assist us but those people were laid off so now my supervisor is having to start over with different people with the same permission to ""cross train"" them to assist with work they already know how to do.

My supervisor finally believes me that we are not getting help. I see on reddit and through my ""in"" with IT guy still in the building that my company is mass hiring overseas employees pennies on our   
US dollar. Yet they are laying off good people and having us work overtime for months when there was a simple solution the entire time. (my department I believe legally can't have non-US workers due to sensitivity)

I debated informing Human Resources about my auto immune issue to see if I could ""get out"" of the mandatory overtime but I had a issue were my PII was leaked to a 3rd party without my consent and that took eight months to ""sort out"" so I'm not confident informing them would do anything and likely just hurt future prospects.

My US State does not have specific Overtime Laws so this is all 100% legal for my employer to do \[to my understanding\] as long as they pay us time and a half of our normal pay \[remember that 70 hours a week is less than 1k gross pay WITH that\]

&#x200B;

tl;dr I feel lucky that I was able to get a house with the job I have through being smart with my finances but working 140 hours for 2k every two weeks for 6 months with the employer trying to get rid of US employees for cheaper overseas ones. I'm exhausted. I have a 2nd interview with somewhere else in 2 weeks and I pray my mental health will last that long.  


I could be wrong and this is just the new normal for office work. I've joked with my supervisor about working at McDonalds for minimum wage but it may not be a joke much longer. Thank you for reading any of this and I feel slightly better but I'm still going to go cry in frustration for 20 minutes then clock in on my wfh computer and do more of that mandatory over time.

I have been with this company for 3 years and have never had any problem with anyone or any problem with my work. The complaints were that I somehow threatened these girls and they didn't take it as a joke.

I was very loyal to the company and I always did a good job doing my work. However, a few months later my manager started giving me an additional 50 cents more per hour for a grand total of $1.50 raise but I realized I could have been earning 50 cents more for all this time. I asked her if she could give me 50 cents more on all my previous paychecks after the raise and she said no because she didn’t know how much of a raise she could give me. I was so mad because I lost a lot of money. 50 cents more per hour doesn’t sound like a lot but it certainly adds up much quicker than you think it would. Especially on all the holidays I worked and got paid time and a half. I understand that that she doesn’t want to correct all my previous paychecks as it would have been very time consuming on her end. On the other hand, the least she could have done was allow me to pick out a few products from the store for free to make up the difference and I feel like she could have done that very easily but she just decided to screw me over despite everything I’ve done for her and for the company. It’s not fair but ultimately there’s nothing I can do about it."

In recent years there feels like a culture shift as my current boss plans to retire soon and another will take over.

It has become more and more implied by this next boss and other coworkers that working off hours is needed, as well as implying I need to work while sick or not take my lunch period and just eat while I work like he and others do. 

I’m happy to work during off hours as my schedule allows but can I firmly set a boundary? What’s the best way? Do I even have any say as an exempt employee?"

One time she was yapping on about her childhood and how she would can fruit and stuff like that on her grandmas farm and they would donate it to the local church. I was like that’s sweet, and she flipped out and was super upset about it. I thought you know maybe she had a bad experience with the church in the past. 

Fast forward a week or two and I told my coworker about this interaction and he gave me the backstory. He told me he got forced to go to dinner at our managers house where she told him how much she hated that she could hear a local church play music in her backyard. She said “I’m a proud member of the Church of Satan.” I asked him if it was maybe her idea of a bad joke but her was serious that she meant it. 

Fast forward to my boss being a turbo bitch and I started to decorate my desk with religious shit like crosses and scripture just to make her even more mad. 

Overall I have a lot more stories about this crazy woman, but for now this is my first one!

Executive Catering Chef for a pretty well known company in my area. I was so excited to work there when I started. I'd been out of work for a few years as basically a house wife because no one was willing to look at my resume when I moved to this state. This company was a small one, owned by the woman who started it a decade ago, who ran it with her mom and a few other ladies.   


They pulled me in talking about how even though I wouldn't get benefits, I would be able to take free business classes with the CoC of our city, and monthly they would take all of us up into the nearest big city for a luncheon at this Women in Business type of club where we could network and enjoy great food. I got to drive the company car, had my own desk, they gave me flowers and a cup with my name on it. I'd never worked for someplace so professional seeming. I also loved that they wanted my input in revamping their entire menu to make it my own. Apart from not getting benefits, it really was my dream job and the pay was double what I'd made at the height of my career.   


They trained me for three days and then left me on my own to handle everything. The thing with this company is that they have this mission statement that basically says ""no order is too small."" You only need 24 hours notice to make a catering order. While I can see how that's great for the customers, what it meant for me was that I was on call 24/7, working 12 - 16 hour days. I eventually got faster at putting together most of the orders, but for the first month, because they had three different menus that were all *massive*, I didn't know how to make most of what was being ordered. I had to call the owner, wait for her to email me the recipe, go shopping for the ingredients, come back and make it all.   


Sometimes they would let repeat customers they knew really well skip over the 24 hour notice to only need eight hours of notice. I started needing to come in on my days off just to prep things for the next day. Some months, I didn't even get a day off, they just broke up my shifts to try to make them shorter. When I went into overtime, I got yelled at for not being faster and told I needed to do the work off the clock because the owner, who knew her recipes and menus by heart after making them every day for ten years, knew it was doable to get it all done in a shorter amount of time.   


In addition to all of this, I was expected to work volunteer hours at local nursing homes and homeless shelters because the company as a whole wanted to be involved in the community and it was important we all be there. And because they knew I had a degree and experience in Baking and Pastry, they added baked goods to their menu without telling me, so after my regular work, I had to make hundreds and hundreds of cookies, brownies, cake shooters, and cakes.   


I put a year into that company because I vehemently believed in their mission statements and their community outreach. My health suffered because I was on call and had to be able to drop everything and get to our kitchen or go shopping for orders at the drop of a hat, meaning I was struggling to make doctors appointments on time. Thank God for the ability to talk to my therapist and psychiatrist on the phone while I worked.   


The last three months, I have not had a day off. I was not compensated for being on call 24/7. If I was sleeping when an email went through and I didn't respond within an hour, I was written up or talked down to. Two weeks ago, I threw my back out, and when it wasn't better in a ""timely fashion"", my boss began threatening to replace me. I'd had enough. I couldn't do it anymore. I used to have so much respect and even idolisation of that woman, but as much as she loved telling people I was her secret weapon and I was so great for the company, when she was mad at me, I was just a pebble in her shoe.  


 I texted her back saying ""I think I bit off more than I can chew with this job, and I don't want to be the reason your company suffers. As of right now, I cannot stand much less work, so I will have my husband return any \[company name\] property to you tomorrow morning. Thank you for the opportunity, and I am sorry I could not make this work."" She text back ""I expected better from you."" That was that. "

Thursday, the 22nd, was my two year anniversary at the company, we all celebrated briefly in a meeting. Then Thursday night I got a “Skip level meeting” invite with the VP of the department. He was the one who initially hired me and after googling what a skip level meeting was every article said to not panic, but it was just a chance to chat with upper management. So I carried on my Friday as usual working and thinking that the meeting was just a friendly catch up after my two year anniversary with the VP who I thought really liked working with me. I joined that meeting all excited and happy greeting him, and the tone suddenly shifted when someone from HR joined and I got news I got selected for the company lay offs. Within that 15 minute meeting, I lost access to everything I was signed into without warning and my world came crumbling down. Once that meeting ended, I was still sitting there in shock.

All throughout last night, I got messages all over LinkedIn about how shocked and sudden it was when I left (more like kicked out). 25 people got selected for the first wave. The most shocking one, my direct supervisor didn’t even know I was part of the selected group and messaged me apologizing that she didn’t know and couldn’t stop it since I got kicked out by the time she knew. 

All this to say, it’s true what they say. Companies will kick you out in literally a heartbeat. I understand layoffs but the way the company went about it seemed so heartless… lesson learned. Within 15 minutes, everything I worked hard for the last 2 years meant nothing. My heart truly goes out to everyone on the same boat! "

In my mid twenties, and feel like I’m wasting my youth. In good shape, able to take a couple vacations a year but feel like most of my time is centered around when I do have to work. I want to take around 6 months to travel, see the world, and find “my person.” My company usually gives generous payouts to those they lay off, but you don’t get a severance package if you quit. Would doing something mildly inappropriate that would get me laid off result in a severance package or would it be considered “getting fired?” I am not racist or sexist at all so this next part may sound crazy but it’s my idea. My company pays 3 months of salary for severance package. If I lightly grab my female colleague and she reports it, or if I say the n word in passing to someone in HR those may be grounds to “lay me off.” Would I get severance package for doing that? Right now I am making just under 700k/year and feel that a 3 month severance package of ~$170k would go a long way traveling the world. I know I’m not the first person to think of this so forgive me for asking if this has already been posted.

- apparently some jobs do *credit checks*? i'm sorry, *what the fuck?* if i had debt i couldn't even get a FUCKING JOB TO FIX IT??

- the applications are designed to drain your self esteem and will to live; it's a war of attrition designed to make you miserable and pliable. 

- every waking moment i feel like shit for not having a job because in our society (in the US, if you couldn't tell because of the ubiquitousness of our obscene drug testing fetish) you're worthless for not having a job; i am then supposed to turn around and channel that into pretending i'm fucking leo in wolf of wall street at these fucking interviews.

Either it’s weird hours, split shifts, weekends & holidays, terrible pay, no parking, no commuter passes, no benefits, no pensions, no 401k plans, no dental even if they have some shitty healthcare plan, they lie about sign on bonuses, they lie about the hours, they don’t have 2 consecutive days off, the expectation to go above and beyond what you’re paid to do. I’m so fucking tired of it. 

I just want a full time permanent position that offers healthcare and dental benefits, a pension, retirement plans and actually pays what the cost of living is to afford a 2 bedroom apartment in my city. Why is that too much to ask when we have literally like 10 dudes hoarding all the wealth?

No I don’t want a side hustle, I don’t want 2 or 3 shitty paying jobs to equal one low paying career, I don’t want to sell my plasma to make ends meet, I don’t want to try and be an influencer to monetize bullshit content. Why the fuck have we all just accepted this as the norm in society? "

Capitalism makes people mean and I don't mean the CEOs (though they are definitely cruel beyond measure). Capitalism makes working class people mean.

I want to be kind but after facing hours of verbal abuse every single day from the public and upper management, my brain literally doesn't have the capacity. Inconveniences I once was able to shake off without any hard feelings, now it feels like every single thing sets me off because I am constantly at the end of my mental rope.

All of me gets used up at my job and what's left is a bitter husk of who I used to be. i hate who I'm becoming. I hate how burned out and bitter I am.

I have a high profile client who has indicated me as their preferred care provider. 



I found some discrepancies in my pay stub from a former, deceased client with this agency where I was denied overtime after working 10 and 12 hour shifts. (This came to light after a delayed overtime payment that they 'found' and were very sorry for withholding last week, ""so please check your stubs to make sure they are correct""). I called them to have them double check another pay stub and they made it clear that what I thought was OT-two ten hour shifts and one twelve hour, isn't overtime, its 'alternative work', as per the contract I signed. 


I'm in Ca. A ten hour work day is exempt (if I understand correctly) from overtime under an 'overachieving employee' clause meaning you aren't eligible for overtime if you are, say, working four tens with three days off a week. 


Are they exploiting the loophole? I am mildly disgruntled on the phone and acquiesce to not receive the hours as OT, since I did sign the contract. 


They immediately delete me from the associated group, block my login on the app and was told, ""go ahead and consult a lawyer and take a few days off"". 


This is in complete disregard for the client and family who lost a spouse/mother this week. I menu planned and they spent over $300. on groceries for a memorial celebration of life gathering that I am unable to fulfill now. By contract, I cannot work for this client outside of the agency.


 I'm shaking and frightened for this fragile family. The person I care for is old and under the care of many doctors. I left work today saying see you tomorrow and now tomorrow isn't going to come. I'm just sick over the disregard the agency has for the client. Help me figure out how to cope with this. I feel like it's unethical,  highly insensitive and over kill to my legitimate inquiry.

I was told by a supervisor, not mine but my coworker's supervisor as we are on different shifts, that we will have to do these exercises as many times as it takes til something changes. This all happened because my coworker (43F) won't keep my name out of her mouth because I don't do everything her way and I am getting tired of it, so I complained to her supervisor. The solution that he and HR came up with was for us to have a mediation meeting which I had no idea about until the day of the meeting which was last Tuesday. During this meeting, we were supposed to bring up issues we have with eeach other but I felt pressured and unprepared, so I really didn't stand up for myself or do the best I could do. 
I just don't want to participate because I know nothing will change. Recently tons of people went to HR against this woman for bullying and harassment including me and all she got was a verbal warning which is basically a slap on the wrist.
Is there anyway to convince them that forcing me to do teambuilding exercises with her will not change anything?

For some context I have been working in my current position doing order management for a year & a half. The manager who hired me was fired and subsequently her manager was fired too.

Now currently my department is being run by someone who was brought in from another country to run projects.

He has no experience in what we do and still hasn't familiarized with our department processes despite being here for 8 months so it's very difficult for him to understand what we do around here, he is constantly getting involved in with projects and not handling department affairs.

Our department has been hiring people with higher titles (Senior Specialists) working in our department but they're still new and not that great at the work honestly (some have work ethics issues) and they will continue to do so.

My colleague of mine has raised concern to another senior of mine that the work load distributed is not fair and we should give more to the Senior Specialists.

However the senior said that we should be the one doing more and give the new hires more leniacy despite them already being here for at least 6 months which should be more than enough time to give them more advanced tasks.

She also ""justified"" that the ones who have been working here longer should do more to justify for their promotion which I honestly think is BS.

She wants to promote someone who has been working here around the same time as us but is not performing well despite numerous complains from the team to our previous managers.

It really pisses me off because not only they do not want to hire people with same titles as us (Specialists), not to mentioned that whatever new decisions or plans that they have they do not discuss with us and just lets the information flow around by their own.

Honestly even though the job market is bad right now I feel like I should leave soon without a job and take a break from working...

I don't want to blame people for a lack of direction. The will to act is there, but we need to get organized in order to act as a unified front. Too many distractions in this century (how do you choose which voice to listen to out of a million choices, and hope that others find the ""right"" one too?), and too many con artists, grifters, and snake oil salesmen in office that have eroded the public faith in established political institutions.

We are in dire need of a leader or leaders with principles to present a clear and specific plan for unified action with the ability to spread quickly enough to gain critical mass online, but enough staying power to be perceived as more than a meme.

It must be simple enough to explain and understand to allow for maximum participation, and powerful enough that the message cannot be ignored - that people will choose to participate despite the personal short-term consequences... for the greater good of the 99.9% who share this planet.

We need people to lead who are willing to step up and sacrifice their personal privacy and happiness for the greater good and a life of public service. They would need to allow total transparency into their personal and financial dealings - it's the only way anyone can still establish and maintain real trust in the 21st century.

People are starving (often literally) for honest and transparent leaders who are willing to put the needs of the many ahead of their own. There are people who could step up, who could lead a life of personal sacrifice and thereby lead from integrity to earn and keep the public's trust. But so many who are lucky, smart, or skilled enough to carve out enough of a living that they and their family can live comfortably above the fray choose to continue in living a live for themselves, rooted only in personal ambition.

I can't blame them. Risking one's own personal well-being and stability to organize grassroots action is a lot to ask, and would represent an enormous burden to bear for the rest of one's life. And there's absolutely no guarantee of success. You may even go to prison or suffer very serious personal losses for your trouble if you sufficiently rock the boat. And this is why just about the only people who slither into public office these days (with very few exceptions) were only in it to sell out from the get-go.

But real change only happens with sacrifice. With people crazy or fanatical enough to say with conviction, ""My life is not my own. I am dedicating my life to a chance at making life for those who come after me marginally better."" Not many people are willing to take that deal. But this is how every pivotal social revolution in the history of mankind ever started. With people willing to sacrifice - to take as their only consolation the dream of a brighter future they may never see.

Great things come from small beginnings."

I found a job to help get by.
When I took it, it was less pay than I was making but like I have always heard “you can’t get a job unless you have one.”
During the interviews and bs I was told there would be a contribution from the employer of 8% for a 403b if I contributed it. I’d be eligible in a year.
Fast forward a year, I’m finally eligible and guess what “the company” stopped contributing citing financial issues. During this time they quit filling positions and laid people off. While I get shit happens and you have to adjust my question is more about how they are selling new positions to potential employees? They have the “8% match” statement still in the job posting. 
Is this legal?

The managers would even talk bad about me for the minor mistakes that I made while I was new there despite the fact that I apologized and corrected the problem after I was told that I made a mistake. Anyways when the semester started things had gotten worse the first thing that happened was cutting off my hours. I was originally working 24 hours a week to only 7 hours a week for the first two weeks of the semester. I work as an Assistant while class is in session and when I first did the interview for this job they said when the semester starts, I would be getting around 30 hours a week 5 days a week. But that was a huge lie since I only got 7 hours at first then I got 15 hours. I do have some remote classes that I do which are kind of like work from home. The problem is after the first week of classes starting, I stopped showing up pissed off that I was only getting 7 hours a week I did go in the first day to see how it was and it was garbage it takes me over an hour to get to the college and after class I decided fuck this I'm out of here. After that the first week to the third week I tried calling and emailing my manager trying to have a talk about this to see if I can get more hours since I didn't sign up to only work 7 hours a week and only three days at first and he basically never emailed me or called me back regarding this. The crazy thing is at the third week He finally started to give me more classes that are remote. I actually started to work those because I can work from home and despite it only being for an hour or two depending on the class it's easy work. The only issue is that I can't punch in my hours since my timesheet for my college says that employees have to do punch in and out with a physical one in-person. Problem is that I am not going in-person and I'm doing everything remote, and I already missed my pay period despite trying to punch in the hours that. 

I worked. It's already week 8 of classes and somehow my manager hasn't reached out to me. What are my options in this situation also can I still get paid even if I miss my pay period. I have worked in several colleges in the past and they would allow you to punch in and out online but for some reason this college doesn't allow you if you're not a full-time worker.

others you have to work and give everything to the community to keep it going worry free.

This particular one is a large house all guys who just game all day. They don't pay bills or groceries or have to work just keep everything clean, although I heard one guy works 9 hours a week just to get out the house and gives  all his earnings to help with property tax.

One of the guys got sick and passed away, he was their handyman as well.so a slots open and I was invited learned a lot about fixing homes from dad, my reservation is:

I'm 22 female, I will be only female there
I travel a lot for work, and own a condo fully paid for.

I very much like the idea of never having to work again and being responsibility free. But I feel awkward cause Ill be the only female, and I might be taking the opportunity from someone not as well off as me.

4,2024-02-25,Been feeling so discouraged going into work lately after what my boss said to me ,u/Apexpred1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1azykln/been_feeling_so_discouraged_going_into_work/,antiwork,"TLDR; newer boss seems annoyed that told her a coworker continues to be rude to me, asked me if I wanted to demote myself cause she thinks I’m getting stressed out. Feel so disheartened after hearing that. Should I try to move past this or look into leaving-Advice? 

Background: Been at this job 4yrs now, 2yrs ago we went through a mass staff shortage; pretty much only myself and one other person stayed and our boss promoted us to trainers when we finally got new hires. (I have no real power I help train and act as a resource but not really their boss or supervisor). Things were going good well enjoy the job, ok money, it’s a nonprofit and I do like that we get to help people-I used to image staying here long term.

Anyways that boss who promoted me and made me feel appreciated retire last year. This new boss isn’t mean per se, but when I’ve gone to her she usually never backs me up or looks into what I’m saying is true.

For months I had multiple negative interactions with a coworker who gives me uncessary attitude and is just plain me. Tried my best to ignore her but when antagonizes me out of nowhere-and I shouldn’t have to feel miserable because of one person (also other coworkers have mentioned she’s a bit of a bully too but they never speak up) 

I’ve brought up our interactions to my boss before and she usually tells me to kill her w/kindness but last time I told my boss she said **are you happy in your role?** **you can demote yourself if you’d like** . **feels like you complain a lot and stress yourself out**

I was so hurt that a demotion was her first thought? Like not speak to the other coworker or offer us some mediation? Not only that she also said **you didn’t have to apply for your position right, it was kinda just forced onto you?** . That was so insulting my former boss promoted me cause I knew how to do every and was fit to train new people, and she asked me I could’ve said no; I didn’t need a formal application. I hate that she was implying I wasn’t qualified and that my position was just handed to me…cuz there is another trainer here who also didn’t apply yet he’s not being questioned. 

Also demoting myself wouldn’t even solve my problem I went to her about. I’m good at my job I guess I just squeaked the wheel too much  and didn’t keep it about the work. Trust me, I will never go to her about a personal conflict again cause she clearly doesn’t want to deal with it. Anyways when I see her she still says hi and acts nice and I have to fake a hi back. I just feel so embarrassed and hurt working here know cuase it feels like she thinks so little of me. Past weeks I go home crying almost daily thinking about this interaction often or even on the car ride to/from. 

Should I continue to work for someone who said that to me cause I really have a hard time being in the same room as her. I really do like the job itself and there’s not another one like this in the area but I don’t care if she still acts nice, it’s so hard to face her that memory is constantly on my mind.

Well I just got a text from one of the managers I was/am friends with (she is no doubt being coerced to text me in the GM’s place) saying our GM wants to know if I can come in for $50 tonight because they’re desperate.

Sooo many cliques here. Majority are kids and they don't give a damn, they are all servers and take the order and then go in the back to chat or get on their phones. The bussers and runners end up doing most of work and they get paid less. 

The restaurant has been short staffed and the manager of that place decided to have me there. He put me as a busser, not server. I was okay since I need hours and kinda hard to get a job nowadays. All of their 3 bussers quit. Their runner ended up walking out because he was getting 0 help from the servers to run food for 10 people.

The manager keeps praising me saying I am such a superstar and doing an amazing job. I know he is trying to manipulate me. He started scheduling me for double shifts saying I am just fantastic. Then he pushed me to be the new food runner. I decided to accept so I won't deal with the cliques as much. It gets crazy.

I'm a woman and carry that big tray and no guy helps. I ask the servers to bring the rest of a big order and they don't do it and say they forgot. The guests are asking me for stuff that the servers didn't give like condiments or drinks. Some of the servers get mad when asking for help and then the chef comes to help. 


My shift today has been the same crazy. Started at 8am, they keep me late until 3pm and have to punch in back at 4pm."

The best I can hope for is a quiet day I forget about as soon as it ends.

If there isn't some stupid change that will cause more or angrier people to contact us, there are internal changes that make working even worse.

I have no education, I have been doing customer service for over 5 years. This is long enough that nobody sees anything else in me. Speak with recruiters and they give me 100s of customer service jobs to apply for, ask for anything not CS related and it's like I'm blocked.

I don't see any way out of this.

I live in a 1 bedroom with a gf in similar situation, together we make just enough to get by together but nothing else. This means I can't afford to study instead of, or go down to part time. Being abused leaves little energy to ""improve myself"" on the evening.

I'm looking at admin roles and they pay even less than customer service. It's all a scam because they know it's worth the pay cut to not have to deal with the general public. I could try getting away from customers and maybe save my sanity, but that might mean I can't afford living anymore.

There is no play I can make to win. I can only look for options where I lose the least.

I work as a head of department in a gym. My boss has asked that all the heads of department (HOD) stay late 1x day a week till 6:30pm on a weekday. Usually I'd be ok with this as they let me adjust my hours so I finish up earlier on another day, but my priority is not work, it's my daughter who's nearly 2. My work commute is about 45 mins. My Daughter goes to bed at 7:30pm. Essentially this means if I do the later night, I'll only see my daughter for 15mins max. Being frank, I'm just not prepared to do this. 

A bit more context, I'm currently looking for another job because I don't like the current gig that much. So I don't feel driven to go ""above and beyond"". The 3 other HOD's have agreed to do late nights, so I feel a bit bad being the only one who hasn't agreed to a day so far. The night I offered was Monday alternating fortnightly (I play DND every other week and it's the only hobby I've kept since having a kid). They said we already have coverage on Monday and need either Tue or Wed covered. My partner goes to a dance class on Tue and Wed at 8:30pm, it wouldn't be super convenient for her, but it does mean I could do these days, I just really don't want to. 

How do I tell my boss, who I have a good relationship with, that I don't want to do this?"

I got an email from the owner of the company asking me to fill out two timed assessments. I completed both and then he asked for a phone interview. That was about an hour long with his wife, who told me they fired the last person after a month because she lacked a positive attitude, had personal life trouble that caused her to miss 4 days, and didn’t know how to use excel. She liked me and said she was going to pass me along to the next round which would be a zoom interview with her husband. Here are the highlights of that hour long interview:

- schedule is 8-5, if you are on time you are considered late, so must always arrive early. Just because it’s 5 doesn’t mean you just clock out and go home
- always answer phone by third ring
- there will be room to grow and can eventually be the head of HR, or marketing, or COO one day
- weekly one on one meetings to discuss personal and professional goals
- each morning make a list of what I will work on including when each task will be completed and share with him, if I need more time I must let him know and not miss any deadlines but request an extension
- on mondays eat lunch with the team
- he will suggest books that I must read in my personal time
- have a positive and high energy attitude  at all times

It ended with him liking me and wanting to move forward. He said I needed to provide 3 past supervisors for reference checks and if that went well then he would schedule me to come interview in person and spend half the day at the office interviewing with everyone in the office and doing trial exercises of answering the phone and stuff. 

He sent my references 30 minute calendar invites. One talked to him this weekend and called me afterward to tell me spoke mostly about himself and his work history. He asked her about my emotional intelligence and what my salary was. I felt very put off when she told me about it. I think asking all of them for 30 minute calls is excessive. 

I’m so conflicted because I’ve been looking for a new job for over a year and it feels like I’m FINALLY getting somewhere but I’m starting to get scared that I’m ignoring red flags. Please give me your opinion on this situation!!!"

You need to be well liked too.,u/Kerubiin,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b074hq/just_being_good_at_your_job_is_not_enough_to_get/,antiwork,"My coworker recently ranted to me about how he was being overlooked for promotions even though he was good at what he does, while his team member got the promotion instead.  The role is a managerial position. Lead Designer that would be in charge of the team and reporting to the department head. It was an hour long rant about how people who are actually contributing to the company gets snubbed while only ‘sycophants’ and ‘yes men’ gets promotions.

Of course, a large part of what my coworker missed out on during his rant was that his team member who got the promotion instead of him is very well liked in the company, and is absolutely not just a ‘sycophant’. He takes the effort to get to know everyone in the company, remembers and brings up details shared during casual conversations and is generally personable and charismatic.

On the other hand, the one whining about how unfair everything is, while objectively good at what he does, does not take the effort to befriend his coworkers in the office. He avoids having lunch with colleagues on the days we come back to the office, avoids going out for any after work events, barely talks to anyone other than people he absolutely has to. That’s not a great way to get people to like you and notice your contribution to the company.

As much as we hate to admit it, how you are perceived is just as, if not more, important than how good you are at your job. If a tree falls in the forest and there’s no one around to hear it, did it make a sound? Even if you did a buttload of work and contributed massively to the company, but no one actually knows what you’ve done and barely know anything about you in general, how do you expect to get noticed for your work?

I mean, if you’re just there for a paycheck and can’t be bothered trying to climb the corporate ladder, then whatever, you do you. But if actually want to hustle for that promotion, pay raise or bonus, then you have to amiable and actually make yourself standout in not just your work but socially as well."
3,2024-02-25,Is my HR job a red flag? Or should I stay and learn?,u/blursothong,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b076b1/is_my_hr_job_a_red_flag_or_should_i_stay_and_learn/,antiwork,"Hey everyone, I'm from Singapore here. To give context to my work experience situation, I worked a 1-year contract job from 2022 to 2023 but I chose not to renew because I didn't particularly enjoy my job scope

I then spent the next 8 months searching for jobs until I eventually got a HR role as a recruitment consultant.

As of this post, I have been in this role for close to 2 months and I don't know if I made the right choice being here. There are problems which I feel are red flags but I would love to seek advice from this community and have a bigger perspective on whether these are actually problems. So I'm pretty new to the workforce.

To give context, this recruitment firm is a startup and we are 10 employees strong, split into 3 teams. 

First off, I had some unpleasant experiences working with a senior colleague from another team. He has a very strong personality and he doesn't like his time being wasted. If he tells you something once or twice he won't tell it again. I found out recently that he's been giving me work when he's not authorised to do so. So it's on me for not realising it on my own. But during the time when I haven't realised it, he said that I couldn't go home on a half day unless I managed to find 2 more candidates to interview. I haven't been able to do my job properly because I don't fully understand the procedures and I get scolded by him a lot.

And the reason why I haven't been able to do my job properly is also because of a lack of guidance from my direct supervisor. Apparently there are operational guides stored in our company shared drive but I didn't know their existence until I asked and someone else pointed me to it. My manager couldn't even tell me during my first week, is this normal or am I supposed to know these things intuitively?

So I also found out a few weeks ago that my direct supervisor is resigning, which could explain his attitude in managing me? And when I look at the track record, he's the fourth employee to have left within 1 year (I have never met the other three, but after checking their LinkedIn profile, they left the company in 6 months)

This situation leads me to be the most senior employee on my team (imagine that, being only around for 2 months). And a new guy just joined my team last week and I don't even know how to properly guide him if he has questions.

Plus, my boss wants me to expand our recruitment services into Australia. He wants me to do market research and find ways to promote the Australian working lifestyle because he wants to help these Australian companies find staff. So apparently I'm not just a HR recruiter, but I'm also a marketer now. I somehow have to brainstorm ideas (i.e. design posters, make videos, connect with people) to promote these Australian jobs. And I'm the only one in charge of doing this.

So I feel like I'm overworked without any proper guidance as to how to perform well. Is there something I'm overlooking or should I think of leaving?"

Since I have time taking a better look at myself and my life so far, apart from the closet of clothes and my phone and laptop I don't own anything.

I worked on a food truck. I felt like the conversations I had with the other 2 people that are in charge wasn't taken seriously.  I could fully understand if someone could take offense to my words, and I am ok with that because I am sticking up for what I believe in. I have shut my mouth on too many things in the past when it comes to this type of political ranting.

I will say me finally not putting up with something that I fully disagree with was truly invigorating, even though it cost me my shitty job.

 So in the burger king I work our general manager has been doing this stupid schedule were there 2 people on the kitchen, a manager and only 1 cashier, this should be a problem right? well most of the time the general manager sends one of the kitchen guys to break because of the ""lay work"" of course the place overflow like 2 minutes later and we can do nothing about other than suffer. Of course he offers us a solution maximize sales by selling cookies. Every time anyone doesn't mentions the cookies in the other he will say some like ""remember offering the cookies"" multiple times, but even if we do it that doesn't make more than $10 in daily selling. Almost all the employees are tired of being always understaffed, but rather than fixing it he doesn't care. 

I should also clarify in burger king standards there must be at least 3 crew members in the front: Drive thru, bagging area and front cashier. while in ours there only 1 to do those 3 things plus cleaning and restocking. 

Also he lies telling us we never accomplish the selling goals, when other managers shows us how we actually accomplish those goals."

A major reason I became disgruntled and chose to work for CPS (I actually enjoyed working with families to come up with solutions to problems, contrary to popular misconceptions we just love taking away kids, we don’t), was due to many folks being set up to fail. 

I was the only male in an office. As such, it fell on me to supervise numerous folks evacuate bodily fluids into a cup, and then test for illegal substances. In my state, weed is illegal and thus, can result in jail time depending on what some algorithm from COMPAS (which is a private system that has not been forced to release said algorithm) tells us to do. So, needless to say, I didn’t really enjoy this as it became clear what was going on. It became even more clear when a coworker asked if one of her clients tested positive for “anything.” I said, “No, he was clean.” Coworker: Did you watch him go into the cup? Me: Yeah, I did what I was supposed to do. Coworker: Dammit, I wanted to start revocation of his probation. 

This entire system isn’t made to help folks really integrate in society. When I actually did try, coworkers actually complained about what I was doing. I really wanted to help folks start over and do better. None of their previous POs actually wanted to try. It’s sad to see many were revoked when they could’ve just been given more time to integrate. 

I’m not referring to violent folks or sex offenders, rather, I’m talking about folks who were caught with possession or something along those lines. 

If you’re an offender, know your own rights and don’t be afraid to call out the bullshit. Also, don’t let your employer bully you into saying they will call your PO and make life hard. Advocate for yourself. Try to stay on the good side of the law, don’t re-offend, get treatment. 

This is my advice, but figured it might help at least one person.

Ok and also the way she said it like why do my managers only focus on what’s wrong always and hardly ever say anything positive about anyone’s work. This is kind of a classic example… went above and beyond to provide comprehensive summary and only thing focused on was what is wrong with it. 

Constructive feedback is great when it’s used in a kind way and focusing on negatives rather than positives about an employees work is so bad for morale.

If I was supervisor I would have sent an email and replied to the call summary and said something like “thank you this is excellent analysis and really appreciate the good work. For next time please change the style ever so slightly. Please see an example attached. Keep up the great work!”

Also after I said oh I think it’s actually well written she did say yes it is the best one she has seen out of everyone. Why not say this first without me having to defend myself??

*in training I never actually was given an example of how a call summary should be done so firstly having one to reference for structure would be very helpful. 

This was the case for A LOT of things in this toxic office with training such as emails… they would come over and tell me off for doing something wrong but I was never actually trained on how to do it and had to make my own templates because I wasn’t trained on it and the way they gave this feedback was as if they were enjoying the power….

I’ll explain what it is now (English is not my first language, and not even my second ;): when you work as someone whose response speed is not related to responsibility for people’s lives or their safety (i.e. not a policeman, firefighter, nuclear power plant operator ;), but ANY most insignificant task is presented as URGENT AND VERY IMPORTANT. 

For example - “URGENTLY! Move the frozen chicken to another shelf!”, or - “URGENTLY! Turn over the “open” sign! 

An example from personal experience when I worked in a private company - one day I was setting up a device (costing as much as the CEO's annual salary) and my project manager called me demanding that I drop everything (and potentially ruin the device) and run to the office - because that she lost one email I sent her.

So that should've been my first clue (DUH)
Our company is constantly teetering the edge of getting their contract breached.

We wear uniforms. They aren't too strict on it as long as we wear all black to match said uniforms. 

However there had been a couple times I had to cover shifts during our annual major repair week.

I was wearing said uniform from the waist down but wore a gray hoodie instead of black because the shifts were unexpected.

ALL my coworkers complained about it. But for some reason we're so stuck on the fact that I was apparently wearing a whole gray sweat outfit. Which I was honest about the hoodie mistake and kept denying the pants.

They made such a big deal of the damn pants I was getting threatened with write ups. 
I'm 100000% positive I've NEVER worn sweatpants to work. 
Arguing with a bunch of adults about the kind of pants I NEVER EVEN WORE to work is so gosh dang frustrating.

I've seen people even my own boss show up in BLUE JEANS or whatever the crap they want cause they were told to come in unexpectedly. Yet MY ass is on the line.

Someone literally was manning the job site alone and abandoned it without coverage and got a slap on the wrist yet I get write ups! Lesson learned don't work in sexist environments.

Of course healthcare comes with its own bag of shit to sift through lol. For me, i work in what’s considered kind of a shitty entry-level healthcare job, depending on how you look at it (it’s sterile processing). 

Over the past 2 and a half years I’ve worked at good facilities, and unfortunately my last 2 before my current one, 2 very, very toxic facilities. Actually I’ll say my last facility.. really fucked me up mentally. And no, not because of the work, honestly, i truly enjoy the work i do for this job and am truly satisfied by it. But.. there were a couple people at that facility and including the manager themselves that have made my orientation there so unbearable and honestly treated me like shit, no matter how good i was doing. They also tormented the other people on that day shift who weren’t the manager’s “favorites”. 

Those regular people reassured me my orientation would be fine and they couldn’t fuck with me, i know what im doing, i was doing fine. Of course, my trainers were those 2 “favorites”, and although they were nice to my face (and I honestly didn’t talk to them very extensively… I didn’t invoke any type of reason for them to do what they did to me..), they would constantly lie to the manager about my progress. Sometimes they would berate me on tasks that I already know how to do, of course I did them how they told me, but they were definitely those kind of “know-it-alls” that acted like everything you did was wrong. (Despite signing off my orientation binder that was a checklist of competencies for the job….) Of course the manager doesn’t care, those are her best friends, so she talked to HR and found a way to fire me out of nowhere. After 2 and a half months of wasted time and orientation and honestly just being treated like shit and defamed. I didn’t think that would happen. Thus, I spent a month unemployed and decided to travel (in sterile processing).

I’m not gonna explain all the schematics of travel sterile processing techs, but just know we don’t make as much money as travel nurses. We make “okay” money, but not enough to truly make a plentiful profit like travel nursing does. All I’m gonna say is during those torturous 2 months, I was on the horizon of deciding going back to college for radiology. After the mistreatment from a facility before that one, and receiving the even WORSE mistreatment at this one, I decided to go on that path (before getting fired out of nowhere).

I guess now I’m in a weird spot. I know it sounds like I hate my job. I kind of do. But not because of the job. That last facility truly made me feel like shit. It fucked up my mental health. I almost became homeless. I felt like I wasn’t a good enough tech (despite my credentials, my experience and my many references). They made me doubt this job and if I really was fit for healthcare altogether. I guess now I feel like I’m an imposter. I’m scared if I spend all my time and money going through rad tech school will I also meet more bitchy techs that want to compromise my job even though I don’t fucking provoke them at all. I know I have to consider sterile processing is considered bottom of the barrel to many hospitals. Most sterile processing managers think they can just replace us with another Mcdonald’s worker (no hate) because we’re replaceable. I would hope nursing, radiology, etc. and any other accredited profession that requires a degree wouldn’t allow you to get kicked so easily unless you truly did something wrong. I know there’s truly miserable people in every job, healthcare especially, but I guess I have this irrational fear that even if I try to stay out of drama, and not provoke anything, I can still have something like that happen to me. So, I don’t know how to feel right now, besides being severely depressed. 

It’s been a long 6 months, I haven’t really seen my family nor my own fucking house for more than 5 days. I’m trying to enjoy travel but as a sterile processing tech you just can’t, our schedules are shit, and all you do where you travel to is work. (What I mean is you can’t explore where you travel to, because why travel all that way from home and not explore the new place you’re residing in? Sterile processing techs don’t have time to do that. Not with our typical 9-5 schedules. Sometimes with call and overtime.)

I’m trying to do my pre-reqs online while doing this too, and it’s just a lot. I’m fucking tired and I feel like a failure. And yet I don’t really want to quit pursuing radiology. I shadowed the job (before I got fired) and I fucking loved it. It totally seemed like something I could do. The road just seems so long. And the trauma from working my last hospital has just been getting to me. I hope if I ever get there I don’t get fired and lied about by other miserable bitches for literally no reason at all. And don’t ask about unions, I live in the South. That’s a fucking pipe dream over here unfortunately for our hospitals."

2,2024-02-26,Confusion regarding people's feelings around what is work. ,u/Silverlisk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b0g6te/confusion_regarding_peoples_feelings_around_what/,antiwork,"When I was young (quite some time ago now), I had a friend who did care work. It was a government job, NHS. 

The pay wasn't great, but I was curious about the role so I asked her for a breakdown of what her role entailed and she told me she was assigned to a specific person, we'll call her Mary. Mary needed meals brought to her, drinks made for her, adult diapers changing, moved around to avoid bedsores, shopping done for her, meds managed and constant company for just in case situations (and that someone else would come in to wash her). 

Everyone around her thought really well of her, commented on how nice she was for caring for Mary and what a great person she was. 

Fast forward a bit until my grandpa got dementia and my father got cancer shortly after my grandma had passed away suddenly. I left my job due to a mental breakdown where I made several attempts at my own life, but that parts not important. What I decided to do, given I wasn't working, was take care of my grandpa and my father, they both needed help with everything listed at my friend's job, on top of which I had to change my dad's dressings (chemo on throat), monitor him to prevent drinking (he was an alcoholic), but my mother washed my grandpa, I tried to wash my father, but he was having none of it and wouldn't let anyone else either plus wouldn't do it himself (he eventually went from sepsis probably due to this). 

Whilst I was doing that, I claimed from the government for their care, far less than what my friend was paid and yet people insulted me for not having ""a real job"" and accused me of using them as an excuse not to work. 

Fast forward some more to just after they both passed on, I met my current partner, who is autistic, has adhd and quite severe hidradenitis suppurativa, plus arthritis in both hands and knees so has to use a cane for support and sometimes cannot walk at all, I took on caring duties for her. I do everything I used to do for my father and grandpa (except swap out adult diapers for mountains of underwear cleaning/changing and medical pads), but also now have to take care of the home we live in, all cleaning, cooking etc etc. 

People still act like I don't work, like I don't deserve the meager amount of money I get for caring for her from the government even though it's still less than working in care work. 

I just don't understand their view. Does the signing of a contract really change all that much? The funds come from the same place, I get less of them and the only times I get any sort of a ""holiday"" are when friends or family agree to look after her for set periods of times which only happens on her birthday (sometimes) or at Christmas (again, not every year, only sometimes).

6,2024-02-26,"Starbucks Switzerland Accident Insurance Denies  Workplace Injury, Claiming it was ""No Accident""",u/sugartea63,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b0gdpl/starbucks_switzerland_accident_insurance_denies/,antiwork,"Long story short, I was hired as a barista in Starbucks Switzerland with the understanding and written documentation that I can not and should not lift things over a certain weight. They made me anyway despite my pain. One day it hurt too badly. I begged multiple times to switch jobs. I was told to keep going. I had been threatened with being fired if I couldn't ""do my job."" So I did what I was told. I was crying, but I continued the heavy lifting. I ripped a muscle, which is made worse by my spinal osteo-arthritis. 

Its now 5 months after the accident, and my back is still searing in daily pain unlike anything I've ever dealt with before. As of now, Starbucks HR has ghosted me. The shift supervisor who did this to me has avoided any consequences (to my knowledge). Helsana, the Starbucks accident insurance, paid for 4 months and then suddenly said jk, we're sending you and your private health insurance all the bills. They say they won't pay since my injury WASN'T AN ACCIDENT. Now there are 5 months worth of doctors visits, medicines, physio-therapy appointments...all for me, a poverty-level student, to pay. I am fighting their decision but feeling hopeless. Hopeless and in such constant physical pain...Just thought I'd share."
1,2024-02-26,Told a coworker she put me in therapy ,u/LeaveTheGTaketheC,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b0gj39/told_a_coworker_she_put_me_in_therapy/,antiwork,"I have a boomer coworker whose main role is to gossip. I’ve been her sounding board for the last four years while working from home—she literally calls me for every single thing, despite us both having separate jobs. It’s become a running joke among others that if I’m marked as “busy” on Teams, it’s because I’m talking to her.

Over the years, her calls have been sporadic, and I never know why or when she’ll call. Typically, she prefaces the call with “I need help” (despite being the top performer in our department for three years in a row) and then proceeds to ask for help with a basic process that she should know after being with the company for 12 years. She is 30 years my senior and I believe she latched onto me because I’m technically her team lead. I often feel guilty if I don’t answer her calls, but I should mention that when she calls, it’s not just about work. She starts off saying it’s about work, but then dives into personal or work-related gossip. She frequently calls me crying about how she’s treated at home or at work. This has caused me massive anxiety because, as a team lead, I’m torn between answering her calls or not.

Last week, I was informed that she had been spoken to because she cornered another coworker for 45 minutes after work, gossiping about work matters. Another coworker supported the complaint, prompting our manager to address the issue with her. She called me on Friday morning, saying she’s no longer going to be friends with those coworkers because she was reprimanded. At that point, I cut her off and told her that I’m in therapy because of her and that I often wake up with panic attacks several nights a week due to her actions, such as calling me randomly or crying, requiring me to console her on work and professional matters. I told her that from now on, I can only discuss actual work-related topics with her.

We’ll see if she calls today, but I spent the weekend on edge, and my boyfriend even said it’s like I’m ending an abusive relationship, so it’ll take time. We are working in a hybrid model, going to the office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, but I’m hoping she gets the point. Additionally, when I mentioned I’m in therapy, she asked who I go to. It’s astonishing—talk about narcissism. This situation has reached a boiling point. I’m not one to cause drama. Notably, she’s friends with our boss outside of work, but our manager has told her to keep her mouth shut before but she still does what she does. I hope she takes this seriously and considers retiring. For today, my hope is that she respects the boundaries I established on Friday and refrains from calling me and we’ll see if she’s still in the lead if she no longer gets any help. "

you know you’re gonna spend all night shitting yourself: will you get a crazy fine? be sent to prison? jesus dude, you got a minor drunk! any idea what they’d do to you online? and then behind bars?

there’s only one solution: you go over and get drunk with them.  

wake up too hungover to work.

get fired.

it’ll be summer holidays soon, and this is the first place those lads will come. your new friends, with pocket money to piss up a wall. your new friends, with their useless school exam results. they’ll be lucky to get shop work, where they’ll probably get fired and/or fined themselves.

A year and a half in, and the definition of being on-call has suddenly changed. 

Now, on-call just means that you have to respond to work incidents QUICKLY. Everyone is required to respond to them during off-hours, but the on-call person has to do it the fastest.

We have a few prep fridges around the workspace that can double function as counters. We keep 80% of the materials we use for these meals in those fridges.

One of the styrofoam inserts for one of the prep fridges was taken out and set onto the counter where we usually place items that are going into the compost (food is piled away from prep counters). Having been taken out before I arrived for my night shift, I gave it a quick glance over while I had a second to see why it was out. On one of the ends of the styrofoam was a bit of black mold.

I asked my manager what we were doing with the insert, and he said he was just going to put it back into the fridge. I said no, because there's mold on it. He flat out denied the presence of mold and asked to see it. I passed it to him with the moldy side up so he could see it, only for him to flip it around and still feign ignorance. I told him to flip it and he saw the mold, and just went 'oh, huh.'

Asked him what we were going to do. 'We'll just cut it off and put it back in the fridge.' Doesn't work like that. There's mold. If it's on the Styrofoam, it's in the fridge.

After having another employee come over to confirm it was mold and agree it was disgusting, manager relented and said to throw it out. As I was throwing it out he stood by and said 'Yayyy, your doing something!' Came back a few minutes later to make comments about 'mold under my mother's toes'. My mother's dead and its a sensitive topic, but I just took it as him being a bit of a piss baby that the minimum wage part timer proved him wrong.

After that I got my hours cut back from 2-3 shifts a week to 1 shift, and that shift is typically only 4 hours long, even on days where I am available after university earlier. Only time he relented was for two weeks last month after someone snitched that I brought up going to another job."

Over the next several of decades AI and robots will take the majority of jobs. There may still be a few niche jobs that humans still do but that will be the minority. The replacement has already started AI is already able to automate certain tasks and thousands of people have already lost their jobs. It will become cheaper and more cost effective to have AI and robots do our jobs. And we all know corporations would be more than happy to fire us so they can save a penny. 

Ai and robots taking our jobs does not have to be scary. We can advocate for a world where people can center their lives around their passions and the people they care about instead of work. Where everyone is given what they need to not only live but to also thrive. But, we need to be involved and work on making systemic changes so that way people do not have to suffer and lose everything because human labor is no longer necessary.

I am curious to see what others have to say on this topic. We really need to have more conversations about technology and the future because this will impact everyone."

Overall, I thought I was doing a good job, besides the lack of direction from my boss (who works remotely.) Today, I was told to go meet my boss in HR’s office. 

My internship was originally extended until August, right around the time I graduated. Mind you, I did not have marketing experience before this. I only had a little bit of social media experience and some retail experience. So anyway, they told me that for their next fundraiser, they are looking for someone with project management skills who has a better sense of urgency, organizational skills, and communication. I was let go effective immediately. I did not find donation pickups to be urgent, especially when I was not communicated with on if they were urgent or not. I just thought that they needed picked up before we packaged them. There was a complete lack of communication between my boss and I. Then, they kept a running list of things I was doing wrong without bringing them up to me at all. I did not know what I was doing wrong the whole time. I thought I was doing okay. I helped them raise $2,000 in donations.

I am not wanting to pursue marketing, but I guess this is just a learning experience. I think I need to have my learning disabilities documented so they can’t be used against me. I get frazzled and have ADHD. I guess I should have just told my boss that I need very clear, precise instruction. Not 100 emails of different tasks and then getting mad that I forgot a few. Idk.

I had an eGift card. The employees couldn't figure out how to use the eGift card at the register. The manager tried also and it didn't work. And when I say they tried, they really put effort into it. They clicked every button possible, scanned the card on my phone in the app, tried scanning multiple times, etc.

When I came in, there was no line. As they tried repeatedly to get the gift card working, a line started building up behind me. The manager even called the owner on the phone and that's when things went sideways. I could hear the manager talk to the owner on the phone. The owner clearly could not be bothered to help and did not care. Manager eventually hung up with no solution. Manager tells me I am the third one today and they just changed the app and it didn't work for gift cards.

The manager ends up charging me the full amount to my debit card and hands me cash for the amount of the gift card. Cool. Except... as I put the money in my pocket I see the manager close her wallet and realize she paid me cash from her purse!

I was floored! I asked if she was going to reimburse herself from the register and she said no. I asked if the owner would pay her back as it wasn't right and she just smiled and started helping the next people in line. I tried to give the cash back, as I obviously didn't want her money. She wouldn't take it back and just said that she was trying not to walk out.

I contacted the corporate office. I wanted them to reimburse this manager not just what she paid me, but whatever she paid any other customers as this obviously happened more than once. Corporate didn't respond for 2 weeks. I kept contacting them, and they eventually sent me some generic copy paste answer about how to redeem a gift card.

What the hell kind of place to work is this where an employee pays cash out of their wallet because the damn register doesn't work right and the owner doesn't care? And neither does corporate? I felt sick. I'm not ever going back there.

He has an office, with a door, yet insists on sitting through a series of conference calls on speaker-phone...with his door open.  Occasionally he will take a stroll through the office, which is usually mercifully quiet, still with his conference call blaring away on his cell phone for all to hear.  He does this for business and personal calls.  Phone man seems to have no idea he grates on people's nerves with his obliviousness.  I've thought of gifting him a bluetooth headset, but I'm cheap.

1,2024-02-26,Should this be allowed or even normal in any workplace? ,u/illinoishockey,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b0unyt/should_this_be_allowed_or_even_normal_in_any/,antiwork,"I spent almost three months working for a pizza restaurant, but the hours were part-time and no full-time hours existed, unless you were the kitchen manager and the general manager. Working here I felt that the work was easy compared to other restaurant jobs where management is pretty hard on their staff, but not at that particular pizza restaurant. The working environment is pretty lax, no pressure, consistency, and no trace of any elements of workplace toxicity, unless the owner comes in and starts complaining about how much lettuce was in the salad and other nonsense, but nothing too serious. 

It was almost the month of December and the kitchen manager received a resume from an applicant who worked in a handful of pizza restaurants in another city, but these jobs didn’t last long when I took a look at the resume out of curiosity after the kitchen manager expressed how he “wanted this guy” and at the time I didn’t think much of it because it was a replacement hire for someone moving out of the country and had three weeks left. 

However, I started a shift and a guy who I didn’t recognize was behind me and I had no idea that it was the new pizza cook, but when I discovered it was the new pizza cook it was going to cause some problems with everyone’s hours. However, mine were the hardest hit out of everyone else as a shift was canceled on me with short notice by text under the reason of “accidentally overstaffed with the new guy coming in” and although I was mad, I let it go. 

Upon leaving my next shift, I was told that I wouldn’t be working the following day or a shift later in the week to make way for the new pizza cook, which also bumped one of the other pizza cooks to the dishpit. It was obvious that my shifts were taken away from me and given to that particular staff member who was displaced as a pizza cook. 

After having my shifts canceled, I texted the kitchen manager explaining that this was unfair and how the new guy was brought in too soon, which bumped this particular staff member to the dishpit full-time. I wanted to resolve the manner out of fair play in a meeting with the kitchen manager and the owner in person, but within minutes of the meeting I learned that I was no longer working there and of course I was really upset about the decision because it was unfair and the kitchen manager made this remark about talking back to employers, although I was defending myself because I felt singled out. The kitchen manager then accused me of guilt-tripping and I then told the kitchen manager to go f-himself and then told him that a dumb decision was made by bringing in the new pizza cook too soon. The owner intervened and explained that it takes a lot of training to be a pizza cook and the displaced pizza cook was still a pizza cook, but I told the owner that I wasn’t an idiot and I knew exactly what was going on and my unceremonious termination was premeditated and the kitchen manager then said three times that it wasn’t true and I was a disruption to the business. I had nothing else to say and I angrily gathered my belongings, shook hands with the owner, and completely ignored the kitchen manager. 

I later learned that my termination caused some drama with some disagreeing with it. I had to group chat with the staff members to explain my termination and not to believe everyone you hear from the kitchen manager. I was not allowed back at the pizza restaurant as a customer because the kitchen manager was not comfortable. I then learn that my hours were given to the displaced pizza cook because of rent and that being bumped down to the dishpit actually happened. Upon hearing this I was pretty angry and it screamed entitlement and favoritism and then it resorted to text the kitchen manager expressing that the whole thing was out of fair play. I never got a response because I think the truth hurts…

I work as a cashier in a grocery store. This is not my first job pick but the only full year job for my age.

The store really isn’t that great. The hours got cut a lot (legally I can work 18) I went from usually about 14-16 to being lucky with 10. I really need the money as I’m saving up for my own car since my parents can’t help out. No holiday pay or even discounts and only real benefits are if you’re full time (a lot of employees are teens who can’t work full time). 

The staff are pretty okay so it’s not that bad with them, but I think overall the store is not a great environment. Breaks are really weird for timing. You are always going to get at least a 15 minute break no matter what, so on week days I work 2.5 hours and get a 15 minute break, but also days I work 6 I get 15 minute breaks. Since I work early mornings, my breaks are usually at 10, when the store isn’t even busy. Two hours into my shift is when my break is, at a not busy time, so I’m working 4 hours of the busiest time in the store. For 8 hour shifts you get two 30 minute breaks. 

Scheduling is horrible and on days that aren’t so busy there are 7 registers open, but suddenly on busy days only 4 are. 

It is not a terrible first job but definitely not something I could stick to for more than a year. I’m thinking about somewhere I can earn minimum wage plus tips when I turn 16 to help out more with savings. 

What do you guys think about this? Should I wait to see how the summer goes? I won’t even be a full year in the job when I turn 16 so I don’t know if I should stick it out.

I always get compliments on how good of an employee I am and I would love to stay but it’s genuinely so stressful with how the store is never prepared for rushes on weekends.

391,2024-02-26,"I refunded hundreds (if not thousands) of NSF fees. Also, feel free to talk about times you sabotaged the corrupt corporations you worked for.",u/Ketalania,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b0z8ao/i_refunded_hundreds_if_not_thousands_of_nsf_fees/,antiwork,"Elaboration on the title.

So, back before COVID started, I ended up getting forced by my parents into getting a job instead of getting to go to college. If that sounds weird it's because it was, they were abusive and manipulating me into pay down the mortgage and their credit cards instead of letting me get an education, but that isn't the point of this story. 

I ended up getting a job at a call center working as an online bank teller, they paid close to minimum wage and the overall work environment was pretty close to *Office Space* except nowhere near as fancy as a SF Bay software company ofc, I would've killed for my own cubical. 

In any case, it wasn't long before customers started calling and complaining about NSF fees, this was back before the banks got sued big time for this practice being predatory, but there are all kinds of ways banks organize it so that if you're even relatively poor, like living paycheck to paycheck, you'll probably end up getting hit with NSF fees eventually, even if you do a good job keeping your bank account in the black.  

My banks policy was, that representatives had the authority to refund up to 3 NSF fees a year, and a supervisor (really just a phone line I could call with another agent) could authorize a 4th refund. We were only supposed to give out the NSF fees if customers asked for them but...I decided to take things further. Anytime anyone called in, for ANY reason, I would check their bank statements for NSF fees real quick while they were telling me their name and how I could help them today. I'd get their business done, but at the end of each call, **even if they had never even mentioned it**, I would just ask them if they wanted me to refund their NSF fees.

For example:

Me: ""I see you have this NSF fee from 4 months ago, would you like me to refund it?""

Customer ""Ummm, what? No thank you""

Me ""Are you sure, it'll be $30 more dollars in your bank account""

Customer ""Well, ok, I guess""

Me ""Thank you for calling \[My bank\], have a wonderful day"" \*click\* 

Most of our customers had some kind of NSF fee on their account in the past year, but every one that called me, unless they adamantly refused, got their NSF refunds. If they had more than three, I would always call the supervisor line and make the best case I could for them. A few times, it rather worked to the customers delight because they suddenly had $90 ""extra"" dollars in their account they hadn't planned on ever getting back. Not everyone can find that kind of opportunity to strike back at the corporations which oppress them, but I delighted in that one. 

Later, the banks got sued bigtime, now most banks have a one-day grace period or something, but it's still pretty predatory.

Seems suspicious, and I know they did go behind our team's back to position themselves and intentionally excluded me from the meetings with upper management (long story). 

 

I am asking everyone (CFO, head of HR, chief talent officer, prior manager, current manager) why the decision was made, what was the decision based on?  -- I asked was it performance based? They all said No. Was it Disciplinary? They said No. They can't give me a straight answer what this was based on.

Do you have any tips how I can get back on track for promotion? I'm already down HR's throat and emailing CFO as we are in our review cycle, and trying to meet face to face ASAP to put a roadmap together etc etc (yay, fun)

Or should I just ""update my resume"" and look to leave asap?"

I totally get them wanting us there a few days a week, I definitely have more productive conversations in person, but sometimes I just need to focus and being in the office really makes that hard. I couldn't tell you the number of times I finally put headphones on and started on a task only for someone to come to my desk and ask me something entirely unrelated, it's so frustrating that my employer cuts into both my personal time and productivity just so they can say we're all working in the office.

Today I received a final warning (that I have not yet signed) for “periods of inactivity”. I have never been in trouble for anything like this and I am above my quota every single month. They also used samples from days prior to being told this, not after.

This was shown on a bar graph in 30 minute increments. However, it is impossible that I was inactive for 30 minutes at a time at any point in my day (aside from my lunch, and even then I am still sometimes back to doing something before the 30 min break is up) as we get pop ups at 10 minute intervals and I never get them.

If I had gotten those pop ups I would be prompted to enter a reason for the inactivity, and they would see that.

This seems to be new software and while I don’t think it’s inaccurate per se, I believe it only counts us as active if we’re doing certain tasks.

For example my job is scanning information, we receive these scans by summoning them to our queue, work the scan, then save and upload.

I am pretty fast because I am experienced. When I’m meeting my quota hourly I will tend to slow down and take my time on a scan. From my understanding it’s not recording us as active if we’re not saving the scan through our scanning process, something I’ve never done. 

It could possibly be that it also records activity when retrieving and uploading scans but it’s unclear because they don’t even seem to know. All I know is that I’m absolutely in a scan and at the very least clicking/scrolling and reviewing enough that I do not get the pop ups unless I am actually on break.

I’m essentially being called a liar and don’t really know how to proceed. They are ignoring my request to provide pop up records that coincide with these “periods of inactivity”, that is because they don’t exist."

I texted her back (a couple hours later) telling her where it could be. And she texted back “okay thanks”… I didn’t even have to text her back so I felt like I deserved more than just an okay thanks. But whatever.

Then a few days later I got a text from a contractor asking for my managers extension because the contractor got less pay than he expected… I thought it was because a week earlier I noticed the contracted did the math wrong (happens more than you think) and they were actually owed less than their total price. After I texted the extension to the contractor I quickly texted my boss that I think it’s about that invoice from last week and to keep my name out of it because in this job I get a lot of enemies due to people not getting paid in time, which is not because of me… the managers have to approve the the invoices before I pay them… unfortunately the managers are so busy that they forget to approve the invoices… I get the mad person coming to me demanding money.

After I text my manager she just laughs and says it about an invoice she did and she also told me that the invoice she was asking about days prior wasn’t paid because she checked in the system… she could have done that before texting me…

I think she texted me because I haven’t been texting her funny videos or memes like I usually do… the reason why I’m doing it is because I’m mad at her… she cut my overtime pay after I worked overtime. And that’s illegal! Which I now know thanks to you guys. I’ve emailed the government to double check to see if anything can be done. My company is in for a hell storm… hopefully."

I wonder if I’ve been failed somewhere in life, and it’s no wonder I’m so unprepared for anything. Everyone else just knows what they’re doing and can somehow do everything super fast. I’m autistic and my disability slows me down, which makes me feel so unwelcome in the corporate world because everything has to be fast or else you’re swept in the tide. I always need clear instructions for everything or else I’ll mess up the tasks, which just pisses everyone off and makes them think I’m stupid and incompetent. I don’t feel comfortable telling them about my disability because telling elders has always led them to infantilize me in the past. They want me to be fast and accurate, but it feels impossible. I can’t be accurate if I’m fast because I’ll miss things, and I can’t be fast if I’m accurate because I need time to look over everything. Although I swear, every time I try to be accurate, they always find a reason to pick apart my work and use it against me. I can’t win. It’s why they put me on a PIP today, and I’m humiliated.

Anyhow, on to it. Last week we had a big change over in software. The software is called X-Time. We use it to communicate to customers about what their cars might need or general maintenance things and such. It also holds each department accountable for whatever they are supposed to be doing. So here's situation. We switched over to this in order to have better transparency with the customer. That being said, it is required that media is used (pictures and videos sent to the service writer and customer about what the concern is and why we are selling it to them). The service writers received tablets in order to write up repair orders on vehicles as well as take pictures and things of that nature. When it came to us, the technicians actually fixing cars, we were told to use our mobile devices to download their app to take pictures and videos using it that way. A lot of us did not want to download the app not only because of data monitoring on our personal devices but also because it would require us to use our phones in not so safe situations. And by that I mean holding it over buckets of oil or over an engine bay while the engine is running. Things that just would require added risk to us losing our devices or getting them broken. When management was approached about this they essentially said tough shit. Said that it's no different than walking into the building and slipping and falling and breaking our phones in that manner. Well we refused to do it but my coworker specifically had a run-in with one of the top HR people in our company and essentially told her to shove it (politely) and that he is not using his personal phone for work. And they should get us work phones. Fast forward to this week, there are like three work phones that we can use. There are 50 of us around about. Management Came up to him today and told him that he is now only allowed to have one car on our lot and that this is because he won't download the app and go along with it and that he should expect other privileges to be removed the longer he fights them on this. My question is can they actually do this? Is this some form of re-retaliation or is he just fucked? If you're still here for this, Thank you so much! "

There have been murmurs of my job outsourcing the department to a private company because ThEY cAnT fInD aNyOnE wHo WaNtS tO wOrK. There has been a years-long trend of whittling down on our staff levels. Someone retires or quits, no replacement is hired. It should also be noted that there aren't ever any job postings for the open positions. Nothing on indeed, nothing on my works web page, nothing. Or, if there are postings it's for absurdly low pay and no one ever applies. Right, so clearly the writing is on the wall that they want to privatize the job to save money, and they really aren't actually trying to prevent it from happening. 

I can see the writing is on the wall, and I've simply stopped hustling trying to stay caught up on the work. If they want the work done, they're just doing to have to hire more people. Period. I work my regular pace, and what I get done, gets done. What I can't get done is not my problem. I'm not working at breakneck speed or coming in on weekends just to stay caught up on the work. 

Right, so cue Mr. Boomer Coworker who is close to retirement. This dickhead has a habit of using his massive amount of accrued PTO to take every Friday and sometimes Monday off too for four day weekends just for funsies. He also cherry picks his PTO days based on the scheduled workload. He'll take every busy day off just to get out of the work. Which, more power to him. *However.* Today this dickhead had thee audacity to tell me that if I just crammed in *just* *a* *little* more work every day, I'd be able to cover for his days off without falling behind on my own work. He's worried that if work keeps falling behind because we can't keep up on it, then they'll definitely want to outsource and we'll all get laid off.

I was like... I don't care. Go ahead and lay me off. I don't want the job anyway if it requires me to do the work of two people just so I get to keep the job. Seems to me like they're just waiting until a few more people retire or quit before they lay us off, that way there's less people they have to pay unemployment. Right now, I'm just trying to wait them out. I'm working my regular pace and waiting for them to lay me off so I can collect that sweet, sweet unemployment. If my coworker is so concerned about keeping the job until he retires, then he is more than welcome to stop using his PTO to basically be a part time worker. He is more than welcome to work six days a week so we stay caught up.  Go get 'em tiger, cuz I'm not doing it. "

This means I've been on sick leave since my surgery. Before my surgery I was also applying for another job, but because I didn't know when I would be available again, that fell trough.

Since I got sick, everything got even worse. Of my original team when I started a year ago, I'm the only one left now. (We were a small team of three, one person resigned some time ago, the other one resigned while I was gone.) So now my team consists of me, the foreign outsourced team members who were working on the new software, and a freelancer I had been trying to get rid of before my surgery. Originally, I was told he was going, but then the owner of the company stepped in and stopped that from happening. That's why I decided I'd had enough.

As far as I understand, lots of things have been going to shit while I was gone because nobody on the current team actually knows the current software or has any domain knowledge. This means that the failing company I had been trying to save for the past year, is now not only sinking but on fire. The CEO is gone, so the crazy owner has taken over, a person has been fired, another is retiring, so there's basically only 2,5 other employees left in the company, plus the owner, the freelancer, and my outsourced foreign team members. There's more outsourced foreign team members than employees currently, basically.

My boss (the owner) and the freelancer were already driving me crazy when I still had my amazing team member with me who has resigned now. I know for sure that as soon as I'm back, they'll expect me to fix everything because I'm now the only one with knowledge left. That would already terrify me if I was just coming back from a holiday, not now I've not worked for half a year. I don't remember the details either! I don't know how to fix everything! And now nobody knows. That's what happens when you run your software team ragged so they just don't find the time to document everything properly. (And before I came in they just expected the one guy that left first to know everything because he basically single handedly made the software, so yeah)

So now I'll need to return soon, maybe as soon as next week, I'm discussing it with my doctor on Wednesday. However, the thought actually makes me have panic attacks. But if I resign, I can't get unemployment benefits and I need my income, so I can't resign until I find a new job. Currently I can't even apply to any jobs, though, because just getting my laptop gives me such horrible panic attacks that my brain just shuts down. 

Besides just being a terrible company because of the weight on my shoulders, I also just can't stand my boss. He's a giant ass. He actually goes around telling ALL of his employees they probably have more money in their account than him because he has put EVERYTHING in his company. He complains that he has to pay holiday pay (required by law in our country). He's even in a legal battle with the government right now, because he did some (illegal) shit during COVID which saved him money, but he's claiming it was all above board. Company is being audited and the people who didn't get several months of pay because of it (he says the government needs to pay, the government says he needs to) were basically threatened to say what he wanted. It wasn't even the only illegal thing he did. The guy that left worked extra hours in the evening for scheduled things for years, they had told him he wasn't allowed to subtract those from his hours during the day but he wasn't paid extra either. When I started working there (I took over the lead of the team) I told him he definitely was allowed to subtract them from his day hours and to send whoever said anything about it to me. He also always paid our wages out too late, until I subtly dropped the hint that they were required to pay out by a certain date by law, and every day they went over that they had to add interest. 

When the foreigners first started working, I had done a week of almost 90 hours (I have a 38 hour work week normally), and I had been taking those hours back over the next couple of weeks. Then I suddenly got reprimanded because I wasn't properly managing the foreign team (nobody had even told me that was my job!) and they were requiring daily meetings and such with that team. I was already working 4 different jobs since that one team member left, I didn't have time for that, and he knew very well I had had that massive week, at that point two weeks before. I told him I would gladly work even more if he started paying those extra hours, but in the paygrade the law states you have to work those extra hours. (Of course I wasn't planning on doing those, but I knew they weren't planning on actually paying for those hours.)

So that was my rant about my horrible employer I have to go back to. Any tips to stop panicking about it are appreciated. 🙈 I mean, it's 7.30 AM here right now, and I haven't slept a wink because of the stress."

6. Almost   immediately: Informed that I'm having an Aldi Experience Day the   following week with the Area Manager. This seems to go well, I ask   questions and try to keep focused and upbeat.
7. 7 days later: Email saying that I'm unsuccessful and I can't apply for 6 months.

All   this for a part-time (15 - 30 hours a week) role as a Store Assistant.   This is a bit of a angry (and disappointed) rant but WTF Aldi? Is this   normal?"

I’ve complained to managers at least 5 times and keep getting told nothing can be done about it. Other workers are also telling me the register is too short. We have a cushioned mat to stand on but everyone pushes it away because it adds two inches of height for us, making the problem worse. 

Customers constantly say the counter is too short, and constantly say I’m too tall for this job, and a lady even gave me a business card to the massage place she goes to and said I’ll need it. My back is indeed getting super fucked up from it.

Is there any action I can take like OSHA to fix this situation?"

&#x200B;

I've been out of the work force for a while. For the past 5 years, I've been doing gig work and also run a small side business (side hustle) that gets me by. I'm far from the american dream. I don't have a social life. But I try to find happiness in the small things and pretending I will have a future somehow. That being said, as I've gotten older through the years, my tolerance for workplace in the BS has diminished. In fact, it's nonexistent. Now I am in my late 30's. I understand I am a bit older for this work force. But still. There are things I used to be able to do. I used to be able to deal with the bullshit. I used to be able to work with people. What happened.. I asked myself? My question to this generation is ""How do ya'll do it?"" 

&#x200B;

There are two main compononents I want to talk about in this post regarding my experience in the modern corporate workplace. The first concept I want to talk about is ""Buttering up for the kill."" - A nice, catchphase I gave to what seems to be some kind of strange corporate practice of catering to a possible new employee by kissing their ass. The next concept I'd like to describe is, ""Throwing to the sharks."" - That is, after a prospective employer has buttered you up to their low tier, bottom of the barrel abuse, they ""throw you to the wolves"" - That will be the name of concept # 2. 

&#x200B;

I have two examples of places that I worked for. Olive Garden, as ""Food Expo"" -  And ""Compass Group"" as a diswasher / kitchen utility person. Here is my experience as follows. 

&#x200B;

Example # 1

&#x200B;

\#Olive Garden

Job Title: Food Expo

\*\*Stage 1: Buttering up.\*\*

&#x200B;

Post-Covid, Olive Garden was in a hiring frenzy. Seemingly, no one wanted to work. I walked in specifically to become a server. Nobody wanted to let me be a server. Probably because I had no experience in such. Instead, they made me an ""Expo person."" Fine. I'll give it a shot. I heard you make tips too. 

&#x200B;

Everything was wonderful. Everything was nice. I was ""The older guy at the table."" - but it seemed I was being treated with respect by the young ladies who were applying with me. Sure I felt a bit out of place, but my side business was slow, and I needed a job. We began the training. A woman by the name of ""M"" came out. She handed us pamphlets. We read out of the manuals and talked. She told stories. She joked. We built rapport with another. Everything seemed nice. 

&#x200B;

She walked us around the restaurant. We were introduced to people. This was ""work"" - I even made an acquaintance, whom I vibed with. This might workout after all. After 5 hours of ""Training"" learning how to carry dishes, learning various small job related tasks, and then reading more from the pamphlets, another surprise. Our boss, ""M"" brought us to one of our very own personal table. There, one by one, a server brought out various delicious dishes from the Olive Garden menu. We sampled all the delicious varieties of food the world has to offer. This is a live ""research"" project on familiarizing ourselves wth the menu.  I ate lasagna fritta. Calamari.  Fried Mozzarella.  Toasted Ravioli. Chicken Marsala.  On and on it went. I was actually feeling pretty hopeful about this job. Everything was nice. Maybe life wasn't so bad after all. 

&#x200B;

""M"" (our trainer) was kind. Helpful, and always answering questions. She had one complaint. That they took her away from ""serving"" to train us, that she wanted to get back to ""serving"" to make her money. I understood. 

&#x200B;

\*\*Stage 2: Thrown to the wolves\*\*

&#x200B;

It was go time. I'm tagging and bagging food bags. A young host, probably 22 does a macho attempt at getting me to ""Flinch"". I think in my head. ""That's odd."" - He sees me attempting to answer the phones and is talking rudely. I also realize I am surrounded by a 22 year old females. They are catty and begin arguing with one another. One has extremely long eyelashes, and fake nails. Her make-up is caked on grandiosely. In the kitchen, she yells at a co-worker that is my age for using the computer system. ""Her"" computer system. (Well, it's not hers, just a computer for the expo people.)

&#x200B;

Some F-bombs were dropped. Something to the effect of ""Don't use my fuckin' computer system."" - What was going on? I looked left and right. Little did I know this young banshee would be my personal trainer. Next thing I know, she's showing me where the plastic ""to-go"" containers are. She tells me to ""Look up."" - and then calls me stupid. I suddenly feel stupid. or Embarrassed. I don't know why. I wasn't expecting this. Next, I was at a phone. There is a beautiful 25-ish blonde girl, with green eyes. She is as sharp as a razor. She takes all the orders, quickly and efficiently. She slams the phone down, tears a receipt slip, and pastes it to the outgoing bag. She tells me rudely, ""Move. Move your'e in my way."" - ""What?"" I am confused.

&#x200B;

She was instructed to train me. She rolls her eyes. She glazes over certain things I'm supposed to do. When I ask question she rolls her eyes again, and says ""I already told you once."" - I'm sweating now. Confused. Wondering what to do. I am instructed to go in the back and box orders in the bag. ""M"" (My previous very kind trainer) is teaching me the ropes. Her demeanor is completely different. She's talking to me like I'm a complete moron. She's shoving and bossing me around to do ""This"" and to do ""That"" - My eyes widen, and bulge. My palms are sweaty. I use a Sharpie to mark the customer name on the receipts. She snaps at me, and tells me to hurry up. She calls me slow. It's break time. 

&#x200B;

The girl with the long eyelashes is training me now. She calls me slow and stupid. I get pissed off, and storm out of the back kitchen and go directly to the first manager I see. Another 25 year old with similarly fake eye lashes, make up and nails. ""Umm. Er Uhh.. Am I supposed to be Trained or insulted?"" I say with force, nervously, looking around. 'They're wolves. They're all wolves' I think to myself. The girl looks at me like I'm a pathetic excuse for a human being. ""Ugh. So what's the problem."" - SHIT! I think to myself. She doesn't give a flying fuck. What do I Do? I tell her what happened, and then retreat back on break. Moments later, I'm called into the managers office. 

&#x200B;

The manger tells me I've already had several complaints against me, and that ""Maybe I'm too old"" for this job. Wait.. I think to myself. Isn't that illegal to say that? After she reprimands me, I walk outside to take a break from the job. I can't go back in there. I call a family member, lamenting. In a panic, I untie my apron and walk to my car, and drive off the job, forever. 

&#x200B;

Example # 2

&#x200B;

\#Compass Group

Job Title: Kitchen Utility Worker

\*\*Stage 1: Buttering up.\*\*

&#x200B;

Here's the buttering up stage. A few years later, I found myself in another bind and applying for everything and anything. I landed a spot in a Kitchen Utility, in some kids ""Summer camp"" in the mountains. My boss was a Chef from Italy. A nice, homely man who was very kind and personable upon meeting. In fact, everybody at this camp was friendly. Looking around, I saw nothing but crisp pine trees, inhaling the thin fresh air of the mountains. Cool snow speckled the environment of old log cabins, facilities, and rec-rooms. 

&#x200B;

The chef walked me around and introduced me to everyone. He handed me some gloves and an apron. I shook hands with fellow kitchen cleaners. They told me ""Oh it's not so bad."" - In Chef's office. I made it very clear to him that, I can only work part time. At the most, 5 hours a day as I had to be home to work on my studies. He agreed. ""Not a problem."" he said. 

&#x200B;

The first day was an absolute breeze. All the employees were nice. I did some light kitchen duty, cleaned a few counters, but mostly did food prep for Chef and cooks. The shift was quick, and after all was said and done, I was invited to the staff Cafeteria. ""Eat as much as you want."" they said. ""All the food is free."" - I made myself a plate. Italian sausage, marinara, beans, pasta. One co-worker says, ""Grab any snack you want."" - I look to the cupboard of snacks on the Cafeteria walls. Oreos. Granola bars. Soda. Anything. ""Employees here can have as much as they want."" he says. 

&#x200B;

I did recall after that, the director of the camp telling me ""That's why we want to pay our employees $20/hr. We want to keep them."" 

&#x200B;

The truth is $20.00/hr comes out to about $14.00/hr.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*Stage 2: Thrown to the wolves\*\*

&#x200B;

The next day, Chef scheduled me for 10 hours for absolutely no reason. It was the hardest, most miserable work I've done in 5 years. Approaching my 40's, it beat my body all up to hell. Washing heavy metallic trays for hours on end, non-stop. Scrubbing, spraying, washing. On top of that, I was supposed to be a busser for 300 students in-between washing dishes. As I'm waste high in gigantic metallic trays (The trays used for the buffet line) - scrubbing various kinds of sticky filth, a Co-worker zooms in and says ""Gotta grab the kids plates now."" 

&#x200B;

Soaking wet in my apron, gloves, I rush out to start retrieving all the used, food covered, plates all the teenage students used. I grabbed roughly 300 plates, and equal amounts of silverware in that time. The trick was, you had to grab all the plates for 120 students, so that the next ground of students (80) can come in. By the time you ran all the plates through the machine, (Industrial washer) - You had to run them back to the cafeteria just in time for the other group of students to arrive. I did this for 5 hours non stop. At the end of the shift, I was wiping down all the kitchen equipment, counters, and was told to mop the entire kitchen, cafeteria, and dinning hall. 

&#x200B;

After the 10 hours, I walked out to my car in the freezing winter cold, drove back to the trailer and passed out. I was scheduled to do all over again the next day.  I was miserable, depressed, and could barely think or walk. I was dehydrated. I got out of bed, hobbled over and popped a multi-vitamin and sipped on some Caffeine. I'm advert to taking Caffeine (I quit years ago) - 2 more days to go and I get break. Just 2 more days. I got ready and went into the only joy in life that I have. (A small 20 year old BMW with a misfire) - And drove back to the camp. I parked my car in the parking lot. Everything in my body and soul was telling me to start the car, turn around, and flee for the hills. I stuck with it one more day. 

&#x200B;

""Why did he schedule me 10 hours, 3 days in a row ? I told him part time. What am I doing here? I told him I can only do 5 hours. ARGH!"" I said in my car. 

&#x200B;

Depressed, miserable, and beat to hell, I came to work the next week. There had been one particular guy who I had started with who just seemed to enjoy ""Talking shit."" for no reason. I didn't even know the guy. I just know that whenever I walked by him, He would say something passive aggressive, rude, or smart ass in an effort to get a rise out of me. He had told me he ""did this work for 5 years at another camp"" when we had lunch. I didn't know how to take him. He was young, brash, aggressive and rude. We'll call him ""D""

&#x200B;

AT the end of the shift we were all doing our duties. I was already on edge from the job, and ""D"" 's antics were starting to really get to me. I was going into fight or flight response mode in my head. Do I ignore him? Do I be kind? Do I confront him? Suddenly, one of the senior employees Screamed at ""D"" for being a smart ass. ""D"" stormed off into another room, somewhere in the dinning hall. I looked around. ""I guess that settles that."" I thought to myself. I was a bit relieved finally that someone had addressed him.  For a few hours later, D was moping around , just being an uneasy energy in the kitchen. I did the humdrum job of washing the 500 or so plates we had in the Industrial machine. D's antics began to start again. I did my best to avoid him. 

&#x200B;

It was the end of another 9 hour shift. I wanted to get out of that hell hole. One of our senior employees instructed us to mop the area. Then leaves. When the coast was clear, D yells at me. ""HEY Where you goin?"" - And I had no idea why. Then he Kicks the MOP with his foot and says ""DO IT"" - That was it. I exploded. I confronted D. Cussed him out. Told him He's not my Boss, and that he had an attiude problem, etc etc. 

&#x200B;

That night. I didn't sleep. The Job. The stress. The wet feeling of the apron. D's passive aggressive tactics pissing me off. I had never worked so hard for so little in my life. With my side business, I had clients paying me triple what I was making an hour with hardly breaking a sweat. How did I get here? I must have taken a wrong turn. I don't know how ya'll do it. I don't know how this work force does it. 

&#x200B;

I've done some interesting things. I've rode motorcycles 50 miles into the mountain wilderness. Changed the heater core out of an F150. I've installed an entire cooling system in a Honda Civic. I've dated crazy abusive women and have been in literal fist fights with crazy degenerates. Even worked construction some odd years with oddball companies. But by far the hardest experiences I've ever had was trying to work the low tier jobs in a corporate work environment.

So four days ago we had a customer, who is a regular, come into our establishment and have a medical emergency in the main entrance. As Manager on Duty I was immediately called to the incident along with our security. We called 911 an administered CPR until paramedics arrived and declared him dead. This took roughly 40 Minutes and all the while customers were walking over us to get out or asking staff what was happening. We had roughly 100 customers in at this point. After the ambulance left, I tried calling my boss several times, and leaving several texts to call back asap, before leaving a very blunt voice-mail of ""Its me, this is what happend."" As I knew that it was probably going to be the next day before she called or texted back.  I called another Supervisor who then told me that policy was to stay open. Then i continued to checked in with all of my floor staff though out the last 3 hours of our shift and gave them time in the back away from customers if they needed it. Most wanted to go home but couldn't find coverage and I was told by the other supervisor if they cant find coverage they cant leave. We all made it through the last 3 hours of our shift by leaning on each other. I texted her again in the morning to please call. Still no answer, so knowing I couldn't call out, I  went to work. I made it through most of that day before breaking down because I found out the guys family had come in the night before and found out he had died there earlier. I had also found out my boss had talked to one of my direct employees and the security guy even though she hadn't reached out to me. She gave the security guy a couple days off but told my employee to just pray. That she had been though it before and life moves on. That same employee covered me when I broke down the second day and closed for me, doing a 13 hour shift. She missed coming into work by an hour the next day, got a no call no show, and was told to go home. Which I plan fighting on her behalf as that was not her fault and she also needed a day to decompress.The  3rd night was really quite and uneventful for those of us who managed to make it in and stay. No contact from my boss however even though she had been in earlier and dropped off pizza for the crew as the kitchen was going to be closed. That leads us to today. Came in bosses car was there, figured I would finally get to talk to her and what do you know she dips 10 minutes after I clock In without a word to anyone. Most of my night crew is starting to adjust and decompress. However, I have one who is really struggling as it was there regular. I had to hold her while she cried several times tonight and is considering quiting due to how she was treated by my boss. Most of my night crew have said they are  only staying because I've shown genuine care for them and what they are going though.  No time off except for that one employee, no empathy for the staff. I have been telling them about the grief counseling, which I only know about because of the security guard. Four days later still no contact from the GM. "

5,2024-02-27,"I got fired without warning during my trial period for not having ""enough experience""",u/Auzune,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b1avrl/i_got_fired_without_warning_during_my_trial/,antiwork,"I'm still trying to process what just happened. I'm 25 and a biologist, and I don't have a lot of work experience, which makes sense considering my age. Almost two months ago I got a job in a biotech company, and I was quite happy with it. I'm living with my parents, so my short to medium term plan was to find a job nearby that would allow me to live with my parents to save as much money as possible. The company is quite new, so I though that they would probably be looking for employees, that's why when I started job hunting I contacted them despite not having a job offer publised. I was very lucky, because just a week after contacting them, the director of the department contacted me for a job offer. I had the interview the day after, and the day after the interview, they told me I was hired. Now, looking back there was something weird with this job offer. First, it was supposed to be a temporary contract to cover a maternity leave, but just a week after, I was told that in the end it was an indefinite contract with a trial period. All of this was the month before starting with the job. I'm not sure about this, but I'm in Spain, and because of new labour reforms, now it's more difficult to hire people on temporary contracts, so what many companies are doing if they don't have the intention to keep the employee is to offer an indefinite contract and then kick the person before the trial period ends to make it like if it was a temporary contract. I don't know how is it in other countries, but in Spain, if you are in trial period they can kick you out without any warning or justification, so it's easier for companies to do this than to offer a regular temporary work contract. 

There were some other things that made me worry about not passing the trial period. A few weeks ago, everyone in the department had an external training that lasted the whole day except for me. Of course, if they didn't intend on keeping me in the company, why would they waste money and time on training me? Also, the directors of the department kept on doing job interviews. The week I arrived, an experienced employee left, so they were looking for someone to replace her. But she had a different job position, and the woman who has been on maternity leave since November has also a different position to me, so it's not like I'm actually replacing her. So, I guess that everyone assumed that the kept on making job interviews to find someone to replace the employee who left, not to replace me. But it seems like they only hired me because the workload was high, and they needed someone to help until they find a proper replacement for the employee who left and until the woman on maternity leave (who is the most experienced of all) came back. Since we would not be doing the same job, I think that what makes sense is to keep everyone so that the people who have the same position as me are not overworked, but of course, that's the most expensive option for the company. 

Despite having these signs that made me worry that I might not pass the trial period, they kept on assigning me new tasks, they never told me off and they didn't seem to have any problem with me. I was motivated, and I actually enjoyed the job. Some task were a bit boring, but satisfactory at the same time, if it makes sense. Kinda like cleaning: before starting cleaning up I don't want to do it, but once I'm doing it it's easy and satisfactory to continue. Also, the job had a good balance between office work and lab work, and between automatic, routinary tasks and tasks that require you to think. The days went on quite fast, and I didn't feel like drained from work. I always struggled with following a routine, arriving on time and being focused (I likely have ADHD, I'm in the process of getting a diagnosis), but in this job, that felt easy, and I've never been so focused and productive before, not just at work, but also in my free time, even if I had to wake up at 6.

I assumed I would be working here at least for a year, and I had my whole year planned: the holidays I would take, the days off, the things I would learn, for how long I would like to be working here, the money I would be able to save... But yesterday, the directors of the department called me for a meeting just half an hour before the time I typically finish, and I assumed the worst. I was right, since they told me that their bosses decided that I wouldn't continue with them because they needed someone with more experience, especially someone with more experience in the processes they need to implement the following months. At least they insisted that I did a great job, that it wasn't because of anything bad I did, that I have an impressive CV for my age and that I have a great future ahead. They even said that I can contact them for a recommendation letter. I though that I would stay there until the woman on maternity leave came back, which is right after Easter holidays, but they told me that I didn't have to come back the next day. Once we finished the meeting, they walked me to my desk and waited for me to take my stuff. One of them said that I would not continue with them to the two coworkers who were there at that moment, and they seemed surprised. They walked me to say goodbye to the other two coworkers that were in a different place at the time, then they walked me to the entry door, I gave them my card, they hugged me and said goodbye and I walked to the bus stop, unable to believe what just happened. Just the day before I had plans for the whole year, hopes, a promising opportunity. Now the only money I have is this month's salary, still no savings, and I have a stain in my CV. Every employer who sees that I was working in this place for just seven weeks will know that I didn't pass the trial period, and even if the reason is that they found someone better and not that I did a bad job, why would they believe me? I'm young and I have less than a year of work experience in total. I was unemployed for almost half a year before this job. Who would want to hire me? One of my best friends is a lawyer and she says that it's important that I get the recommendation letter, because it's what is going to make the difference: it's not the same being fired because you fucked it up than to be fired because they found someone more suitable. I also can't deal with the humilliation of being kicked out and walked to the door and everything. Maybe the people of my department, with whom I've been working, will know that the reason I was fired is not that I fucked it up and that I'm not completely inept, but people from other departments will just assume that I fucked it up when they see that I don't come back. Their opinion shouldn't matter, but it does, because this sector is small, and if you don't have good recommendations you won't get the job. Also, there was a guy before me who was also fired during the trial period, but from what I've been told, he did fucked it up, so I just know that now they will talk about me like I'm him 2.0. BTW, none of my coworkers has bothered to contact me to send best wishes, say goodbye or anything, and I wonder if right now they are talking shit about me or making fun of me. 

Yesterday night I was having really dark thoughts that I've never had before. For example, I live in a high building, and I couldn't help to think that it would be easy to just jump off. I truly don't have any hopes about the near future. I know that no one is going to hire me within the next months, with so little experience and after having being fired. I'm almost 26 and I can't continue to leech on my parents, even if they are ok with providing for me. And for sure, I'm not going to find a job that offers the good conditions that this one offered: 35 days of holidays a year, flexible schedule, 35 hours a week in July and August., just a 15 minute drive from home..  Honestly, I don't know what to do. Sorry for the wall of text, but I really needed to vent."

If all companies flood the market with something, supply goes up and demand goes down. The effect this has on the market is that prices go down of course.


These big companies are coordinating their mass layoffs for a reason.


Usually, in a post-inflation world where the price of goods and services goes up, salaries are bound to also catch up, albeit slowly for various reasons.


Inflation is mostly over all over the world, but companies don't want to permanently pay more for salaries, so they are doing these ***coordinated mass layoffs*** to manipulate the labor market.


These big companies don't even need to take a hit from those layoffs, because their profits have hit record numbers."

52,2024-02-27,Don't Teach Your Kids Work Ethic,u/OneOnOne6211,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b1bgka/dont_teach_your_kids_work_ethic/,antiwork,"I just saw [this post](https://new.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1b0id1c/how_much_of_an_allowance_did_yall_get_in_your/) on No Stupid Questions asking people what allowance they'd get as a child. And a lot of the people commenting basically took it as an opportunity to say ""none"" and to add proudly that ""I got a job"" or something similar. With others talking about how you should teach kids ""work ethic.""

That's one perspective. But I say what they call work ethic is what I call a slave mentality.

The idea of ""work ethic"" and teaching kids that there is something inherently noble or good about working is terrible, actually. We should work to live, not live to work. You only have one life and, ideally, you should be able to fill it with as much happiness and freedom as possible. Obviously work is necessary otherwise we would have no food, no cars, no nothing. I don't deny that at all. But it shoud NEVER be treated as something to be proud of that you work a lot. Or that somehow working is itself noble. Because that is easily exploited.

And, in fact, corporations DO exploit that.

How often have you seen people brag about working 60 hour days, for example? I've seen it a bunch. They talk about it as if they're some brave Hercules. In reality, they're being taken advantage of. Corporations take advantage of this mindset. Because when people are proud of doing this sort of thing, you know what they're less likely to do? They're less likely to think ""Hmn, I actually don't want to be working 60 hour days, what can I do to change this?""

If you've ever read some LinkedIn job listings you'll also notice how much corporations love mentioning this kind of stuff. That they expect a ""strong work ethic"" and stuff like that. And what they mean with that is ""we expect you to work hours of unpaid overtime, weekends sometimes and work yourself to the bone every second despite the fact that your wage will stay the same no matter how hard you work."" And because ""work ethic"" is seen by so many people as a positive they get away with calling it that. You know what I call it? I call it exploitation. No kid should be taught to put up with this.

Unless you're self-employed, all your ""work ethic"" is doing is enriching billionaires, I promise you.

So I say rather than teaching ""work ethic"" to kids we should teach them that work is necessary but happiness is the ultimate good. To expect what they are owed. To *fight* for what they are owed. That solidarity is important. And to challenge authority, not bend to it.

That is how you get happy people. That is how you get a 4-day work week. That is how you get people who fight for a strong social safety net. And that is how you get people who will fight so that they get paid a fair wage, rather than simply ""working hard"" so Jeff Bezos can become a trillionaire."

Recently we had reviews, which only happened because I literally walked out one day and sparked a fire under management, and in my reviewI pushed for more PTO. I was able to get 2 more days for everyone. This was a pretty big victory and I was excited for all of us. Well, we just got our paystubs this week and of course management didn't add those 2 extra days to our existing PTO. That's honestly not a surprise as we have to fight for EVERYTHING here, but none of my coworkers seem to notice or care. I don't get it. They are perfectly fine if I'm in the line of fire fighting for them, but they won't do the same? Not even the simple task of going to management and saying ""hey, I'm missing 2 more days of PTO.""

But I have come to the conclusion that, not only is it a far greater scam than I imagined, but **it's also an indoctrination camp to get people accustomed to working themselves to death from a young age.** I suspect kids put up with this because they believe they have no alternatives like trade school or business. The sad part is, school is free for me due to taxpayer benefits, and I still think it's a scam and waste of my time. When I look at the endgame pay for my major, it's at best, $220,000/year, that's after a minimum of 8-12 years of education. The money simply isn't worth the last young good years of my life. (I'm well into my 30s). In what world are professional skills worth so little?  


The thousands WASTED on tuition and RENTED / DIGITAL books is more than enough to start a business on. I can only imagine the goals I could reach if that tuition went to my pocket rather than a school.

Not only is it indoctrination, but the knowledge amounts to diddly squat. I find myself writing essay after essay that amounts to nonsense and very little practical and industry-related knowledge. The last several essays I wrote were on bloody gender differences and power structures. I no longer have time for anything that I love, my business has fallen to the wayside, and for what? A piece of paper that says I'm qualifies to do a job I have never done before? A permission slip? Kissing the gatekeepers ring? Mother may I enter white-collar work? At this rate, I should go back to teaching myself and if I really want to enter that field, incorporate my own business as work experience. I'm getting my associates and then I either drop to half time or I get out.

Yeah, flame away, I'm a sole-proprietor; I don't comment much because of the hostility but I figure this one is worth posting. I won't need employees for years but when I do, I might require an **associates at most** and that's only because it helps screen out potential troublemakers. From a business perspective, requiring something as asinine as a do-nothing degree is just a limiter on the potential labor pool."

The same group in which my mother (F54) has worked for almost 30 years. She's now in charge of a team of around ten people in the finance department and everything's going well for her. 

I was selected for an interview directly with the managers of the team concerned 2 weeks ago. Everything went extremely well and I was informed at the end of the interview that HR department would contact me again for a proper formal interview in accordance with the usual process. (I should point out that I did 2 internships lasting several months in this same team in 2018 and 2019, so I know the environment, the processes, etc.). 

During the interview, I consciously asked the recruiters to not tell my mother about all this as I wanted to be treated like any other candidate and to avoid any suspicion of a conflict of interest.

However, I haven't heard back from the company since that interview. Today, I received a call from HR informing me that, after background checks, the recruitment process was halted due to a suspected conflict of interest within the finance team. They simply stated that, because my mother works there, I cannot be in contact with her.

It's essential to note that she has no professional contact with the team I was supposed to work with. Additionally, in the same department as that team, there are over 60 people who don't all know each other, and there's a significant turnover.

In essence, I've been rejected solely because of my last name, and it's disheartening.

so, they monitor how many phone calls you make a day, whether you answered a call or not, how long you were on the call for, how many times you type on the keyboard, how many times you move the mouse, it also detects if you just move the mouse instead of clicking, how many seconds you stay on each browser or screen, monitor all chats, they see how long you’ve been logged onto the computer, they see if you clock on from your work computer, they send weekly reports of your activity, your progress is shown for the entire company and coworkers to see, and if you use the bathroom for 2 minutes your computer gets automatically shut off and logged out of everything, and in order to sign back in you have to get authentication every single time which notifies your supervisor.

They do include a section for ""religion/creed"", but no protections for political affiliation.

The reason I ask is because I am a communist; I am a member of a few local communist organizations,  I attend meetings and protests, and I often post anti-capitalist material on social media and reddit. So let's say for example, my manager finds me on here or adds me on social media and wants to fire me for being a communist or for saying things outside of work which make it clear that I am not motivated by profit or by greed and that I am against the capitalist system (which would make sense because I'm going to be doing sales, and from their perspective, a person who is anti-money, anti-capitalist, and anti-profit might not be the best fit for sales).

Could I possibly make the stretch that ""people over profit"" is my religion or creed, in order to have my status protected under federal law? Or are federal discrimination laws specifically against protections for political affiliation in order to allow for the systemic suppression of socialists or political dissidents?

Obviously I leave all politics at the door when going to work because I currently live in a capitalist system and I have to work to make money, and bitching about it at work isn't going to change that, so I won't be causing any sort of trouble at work, but I'm just wondering if I can extend any discrimination protections to my actions outside of work.

Years ago I lived in Washington state. I got an interview over 5 hours drive down in Oregon with The Standard. Two young women from HR interviewed me. They kept giggling at my responses, talking to each other, answering or looking/texting on their phones the whole time. Job was for a barely entry level role, but full time and I was really interested and had relevant experience. 

Back then, I was dealing with untreated PTSD for military service stuff and the blow off from two mid-20 year old women after driving 5 hours made me upset but I kept my cool and was professional to the very end. 

But to this day I wish I had called them out at the time. Sometimes I wonder what to say when potential employers ask why I haven't worked very long at some of the places I've been recently. The honest truth that isn't pretty (or hireable) is that sometimes you end up in inappropriate jobs for your values, personality, skills, or experience because they're the only ones that gave you anything at the time.

Then they think you're a flake when you're applying to a job you'd be great at doing and fully expect to stay a long time. Sometimes 20 year old kids from HR on a power trip who couldn't care less are the cause of damage for a company and people who apply. Sadly, they don't see consequences themselves.

It's not a ""we're out, nice knowing you"" move, they still want to continue working here too, but obviously it'll be severely reduced days and hours.

I haven't been handling it well at all. Partially because I want to be in that position too of leaving for a better paying job, but also because I know this will absolutely mean all this work is suddenly going to pile on me (we're all the top people in our department outside of our manager, so it's basically just gonna be me and our manager, and whoever we hire if anyone to fill some holes).

I've already been struggling with the regular day to day workload as is, and this news doesn't make it any better. I've already been casually applying for other jobs, but guess I gotta ramp it up. Time to abandon this sinking ship.

Not that I should care, but if those people leave and I follow soon after, this entire department is as good as dead. Even if they hire new people, nobody knows how to carry things like we've done for years, and we were literally the reason the department got created to begin with. I'm gonna try using this as leverage into staying with a higher pay, but I'm 99.9% sure that'll go nowhere, which would be all the confirmation I need as to why I should leave.

Just such a sad moment right now. You had such a good thing going, and just out of nowhere it's like everyone's abandoning ship (not because of the manager or any of that, it's the higher up's and the lack of promotions). Deservingly so though, everyone should get paid much more than they are, but I don't know how they managed to mess up catching lightning in a bottle this badly with what we've accomplished."

It's not that the people weren't smart enough, it's simply that they weren't *actually* interested in software engineering. Writing actually good software is reeeeeally fucking hard. They were sold this promise that if they work in software they'd have some ultra cushy job where they get paid piles of money for doing next to nothing. This has never been my experience. The pay is good, but it's about as good as most other hard science/math fields

I kept seeing media like ""just learn to code!"" and no one saw the obvious problems here. To be good at coding is not easy. I never hear anyone say this with other fields, because it sounds ridiculous. ""Just learn to be a surgeon! Pick up a few surgery textbooks or something, read some articles online, I'm sure you'll get it!"", also people also didn't realize: if everyone becomes a software engineer, the pool of talent is so much larger and therefore the pay will go down in response.

I think all of this happened in 2022-2024. It was so easy to get a job during the pandemic and a lot of people *did* learn how to code. Now we're seeing a ton of mass layoffs and the field is hugely oversaturated so everyone is fighting each other for whatever few roles there are. Pay has dropped massively: I'm now seeing jobs that are 2/3 the pay of my current job as the ""best option""

All in all, what I really want to say with all this is that we can't just keep trying to implement individualistic solutions to these systemic problems. I'm sick of people trying to find a way for they, themselves, to *escape* without actually fixing any underlying problems"

I want to preface this by saying that my previous job was small but super toxic. They were rude, racist, and more interested in inter-office politics then doing work. I just graduated and I needed a job, so I tried not to look at all their issues at first. But when you have another employee saying that I come from a ""third world country"" and that the job needs to be done by someone from this country (even though I was born in America and all my education is from NY) and the CEO of the company talking about how my home country is dirty and uncivilized, its hard to ignore the glaring racism issue. They hired primarily WOC to do all the office work but didn't hesitate to say that these women ""didn't know anything and don't know English and don't know what they are talking about."" Even though the women working knew more English then our foreign born CEO (with shitty English, might I add). There were a bunch of smaller crazy things they said to but I was way to overworked to even remember.

There were two branches to this company and we were the extension branch and even though we generated enough revenue to sustain both branches, while the other one did fuck all, were were contently bogged down by office politics. Because we were the extension branch we didn't have permission to get the materials to do our job. We went a month without Microsoft 365 because the main branch was mad at us for doing well at an audit and didn't want to renew our subscriptions. They regularly ""forgot"" to pay Wi-Fi bills and forgot to order office supplies, like printer paper. They would tell us to pay for it and they they would reimburse us. But they would pay us back after 1-2 months and sometimes they would put the wrong name or amount on the check or they would lose the expense report and now you had to chase after the CFO to get paid back. For 20-50 purchases that fine but if you need a 100+ purchase, like a broken printer/computer/projector/chair/desk/etc, and nobody is willing to front the money (rightfully so) because they can't take that much all at once, you have to deal without whatever broke it till the main branch feels like playing nice again.

The CEO comes in every 3-4 months demanding we generate more revenue because the main campus is sinking again and leaves just as fast as he came. He regularly gave payroll late, like nearly 2 weeks late, despite the fact that revenue is growing and expenses are being slashed. It used to be ""we are low on funds"" or the bank is holding on to the money"" or ""we are waiting on a loan"" but he has stopped giving excuses. Whenever someone from the extension branch does something that deviates from absolute submission, without fail paycheck come out late. The lady in charge of sending out a report was on sick leave and the report when out a day late and unsurprisingly payroll came 2 1/2 weeks late. This happened like 30 times in my year there, and magically stopped when everyone in the extension branch was perfectly subservient.

Anyways, I left that company because it was a garbage fire, and I would rather be poor then deal with shitty co-workers and higher management. It has been almost 2 weeks since I have left and my co-worker (who I was good friends with) just called me in a panic because one of the higher ups asked if I found a better job somewhere. She said she didn't know and he cuts her off by saying, ""Dont lie to me, I know you know."" I had put her as a reference for a job I was applying for a few days prior and they had probably read my email with her contact info. I checked my gmail account and it looks like I had signed into my personal email on Edge by accident, never signed out and I didn't even notice bc I did all my work on Google Chrome. I already changed my password and I know there is not much to do but its still so annoying. I have left the company and they are still reading my shit.

This job managed to kill any joy I had in life in a year, work me to the bone, give me impossible deadlines, set me up for failer by giving me the jobs that no one wants because of hard they are on top of my normal work load, complain that I wasn't good enough, but didn't want me to leave bc they wanted to maintain a skeleton crew, and harass the people I work with about jobs I applied for. Its like trying to leave a clingy abusive ex.

The job market is in such shambles that I haven't been able to find a decent job in almost a year and I think i'm losing it. I am a good worker, i like to work, and I want to work but I feel so lost right now bc I have no one to tell, my family doesn't understand and I have no one to turn to. I just wish this was easier."

To say I don't ""need"" this job is somewhat of a half-truth, as I have enough savings to last me a few years of living humbly, but not enough to purchase a home in my area.

My tech lead does not micromanage and there are really no set quotas for productivity. A lot of my time is unsupervised and I am usually watching YouTube videos when no one is around. Our work is pretty much grunt work - carrying items around and moving things around on spreadsheets.

I understand some would be immensely grateful to be in my position. One of my coworkers feels the need to always prove himself and to show off his productivity while I kind of stay under the radar. He's a little older so it takes him a while to do things, so I take advantage of that and work at his pace even though I could do more. 

Our job is a 2 person job, so if I am not here then my coworker is unable to run the machines we use. 

My question: Should I actually care about this job? Or should I continue to do the bare minimum and hope it'll be too much of a hassle to fire me and hire someone else?

The delivery site was on a hill and the drivers helper was eager to begin his day and wanted to prove his worth to the company. He had unstrapped the load to get it ready for transportation to site when the material fell out of the truck and crushed this poor individual and he was killed almost instantly. The worst part about everything is during the family’s mourning , (I’m under the assumption they rightfully sued our company) our managers asked us to make cards for the deceased’s family in order to help comfort or something. 

However being new and a fresh employee nobody really knew him, so we didn’t fill out fake love cards out of respect for his family. A couple days later the managers decided that because of the lack of appreciation they would go to each employee and demand a hand written thing of sincerity, even if you didn’t mean it. I refused on the grounds that if their was a lawsuit, it’s up to the company to make right with the family and I will not lie on their behalf to make them look better.

1,2024-02-27,FMLA - fired for poor performance ,u/ImaginationStatus184,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b1m085/fmla_fired_for_poor_performance/,antiwork,"Hello fellow redditors!

I’m hoping I can get some advice about a situation that is going to be coming up. A little background on what’s going on:

I work in a sales role for a company that does software sales. The expectations are extremely unrealistic, salespeople rarely hit quota, and they micro manage like crazy. This has created a lot of work induced stress and my behavioral health doctor has recommended that I use FMLA to take some time off. However, leadership has stated on multiple occasions that if this job stresses you out then it’s just not the job for you and that they would “help” you get into a different role somewhere else. (This is their nice way of saying they would fire you and let you go find a job elsewhere)

I want to take the FMLA, but having heard this several times in the past I pretty much KNOW they would end up letting me go. Of course, we have an HR department so they wouldn’t allow them to state that FMLA is the reason and I can almost guarantee they would point to “poor performance” as I am not hitting their set quota. 

Back in October of last year I inquired about an open position, within our org, to see if there was a chance I could be a good fit for it and move into that role instead of being on the sales team. Immediately after that (like the next day) I was put on a “PIP” (performance improvement plan) and in that plan it was mentioned that they questioned my commitment due to asking about a different role. 

The PIP went through December and it was never followed up on and nothing ever came of it, though I was supposed to be terminated. Nothing has really changed in regards to me hitting quota but they have not put me on another PIP since then. 

I am concerned that if I request FMLA they will use that PIP from last year as the reason for my termination. 

If this were to happen and shortly after requesting FMLA I am fired for “poor performance” will I be able to use the fact that they procrastinated on the original PIP as proof that they actually retaliated against me for requesting FMLA? 

What I would REALLY like to happen is that I receive the FMLA and the company fills the sales role with someone else due to pressure from the investors and when I come back they move me into a different role within the company. 

I feel like in order to completely protect myself I will need to get leadership on recording admitting that if someone is stressed about the job then they don’t deserve to work here, but I can’t think of any way to do that without letting the cat out of the bag. 

My current plan is to:

- call a meeting with my direct supervisors and ask offhandedly what kind of advice they would have for someone who is stressed about the job and record their response
- let HR know of my intent to submit FMLA paperwork
- Take the completed forms from my doctor and submit them
- wait to be fired
- if I’m fired, contact and employment attorney and get advice on how to reach a settlement due to wrongful termination
- provide that attorney with the information about the PIP from last year, provide proof that other reps with similar performance are still employed with the company, the recording from the conversation with management, etc

Does this sound like it would work? I genuinely hope that the company just allows to me take the FMLA without retaliation but having been employed with this company for 3 years I just don’t see that happening. 

Edit: I work in an “at will” state"
1,2024-02-27,Need advice,u/Pale-Ad1587,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b1m28a/need_advice/,antiwork,"Hi everyone,

I have been working my first full time job since graduating college since February 2023.  When I first applied, there were some red flags but I (stupidly) ignored them and told myself to try it out.  I have a workaholic boss who doesn't seem to get that employees are adults and not children and that work is not everything.  

For example, I left for lunch one day for about 30 minutes (salaried exempt) and the next day he called me into his office to tell me that I needed to tell him before I was leaving because that is ""professional courtesy"".  He's not an approachable person and likes to make people feel guilty for having a work-life balance.  

We only get 1 day WFH, and it can't be on Monday or Friday ""because that would give the appearance of a 3 day weekend"".  We also are expected to work a minimum of 40 hours and have to clock in and out even if we do not have things to do and we get no overtime.  I have been informed that I could be expected to work up to 55 HOURS a week without overtime.  

Anyways I have been planning on quitting but it didn't feel like the right time until last week I got a bad cold and worked from home on Thursday and ended up calling out on Friday.  I went to work yesterday but this morning I was starting to feel like the cold was getting worse so I wrote my boss an email that I'd either like to work from home or use sick leave.  He responds that I can WFH today but he wants me to come in tomorrow (normal WFH day) and then assigns me work that is due tomorrow.  I've been upset all day about this and don't know what to do.  I am currently looking for new employment but I need the health insurance this job provides me and feel trapped.   Any advice would be really appreciated.

TL;DR: Manager is a workaholic.  Been thinking about quitting for a while.  Asked to WFH today because I have a cold and now he is wanting me to come in on my scheduled telework day (tomorrow) and has assigned me work to be due tomorrow."

I feel really hurt and confused and a bit suspicious I was let go after asking for accommodations. I hope this makes enough sense, im still in shock about what occurred. Thank you in advance and if im being ridiculous please be kind. 

I had just started working for a bank (necessary context) and it had been going really well, or so I thought. I felt like I had been doing very well and was being told that I was doing amazing by coworkers and supervisors. I had a few progress check-in's with my superior or dept lead i guess. She told me that these were routine and they just wanted to check in and see how I was doing. I had told them I felt like it was going really well that I understood most of what was going on. The feedback I had received was that they wanted me to ""be more positive and smile more"". I was also told that they felt they couldn't tell what I was thinking to which I responded that they should just ask and I would be more than happy to explain what im feeling and thinking about what's going on. After that first meeting I was repeatedly told how awesome I was doing. I had a few tough people interactions that made me feel overwhelmed but I handled them without being rude or getting overly upset. But my supervisors told me not to worry about it and that they were impressed by how fast I was learning. Later that week I was put at the drive up window for the bank by myself, my supervisor was present but contantly being pulled away and I felt very unprepared. I also have a hearing problem that is recognized by the government as a disability. It usually does not impact my day to day life which is why I had not yet disclosed it to my employers. The drive-up drawer that is used to help the customers is WAY louder than I thought it was, so I was struggling with making sure I was doing each transaction correctly. I got a bit anxious which makes me become quieter so for the rest of the day I was a bit more reserved. Again I was only told that I did an amazing job and to not be discouraged. 

The following week I had another meeting that I was told was normal and a check-in for new employees. I told them I felt like I was doing really great and understanding everything. They asked what they could do to make training easier so I asked to not be on the drive-up until I had more experience and felt more confident with the software. They told me that this was totally fine and we could easily implement this. The only feedback I was given is that ""they wanted to see Happy Smiling OP"" and to be ""more positive"", I asked ""have I been smiling enough at the members?"", which they said yes but I needed to smile more at coworkers. I had also asked if there was times while I was shadowing another employee and there was nothing I could do if I could go do my online training so that I can be productive if I cant help with the transaction. My dept. lead was very offended by my suggestion and said that watching everything ESPECIALLY when I cant help is very important. So I said okay that makes sense and that was the end of it. 

The following day I was put in drive-up. My coworkers were told that I didnt have to do any transactions but were constantly pressuring me to do them and trying to make me do them regardless. They would hold the money out to me infront of the customers and say ""do you want to do this transaction? But you dont have to!"", while the member was waiting. It was extremely strssful and I tried to explain that I needed a break from the drive-up and they just kept asking me what I didnt understand. But the issue is not that I didnt understand it was the loudness of the drawer. After about an hour of this I was borderline in tears, I felt so upset that my superiors had promised to have my back but then went against it the next day. I felt even more overwhlemed because I knew I wasnt smiling and I had recieved several comments about it. So at this point I went to talk to HR about how to handle this. I asked for guidance about the smiling thing and she had told me to have a conversation with my supervisor about what her expectations were for smiling. So I had taken her advice and I was going to ask my superior. I also mentioned to my HR rep. that I am hard of hearing and have a disability and I had asked for accommodations with the drive-up drawer. I was told I could have them and then it was completely ignored. She had agreed with me that it was a reasonable request and said she could easily make it happen. The HR rep told me we would have another meeting the next day to talk about how everything was going. 

The next day I had an amazing day, I was doing everything right correctly balancing my till and I was just on fire. I had received no messages from HR about another meeting that day. But ten minutes before the end of my shift I was pulled in by my superior and told I was going to be terminated. I was extremely confused and I had asked why. She told me that I wasnt meeting their ""core values"" because I had said to another coworker without any public present that I felt like I had a rude interaction with someone in the public. My supervisor said ""she couldnt trust that I could go into new interactions with members without holding it against them"" or ""I would be unable to interact with them without wondering if they would be rude or not"". I was extremely surprised to hear this because I have worked several customer service jobs and I am aware that there is rude people but I am not always on guard? I explained that this was not how I felt at all and that I was confused why she would think that I thought that. She wouldn't really explain her reasoning behind this opinion besides the fact that I had called someone rude. My supervisor also said that my coworkers didn't feel comfortable talking to me because of these comments when THEY HAD ASKED ME about the interactions. She said that they felt like I couldn't take feedback without dismissing it? I had explained to her every time I received feedback I would listen very carefully and say okay to what they were saying so they knew I heard them. She told me they feel like I was dismissing what they were saying. I told her I had no idea my words were being taken that way, I also told her I had never received any critical feedback about anything I was not doing well in. My supervisor told me the reason they wouldn't give me feedback is because my supervisors were ""scared of my reaction"". But in every meeting/check-in we had I was smiling and understanding about the feedback I was given and we given the impression everything was going great. I told her this and I informed her that I was never given a chance to react negatively or positively to feedback because it was never given to me. Halfway through this conversation she tells me that she's reconsidering letting me go. She tells me to think about the stuff she told me over the weekend and that we would have a meeting with HR the next week. But then she took that option away but like was offering it and dangling it in my face. I also told my supervisor that I went to HR to get some help on how to address not smiling enough and she got extremely agitated and said that me going to HR is one of the issues because I need to go to her and not anyone else. I told her that the reason I went to HR was to understand how to best address the issue by someone who knew my supervisor. She did not like this answer and got like visually agitated. 

About an hour into trying to understand why im suddenly losing my job she brings HR in. My supervisor tells HR that im not following their ""core values"" because I had called a customer rude(not in front of them only to coworkers) and that meant I would be unable to handle customer interactions. She also told HR that I couldn't take feedback and would ""shutdown"" when upset and that I was ""unpredictable"". Which I clarified that I had never once been rude to a customer or Coworker I have never called names or been physical with anyone, and that my reaction when im overwhelmed is becoming quiet but it is NOT unpredictable or shutting down. I also explained that I was not aware of the issues that were occurring because I was not informed that I was underperforming. To which my superior responds to by saying the meetings that she had told me were ROUTINE and NORMAL check-ins for new hires were actually not standard or routine. I had no idea that this was the case, I was never informed they were nothing but routine until this moment. I explained that maybe if there was a way I could receive feedback if there was a stressful situation to be given the feedback a bit after the overwhelming interaction occurred to make sure I could really listen and take in the feedback I was given without the emotional charge of whatever just happened. I was told this would not be possible and that even asking for it was not going to work for them. They told me they cant do that and they both stared at me. I just said okay and they told me to not hesitate to reach out if I need something and I was escorted out. At no point was I given a pink slip or any paperwork. 

Is this wrongful termination? Can I get unemployment? Is it worth talking to a lawyer? Help please, this just feels so weird and wrong."

We live in California. My partner was hired full time for a company in November 2023. The position was described as being full time, office based (rather than driving out to clients) and that any downtime could be supplemented with office work. Well…after training they told my partner they didn’t actually know when the office would open but that my partner could be supplemental staff in case of call offs. They were never called to cover. Finally the office opens and my partner is scheduled 16-20 hours a week. One day a client didn’t come in so my partner thought they could do office work but apparently you have to be authorized to do office work because its “extra hours.” Last week partner received a text from management asking “hey, do you want to work more? So I can work on scheduling you.” My partner agreed. Management replied back “oh well we don’t have much for you right now.” My partner applied for “partial” unemployment as they aren’t getting the 80 hours they were hired for. Last week they worked one day for 4 hours. This week they haven’t been scheduled at all. What can my partner do? They are actively applying for other jobs, had interviews but nothing lands. Quitting would make them ineligible for unemployment and thats whats helping them stay afloat right now. Thank you guys! "

2,2024-02-27,Just a much needed vent. Im so fucking done. ,u/Lil_Cl0rox,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b1mvy4/just_a_much_needed_vent_im_so_fucking_done/,antiwork,"Preface: this will be quite a lot as I have been holding all these feelings in for about a year. So most of this might just be manic gibberish. But it’s how I really feel so feel free to read if you want.



I am so done. I have been with this fast food/restaurant style company for over a year now, and am just realizing how cultish this place is. 

All the toxic positivity, making me feel like there’s something wrong with me and that’s why i am not succeeding in the company. All the gaslighting they do. The fact that they dangle a dollar bill in front of you acting like they will give you a raise soon because you go the extra mile when it comes to work. But instead they keep you at 12/hr the whole time, and then wonder why you’re upset. You jump when they say jump. 

 The fact that all of corporate will talk down to you like they’re still in the football locker room in high school. The owner comes in from time to time  and talks down to you like a manged dog. The fact that they literally never uphold their core Christian values of love positivity And leadership. They can brush of bullying in the workplace as “a humbling experience for you.” 

The fact that they literally cut me from full time to part time with no notice whatsoever. So now im scraping by just to pay rent have no benifits  and have to get a second part time job. This is just the very tip of the iceberg.

 The owner almost fired my friend because his dad had a stroke and he couldn’t make it to work.  I thought for so long that this is my only chance to make it in this world. And that there is truly something wrong with me. They broke my spirit. And build it back up in their own image. I can’t ever talk about this and there’s so much more shit they do that’s fucked up. But since most of their workers are either high schoolers with a high turnover rate or the same people that have been working there since it opened in 2010 there’s not much awareness of this butt fuckery.

 My mental and psychical  health has been greatly affected from trying to succeed in this company for various reason. Yet anytime I try to voice this it’s always a me problem. I’m sick of this shit. 

Read this or don’t. I just need somewhere to vent because this place is making me go absolutely insane. I’m so fucking done with it. Sorry this is a little hectic I’m just very manic at the moment. 

There’s way more I could tell that would make y’all really be scratching y’all’s head. I’m so deep in this I can’t even truly tell if I’m overreacting or this place is just that fucked up. With these people it’s profit Over everyone. They do some fucked up things just to save a penny. This place will burn you the fuck out. 

Sorry I just need to get this out. It’s been building up for a long ass time. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Peace ✌️

Front of house doesn’t get tips, and my boss has previously said that if we want to complain about this, then we should just find a different job. He’s lied about tips going to chefs but they don’t receive them either, so they’re definitely going to my boss. I’ve also seen him 

Normally I’d file a complaint to labor department but another issue came up with my coworkers being undocumented.

My coworker, Mark, has a work visa for a teaching job, and he works under the table, but he’s not paid his full hours and he’s not paid on time. They owe him 800$+. I have 2 other coworkers who also are on visitor visas, one of which is a chef and is owed 1k$+ and the other is front of house and also doesn’t get tips.

My concern is that us filing complaints might spark an investigation that could lead to their visas being taken, but all of them need the money. I’m not in it for the money, but I deeply concerned for their situations and I have no idea of what to do.

tldr undocumented coworkers that need the money but are underpaid, no one gets tips, don’t want coworkers to be screwed."

Last week he called me in for a 1on1. Corporate BS for the first 5 minutes how difficult it was. The word promotion comes along. He was so sorry that my promotion wasn't approved but he would make sure I would get promoted in the next round, next year. Reason why I didnt get promoted was other countries had to many seniors. 

Now comes the kicker. He was pleased to tell me that my significant pay raise was approved. My new procentual increase is...... 2% gross on my anual salary. I would be getting net around 50 bucks extra. My rent increased with 20 bucks, healthcare with 15, internet with 10. City tax went from 360 annually to 420 and so have other stuff increased.

Let me just say, I'm talking about the people that genuinely try.

I (30m) have tried and tried the last 15 years to hold down a job and have never had much luck. Idk if it's my severe ADHD (used to be medicated growing up) or if my brain just works in a funny way. I've gone to school 3 times since I graduated HS. 1st time was Graphic design at 19, then Culinary at 21, dropped out the 2 times because of life events, but finished the 3rd and got my CDL last year. The other end of things is, it seems I'm always a target at work places as well. 

Let me explain: my own fault is, I get bored of things.. SUPER fast. And I get so bored that my mind says ""this isn't worth it, time to find something new"" within the first 6 months of working somewhere. Especially if it's super repetitive. I hate repetitivenes so much, so if I'm on a assembly line you can bet I'm only gonna be there 2 months max.

The other side: as I stated before, alot of these places, I seem to be a target for people. Idk if it's cuz of the way I look, or present myself. I'm pretty laid back-get along woth most- kind of guy. I was raised to always be polite and respect your higher ups. But it seems, that gets me in trouble? Like if I'm not disrespectful to my boss they don't like me? I've heard almost every excuse as to why they are firing me 8 months later. And I have some great examples.

1: a few years ago I was working in a lab for making eyeglasses. It wasn't a hard job, pay was me, buy I was actually enjoying myself. Me and the big guy got along really well, went out for drinks a few times after work, he also invited my family over to have dinner with his once in awhile. He constantly complimented me on my soeed and accuracy and we even held competitions to see who could make the most glasses by the end of the day(i let him beat me a few times lol) All around great guy. One day he hired a new manager for the lab so that he wouldnt need to be in the lab so often, cool great. I introduced myself and was super nice and showed her around the lab. Within three days of her hire I get pulled to the office with a FINAL WARNING, no notice beforehand. This b**th told him that I was: A-Slacking. B-Was found sleeping on multiple occasions???? and that i was quote ""a displeasure to work with"" I asked him straight up ""wth man??"" Him:""I'm sorry idk where she got this from buy I have to do something and make an example"" 
8 months in..

2: I went to school and got my CDL, I was HYPED. I was ECSTATIC. Finally something I've always wanted to do that paid AMAZING. My trainer was the best guy I could have asked for. The route I was on was awesome I was home every weekend.this was my career and the place I knew I was gonna be at till I die. 3 months off on my own, I'm at one of my pickups. Trailer wasn't ready. Call dispatch and they tell me ""well, just come back to the terminal, that trailer isn't gonna be ready for a few days. Your empty right? Cool yeah just come back and we will fix you up with another load tomorrow"" so I head out. Now keeping in mind this was during the worst winter my state has had in 30 some odd years. I always stopped if the weather was bad. Never had any accidents always passed inspections. Never had any problems. Weather that night was decent, cold, buy good enough the roads were clear. Except one little tiny spot of black ice. 40 min away from the terminal. I saw it and slowed to 35mph, still slide off the road and into the ditch. Scared the F**K outta me, but no harm. No damage to anything except a small spot in the bumper. Called it in they made sure i was okay. Tow truck pulled me out and I drove the rest of the way back. 
Fired me next day...3 months into my new career. Ruled ""too fast for conditions""

Idk man, I must have the shittiest luck and a bad thought process I can't seem to change. I wanna state too that, I have kids and married. My kids are well taken care of and my wife is too. I ALWAYS help out around the house. I do things without her even asking. My wife is a SAHM and I'm the ""breadwinner"" (if you can even call it that) if I'm in the middle of a game and she asks me to do something I don't even hesitate. My kids need or won't something? I don't even hesitate. I find a way to get money for them. My wife is patient (thank the freaking gods) with me. Does she want me to do better? Of course she does and I genuinely try and do my best. I wish I could be one of those guys that has the numbing mindset of ""this is where I'm staying for the next 40 years"" ...but I'm not.

My main take away here is, I'm tired of being seen as, or hearing others being called a ""loser"" or a ""deadbeat"" etc. just because someone can't hold down a job. Especially if they are in the same predicament. Even more so with the job crisis and housing crisis. Sometime i sit back and think whats the freaking point? Im never gonna own a house even if i made 6 figures a year. 


There are exceptions to this obviously but I'm not talking about them. "

It's not only been reported that more than 50% of Americans are struggling paycheck to paycheck due to corporate greed (not because of personal choices) and half of US tenants can't afford to pay their rent, we also know that the restaurant industry [has spent decades fighting wage increases for their employees ](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/17/us/politics/restaurant-workers-wages-lobbying.html)in a nationwide lobbying campaign.

And now Wendy's, of all corporations, is investing $20 million dollars into themselves so they can display fluctuating menu prices during rush hour without at all compensating their workforce. Dynamic pricing and surge pricing *fast food*.  I can only imagine other companies normalizing this practice, forever fattening their pockets and the firm's by stealing our wages.

I think the employees of Wendy's should organize and respond to their upcoming strategy. Boycotting is a good start, but the real power is in our labor and withholding it. 

No labor = no production = no profit


They can..

⚔️ Unionize and/or organize a strike. The strike should not be announced with a start or end date. If you can't afford to, we could organize strikes in bursts or we can develop mutual aid. People can just stay home and don't go into work. The strike should advocate for livable wages, benefits, and increased pay during rush hour if the prices of their frostys and burgers are surged. 

⚔️ Switch jobs on a mass scale to short Wendy's employment. If you can't afford to strike or don't have the energy and time to organize one, this is a more realistic option.


⚔️ If possible, join in arms with gig workers from companies Uber and Lyft. They have been vocal about their own exploitation, surge pricing, and treatment. Even more ideally, we can encourage McDonald's employees to stand in solidarity as well. A McDonald's strike/mass job change is honestly long overdue. 

Last year we've seen spikes in the labor movement both in America (Starbucks unionization, Writers/Actors guild strike, UPS strike etc) and globally in France (retirement age increase protests). Some movements more successful than others, some ongoing. I want us to have hope and reliance in one another to make real change. We are all tired of wage slavery and corporate greed. "

The staff handling the most critical parts of the company are more burned out and underpaid than ever. The people answering the phones are temp workers and contractors who aren’t trained at all in local information so unless it’s strictly a billing or appointment question there’s a solid 25% chance you’re just going to get hung up on or lied to. You may get lucky and get someone who knows what they’re talking about or you’ll get someone who has no idea what they’re doing and aren’t getting paid enough to care. There have been a bunch of cases where people paid money they shouldn’t have because one medical didn’t do their billing correctly. Racist staff have been reported to HR but havent gotten punished or corrected at all. It’s run by a person who ran call centers and you can tell. The doctors are also being asked to do shorter visits soon.

Amazon bought them and made one medical do the first mass layoff it’s ever done and they fired people doing critical tech security and data protection without replacing them. A lot of the people fired were known to be vocal and supportive of lower staff members while toxic individuals who had been at the company for a much shorter time got to stay. The amazon employees were apparently making fun of the one medical ones for being so upset because “this is what amazon does”.

Honestly I think one medical is still worth it for a lot of patients and I’m not going to say they’re wrong. Healthcare sucks here and one medical is better than most doctors offices. Just know they’re mistreating their staff and there’s no guarantee how far amazon is going to get into one medical. They care way more about money than the patients now.

If you’re a patient at one medical and you haven’t already left, you should ask about their financial assistance program that people are trained not to tell you about. "

At the beginning I thought the manager was really lovely and chill. He trusted us to do our jobs without much intervention and was generally always in a good mood. He always releases the roster around 6pm on a Sunday and at first I was understanding because everyone was still finding their feet and he had a lot on his plate, but almost 3 months later he is still releasing the roster at 6pm on a Sunday, the day before the new work week starts. 


I had to travel interstate on Sunday to see Taylor Swift, so I asked him on Friday if the roster would be out before Sunday and he threw a massive tantrum. He said “yes, the roster will be out before Sunday if people stop changing their minds on what days they want to work!!” and then it sounded like he said “FUCK OFF” and slammed the door. I had to go in the room he had confined himself in (lucky me) so while I was in there I asked him if that was aimed at me. He said no, that someone else is currently asking to switch days, but then launched into a tirade about me. The reason people are always asking to swap shifts is because he sucks at making rosters. He’s constantly changing our start times or days. Just when you think you’re getting regular hours, he will put out a new roster and have you working the Monday even if you’ve never worked a Monday before, or he’ll suddenly put you on night shift when you always work mornings.  I have only asked to swap shifts twice in my entire time there, and he said yes to both times. 


I have previously asked him not to roster me to finish at 9:15pm and then have me starting at 7am the next day but he keeps doing it, which is why I asked to swap one of those times. He started ranting about the legal minimum being 10 hours between shifts and that I can go call fair work. I have never threatened to call fair work on him or made any sort of complaint about him, but now he is telling people I have threatened to call fair work on him and that he is “not scared” and “wont stand for it”. He has already deleted one of my management shifts this weekend without telling me and has given it to the other duty manager. I think he is getting ready to fire me. 


My manager hates being questioned on things that force him to confront the fact that he is incompetent and useless at his job. Everyone is scared to ask for solutions to problems in the work place because he takes it as a personal attack and shuts it down. He hires people and doesn’t train them and then fires them for not being good enough. He’s an incompetent asshole and I’m glad to be leaving. "

In my previous posts on this subreddit, I mentioned that my job put me on an improvement plan, I also mentioned that I've been doing the job of 3 people. It was like an open secret, everyone knew that I was overworked but didn't really do anything about it. I work, or worked in a non-profit, so going above and beyond for pennies kind of came with the territory.

This might sound a bit ranty, but I think the two things that pissed me off about the firing was:

1) I'm coming back from bereavement, though I lost my person at the beginning of the month, I didn't give myself a chance to really rest and process that. I took two days and went back to work. When I found out about the funeral/remembrance events in advance, I took two work days off. I even emailed them the day before hand to tell them I will be taking these days and to please not contact me as I won't be in the headspace to really work.

2) My coworker (same position), kind of had the tendency to throw me under the bus. Yes, he did his job (which he was hired for) well, but when it came to running afterschool clubs and brain breaks (going into high school freshmen classrooms) he checked out. Leaving me to do more of the work. Not only that, but not once but twice has he embarrassed me during work meetings with our boss and her boss attending.

My coworker texted me about an hour ago asking if I was ok, and if it were legal for me to give them ideas (I was the idea guy and the creative one), even if I could, I don't want to.

If you have not been given a payoff notice but you don’t trust your company 
1. Check the warn notices in your state Google warn “your state” . 
2.  Check the SEC security and exchange commission website for new aqustions . 
3. If you don’t find any information but still don’t trust them save as much money as you can. Get on a budget and know where your money is going and see what you can save. 

Layoff with notice 
Before you go to your layoff meeting. 
1.Be prepared to Negotiate your medical/ COBRA coverage and cash severance. Get as much as you can. I have seen executives get as much as 18 months. 
2. Clean out your desk . 

laid off without notice. 
1. file for unemployment asap ! 
2. Get on phone with hr and as about a severance if you have not already. 
3. If you take any kinds of meds go to the pharmacy and request a vacation or lost/ stolen override to get your prescriptions filled , they may have to get permission from the insurance company but that way you have meds for a moment. The my will charge a copay. this will buy you time for getting some health coverage. Most insurance plans don’t terminate until
The end of the month. 
4. Take your unemployment letter and sign up for discount power or gas programs from your utilities. 
5. Know where your local food banks are. 
6. No eating out . 
7. Make a budget with your new unemployment income and stay on it. 
8. Get to know what public transportation is close to you if any, it may be a cheaper way to travel. 
9. Get a 1099 side hustle do some you enjoy. 
10. Clean out your closet go thru those boxes whatever you don’t use sell it on Facebook market place , e bay , Mercari Poshmark ect for extra cash.
11. Get up everyday with intention get dressed bathe just like you did when you went to work , instead you will use this time to figure out your next move, take time do take a walk around the block and read those pile of books. Enjoy your life. Take the time to really figure out what you want to do. 

You will survive this. Good luck and good speed.

She never responds to any message I send about my shifts. When she sees me at work it’s all smiles and fake positivity. 

I’m not the only one who got their hours cut like this too , 3 other coworkers had theirs cut from 40 to 29 and 25 for another. When I check the schedule every week there’s always a select few (like 5 people) that always have 40 hours no matter what. 

Before some might say it’s not performance wise because the boss always compliments me on my work and my peers know I never miss a day or mess up at work. 

Have any of you been in this position ? It feels like it’s intentionally done not to fire me or something but like favoritism around work simply because I don’t participate much in their dumb talks about relationship drama, dogs and weed. This really pissed me off because I needed full time like they told me so I can pay off my debts.

I tried to do all the right things.  I went to college and I had a job offer with the first company that interviewed me before I even finished school.  But just like with all the jobs before I got fired from all the jobs after college.  Attention to detail was a problem but the #1 things that kept coming up was ""i don't work well with other people""

I was diagnosed adhd, aspergers, neural divergent, possibly autistic, with social anxiety cranked to 11.  I've been thru so many companies in the wind industry that I've made a name for myself.  

When covid hit I started doing gig work, doordash and Uber, to keep money coming in.  And the truly pathetic part is these gigs are my longest running ""job"" I've ever had, twice as long as anything else.  We'll sadly I've lost one of my gigs due to low customer ratings.  That's nearly 500 a week I'll no longer be able to make.  

I'm screaming into the void here, I know everyone on this sub is struggling.  I'm literally sick to my stomach.  My (lack of) people skills keeps costing me jobs.  42, never even owned an apt.

Just look at the jobs online, it's non stop bullshit jobs.  Either exploitative minimum wage or jobs that require a theoretical degree in physics.  I've got heavy industry and equipment experience.  WHERE ARE THE FICKING JOBS!  I'm so sick of seeing monthly ans quarterly reports on how well the economy is doing.   It doesn't help that I live in the middle of fucking no where and I'm in no position to move.  On that note, how do people do that?  How the fuck do people pack their lives and move for a JOB?  I've rarely held a job past a year.  I can't imagine having the career security to move for a job.

Until today the communication from company leadership has been that things are going well, revenues have been growing (although “behind plan”), there’s plenty of money in the bank, there are *no plans* for layoffs, etc.

But suddenly today there’s a need to let a group of people go. All the usual corporate euphemisms were chanted. Amongst all the bullshit the one comment that stood out to me referenced “the board” applying pressure to cut costs. In my opinion they basically did an impromptu stack ranking of employees and cut the bottom ~10% who apparently weren’t doing enough.

Maybe some of what I’m feeling is a sort of survivors guilt. I’ve been unexpectedly laid off before. It’s horrible. Like most of the people on this sub I’m a working class person. It’s never fun to suddenly be out of work with the clock ticking to find a new job before you burn through all your savings (who has much of any?) and all the stress and anxiety and uncertainty.

But mostly I feel completely exhausted mentally. Today I’m even feeling exhausted physically. Generally just feeling like shit. Maybe it’s some sort of trauma response. For fucks sake, you can never be too comfortable having a job. The threat of losing your job is always near. You can never fully believe company leadership. Of course they’ll lie about layoffs being off the table when they really are. They ***need*** us to keep working our asses off until the very end before swinging the axe. They want us to live in fear and keep quiet.

I graduated college in 2008 and struggled through the nightmare of the *Great Recession*. I spent years grinding my ass off and getting nothing for it. The pandemic fucking sucked. I only recently started to feel like I was finally getting ahead. And then today I’m reminded that all the gains I’ve made can be undone through no fault of my own. I can never make enough progress to be fully free of this nightmare.

And I’ve got at least another 30 years of this bullshit to look forward too…"

Relocated to this very expensive location in FL at a cost of ~$10,000 (apartment fees, first months rent, furniture, dishes, etc). They recruited me hard and told me I had a bright future with the company. They even flew me to their headquarters in the northeast US twice and took me to very expensive dinners to wine & dine me. Now I’ll have to most likely break my lease ($3,500 + moving costs) because I can’t afford to live here making less than I was. 

It’s late in the hiring season for my profession. I’ve had some recruiters say that hiring doesn’t pick back up until August/September. The tough part is that I didn’t want to move here in the first place but came for the job. If I had known there was even a 5% chance of layoffs I wouldn’t have taken the job. I asked each of the 4 people I interviewed with what the possibility of layoffs were if the market continued to decline, and they all said “don’t worry, we’ve never laid anyone off”. 

They only offered 1 month severance which I feel is a slap in the face… I know it could be worse but my state doesn’t help unemployed people and only cares about big business. 

Has anyone else been laid off after such a short amount of time? I feel like most businesses budget for 1-3 years at minimum. They were paying me significantly more than everyone else in my position (~$30,000/yr) but I have ~6 years of experience. "

New VP of IT comes in about 8 months ago. I knew from the start that the clock was ticking because he wanted to replace the in-house team with companies.  Today I’m notified that my position is being eliminated and they revoked my access, but my last day will be on 3/15.  From now till then I’ll be providing transition assistance, which there are a decade’s worth of institutional knowledge to get out
The  thing I’m concerned about out is that after that two weeks is up, they’re offering me 16 weeks of severance pay, but I wont get that agreement  until my last official day, so I don’t know what it contains and theres no guarantee that it won’t be reduced or retracted.  
Any thoughts on how I I shouldn’t approach this?"

I really hate it. It's very boring, all you hear is keyboards knocking and people talking over each other. It's not comfortable in any way.

You have to commute to get to work, then work your hours, most likely eight hours if not more.

Even if the work itself is pretty ok with little stress, the setting of the office is just not for me. For boomers, they love the office. And for the employeers, they really love the office and wants everyone to come in, just so that they can justify the rent for an office space or whatever.

I really hate working in an office. Not sure what other jobs there are that are more interesting but offers somewhat some flexibility."

6,2024-02-28,Made redundant whilst applying for a mortgage,u/Boppy_29,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b21ant/made_redundant_whilst_applying_for_a_mortgage/,antiwork,"I worked for a company in an area I was passionate about (making educational resources) for 5 years. I often needed to work a lot of extra hours sometimes late into the night/weekends/holidays to meet the deadlines. I had been getting a bit burnt out but I was feeling like I was recovering. 

They've just fucked me over completely. At the beginning of February I told my boss that I was going to take a week off to find a property. We found the perfect flat and couldn't believe it was in our price range. We did an inspection on the flat and everything was fine. I was super excited. 

I've had a really shitty last few months for other reasons and so I needed a glimmer of light. 

We started talking to a mortgage broker and he assured us that the property was well within our price range. So we signed a contract and handed over 26,000 euros in earnest money, which was ALL my savings. 

My boss and bosses boss, knew this was all happening and didn't say anything to me about my job being at risk. 

Then a week later I get tapped on the shoulder and sent to HRs office. I'm being made redundant for organisational reasons. I'm assured that it was nothing to do with my performance. They tell me to hand over my laptop and send me home there and then. 

Now, the mortgage brokers say they can no longer work with us and I'm worried sick. Literally vomiting multiple times a day, can't eat, can't sleep for more than 2 hours at a time. It looks like we won't be able to get a mortgage and that we'll lose our earnest money. I was told even if I get a job now I'd need 6 months experience to qualify, so I'm screwed. 

Could they really have not waited 2 months? Told me sooner, or fired me earlier? It seems like they deliberately waited until the worst possible time to fuck me over the most. 

Can't even think about looking for another job right now. I'm too much of a mess. 

I have some ideas of educational resources I'd like to make and would love to see if I can make it work on my own. Wish I had the energy to do this instead of being consumed by worries about the mortgage. If this had happened at any other time I feel like I could have put a positive spin on things. 

**I feel like I never want to work for a company ever again.** 

Has anyone been through a situation like this and got out the other side? What did you do?

A friend mentioned this subreddit; I wanted to see what you all thought of this— so I’ll throw in some background information about myself and the role to hopefully help. 

I live in South Carolina. I’m in a new role for the county Chamber of Commerce as director of xyz (leaving out some personal details). In my interview and the job description, there was no mention of contract work or anything that would have me believe I was anything other than an employee. Job description just mentions “fellow employees” but neither calls me an employee or an independent contractor.
I have to go into the office M-F 9-5 and have specific tasks/roles to fill. I have my own office where I am supposed to be once we finish renovating the office for opening next week.
I filled out the W-9 honestly without thought because I just was excited and didn’t realize what it was. I was working on my own upcoming taxes and had the thought of “oh I wonder what a W-9 is all about”— and here we are. 

I don’t know if the other admin assistant was given a W-9 as well. I don’t know if the president of the chamber operates on one either. I hope to find answers to these today when I go to work.

There’s other stupid shit going on in the office like throwing Amazon purchases away instead of returning them (essentially throwing away money that was donated to help us renovate the office). I’m also the oldest in the office at 29 (30 in April); the president is a large handful of years younger and the other admin he hired is just a year younger than him and a close family friend of his.

I want to give the situation the benefit of the doubt, but my spidey senses are tingling— I have really good bullshit detector/getting that feeling when something isn’t right.

Sorry for the super long post— any advice on how to handle the situation? I’m not opposed to working as an IC if the arrangement can be of benefit to me (wfh flexibility), but not if I don’t have the flexibility and have to file extra taxes."

3,2024-02-28,My Job is Making Me Work 2 Jobs For 2 Separate Companies But Is Only Paying Me for 1. Is This Legal?,u/ScottyAyyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b23g7d/my_job_is_making_me_work_2_jobs_for_2_separate/,antiwork,"So I work as an accountant for a very small company that works in the medical industry. We contract doctors out to emergency rooms. Up until January 1st we had a subsidiary telemedicine branch that was spun off as its own company. The telemedicine company has a separate federal tax ID number and I have been going through the process of registering the company as a sole entity in all states we do business. The 2 companies are not even run by the same people and have 2 separate CEO’s. The telemedicine company still rides off of our 401k plan, insurance policies, all of that, and then pays us back in the form of monthly “management fees.”

Well my boss has been very secretive about what is included in the management fees and I think I found out why - my company does not charge them ANYTHING for the accounting work I do. I personally am processing their payroll, making accruals, analyzing their financials, everything accounting and finance related and apparently it’s all done on “goodwill”. 

Under normal circumstances I wouldn’t think it’s that big of a deal, but my pay is absolute trash. According to a recruiters report that was just released I’m being paid like 20% below the low-end of fair market value for my position. I’m living paycheck to paycheck and don’t feel good about being required to do free work for this telemedicine company while the CEO is paying himself over $500k a year through 3 separate income streams (I process payroll so I know exactly what he’s getting paid).

My question is, is this legal? Can the old parent company require me to do work for a company that is by all definitions its own separate entity? This was not a discussion when I was being interviewed. They never revealed plans to spin off this other company. It was just kinda sprung on me in October. It has in many respects doubled my workload doing the same tasks for 2 companies instead of 1. Idk, it’s hard for me to believe that they can legally require me to work an unpaid job or retaliate against me for refusing to do it without pay."

3. How do you feel about the customization of resumes? Do you think an automated tool can effectively highlight your strengths for specific roles?

Proponents of Communism love proclaiming ""that wasn't true Communism, true Communism has never been tried.""

I was, until a few days ago, firmly against that second line. Then I found out Marx hated the State, too, and wanted no part of it. Oops. Well, live and learn, right?

I still mostly stand by my stance at the time, however. Capitalism is, at it's heart, the implicit acknowledgement and understanding that you as a person own yourself. Communism, near as I can tell, is the understanding that you belong to your neighbors, and vice versa. Initially, I believed it meant that you belonged to the State, as did your neighbors.



No one really likes to hear that ""Capitalism is bad"" stuff. At the same time, those same people that hate hearing it will agree that it is pure villainy what (for example) Ford is doing, with their subscriptions for heated seats, remote start, and other systems that are PHYSICALLY ALREADY PRESENT ON THE VEHICLE YOU ALREADY BOUGHT AND PAID FOR!!!
Ahem. Excuse, I tend to get a little worked up sometimes, when I find that my ownership was stolen from me.

The problem is Corporatism, and I believe we should start making this distinction known. If we do not, and instead continue to blame Capitalism for our woes, the architects of our destruction will scamper away in the night when this system falls, having never once been remotely in danger of smelling the consequences coming over the horizon. Corporations have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to make profit. That's it. That is their sole purpose for existing. (Ford v Dodge, when Ford tried to raise his worker's pay.)
Corporatism is serfdom, hiding as Capitalism or Communism. In a Capitalist society, we serve the Corporate Lords. Amazon, Ford, Microsoft, Walmart. In a Communist society, they served the Corporate Lords. The State.
Regardless of how they dress it, the result is the same. Feudal Lords, ruling over serfs who live in utter squalor. Serfdom was the worst system created IMHO, and we cannot afford to allow the Lords to make a comeback, particularly in America, where we fought a war to get away from Kings and Lords.
We cannot allow this to remain unchecked. You say ""Capitalism is bad"", and the normies will ignore anything else you have to say, but say that ""Corporatism is bad"", and they'll ask you what in the blue hell Corporatism is, because they've never heard of it.
Don't attack the body, attack the cancer. You'll get further.

Like, maybe it's just me but I was on Sertraline for a couple of years and it just made me feel kinda nauseous. I stopped taking it, quit my job and was a stay at home mom for a hot second and I was as content as a clam at high tide but my fiance also had expectations and kept my ass *busy*. I honestly think it's because SSRI's try to fix a chemical imbalance and I don't have one: my work life just sucked and my brain was wise enough to advise me it was so. At the time I believe I was working for the guy that said that ""autistic people (like me, which he didn't know) should be culled at birth so society wouldn't have to deal with ~them~ [me]"". He then handed me a personal set of keys for the shop and left for the day, which I've always thought was funny. I guess I'm the kinda socially awkward kind of autistic that just happens to really like airplanes, and not low-verbal and semi-lucid like he expected. 

But anyways I digress. It's not that I don't want to work. One of my special interests is metal fabrication and machining, and I've been very proactive in buying tools whenever I can. I *love* building things, and I'm particularly good with jewelry and motorcycles. My problem is that at this point I'm just plain terrified of getting bullied by management. One of my biggest social deficiencies is that I'm really bad at sticking up for myself particularly if there is a hierarchy. Like I started getting ""unofficial write ups"" every week for saying things like ""could you please look at this stone, it looks to me like it's loose in its setting"" to the jeweler that worked on the piece. This was at the jewelry shop I worked at, and one of my jobs was to look for loose stones in rings. He wanted me to tell them how nice it looked for 45 seconds first or they would ""feel like I'm telling them what to do"". Like... what? Nevermind that I'd just been in contact with HR because certain perfumes in the office were setting off my asthma and they'd just rolled out a low-scent policy. At the time I had no idea I should've lawyered up but I'm pretty mad I didn't now. I even had recordings of them blatantly violating the ADA.

But anyways, how do you all keep going even when psychiatric intervention proves ineffective? I have had several therapists and a couple of psychologist; talked to them all through the stuff mentioned here and some other stuff and all they had to say was ""that's terrible, nobody should be treating you like that"". I'm kind of at a loss in terms of what to do. The anxiety keeps me up sometimes at night, and crying at interviews is generally seen as a bad sign lol. "

Hoping someone could help  me with different perspectives.   

&#x200B;

I make good money in this position, but it's making me increasingly  stressed and feeling worthless. I've been unmotivated even to do things that I like to do in my spare time. I feel depression creeping up on me,  I've gained weight and stopped doing things that I like, including  good/healthy habits, it even affected my sleep schedule (been sleeping  like 12 hours a night and still waking up tired).   

I have enough money to pay my bills (which are not much) for months  ahead, and I'd get some more money from quitting as well (I'm in Brazil  so not sure if it's like that everywhere).   

I feel that I need a couple months to put my mind back into place  before going into the next job, so I'm not sure if applying for other  jobs and leaving after getting one would be the best option. I would  also be doing research during this time and catching up on errands and  random tasks, so it wouldn't be 100% idle.   

And lastly, I have a pretty good resume compared to the grand  majority of my co-workers, and looking around on LinkedIn reveals kind  of the same thing. So i \*believe\* it wouldn't be that hard to find  another job a few months from now.

They are closing the call ques early and we have our department meeting then having the event from 4-6. It’s gonna have food and drinks (all things they can write off on taxes). Yet for those of us that work from home and don’t want to come in we get punished by having to work the last 2 hours on “offline tasks”. Then on March 1st they are encouraging people to send of badges on this point system we have called BRAVO, and mind you we have to pay taxes on their points too. Not even to give us points to spend on the crap in the store, just NFT looking badges. No bonuses, no raises, just food and drinks but only if you show up.

Fast forward about a month and a half and we met for lunch and to catch up at which time he dropped the bombshell that he is covering his expenses just fine for now while unemployed and looking for work.  

He crunched some numbers and as it turns out the cost of going to work (he had a long commute so fuel, meals, vehicle wear and tear et-al) was costing him around $550/month (sometimes more) and with that expense gone unemployment was enough.  His blood pressure has also gone down for the first time in several years, he's not exhausted all the time and he can't believe how much more time he has to ""do stuff"" now that he's not spending over 2 hours a day commuting."

1,2024-02-28,A supervisor I had made me see things even more clear then ever before ,u/CommonGardenGrub,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b283ss/a_supervisor_i_had_made_me_see_things_even_more/,antiwork,"I have had this on my mind for months now and I need somewhere to share my experience with a former supervisor.

Read this and know this is why you join a union, this is why you go to whatever local government body you can if your employer pulls anything illegal, and this is why so many people have and will continue to have the mentality that employers would take the first chance to screw us over for profit so why should we show anything other then the bare minimum respect.

My previous supervisor was an immigrant and he could barely speak English. He couldn't pronounce words vital he needed to for his job and a co worker would occasionally have to translate for me.

This wouldn't be so problematic if he wasn't extremely racist. On two occasions he'd start ranting about too many immigrants and how they mooch of our government for free education and how they would take roles without being able to ""speak our language"". 

In another rant he ranted how he had to pay property taxes. In Australia you don't pay those on your place of residence he was talking about a second property of his and in this exact same rant, same day as one of the racist ones, he complained how no one wanted to work anymore.

He then spoke to a co worker how his rental only had female tenants and another co worker got upset because it's not good not having a man in the house and then saying ""I kick them out I sorry but I would throw them out!"".

This supervisor would frequently be on his phone during work hours. Short form content out loud all day, talking to a builder about a property he owns, etc.

A lot of people who worked there would play short form content out loud. I guess I was misguided in thinking only people 25 and below were addicted but it's terrifying to see how bad it was in person. Losing track halfway through conversation, forgetting to do work, not being able to maintain focus on anything.

The only time it wasn't short form might be triggering for some. Skip the next paragraph if you could be upset by SA and similar topics.

My supervisor played out loud a text to speech story of a woman being sexually assaulted. Gruesome details I won't go into here, more detail then you'd need to confirm the topic. This is the point that even after a lot of bullying I stopped caring about my job.

This supervisor was not the only problematic person there. From the only member of HR personally coming to my desk trying to pry into my personal life and shouting slurs at me when the answers weren't to her satisfaction (I never yelled, never insulted, I constantly tried to calm her down), to a manager telling me ""You can report bullying but nothing will happen"" (I never used the term bullying first), to my hours being changed as retaliation for me trying to report bullying, and so much more.

The manager who said that told me him, my supervisor, and the member of HR all have strained relationships with their family, their kids. I really didn't need to know all the personal information he randomly dumped on me, I certainly didn't ask, but jeez I wonder why.

He also tried starting an argument with me about something that I didn't care about that happened months ago. I just nodded my head and he eventually calmed down. If you've ever dealt with an angry boomer in retail or hospitality you'd know this exact feeling.

No I'm not going to name this business. I want nothing to do with these people. They're sad, lonely boomers who will leave no real accomplishments behind. No loved ones. Only people hoping they're still in their will.

They believe making money for someone else is an accomplishment. Some still have a mortgage at an age you can only be shocked, they never talk about what they did on the weekend, no projects their working on, no movies they've seen. Just hollow.

They don't make anything, they don't provide a memorable service. Just cheap plastic, cheap imported goods, cheap everything. They used the term ""We make cheap goods"" and ""We're not some boutique"" themselves.

The owner has a massive ego but he's just another rich white guy who has more land then anyone but a farmer could use to make society better. One of the many people who couldn't answer the question ""So how did you get ahold of all this land?"" with a straight face.

One of the many people his age who only have money yet nothing can fill the hole.

They'll be miserable for the rest of their lives then forgotten. Maybe one will see this, they'll know the quotes are them, maybe try suing for defamation. But this Reddit account has no name to it.

I never shared the ""behavioural issues"" one your managers described it with other managers or supervisors. You'd be telling on yourself.

Nothing mentioned here was shared with co workers either. Everything you said, everything you did when it was one on one stayed that way.

I've taken off every job site I worked for you, I've never put it on my resume, and there's nothing on my Reddit account connecting me to your business or even saying what industry it's in. My name isn't on here either, nor my face. No easily identifiable details.

If you're wondering why I feel the need to add the little personal message it's because, for reasons I won't put down due to a privacy issue, they may very well see this post.

If they or you are wondering did I try reporting the bullying anyway I didn't. Why? Well it's because 

1. Their bullying cost them money with no involvement from me. In fact I tried stopping one of the higher level staff from doing what they were doing.

2. I'm under no obligation to try helping them if help is met with hostility, I've raised the issue multiple times, and I'm not longer your employee.

3. Customers have been and will be exposed to all of their ""behavioural issues"" that their ""Too old now"" to change. My supervisor's phone is pretty loud. 

The point being is I've seen them trip over their own egos multiple times and everytime they did the consequences were worse. I don't want them to have a wake up call and other co workers refused to go to fair work or join a union.

Rest well everyone knowing the amount they lost is not insignificant. Not a fine, not some genius sabotage by me I pleaded with my supervisor and co workers to listen to me, I tried harder then anything to have someone take them seriously. Just karma I can't explain or it could reveal my identity.

For reasons I won't say as it could also identify me, as the reasons are specific to this business, I know they aren't doing well business wise mainly because a supervisor who had been there for a very long time told me they're not doing well business wise.

Remember everyone most employers only treat their employees to the bare minimum standard the law makes them and some don't even do that. You do not owe them more then they give.

Trying to work extra hard earns you more work, trying to improve the business will be met with punishment, and if you're minimum wage keep in mind that's your employer saying if they could pay you less they would.

I was given the option to resign by these people but I was already planning to leave. They made up they wouldn't have to pay me a week's worth of wages if I were to quit (no that's not true union confirmed but I already knew) but they said they would pay the last week of work out of generosity. I just nodded my head and got the hell out of there. 

The last words out of their mouths before I walked out will make sure I never forget the advice I gave in this post. If you made it to the end of my rant thank you and I'm sorry you've put up with me.

There are more things I experienced but those also happened to co workers and I'm not risking getting doxxed.

I knew that getting a B.A. in sociology with a specialization in human services would limit my career options, but I figured it wouldn't matter since I planned on earning my master's in counseling before entering the job market. But I realized a couple of semesters into grad school that I would hate being a therapist, so I decided to change career paths.

I was completely unprepared for how difficult the change would be. The only careers you can get with my degree and specialization are human services jobs, and while I do have one year of human services experience, companies are always looking for more experienced candidates (regardless of what they say on their job postings). The only human services jobs that I can get are menial as hell or pay worse than what my siblings earn from working at a god damn ice cream store.

I've tried applying to jobs that aren't related to human services, but it hasn't made a difference. At this point, I'm convinced I have to lie to get a job I don't hate. I only plan on fabricating my dates of employment and don't intend to apply to jobs I'm underqualified for, but I'm still reluctant to do so.

What if my references or previous employers find out that I lied? I can manage being blacklisted by a few companies I apply to, but I only have a handful of references and two human services companies that I can honestly claim to have worked for. If HR or a background check company asks them ""did x employee work from MM/YY to MM/YY,"" I'm worried they'll realize I lied. Would I be better off claiming that I worked for now-defunct companies and using my family members as references? Any advice would be appreciated, thank you."

You can get laid off at any time for no reason, you can get laid off as retaliation for doing something your boss doesn't like or because they want to hire someone else in your place and those who do it just claim it's for ""poor performance"" or something. People are being laid off just like that after a couple of weeks after moving across the states in order to work there and unless you still have a place to return to, you're absolutely fucked. Being a 7-month-pregnant woman doesn't seem to protect you from this, either. And it doesn't seem to me that you get unemployment benefits when being laid off.

You don't get any vacation, or maybe two weeks or something, if you're lucky. Having paid time off seems to be a luxury over there - I've seen screenshots on this Subreddit where employers asked for employees to ""donate"" their PTO. I mean, wtf? Who comes up with this shit? Your sick time is extremely limited (assuming that you have sick time in first place), too.

Having an insurance is a luxury, too. Once you get fired, you don't have an insurance anymore and if you get a stroke or catch a flu or something, the system basically tells you to fuck off and die. And even if you have an insurance, it's not guaranteed that it will give you what you need (not what you WANT, what you actually really NEED).

Basically, you don't work to live, you live to work and your salaries are often so small that you cannot even live from them.

On top of that, there is a constant risk of being killed by some firearm-wielding psycho. Not to mention the current actions of the MAGA cult.

Generally, when reading all these posts and screenshots, I'm wondering why you even let them do this to you? Have you never considered moving out of there? If you already have to move, why not move out of this country entirely? Is it due a lack of money or because you were born there and lived there your entire life? Are there also some good things we don't have over here in Europe? Am I wrong about something? Or is there another reason why you wouldn't leave a country that does such terrible things to you?"

Money is fictional.

Yet it determines most aspects of our lives, including how many years we must work. Under society’s games, we must work until we’re old and grey — or worse. Meanwhile, Nature stands behind the curtain with a very different view of when we could retire.

She thinks the answer is 12 years.

\------------------------------------------------------

Nature demands 10 hours per week.¹

That’s how much each working-age person (15–64) must work to provide everyone what they need. In other words, it’s the amount of work necessary to keep everyone alive and maintain a basic society.

Now, ten hours per week comes down to 25,480 hours over their working-age lives,² which corresponds to around 12 years of full-time work.³ In other words, if a person starts working at age 18, they could retire at 30. This wouldn’t give them a life of luxury, but it would give them — and everyone else — the freedom to do what they want with their lives. Whatever we do, the choice would be ours — whether we lie on the couch, work on projects, or spend time with family and friends.

**Let me say that again: from a physical perspective, we could retire by 30.** Meanwhile, in fictopistan, most governments only permit you to retire four decades later. As such, our technology enables an abundance of spare time and a good quality of life — but our economic system takes most of it away.

In practice, it’s unclear how close we can actually get to the physical limit. But one thing seems clear: the margin of error can’t be that large.⁵

In other words, there is a life after work.

But it’s being stolen from us.

\------------------------------------------------------

## Technical note: the 12-year estimate assumes productivity and the working-age population remain constant over time.

For the technically minded readers, the 12-year estimate assumes that productivity remains at 2019 US levels and that the percentage of the population doing the necessary work does not change over time. Changes in demographics — i.e. young and old in the population — could impact the latter, however, it’s impact is likely negligible for the foreseeable future.⁴

## Footnotes

¹According to my estimates, ten hours per week is the time per working-age person (age 15–65) required to provide everyone in the US population with a living-income worth of goods and services. For details, see [A 10-hour Workweek is Enough (To Satisfy Everyone’s Needs)](https://medium.com/@thetoblin/a-10-hour-workweek-is-enough-to-satisfy-everyones-needs-8203efb72b76).

²The necessary work an individual must perform throughout their lifetime was estimated by multiplying 10 hours per week with 52 weeks per year, and the number of years they must perform the work — i.e. the number of years they would be between ages 15 and 64. Concretely, 10*52*(64–15) = 25,480 hours.

³The 12 years of necessary work is based on taking the work an individual must perform throughout their lifetime and dividing it over 40-hour work weeks. Specifically, assuming they work 52 weeks per year, we get: 25,480 hours / (40 hours per week \* 52 weeks per year) = 12.25 years.

⁴From a physical perspective, an aging US population is estimated to require only 2 more hours per week in the coming 80 years (meaning 12 hours instead of 10). Consequently, population aging is likely not going to be a (physical) problem in the US for the foreseeable future. For details, see [Population Aging is Not a Real Problem in the US (Not Today, and Not For At Least 80 Years)](https://thetoblin.medium.com/population-aging-is-not-a-real-problem-in-the-us-not-today-and-not-for-at-least-80-years-c6f115054dd1).

The amount of people at each site is pretty small so everyone has their own office . One day i came to one of my sites and my office was given away to a man without my knowledge or consent. The onsite manager made this choice and never said anything about it until the end of my first day back at the site stating she wanted him closer to her office to be able to train him because he would be taking over for another employee who will be out on maternity leave ( this person going on mat leave office is closer to the onsite manager like literally next door  and has an extra desk in there. it would make sooooooo much more sense to place him in her office so he can shadow her, and the onsite manager can have even more access to him). I ended up staying a week at this site and went to my other site for two weeks assuming by the time i returned he would be moved to the now vacant office of the woman who went to mat leave.  So here is where the issue lies. I feel like putting someone in my office is very illogical. One there were two other offices that could have been used. The temp has an office which is unnecessary cause she spends 90% of her time filing and rarely sits in there and there is another office of a women that comes in once or twice a week at the most. Also, I should add that week when i initially returned the temp was out on vacation so the office was completely available. However, the onsite manager mentioned that their offices were too far away to walk back and forth to. Instead, i was displaced and put in a shared office across the hall from my office working on my laptop instead of my new double screened desktops which i was super excited to use cause my computer at this site was so bad and slow and i was tired of working of my laptop. I'm really pissed off cause I feel disrespected and not accounted for. At this point this man should be put in the office of the person he is covering for. Thoughts?"

There are many times you have to schedule 1:1  time with him if you need to discuss an issue with your work bc he is constantly in back to back calls/meetings. 

There are times I’m waiting for an opening all day only to hear him hang up a call, look up at me knocking, and give an exasperated sigh (I only come by when I can’t handle something on my own so he already knows there’s an issue if I show up). 

It doesn’t make me feel great that I’m not welcomed with reassurance that I’m not bothering him (certainly feels that way sometimes) but I man up and do what I need to get my job done. 

There’s been a reorganization at my company recently and the stress is higher than ever. 

We have a team meeting meant to serve as a forum for asking questions and communicate issues on projects any of us are working on so we all know what to do going forward. It helps ensure consistency. 

Recently on a team meeting I brought up something worked on that my manager rejected and I had to reclassify and pull all different forms/ documentation for. I said ‘I just want to ask so I know going forward if this type of project will always be classified this way?’.

Cue the long pause…. followed by a hasty ‘i can’t answer that type of question! It could be that category but I’m not going to say it will *always* be that category! Yeah I don’t know what to tell you” 

Dead silence on the call, everyone just gets quiet and now nobody wants to ask anymore questions. What ends up happening is the more Junior staff won’t ask him what they need and will approach us more seasoned veterans with questions that should go to him. Sometimes I know the answer and Sometimes I have no choice but to redirect them to him. 

It happens 1:1 too. We have engineers both on our team and in a different department since some projects require a different level of expertise. There was one engineer who was continually working with us but part of the other engineering team which was out of the norm. I needed an engineer to collaborate with and the ones on our direct team were all on other projects so off to my boss I went. “Hey, is X officially part of our team?”. Cue the death stare, long pause, followed by “Why? Don’t worry about X and who he reports to!”.

I was MORTIFIED. I stammered ‘i was just asking to see if I could use him as a resource on this project or if I needed to partner with him’. More glaring, a deep sigh, and ‘let me get someone for you’. 

I get that your stressed but making your team feel like they can’t ask questions just leads to poorer quality work. 

I’m just really getting sick of this *keep your head down, do your work, and don’t ask anything! If you have to redo work bc you couldn’t ask questions then oh well!*

I used to be a workaholic. I felt that my worth depended on how chaotic and stressed my work life was. I’d dedicate my entire life to work. 
Recently, after having my second baby, I’m going through the motions of getting ready to return to work next week as I spent my leave unpaid and was just lucky enough to get by. It’s enraging and makes me super depressed, leaving my 3 month old to a daycare. But that’s the reality we live in right? Okay cool, gotta work to support my precious babies. 
I’m DREADING the idea of feeling slaved again. I have to put my “I love my job & nothing else is more important than this job” mindset back on. I feel like it might be imposter syndrome. 
During my leave I was able to set up a new business and I’ve never been so HAPPY in my life. I was genuinely happy, creative and excited. And now I know I face little to no time to explore that again. I’ll be dedicating at least 40-50hrs a week (sometimes more) at my current job and it’s just eating me alive.

I was wondering if anyone knows if there’s any regulations in regards to when a manager should be posting the monthly schedule for those in the healthcare field (outpatient clinics like dialysis)?  

My employer will post the monthly schedule the day before the new month starts. I find this to be unfair and unprofessional. They will also abruptly change the schedule without notice and the updated schedule(s) are not always posted in the same spot. 

Complaints have been made but staff seems to be split on this. Some are upset by it but others (those with seniority) tend to have a predictable schedule or able to negotiate their days in advance. Manager will also refuse any accountability in updated schedules not being shared/communicated properly. 

Sorry for the bit of a rant, I’m very frustrated and have been applying to jobs elsewhere lol I just want to know if I’m entitled to any form of a predictable work schedule. "
12,2024-02-28,My last workplace was like an abusive partner and recognizing that pattern helped me finally quit,u/AnonPinkLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b2e6gn/my_last_workplace_was_like_an_abusive_partner_and/,antiwork,"Shit that happened:

1. They controlled our bathroom breaks, listened in to our every call and would aggressively disciplines us for just seconds of time spent not dealing with customers
2. They forced me to work 10 hour shifts for months at a time just to maintain my one accommodation which was that I could have lunch at the same time on a specific day of the week for my private virtual therapy sessions
3. They promised a promotion if I passed a certain qualifying test and then changed their mind and moved the goal post just because they could
4. Shortly after I started treating my mental health they silently demoted me without explanation and started to talk down to me and infantilize me as if I had told them I was severely disabled and functioning at a teenage level at most.
5. They trained me to be extremely aggressive at my job and assume every customer is lying and making excuses to the point that they practically dehumanized  customers and then struck down hard if we did exactly as we were told and didn’t use the “right tone”
6. They threatened to fire me for low numbers during a bad economic time where everyone was struggling and then complained that I wasn’t the happy go lucky worker I started as anymore due to their demoralizing treatment
7. They had frequent meetings with us but never wanted me to talk at all in them even when all I did was join in with regular conversation and show positivity to help my team members stay energized. They’d get bothered if I talked at all but claimed behind the scenes that they weren’t trying to silence me or spite me.

&#x200B;

What’s most interesting is I realized later the way they used tactics very similar to an abusive partner to keep me accepting all of this. Excuses such as “all jobs are like this, you should expect it, you won’t find better” which is highly reminiscent of an abusive partner telling you no one else will want you and you’re lucky to have them so don’t leave because you’ll just be alone. Another excuse I heard often was “If you can’t meet our standards it’s because you aren’t skilled enough” even if they expected you to work more hours than they paid or take more calls than you feasibly could, they’d tell you that it was always your fault for not meeting their demands. Then there was the constant putting us against each other. They’d claim we were a team but they constantly pit us against our coworkers aggressively and unfairly even if we weren’t very different shifts for example and as such had very different customer availability.

&#x200B;

If I had thought sooner to recognize how these same techniques were already familiar from past abusive relationships I would have realized sooner the pattern."

5,2024-02-28,Culture of surveillance ,u/auberryfairy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b2e8dm/culture_of_surveillance/,antiwork,"I had my updated performance evaluation yesterday. I met with my manager and our mutual supervisor. I was apprehensive about it because, in an organization-wide meeting, my manager raised his hand and asked how he could track calls made. (The implication being he wanted to track my and my colleague's calls made)

During the meeting, my supervisor spoke for my manager and prefaced it by saying she did not want to micromanage or “focus on the negative.” Then she said they noticed a decrease in activity in my calls made in December. She then turned to my manager and said, “So how is this relevant to her goals— I’m not sure it is.” 

He didn’t say anything. 

They then said that in the following months until now, there had been an improvement in my productivity. 

This confrontation makes me feel like an uncomfortable level of surveillance is happening from a position that I thought would be hands off. It also makes me feel like there is a lack of trust. There was no curiosity or empathy or concern. No check in. Just - we noticed you were not making enough calls. Which, in this role is kind of irrelevant if you are working on other things. You can do your job effectively without being on the phone all the time and this is not an accurate measure of productivity or success. 

I was so uncomfortable with the conversation that I did not ask about specifics. And they didn’t offer any specific details. 

I said if I could bring some insight to this — it’s personal. I’ve started a new medication that helps me regulate and stabilize anxiety levels. I started that after December. But I think that might be it. My supervisor said she completely understood. Then moved on to how I had improved.

Reflecting on the meeting has left me with feelings of resentment towards my micromanager. I’m working really hard today out of spite. And looking for jobs on my break."

I’ve been both a coordinator and an analyst within HR for three companies now in the last 2.5 years. I’ve moved companies three times now because I was apart of the tech layoffs twice in one year from my first two positions. 

Anyway! I’ve been at my current job for over a year now and I joined because I thought it’d be a great career pivot. I’m making substantially less than I was in my previous roles but I figured why not take the leap of faith as it was a good company, would be a better career in the long run and would hopefully help me avoid ANOTHER layoff. Fast forward a few months, I receive a new boss than who hired me, he absolutely doesn’t like me, never missed a chance to belittle me, doesn’t include me in team meetings and projects and verbally informs me within the first three weeks that he doesn’t understand where I “even fit in” on our team when I asked why I wasn’t being included in meetings/projects. That was last summer. Since September I’ve received another boss, who now has my previous boss as his boss. 

Things were going well with me and my new boss and he was making me feel like I was important to the team, giving me tons of projects and overall just being super nice to me. Well performance reviews hit, my old boss did mine of course (it was subpar which wasn’t shocking) and ever since then my current boss has done a complete 180 on me. My current manager now also no longer includes me in meetings/projects, ignores me when I message for help, and barely speaks to me in office. Yada yada yada a lot more has happened but I don’t feel like typing everything, let’s just say my experience at the company hasn’t been good. 

In turn, I’ve been debating leaving the company but have been struggling to find something new in the current job market. My mental health has declined insanely over the last few months. Just last week I left work at 4:50 PM, went to a dentist appointment down the street, at 5:20 PM my manager is mass texting me asking me for a bunch of work that needs to be done by the following morning (that I obviously can’t do immediately because I’m sitting in a dentist chair by 5:15), I’m shaking so bad in the dentist chair that the dentist keeps stopping while she’s filling my teeth because she thinks I’m in pain. Nope, no pain, just extreme anxiety! And this isn’t unusual at this point. My job gives me insane anxiety, I’ve started seeing a therapist for the first time ever, I wake up every morning nauseous scared wondering in what way I’ll be belittled in office today, I cry myself to sleep often, it’s just a mess. 

I told myself to just stick it out until I find a new position. Well it’s been months now and I’ve never struggled to find a job even after two layoffs until now. I was just informed that I’d only be receiving a 0.75% raise, so obviously I checked everyone else’s on my direct team’s new salaries (I’m in HR hence I have access) and everyone received 6% or more! My boss’s boss was the one in charge of our salary increase. I knew he’s never liked me but WOW. Not even 1%? 2%?

I fear I’m at my breaking point of just giving a two weeks notice because I sincerely don’t think I make enough ($60,450) to be deal with constant anxiety and nausea. 

Can someone, anyone from the outside looking in tell me if I’m crazy for putting in a notice and just working retail until I find my next position? Is this normal in corporate?

Instead of a raise, people just praise me and my work as if that's going to cover my bills. I have been experiencing true rage over this job and the fact that they're blatantly screwing me over. I'm not sure how anyone handles this, let alone professionally, because I'm in a mode where I want to watch them scramble and panic. I want revenge.

I work for a relatively small company, and me leaving would genuinely be an issue since I cover 2 separate jobs (also the admin assistant) for the pay of one worker. My rage has gotten to the point where I intend on making my transition out a living hell.

I have a review coming up, and I fully believe they're going to lowball me with a $.50-1.00 raise, although I am going to be firm on a minimum of $21. Once they turn me down, my production will be going down. I will not do anything extra, and will take my time (and a lil extra) on all projects. Additionally, they have a habit of asking departing employees to take on more work outside of their new job to train the new hire. I will absolutely not be doing that. They also ask departing employees to cover some assignments until they can properly train the new employee, and I won't be doing that. This will result in upset clients and panicking.

No one likes to be screwed out of money, so enjoy not meeting client deadlines and having to invest in another employee. Friendly reminder, even ""family businesses"" don't care if you live or die. They gave me health insurance, but I still have to save up to get anything looked at. "

Long time lurker..first time poster. 
I’m in need of some advice. 

I work for a big name home improvement store. Yesterday, I was asked to be a temporary Lead (one step higher than what I am now) for about a month while the current Lead trains for a different role. My first reaction was feeling appreciated and ready to do it! I honestly felt honored, and it was so nice to felt seen for my leadership skills. The only thing is, when I asked about the pay difference, they said it was a “learning experience” and no pay incentive. Which is a total bummer. I’m super conflicted because my morals, ethics, etc are to say HELL NO, absolutely not. I’m going to be doing triple the work for the same pay? I don’t think so. 
But on the other side, I would love to be in this leadership position..learn about it…and get solid hours and a couple really good paychecks. I’m not struggling financially, but I could use the extra money in my savings. 

Anyways. One side of me wants to stand my ground and what I believe in, but the other side wants to take this opportunity for the education and money. 

I told my boss I’d think about it…and my next steps when I see them are to say 
“I’d love to take on this role but I would need compensation in order to agree, if not, then I’ll have to decline” 
They might be desperate and eventually say yes to it, but I doubt it.

They said that this would essentially be considered an ongoing side project to my current role and that it doesn’t rise to the level of creating a new position. They said it would only add a few days of work per month, even though the expectations of the role we talked about would increase my workload by about double. I would be expected to do all this extra work with no title or compensation change.

How could HR and the top leadership of this global company say to me with a straight face that going from being responsible for one facility to being in responsible for 10 facilities isn’t enough of a change in my workload that rises to the level of a promotion? Do they think I’m an idiot? I expected a negotiation, I did not expect the starting point of their negotiation to be “fuck you do it for free final offer”.

It’s all so insulting and unprofessional. "

My company (600 employees worldwide, profitable, tech sector) is only offering one month paid maternity leave. If that wasn’t bad enough, I just found out that, in order for them to be pay me, I have to use all my PTO and sick leave first. So when I come back to work, I will have zero PTO or sick leave left. FYI, I only have 2 weeks of PTO and 3 days of sick leave per year to begin with. 

So when the baby is born, I’ll use my 2.5 weeks of PTO/sick leave that I have been saving for the past year (I’ve never been sick, and have only taken one day off in the past 12 months), then the company will pay me for one month, and then I either go straight back to work (when baby is 6 weeks old) or they’re ‘generous enough’ to ‘allow’ me another 4ish weeks of unpaid leave.

In February 2023, I got a promotion and raise from $20.50/hour to $22/hour. I’ve made it clear to management in the past that I believe I’m being underpaid and this raise was used as an “incentive” for me to stay.  My employer also gives out larger bonuses compared to most. Some years my bonus pay has made up nearly 20% of my annual salary. In 2022, my gross pay was $52,373 after bonus pay. In 2023, despite my raise, my gross pay decreased to $52,124 because my overall bonus pay decreased significantly. 

Do I have a foot to stand on if I question my employer about this? Or am I out of luck since bonuses are not guaranteed?"

I have worked in the company for a little over 2 years, and half year prior our department got a new supervisor.
I thought he was cool and all, he acted like that all the time. I honesty trusted him ans considered him a friend.
During september of the last year I had a period of rough time(private life issues), which sure I admit could have affected my performance a bit. 
 During the rough time I would get talk with the HR, but they just asked me wether or not I need anything. I did not take it as a warning, apparently I was wrong, because now I got fired, because apparently my performance never improved, which I know for a fact is not true. Even colleagues from my department confirmed that(and they would know better than someone who does not do our work).

 Idk, I thought he was the kind of guy who would let me know first if something was wrong with my performance, but apparently no. He went straight to HR to get me fired, while acting like a friend for all those months.

I work for… well. I don’t want to say who exactly I work for, but let’s just say it somewhat rhymes with “rederal rovernment.” I don’t want to say *which* rederal rovernment I work for, but let’s say a decent portion of my paychecks goes towards health insurance. I will not answer further questions in regards to who I work for. 

At the start of the year, we received a sizable cost of living increase. Excitedly, I checked my first paycheck… and it was too small. Not just smaller than expected, but smaller than previous paychecks.

I reached out to my boss, who reached out to HR and payroll, who were as helpful as you would imagine. Turns out, the job offer I received last year, accepted, and have been working under since March was illegal. The cost of living update “fixed” that and put me at the pay rate they say I should have been at all along which, even with the cost of living raise, is less than what I was getting paid to begin with. 

But the rederal rovernment wasn’t done with me just yet. Nooooo, they want their extra money *back*. So today, my paycheck was short a few hundred bucks because now they’re just taking it back from my paychecks. 

I’m heartbroken. I received an outstanding performance review last year. I volunteer for just about any task that comes up in the department. How does my employer thank me? By not negotiating with me and starting to take back their $2500 from my paychecks. "

Decent severance but needed a new role pretty quickly. Got a call from a recruiter after 3 months of not working and I gave him an hourly wage I thought would be attractive to him (my first mistake). I get the gig, as a W2 contractor, and things start off shakey but eventually I get it down.

I begin receiving praise for process improvements I develop (moreso to make my job easier) and then a new recruiter contacts me for a similar role with a different company. This recruiter tells me they can give me $20 more an hour. I'm excited and also kicking myself for not increasing my initial price but lesson learned. I don't get the new gig but now my current boss is aware I'm being contacted.

Cut to today, the role I perform is posted to the company job board and I apply. I'm told that the role, that I currently perform as a W2 contractor, pays $22K less a year than I currently make. I can be an official employee and make less than I'm currently paid by a contracting company that charges the company I work.

I truly don't understand my manager's logic sometimes. Examples:

Each pay period we have a stack of employee timesheets (yes, paper time sheets) that's about 500 pages, which has to be scanned and uploaded. She staples the time summary to each person's stack...then turns around and *removes all the staples* so they can be scanned. Why even staple them?? It adds so much extra work.

She thinks making 4+ copies of every document is a good method to make sure we don't lose the document. It's not. It creates chaos and confusion as we have to keep multiple copies of documents in multiple places and somehow she still misplaces things.

Doing everything in alphabetical order, but sometimes it's by last name and sometimes it's by first name. This makes some tasks way more of a hassle than they could be.

Hanging on to things that are not necessary to hang onto, like the volunteer files, when we have an employee whose *entire job* is to manage the volunteers. Or cords to laptops we no longer have. Or employee time-off requests from well over a year ago.

Maybe I'm just nit-picky but this stuff drives me crazy. There's no talking sense into her because these things are logical in her mind.

5 days isn’t necessary. We can all close corporate jobs on Fridays and get the same amount of work done. I feel like my life is consumed by work work work. This can’t be how it is for the next 30 years right? This is what being an adult is?

Life im realizing is a scam. Most of us dont even make enough to afford hobbies outside of work, so whats the point of it all?

I bring it up at the meeting and one of the assistant managers reiterated “we are just gonna have to go with what she signed”… my fucking practice manager, the fucking lady who runs the place, says why cant we judt hold the body?? her fucking managers reflect her and that made me realize she doesn’t know these things.. had i not said something.. that lady could’ve been so upset … like what the LITERAL FUCK!

Both times these kids sat with head injuries and blood running down their faces and were refused their requests to go to the hospital or to even have an ambulance called to be treated at the scene. The company was more concerned about trying to bust them for weed in their system so they wouldn't have to pay any medical or unemployment expenses.

I've been rising middle management at this place for a few years but this has turned me off to staying here any longer. They were pretty good at everything else. The pay, PTO, and benefits are good. The work and schedule are easy. No real attendance policy or point system. Regular raises. It seemed like a great company for blue collar workers until this. It's the most cold blooded bullshit I've seen in the workplace in person and it made me yell at my boss in anger.

The first time they ever got OT. They had always been told “you are salary and required to work as much as the business needs” and that their pay is a fixed number regardless of hours worked. Management was unaware until Feb 1st when one of those laborers mentioned getting OT to another “salary” employee who had been working through her lunches and 6 days a week and didn’t get any extra pay.  That employee was rightfully upset and stirred up a lot of drama when she raised hell about not getting OT pay. (She left at lunch the next day and was absent the following 2 days due to having already worked 40 hours. The next week she stopped being required to work more than 40 hours).  As result of this drama management stopped scheduling us over 40 and converted us to hourly starting in the 3rd payperiod (but not the lady who didn’t get OT she’s still salary).  However my second check where I was still salary and expecting 20 hours in OT (at 45$ an hour) no OT.  Asked HR about missing pay they said “you were hired as a salary employee and not eligible until we converted you to hourly on Feb 9th”.  I’m also the employee that mentioned getting OT to coworker that didn’t.
I think the fact I did get it, then they witheld it, and then converted us to hourly after finding out we were paid it, and stoped scheduling over 40hrs,  illustrates it was willful exploitation salary payplans on workers that never qualified as exempt.

My on boarding paperwork says “salary non-exempt” salary and benefits based on 40 hours.   only started in January but my coworkers have been here for years working up to 16 hours of overtime a week, every week and not being paid.  I’m certain the lady still being treated as exempt doesn’t qualify because she doesn’t supervise anyone.  She’s like a Secretary really, greets and faces customers, writes up their orders and answers phone.  Us laborers work in the garage.

And ever since, I’m being “papered”. I would like to get the right kind of attention on this company so my coworkers and all the former employees get their rightfully earned back-pay.

0,2024-02-28,Overwhelmed with emotions about leaving job. I do not want to work anywhere. Higher Ed Expat.,u/FionaFergueson,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b2pbjy/overwhelmed_with_emotions_about_leaving_job_i_do/,antiwork,"
This is a mild rant, so I apologize if it doesn't come out as coherently as I would like it to. But as the post says, I'm feeling a wave of emotions right now and what better place to turn to than strangers on the internet for support.

Part 1 

I am 48 hours away from ending A three-year higher education position In the United States.

Today, There was a going away party  in my honor that was held from 2 to 3 pm. Not a post-work event, not a lunchtime event, but an event At a random hour of the day that was most accommodating to my boss's schedule.

Needless to say it was not well attended and while that didn't really bother me because I didn't want a party in the first place, It just really encapsulates my sentiments about the job overall. I gave my institution ample notice that I was leaving Yet they still have not posted my position to search for a replacement. I wad also asked to stay on In a Consulting capacity to help search for my replacement while no efforts are being made To find said, replacement.

The disengaged attirudes My boss and higher-ups have around My departure is Wild to me. It's like they refuse to acknowledge I'm leaving and are doing the bare minimum To make that acknowledgment, despite the fact that I am very clear on leaving.

I think what is most hurtful is that I have truly enjoyed the people that I work with beyond my boss And they have all rightfully pointed out How bizarre, my departure is being handled. Beyond the going away party announcement that went put  On Monday to a select group of people for an event today (Wednesday), there's been no formal announcement to any of the teams. I have been the one to tell most of the people I work with that I am leaving and that news, has spread and caused a lot of misinformation about why I'm leaving.

Part Two 

I am leaving without a plan. I am so exhausted from this job and from the failed leadership, I have that I am leaving without a plan. When people ask me, what my next steps are. I have simply joked. I'm taking a sabbatical like our faculty do. The truth is The closer I get to ending my time The more I realize I do not want to work anymore. I have worked diligently to climb my way up The higher education Corporate ladder. I find this work extremely taxing and I'm starting to take a lot of what happens in the workplace home with me in a personal way That really does not bring any sort of separation from my personal life and my professional life. 

I am entirely too exhausted to figure out what, transferable skills I might have developed on the job That will be good in a corporate setting.

I can't imagine myself being a shill for some corporation that cares about its shareholders More than it does It's employees.

When I see news of big tech companies laying people off en mass or Fast food companies acting like uber or Highly regarded companies doing rounds and rounds of layoffs While also opening up multi-million dollar Buildings in some of the most expensive cities in the country, I just don't really feel optimistic about what the workforce brings. 

It has always been my dream to be an entrepreneur. I don't think the business ideas I have will add much tangible value to the world, but I am very passionate about a couple of things And would love to explore what that looks like. 

I am just in a very weird space right now. And I have no idea what my next steps are. And while I do have a safety blanket mostly because I've acquired 42 vacation days And I have a loving partner who Is okay financially supporting us if I'm unable to figure out what I want to do with enough time, It does not make me feel any better to know that my options are To continue to Work in environments that Personally and professionally dissatisfying to me I don't know where to go from here.

I really just need a break from Workforce. 

I feel really guilty saying this to people, and I've only truly admitted this to My partner, and my immediate family. They're all extremely supportive, but I sometimes worry in the back of their minds They think I'm Delusional for expecting that I just stop working for a period of time and then restart as Things will change. 

TLDR: I really have no desire to continue to be a part of the workforce And  I'm feeling so discouraged about what working looks like at any point in the near future. "

They work in the same building, same desk spaces, and use the same company tools and emails. You really don't even know if someone is a contractor unless you ask or they show their badge. 

It should go without saying that these parasitic contractors companies offer shitty benefits and pay compared the company that they are working for. I got stuck being a contractor because I needed a job out of college and while the job isn't bad, it's fucking bullshit that I am doing the job of a regular employee but without pay or benefits.

Your bonus

You sold your soul for the illusion of control
Your capitalist grip is losing it's hold.

We've had it with pizza parties and pats on the back
We need life worth living and ability to relax

Call it quiet quitting or malicious compliance 
Doing required minimum isn't social defiance.
We're no longer fooled by your lies and the bribes
We don't need you and your handouts to survive

(Chorus)

You need us more than we've ever needed you
If we all quit tomorrow there'd be nothing you could do
Industry will collapse and markets will be in ruins
And to think, all you had to do was treat us like humans

They hired me as an office assistant.

It's my 3rd week here at (let's call it Orange Company in Houston, TX). My supervisor is the right hand of the owner and she even takes care of his personal stuff (his whole family knows her and she keeps close relations). Even stuff like dropping stuff to his house or booking personal appointments.

Today my supervisor told me to call Spectrum because we got a bill where they're overcharging us at a location in Austin. ""Make sure they reimburse the overcharge. Be mean and feisty, let out all your dark side!"" she joked. (I'm totally the opposite lol I'm shy and quiet).

So I call ""Hello, I'm Anabeth from Orange company, I'm calling in regards to this bill because we got overcharged.""

Operator: ""Are you Jona Smith?""

Me: ""No.""

Operator: "" I can only speak with the account holder""

Me: ""Ok, I'll let my supervisor know. bye""

Then I tell me supervisor and she says, ""Jona Smith is the owner's son. Just pretend your Jona, say ""Joana"" so they confuse you as a girl""

I said: ""But, is this Austin location part of the company?"" (because on google maps it looks just like a house).

She said: ""It's one of the owner's properties, yes.""

I tell her: ""Is this legal? (me impersonating the owner's son to dispute a charge).""

Her: ""Are you serious?

I nod.

Her: ""yeah, it's illegal?""

Me: ""well then I don't feel comfortable passing as Jona, I don't think I can do the call.""

her: ""Ok....""

Me: ""Can't Jona not call to solve the issue himself?""

Her: ""No""

So then she calls Spectrum, passes herself as Jona, and even calls him personally to confirm router information and also mentions to the operator that he moved addresses and other stuff that made me think ""How was I supposed to know all that??""

The I overhear her say to another coworker ""She got upset.... I thought they hired somebody with qualifications...."" (I'm also the only one there with a bachelor's degree and got paid $15 instead of $10 like everyone else).

**Basically, the owner gifted his son a home and he pays his spectrum with one of the company's money. They overcharged him and asked me to pass as him to dispute the charge (because the son cannot be bothered with this).

1,2024-02-28,How naive have I been?,u/powdermonkey99,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b2qwqr/how_naive_have_i_been/,antiwork,"TL;DR: grew up as a farm hand, went to college, experienced the real world, am sad and confused.

In high school, I worked as a farm hand at a small but active farm owned by an older couple. I started off aged 14 at $10/hr (almost $13 in 2024 dollars). As I grew more skilled and my boss got older and relied on me more, he raised my wage accordingly, and by 17 I was making $17.50/hr (\~$21 in 2024 dollars). The work was hard and the boss expected a lot from us (me and two other hands), but he treated us well, paid us daily at quitting time, and provided us  with a full lunch on a paid lunch break. My job growing up wasn't merely transactional, and it wasn't in any way exploitative. It felt very communal. All of us, boss and hands, were just laboring for an honest living. There was no bitching about sick leave, no adversarial ""how little can I get away with paying you""/""how little work can I get away with doing"". We would even come over and help them decorate their Christmas tree (they never had kids).

While I was away at college, they retired and sold the farm. Now I'm in the city, job searching in a field I'm not sure I want anymore and working part time at a grocery store. Not even getting to the job search part, the grocery store is at best hellish. Everything is designed to squeeze the last drop of productivity out of their employees. They refuse to hire full-time. By keeping 15 people in a department all desperate for hours, they never have to worry about call-outs because someone is always ready to pick up a shift. Also means they don't have to provide benefits. There's free coffee and sometimes snacks in the break room. I'd like to be grateful, but I know that it's a carefully calculated investment. $0.50 of coffee makes an employee 5% more productive or something like that. I tried to get a second job for more hours, but they refused to accommodate it in my schedule. Everybody is always at each other's throats. They all feel exploited. They take it out by doing as terrible a job as possible. I'm used to doing my best and putting in full effort, but I admit it's hard to care about doing a good honest job when I'm not being given a good honest living. I'm considering finding a new temporary job until I can land a career job in my field, but I don't know that the McDonald's down the road or the hardware store would be much better. Maybe I should just move back home, but I have too much college debt to abandon my career now.

I just want to know: whose fault is this? Who built this system that's designed to extract profit from us and leave us suffering? What's even the point? I've always believed in a free market, but my impression of a free market has always been based on what I grew up around. I see money as just a means to an end. Just a common medium to translate different people's work into different people's needs. What do they need all this wealth for? How can their consciences justify crushing people's lives for money? I just don't get it.

Thanks for reading my rant. I know once I find a job I'll be in a better place, but it hurts to think about my coworkers who never went to college and will probably never get out of this mess. I just wish I could fix it somehow."

context: i live in ontario, canada. i am a highschool student and i am very unaware of my rights as an employee and trying to learn more.

i am quitting my current job because of an extremely racist employee who has made personal comments toward me and others and even attempted to throw an item at my coworker with intention to harm them. we have brought our complaints and concerns to our manager, yet nothing has been done. he has actually made a racist remark about my culture himself. my coworker brought the situation to HR, where nothing was done and they were told that “it was not intentional” (the racist coworker stated it was intentional & my coworker “should have gotten out of her way,” but the security cameras conveniently weren’t working that day). 

i am trying to find specific documents on employee rights and policies through the company i work for regarding my coworker’s racist remarks and attempted assault, in order to bring it directly to HR and my manager when i quit. does anyone know what documents i should be looking for? i tried the business code of conduct, health and safety policy, and human rights policy and they were all no help. 

please let me know if anyone has knowledge on how i can obtain this information. i am trying my best to make a difference for future employees and hopefully bring justice to this situation, but there is only so much i can do without proper education on the topic.

So my current job has me hard stuck on working two days a week over weekends (which big surprise is not enough to survive) and affords me zero respect despite the fact I've been with this company for almost two years since the location opened. They claim there are ""no hours available"" and yet others are working doubles constantly because, frankly they've resolved to stroke the upper managements ego more than others are willing to. So I've been looking for a second job for more income or just to replace my current job.  


But I don't know if it's just me or the area I live in but the job market is BALLS! I have never in my life experienced such a complete lack of effort and care from employer's side of hiring new staff. I have been to multiple interviews where self indulgent management just stroke themselves off the entire interview and proceed to ghost me completely after I kept trying to follow up.  


And then many of these companies claim they need workers desperately, whining and moaning about how no one wants to work and crying about being constantly understaffed. Then just continue to maintain just below the bare minimum of poor souls on staff to barely get the job done (often terribly).     


I actually had an interview the other day that was a second follow-up interview where I was told to ask for another manager on arrival. When she came up to me I learned that she WASN'T EVEN TOLD I WAS COMING?! And now I've called them every day for a week to follow up after they said they'd hire me to NO RESPONSE WHATSOEVER. The actual epidemy of wasting my time.  


What did I do to deserve this hell world where I can't even land a crappy paying part time job with over 10 years of collective experience in the positions I'm applying for?! Anyone who says the current generations are ""lazy"" or ""don't want to work"" are completely and utterly full of it. "

I work 50 hours a week (including commute) and am a salary exempt employee in North Carolina. I essentially work 4 positions worth of work; web designer, web developer, system automation tech, and help desk tech. We get breaks, but I generally have to work through them to keep up. I also work ""closing"" shift and, probably 3/5 days a week, have to stay past my shift to assist coworkers tickets who leave earlier or some corporate asshole submits the ticket right before close we and our SLA requires it be answered within 15 minutes if it's before close. 

Anyway, Salary is supposed to be consistent, right? But what does that even mean? If you miss a day, you get your pay docked still...so..? I think this part is illegal, but my employer will also dock pay if you leave early. I feel like we're just hourly workers w/o overtime. We also have to work on-call every 6ish weeks. We're required to answer tickets and take calls 24/7 during that time with $200 comp on paycheck (which is not a legal requirement, surprisingly). 

I'm so insanely burnt out, I requested a change in my contract to be part time and they refused, so I would have to quit in order to feel human again. I was also in a car accident recently and my back has been fucked up, but I have to pay the car off (that I only use to commute to work and don't want...) before I can quit or file bankruptcy...thanks for reading my rant. /endrant

I'm very close with one of my coworkers, her becoming a best friend for sure even in this short of time frame. The job is easy, I sit and put items into the system, put them away, and process transactions with customers. My coworkers are all very nice and mostly older ladies with good manners, very maternal.

Our store sells some Christian items my boss orders, but I don't mind it because it's her store lol. There was a Hanukkah cup I bought from the store last December she obviously is tolerant to not turn away other religious items. Heck, we have a very nice jewelry collection and I bought a star of David that had been collecting dust from our jewelry case. Our items are consigned so I'm assuming that had been there for awhile.

Thing is, our store playlist that blasts in the store all day which is only 2hrs 30min long (repeats 3+) times a shift is like 10 Christian songs on it. A few specifically mention Jesus, some saying 'the father"" etc. at first I was fine with this. But the everyday repetition started to make me uncomfortable

I noticed by the security camera facing the register there was a ""glory be to God "" or some other Christian quote tapestry which I had not noticed before, not sure if it's new. It's not for sale, just as a decoration. We have a prayer jar next to the register, and when my boss left on a mission trip to Costa Rica (she does very good work with young girls for female empowerment there. Along with some Christian stuff obviously but I don't mind hearing about it because that's wonderful) she asked me and another coworker who wanted to take up the prayer jar while she was away ""👁️👄👁️"" I looked at her very confused, I wear my star of David everyday I don't even think she figures the prayers will even be sent according to her faith? Return to sender??? Idk.

I want to bring this up, but  there's 5 people working here including my boss and only two arent Christian. I want her to be able to practice her beliefs, but this is becoming a bit uncomfortable. My coworker a older lady has had conversations about religion with customers in front of me a older gentleman ranting his daughter ""left god"" and she shook her head to herself saying how sad that was.

My options are either a gov customer service role with the county or a service/sales representative for a top 20 bank. They would both be full time, 9-5. 

The gov role would be working for the tax collector/DMV, doing things like renewing registration, driver license, tag transfers etc. They are offering $17.50/HR and includes health insurance options, retirement vested after 5 years, PTO, paid holidays etc. the usual local government package. My commute is about 5 minutes, no tolls. 

The bank role would have me doing bank teller duties and more. This branch mainly focuses on businesses and less personal banking. They are offering $21/HR, paid holidays, 401k matching, health insurance options, PTO etc. My commute would be about 30 minutes (longer with traffic) and $2 in tolls each day.

Health insurance costs like $90 per check from bank and like $7 from county/DMV so that’s something to take in consideration too. My family is telling me that government role is the way to go but I’m looking for some other insights and opinions. Thanks! "

*Make the environment more and more toxic and awful till they quit. Rinse, Repeat*

Tired of dealing with vendors?
 *Make them fucking hate you by micromanaging everything and making a big show of it*  (fr one of the coke guys quit our route because of her and there on like there 3rd redbull rep)

Running out of good workers who care?
 *Hire anyone who doest run for the door immediately apon meeting you*

Everyone always quiting or not wanting to work with yo ass because they can't stand how annoying and unhelpful you are? 
*Keep job posting up year round... there's always someone looking pick the three most recent ones and call in that interview*

Disgusting store room with at least 20 different rolltainers that are completely out of date? 
*Why worry when you only schedule enough to unload the current ones and just barely stay ahead. *

Don't wanna work nights? 
*Just fuckin don't and close the store when your AM can't cover*

Want attention?

 * PULL UP TO THAT FUCKERS HOUSE AND SEE WHATS UP* (necessary context : we live in a small town and she had picked me up before, if she had no other choice and needed someone that wasn't her that is)

Piss of the 21 year long land lord enough for him not to renew the lease?
*SOME FUCKING HOW INSTEAD OF GETTING FIRED SHE GOT A STORE BUILT FOR HER ACROSS THE FUCKIN STREET* (no she has not changed I have talked to her current employees) 

Idk tho random men stopped by the store all the time and she called them her boyfriends despite having a husband. Told us hes totally cool with sharing despite had previously mentioned his jealousies and anger.
had conversations with the DM personally when the old manager left. He came to over see an inventory of the store and enlisted my help. Seemed like a reasonable dude and also felt like a test at the time for something more, then he sends that fuckin gutter ball out, hes either being lied too or is protecting her for some reason . . Do you think if i had an honest conversation with him he even would consider firing her?? Are they fuckin??? Not out of her wheel house and I don't know him that well,  Once shes gone i dont mind working back.to the top and running that store. I was fucking good at it too but i dont know what all he knows about and what lies shes told Idk honestly this was my little diary entry about the worst person I've ever worked with but if you got an opinion I'd love to hear it

Final thing on the list: ""If you're done early, let me know. I'm sure I can find something else for you to do."" Best way to motivate me to get my work done quick is to...  promise me more work, of course.

Not so say there's never any fun at work. Sometimes he likes to play games with us. For example, he'll give us a task, and lets us estimate how long we'll need to complete it. This isn't a case of 'there's no right or wrong answer'. Rather, you need to give the answer he already had in mind, otherwise you're greeted with a passive-aggressive 'Why do you think it'll take that long? I'm sure I could do it in xxx amount of time'.

Oh, and working from home? Unless you have very good reasons for it, you can forget it. Who knows what you'll get up to without his oversight? Probably nothing!

He's not even an actual boomer - just his mindset seems imported straight from the 50s.

Please read the messages, no where did you tell me it was a in-person interview, nor did you provide a address. so i assumed it was a phone interview which made the most sense.
Do you have a hard time finding candidates, because i can see why with your lack of communication. Clearly the mistake was made on your end, as i was uniformed that is was a in person interview and did not get a address to arrive at, which means phone interview to any other company.

TN, US-based, hourly, non-exempt, working in a 501(C)3 non-profit mental health setting. 

A coworker of mine found out today that if she doesn't work at least 40 hours in her ""home program"" they will deduct PTO even if she works over 40 hours total within the company. For context, our company has over 70 programs, and we can choose to PRN for other programs in need and get paid a higher hourly rate than full time staff in that program. 

She has been doing this for a while, and they have never had an issue before. Our ""building"" director (over 2 programs) was just as confused as the employee was at the initial email. 

To me, this sounds like it goes against overtime labor standards. 

I told her she should consider contacting the Department of Labor, if only to find out if it does go against the standards, and then proceed accordingly. She is choosing not to, and instead decided to pull all of her future PRN shifts in other programs (good on her setting boundaries and screwing over the company instead of herself). 

But I'm still wondering if there is a violation here. "

I don’t know if he quit or was let go but I figured he wouldn’t last long because my company has major turnover due to poor benefits-5 PTO days and 6 holidays a year, no retirement and their cheapest insurance plan costs $164 a paycheck.

After several months working as a contractor, I was hired full time on December 1 but was cut seven weeks later. My replacement lasted less than 11 weeks. He showed up unannounced and I had to train him. I discovered my job posted on Indeed in November and my boss said at the time he was hiring more people. He never said he was letting me go and I had to train my replacement before leaving.  I would have refused to do so.

I saw my job posted again on Indeed two weeks ago. I doubt my boss would call me back to work because he would be virtually admitting he made a mistake cutting me in the first place. I would only go back if I got back pay for the entire time I’ve been gone.

This call center is a small company and pretty laid back. My company is contracted by a bigger company for inbound and outbound. But the past few weeks it’s been going downhill. The writing is on the wall. 
Higher ups are struggling to find work for the outbound team. Inbound only gets a call maybe every hour or two, sometimes even three hours. I’ve worked here for a couple months now and I started noticing the red flags. I think the company over anticipated the workload and now it’s biting them in the ass, but it’ll be the workers like me who will get the brunt of it. 

We were handed an old call list that hasn’t been worked on in a while since they are struggling to find us work. Without going into too much detail, we are reaching out to clients who have duplicate emails with another person.  The catch is, we somehow don’t know where or who has the same email we’re reaching out to. My first thought was “Then how the hell was this list made in the first place to call people?” Why not just show the duplicates and I’ll make the call? Terrible system. We were told to call the client and ask them if they can think of anyone they may have shared their email with or someone they know who is using it. All I can think is that this is going to cause the client to either panic with “How is someone else using my email?” Or “You’re calling me about a duplicate email. You’re the company. How do you not know?” How do I even answer that?

If we happen to see the duplicate emails between two people, it’s a pretty simple call. No problem. Have them provide an alternate email. But if we see the person we are going to reach out to doesn’t have a duplicate email, we were told to still need to call them mentioning duplicate emails. “Do your due diligence,” they said. They said it’s for practice, but this isn’t practice! This will cause the clients to be even more confused because there is no issue.  We can’t just update the list to be correct, supervisors still want us to call to show production. Numbers.  Even more confusion - if we leave a voice mail mentioning a duplicate email and to call back for assistance, they will call back asking about duplicate emails, and an agent will look and see there are no duplicate emails. Both the agent and client are going to be confused and not know what’s going on. 

All of this because my company is wanting to show constant workflow, but not realizing the wake of issues we will cause. I’m not a big company man…but I am astounded that they do not realize what issues this could cause. The company that contracted us I’m sure will get frustrated with the issues this may cause. Won’t look good for my company, but I will get the shaft of it. 

I definitely feel like I am in a pickle because we have ran out of work and supervisors are desperately finding anything for us to do. We have overheard our supervisors mention hours being cut. Have heard them say that these call lists they’re giving to us is for job security. But I honestly think we will be laid off here soon. I called off today to try and relax and look into other jobs before this ship sinks. I feel desperate, and it’s probably because I am. 

So am I wrong for feeling this way? Wrong for not wanting to cause possible panic or confusion, for feeling like we are going to possibly be laid off soon, for wanting to call off because of not wanting to deal with this stress?

Thank you for those who take the time to read this and or reply. Hope you all have a great day. Just needed to vent. 

TLDR; Supervisors are having us place calls that may cause confusion or panic all because they ran out of work for us to do. We may be laid off soon because of this."

if you find any misspells keep em ;)

&#x200B;

I have been at a 4 man electrical company(?) in germany and left about 1.5 years ago.

I still have regular contact to my former apprentice and he said everything went south since I left.

Things have been miserable before. My boss had too high plans and only sees the opportunity to make more money. Besides this he is an absolute choleric asshole and a fucking rascist who doesnt keep promisses  or gives a shit about health and safety regulations.

I have witnessed numerous times that he offered to cash up so neither the customer nor my boss pays taxes as well as he pays overtime he also in cash (i wanted it the official way so he did atleast this). He also is a really cheep fuck always buying the cheapest stuff and we had to deal with the outcome of bad quality and saving in the wrong endings. He even charges his employees when they make mistakes and deducts directly from the paycheque. Usually you as an employer are oblidged to have an insurance for this but he doesnt care.

&#x200B;

My former apprentice says that they have a new (underaged) apprentice and the boss doesnt give a shit about laws handling underaged apprentices and apprentices in general like them only being allowed to work overtime occasionally and them not having to miss professional school (apprenticeship here is dual and depending on wich school you go you either have one or two days a week or 6 weeks every three months) for being on construction sites.

&#x200B;

He treats his journeyman and his apprentices as slaves and they cant handle it anymore. 

This are just some of the things I know of. 

I think someone like this should not be entitled to train apprentices at all.

I finally got my man to hand in his notice and the apprentices are about to do so too.

&#x200B;

The only thing from keeping me from reporting is to protect the others there since he might think it was them and make it even worse.

A few days in they said that after a few months I would hop back and forth between the two with intervals of a few days, weeks, or months, not a routine basically.

Edit: Wow. I know people always say this… but I didn’t know this would get so much attention. Thank you for your awards and advice. I sincerely appreciate the outpouring of well wishes and I will pass them along to her. For those who don’t believe the story I posted more details on some comments.

Another fun detail about the old workplace: I think one of the final straws this year was the boss hired his constantly-relapsing-into-drug-addiction-and-totaling-cars grown man of a son onto the company in order to teach him financial responsibility. The son is very stupid and has no experience. Boss man told my mom it was now an additional job responsibility to teach the son how to work at the company. Whatever he was paying his son he could have given my mom as a raise but he chose to keep it in his stupid, stupid family. POS.

—

My mom has worked for a small construction company for like 10 years and hasn’t gotten any raise other than the occasional large bonus. She asked and her boss said no even though he’s personally filthy rich and she keeps the company afloat.

She just applied to a larger construction company and with her amazing experience, even though she lacked the educational prerequisites, she blew through all 3 interviews and already has a job offer within a couple weeks of beginning her search.

The new company offered her much more than she even asked for: twice her current salary. 50k to 100k in two weeks. Including great benefits.

She broke the news to her old boss and he started acting so desperate, panicked, and crazy that it emotionally disturbed her. He tried to make her a bunch of offers and promises she knew he wouldn’t keep.

He offered to pay her more than the new company offered her. He point blank told her “I haven’t been paying you the value you are worth to me.”

What a fuckin slap in the face. I’m so glad she’s leaving and said no to old boy’s offer. After all these years of loyalty and struggling financially as a single mom right in front of him he admits he was doing it on purpose. Fuck him. Small businesses don’t automatically equal better businesses, folks."

[vent],u/KRabhouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1b35s36/my_coworker_is_micromanaging_me_and_im_sick_of_it/,antiwork,"Hey so the title says it all. I've got a government job, or I could be more specifically described as a jurist, despite not being enrolled in law school (long story short: despite having specialized in law for a year after my degree in International Relations, I shouldn't be able to call myself such but ended up in this job somehow anwyays). Nonetheless, I started working in September in a team of four people; 

\- 2 of whom had started working in 2018

\- 1 other girl who is only one year older than I am started in 01/2023 

The girl was very supportive in the beginning: she sent me a bunch of examples and regulations, legislation, judicial texts... to make sure I knew the job and she used to reply promptly to any question I had. My team leader on the other hand is super easy-going and assigns a job every now and then to make sure new folks have something to do. 

At first I didn't receive much work, I assumed because they didn't quite trust me yet and I did not have a law background. Then it was holiday season so any time I asked for some work to improve myself and get accustomed they told me it was calm, but I've noticed the last month especially that this girl is taking all the work upon herself. I didn't mind at the beginning, because I was able to just log in and log off and do absolutely nothing the entire day only to make a bunch of money. My imposter syndrome was occasionally kicking in so I asked for work again regularly, and since the aforementioned girl manages the mail box and assigns jobs to others I have to go to her. I even told her loud and clear I don't want her to end up with a burn-out and she can give some of her work to me as I feel undeserving of the money I earn. Again, we don't work in the private sector so she will not get any reward for working her butt off, nor do I think our team leader even cares as much: she received the same ""you're an asset to the team"" comment as I did on our compulsory 1:1 meeting with the team leader. 

&#x200B;

Now the actual issue: I've noticed that while she takes a lot of work upon herself, after begging a bit, she's able to leave one out of the 20 jobs we receive to me. Once I'm done with it she takes a look at it without me asking for it and comments on it. Every time. Her comments also come off as obnoxious and very how-do-you-not-know-this-already (the reason is because I didn't have to chance to gain some experience clearly...). Or even ridiculous things like deleting the folder I created on the drive to make the exact same with a different name, telling me to do something even though I already did, commenting on how she didn't see me in office (why does she care in the first place?!) or emailing people in my name without giving me any sort of responsibility or at this point, agency. I really appreciate everything she's done so far and how I've been so careless with my job thanks to her, but the more I pay attention to her behaviour, the more I notice she's a control freak. So despite being the favourite in the office and among the managers, it's very hard to work with her. So what do you guys suggest I do? I was planning on looking for another job in at least 7 months anyway, but I need to find a way to survive this period. Also maybe an important detail: two other girls joined the team after me and they too have little to no job. I mentioned this issue to the senior workers and the new ones without ratting her in any way, but I don't know what else I can do. My favourite time to work is when she's on a holiday. "

I have anxiety and I am currently getting tested for autism, as I get overwhelmed and anxious quite easily when I’m working in the office, so I usually give myself a mental break and message my friends and family as it helps me stay grounded and focus on my work when I get back to it. As a result, the work I’ve done has led me to a promotion, but now I don’t want to start the promotion job because of this. 

Also, my manager no longer allows me to work from home, which is the only safe space I have for work, and now I have to log down every time I enter or leave the office for any reason. These include starting, going for lunch, going for a piss and shit, and leaving."

I often talk with my students about various things, which is part of building/maintaining relationships. I ask them about their jobs, work, popular culture all of that stuff.

One of my students was telling me how they were quitting their job because they know they can get paid more elsewhere (good for them) when I asked them what their reason was, just as a conversation they said ""***they've been cutting my hours, and they cut my hourly wage below the $10.45 minimum wage...""***

The inner Union-Member/Union-Rep/Defender of American Labour in me was puzzled by that statement. Surely student was misunderstanding their paycheck, only seeing the final pay as opposed to taxes taken out. Student insinsisted that they were in fact being paid less than the state minimum wage (at a non food-industry restaurant, non-salary position obviously). 

I told them that if it's true, they can't actually do that because it's illegal. The student was like ""it's no big deal I'm quitting anyways..."" and I insisted that it was actually quite serious even if it's just $6.00 to them, wage theft is a serious crime. 

Student showed me their paystub, and it did indeed appear that the ""hourly rate"" was $0.35 below the minimum wage in our state which does seem to be in direct violation of the law.

Wage theft is a serious crime, I just don't know who I actually contact to report this. And my HS students aren't likely to do it because they don't understand they need to be their own bet advocate or that they should question authority."

There's virtually no benefits. I have nothing to look forward to. I don't have 2 days off in a row, and even then the 1 day off I get during a week is random because my boss basically makes me work around everyone else's availability. I have no PTO. I have no insurance. I don't like my coworkers. I have virtually nothing left to look forward to because I don't ever have enough time off or money to do anything but go home or do errands. I don't see my friends. I don't go anywhere. My relationships are struggling.

The only thing I get out of here is a cat that lives here, a paycheck for $16.50 an hour and a commute that's 15 minutes. 

I don't want out I NEED out. But there's no openings in my field besides the one I applied to and have been waiting to hear back from for the past month... They had a change in leadership and have to do onboarding before they want to interview for the opening. And realistically I feel my chances of landing the job are low.

How do I keep working here? How do I stop going home and living alongside the sense of dread I get every day because I never get to relax? I'm at my wits end. I don't know how much longer I can do this."

I get contacted by Recruiters once in a while. I work in a technical field, and there are usually a fair number of job postings. I don't have plans to go anywhere, but I will listen to offers, and I will do my part to push up their expectations of what someone with my skills will expect for compensation.
 This last one frustrated me. Got contacted through Indeed, and they asked what my availability would be to talk. I said after 4pm. They call immediately. I don't answer. I text to say after 4. They agree. I wait. Nothing. Next day, I get a call at 5:20. When I asked what happened the day before, I am told they were busy. Nope. I'm done. 
If you contact me, and then don't follow up properly, I am going to assume that your lowball offer is coming. They are trying to gauge if I am desperate for their offer, and try some stupid tactics to make me feel like I'm lucky they called after all. I don't care where the offer may be coming from at this point. If you don't want to show respect, I don't feel any interest in seeing what else is coming. 
We all have to stick together on this stuff. We all deserve respect. When Recruiters can't do that much, we can all show them how much we don't need them. "

When applying for funding they often undervalue the ancillary work such as reading emails, calendar stuff, 2 required breaks per day etc....and over-promise the funding meant for clients.

Ok so... my boss makes me bill half of my ancillary time to client funding. This is illegal and immoral, but it's what I'm told to do. 

THEN..... I was talked to and told to not schedule client meeting at the end of the day because it's considered ""ending your day early"" because I can drive home after and am saving time not leaving from the office.....

My managers (salary not hourly) show up at 9am and leave at 4:30pm EVERY DAY...

When I was 9 I started babysitting my siblings and at 10 watching the neighbors kids for $1/hr so our parents could go to the bar on weekends. 

My mom continued to have kids and I continued to provide childcare for $2/hr on weekend nights, then also weekdays in the summer while mom & stepdad worked. I moonlighted doing childcare and housecleaning for $5/hr for my landlord and neighbors all the way thru junior year of high school. 

Second half of junior year I lost interest in school and switched to night school so I could work days for minimum wage. I decided that sucked so I went back to school in the day and worked nights and weekends. 

After HS graduation I saved up and moved out. I decided that low wage work sucked so I enrolled in college but it took me 11 years to graduate because I had to keep working and took 4 years off in the middle to pay off credit cards that I racked up trying to survive. Throughout both stints in school I worked 2-3 part time jobs to make ends meet. 

After college graduation, I went straight back to working full time PLUS an internship. I have been grinding away 40-50 hrs/week ever since. The last time I even had some kind of time off between jobs was 24 years ago!

I’ve been slowly losing hours at the place i’ve worked, wouldn’t of been as big of an issue before, but i now am living outside of my parents (which this job has helped me do, and i am forever grateful) 
But I can’t help but feel as if they are cutting hours as punishment in a way.
For the first time the other day, i didn’t realize i worked, i’ve never had any issues like this before, i’m a goody two shoes when it comes to coming in to work on time, and about 2 hours after my shift started (i was sleeping), i messaged them super apologetically and told them “Once again i’m so sorry about that! i’m not sure how i missed that , I’ll be paying a LOT closer attention to the schedule from now on!

 I look at the schedule a few days later and they’ve taken me off of mondays, with little communication. They’ve been doing stuff like this before, and they’ve slowly started giving my shifts to a back of house employee, i am quite bitter, as they’ve done this unexpectedly, they’ve already cut my shifts before and i was mad, but one day a week is ridiculous and just kinda seems rude? i was working 32 hours before and now it’s just 8, like just fire me you know. 

Sorry for all the blabber but i thought backstory here would be ideal

here’s the letter:

“Hi i will be resigning my employment by march 17th as I feel i’ve not been communicated with effectively, and that has resulted me being in unforeseeable circumstances with my living situation. The lack of respect and management shown here was incredibly disappointing, one mistake shouldn’t cost me all of my hours, especially when there’s a great lack of communication in the store for example, me and (coworker name)  had no idea the bins were put in a different place now until it was written down on the daily todo list a month later, which greatly caused production to slow down, mistakes are bound to happen when the communication is low. 
I hope moving forward, you guys are more willing and open to start conversations with your employees.” 

I drafted this up because i was angry with plans to revise it to be more chill but my roommates said i should just send this but i’m afraid it will ruin references in the future because it’s a little harsh.
also apologies if this is the ugliest reddit post ever, i don’t come on here too much! "

Studies have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a massive amount of inflation is due to profiteering and greed so I'm calling for an inflation boycott in solidarity with the Palestinians boycotts targeting specifically companies that have a track record of price gouging but also aren't heavily diversified the companies I'm pointing to specifically are Coca Cola, Star Bucks, Netflix, Disney and McDonald's these are globally recognized brands that can't hide behind smaller brands with different labels and are easily replaced."

I am a 16 year old Portuguese young man, and I see my life taking a direction that is not what I want, the ""normal"" in Portugal would be after finishing regular education to go to university, take a 5 year course and then I started working about 38 hours a week until I retired at 64;  Although there is a course that I would like to take, which is the programming course, when I see the example of my parents and friends who followed the normal path, none of them seem to lead a happy life;  Seeing my parents come home tired every day shows me that this is not the future I want for myself.  Finally, the questions I want to ask are: What should I do so that this doesn't happen to me, and I don't end up working a 9-5?  I'm not saying that it's not possible to be happy working a 9-5, but I know myself, and I know that I couldn't lead a happy life that way.
Thanks in advance. "

Help quitting 

*Posting for a friend who doesn’t have Reddit. Any grammar or formatting issues are from copy/paste* 


Start off by summarizing: I work for a company with 4 people (boss/owner, his wife, a maintenance guy, and myself) I am the only one that knows computers, accounts payable and receivable, taxing, etc. I’ve been here since I was in high school and I am terrified to quit. Does anyone have any advice? 

More info:
The good:
The whole company has been very good to me. I have been nvited me to dinners, bought me work clothes, and appeared to genuinely care about my well being and family. I was payed fairly for a long time and given many opportunities that I would never have been able to have. I also genuinely care about my coworkers and the company as a whole. My name is on some of the business cards and I am familiar with nearly every client we have. My coworkers constantly praise me on how great I am and how lucky they are to have me there and they don’t know what they would do without me.

The bad:
I am underpaid, I work long hours, I have no time for college and I am not doing well in my classes. My boss will yell at the other coworkers and then take anger out on everyone. But usually I am avoided from the name calling and actually screaming. I get calls all the time (outside of work) to handle things that need to be done at the company or random stuff. I also travel for the company and I do not like it. However, for some reason, I struggle to say no to this company on anything. It is taking a toll on my home life and has for months. I am genuinely terrified of quitting. Confrontational things never scare me but this does. It feels like I am too connected to this company and I don’t know how to get out. Any advice would be cool. Thanks
