1,2024-01-31,CMV: we need to give joe buden a taller hat,u/ReyGetard1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afxc81/cmv_we_need_to_give_joe_buden_a_taller_hat/,changemyview,"This is ny “honest” opinon about how…the sense of metaphor rather than literal fashion advice is at play here. The significance lies in the symbolism associated with the iconic stovepipe hat that Abraham Lincoln famously wore.
Abraham Lincoln's tall hat has become a symbol of wisdom, foresight, and leadership. It is not the size of the hat itself, but what it represents. Lincoln, during a critical period in American history, navigated the nation through the challenges of the Civil War. His towering hat became a recognizable emblem of his steadfastness and commitment to preserving the union.

Applying this metaphor to Joe Biden, suggesting a ""bigger hat"" implies a call for him to embrace a symbol of strong leadership and resilience. In today's complex and turbulent times, a figurative larger hat could signify a heightened commitment to unity and a steadfast approach to addressing the pressing issues facing the nation.

A ""bigger hat"" could symbolize the need for a president to rise above political divisions, much like Lincoln did during his presidency. It encourages a leader to embody qualities of inclusivity, empathy, and a broad vision for the well-being of the nation. It suggests a leader who can navigate through challenges with a sense of grace and unwavering determination.

Moreover, a bigger hat could represent a broader perspective, encouraging Biden to consider a wider array of voices and perspectives when making decisions. It symbolizes an openness to diverse opinions and a willingness to embrace a more inclusive approach to governance."

Gonna make it short to keep readable.  


So, we know our planet has a lot of issues to be solved. Poverty, conflicts, desease, resources scarcity - all these things have been with us for thousands of years, with various social and economic systems trying to overcome them in one way or another. If we look at things from a philosophical perspective putting political details aside, basically, in the 20th century we saw a competition between the two most recent ones:   


\- The Freedom approach. Attempted by the West. States that maximising freedom will lead to maximised opportunities and unleashing of one's potential, thus, happiness and a better society

\- The Justice approach. Attempted by communists (as thinkers). States that creating an economic system where everyone is free of economic exploitation will lead to unleashing one's potential, thus, happiness and a better society

  
Eventually, however, we saw that these ways are not enough. Maximising freedom may lead to collisions between different understandings of freedom, which are all free to be expressed.  This also may lead to increased individualism, polarization and atomisation of societies.

  
Creating an exploitation-free system has not been achieved yet and there are quite a few factors that are obstacles - ambitions, greed, fear. Besides, this likely won't solve all of our problems on it's own - psychological factos of conflicts, for instance, arise not only from economy.

  
So there must be some other approach. If founding societies on freedom or on justice is insufficient, I believe we still can reshape the planet via founding societies on love and compassion. Seriously, it shouldn't be viewed as some idealistic philosophy. 

  
We know that positive emotional connections between people lead to much more sustainable results than in the case of purely pragmatic relations - families are much stronger than business partnerships.   
We know that positive connections can be build gradually starting from a smaller scales to larger ones: - families -> local communities -> larger groups -> possibly nations -> why not globally then?

  
We know that love and compassion towards other ordinary people provoke reciprocity and support in return. So if we don't bypass the political level (where greed and ambitions become too strong) and build horizontal links based on that, we could very well achieve a chain effect based on emotional contagion.   


Now, since globally everything is interconnected, starting such a process consciously will spread the resulting effects across the globe rather fast, especially given the modern communication tech. Establishing positive interaction between massive groups of people based on love and compassion starting from smaller groups (like 10-20 people) will likely snowball if supported by influencers around the planet and has the potential to change people's thinking, ushering in a new era of our civilization.  


Now, to the point. I believe all this can be achieved in one lifetime. People want a better world. People can be kind. And people are able to learn and adapt to new trends very fast. 25-30 years would be enough to create a totally new set of ethics. This will automatically transform our political, social and economic systems without over-complex theories like the ones described by marxists. All is simple and straightforward. The thing is to create the initial impulse to launch it.  


Fight me  


TLDR: love and compassion can reshape the planet in one lifetime where freedom and justice failed"
1,2024-01-31,CMV: Public education doesn’t teach wisdom.,u/IzzyIzMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afxl6z/cmv_public_education_doesnt_teach_wisdom/,changemyview,"I want to start by asking you, my dear reader, a question. If you disagree with a system, do you leave the system or endure to attempt to change it? Many of great men have shed blood or been put to death for their attempt to make their people wise. Math being a higher form will never be a matter of mere opinion and neither are the systems that dictate the seasons, but humans have a choice, live alongside nature, or conquer it. 

The removal or introduction of a single species of fish into a river can potentially set off a chain reaction with far-reaching consequences for the ecosystem they are put in. We do this on a large scale and when we are working with a finite resourced planet could end with disaster. We already see effects in the weather, a surge in storms and earthquakes. The heat of our planet was always protected in a cooling cycle with our oceans, but we are destroying them at an alarming rate according to almost any study from any credible institution. This paper is not a debate over global warming, but a plea for change. 

My argument is if there is a route to harmony both systematically and for humanity, we need to know there will only be a singular route from our current time and space position to one of truth and harmony at any given time. This ideal is always changing with our universe and us, it’s always rerouting to know what that path to harmony is, always accounting for the total lack of. 

My disagreement with institutionalization runs deep because people never truly knew what was good. So why create a system that dictates class on knowledge but lacks the backbone to make them wise with it. Public education and knowledge are an absolute necessity for all of us to grow to true reverential love for each other and our beautiful systematic world. Although there seems to be a point during education that someone either be it ego or pride, can feel their knowledge is good enough. When perspective is lacking, we find disagreement on objective truths."

Then a new study comes out and now said influencer completely 180’s their opinion on the matter to the new study. Well Iv been listening to your advice and have been doing the wrong thing this entire time because the new study says the old was is wrong…. So why did I listen to you in the first place? It seems that their opinions are feathers in the wind from 1 study to the next. There are more examples of why I believe science having become a religion is bad for society having to do with a  conspiratorial matters. In short, I believe some major scientific institutions have been hijacked by political special interest trying to control narratives.

9,2024-01-31,cmv: absolute objectivity (probably) cannot be defined within a subjective human experience,u/bananataffi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ag0um0/cmv_absolute_objectivity_probably_cannot_be/,changemyview,"when i say ""subjectivity"" i am referring to phenomenon that exists and is measurable within the experience of a or group of human awareness. and when i say ""objectivity"" i am referring to phenomenon that exists and is measurable outside of subjective experience. 

my first and most foundational argument to this concept is simply that human beings are beings who happen to experience phenomenon through a lens of sensory information which creates a relative and subjective experience. this inherently creates a limitation on the perception of every experience and information objectivity could include. this is because, as long as you stand within a subjective experience, every phenomenon is immediately put into the category of qualia and any definition of objectivity becomes stripped away. there is no where to stand but a subjective experience as long as something finds itself in one. i think absolute objectivity lies there just beyond our capability to experience and define it because of this.

 it becomes very difficult to describe what absolute objectivity even could be because im here within the bounds of subjectivity lol, but i think it would include something beyond awareness or perception. and what i mean by this is a state of reality that is completely unaffected by any subjective perception and always remains consistent in that sense. in my mind, as soon as a human observer comes in, this sense of absolute objectivity is stripped away and replaced by the perception of what we think it is based on sensory information. 

my second argument is on that of consensus (which will tie into my first argument as well). consensus can be and has been described as something objective. i argue that although it may bring us closer to what objectivity could be, it does not and ultimately cannot define it. once again this is because as long as you are standing within a subjective experience, there is simply no where else to go. and even if multiple subjective awarenesses say the sun is in the sky, this does not mean the sun is in the sky in an absolutely objective sense. but rather the sense that multiple human beings who are each having a subjective and individual experience can come together and say ""yes my reality aligns with yours in this relative way"". even within consensus, we have not left the realm of subjectivity. 

my third argument is on instruments that detect phenomenon that is not typically detectable with our set of sensory organs. this includes something as simple as eyeglasses or as complex as an MRI machine. i believe that while these instruments expand upon information able to be gathered within a subjective experience, they do not define objectivity, especially in an absolute sense. once again, this is because even with the expanded set of information, there is the subjective observer perceiving it which as stated before immediately strips any concept of a definition that could even hint towards objectivity. 

tldr: absolute objectivity most likely cannot be defined within a subjective experience because of the nature of a relative experience, limitations of sensory experience, and the notion that you can never leave a subjective experience as long as you are currently in one. "

1,2024-01-31,CMV: Less incels would exist if boys were raised with the idea that romantic relationships/sex were luxuries instead of a rite of passage/life milestone,u/GorrilaRuffy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ag1ap3/cmv_less_incels_would_exist_if_boys_were_raised/,changemyview,"I think something that's changed in the last few generations is men's accessibility to romantic relationships. Because women are no longer in positions where they NEED to get married lest they starve to death, we seeing women actually able to choose what/who they truly want and unfortunately for a a very large portion of men, we are just not it. 

I think the reason so many incels and incel adjacent groups exist is for this reason. A large amount of men are just not meant to be attractive. I mean look at any animal. The buck with the small horns doesn't get to mate. The largest lion gets a pride while the lesser males are excluded. Humans have more female genetic ancestors than male for a reason. Men are struggling to adjust to the natural order of things and as a result we have Elliot Rodger and other psychos killing women over it. 

I think the best COA to prevent this is to change the way we talk about relationships to young men and boys. Relationships and even sex are seen on some level as developmental milestones. It's why we harp on virginity and why the idea of a ""first love"" carries any significance. What would help a great deal is the change of this idea to a view where relationships and sex are viewed as like luxury experiences in life. 

Like how not everyone gets to travel the world, not everyone gets to have sex or date. I think this restructuring of the dynamic could help men. First you don't have 20 year old men destroying themselves trying to figure out what women don't like him when it just isn't meant to be for him. It could also fix the entitlement issues I see feminist talking so much about."

- Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
- Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
- imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;

2,2024-02-01,CMV: People without suicidal thoughts are more incorrect than with,u/ThatsSoRighteous,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ag3c3r/cmv_people_without_suicidal_thoughts_are_more/,changemyview,"Repost, removed for not holding the view in question. I am extremely suicidal. The progress or nature of my own medical state ought not be subject to any formation of viewpoints in the discussion.

&#x200B;

It is more logically correct for someone to experience 'suicidality' than it is for someone to never experience it. It is a logically correct conclusion to make in any life, throughout time as it has occurred in history. For someone to say that they have never experienced a scenario that they could logically conclude that suicide is a favorable outcome would be admitting that they have also never experienced or fathomed life to its fullest. This point is made more true than false because there is more suffering in the world to experience than there is joy. The reason there will always been more suffering is because the scale at which suffering has become deemed so that it is comparably suffering rather than not has shifted proportions to even smaller amounts of 'ultra' rich wealth occupying much larger amounts of sustainable growth than that of living under the growing population of poverty.  
  
What this means to say is a majority that is doomed to a life of exploitation that substantiates people they may never be entitled to interact with. Given the scales at which one must climb and the purposely restricted profits at which they would benefit disproportionally require extraordinary ability or more likely the case which is willingness to connive against peers of equal ability.  
  
These statements come from a place of extraordinary privilege that I've had the luxury or opportunity to explore. I've had this somewhat unique experience because I am one that grew up within the 'super' wealthy, I've had opportunity to experience the standard brutality of child raising that of roughly 50 years ago (much worse the further back you go), and I have the opportunity to experience the absolute fullness of human technology and infrastructure. These are things that are undoubtably life changing, but it all exists on one thing which is human competence. The competence that congregates in these places of wealth do not originate here usually, they come from all over the world; it's a melting pot of the world's most successful. Successes that inevitably resulted from some failures along the way. There are areas of ultra competent because they practices around the world, learning, and sometimes getting it wrong; with the intention of helping but without the legal repercussions of getting it wrong, or lying as far as research goes.  
  
I'm very sorry to say, the science the basic population lives off of is basic science. It is often created to maintain status quo and profit. It is not to specifically aid the purchaser any more than a placebo would, because ultimately the results are the same: a satisfied customer. It's an extremely predatory environment gatekept by what would otherwise only be attainable knowledge from PhDs in the field with a similar opinion. I don't mean to convolute the areas of belief and known science, but you would imagine that the more in-depth the science is, the more unknowns, the more room there is for conflicting theories. Anyway the super nerds will often compete with their studies to out prove the other, usually at any cost.  
  
The bottom line is, you are a tool. Someone knows exactly how you operate you as a tool better than you do. The best course of action of many lives would be to dedicate themselves to the system of exploitation to hasten the resulting money-up system to ultimately create a better world than if they just went about enjoying their lives. You have two clear means of approach, hopefully you could find a way to do both; enjoying what little you have while attributing to the system efficiently. Many don't do this, evidently. Most, typically enjoy a life that is a little more self pleasing, as ought to be expected. It would not be expected exactly to just dedicate yourself to the idea of a machine. So, many live their lives they way they want to, exhibiting behaviors at their discretion. Freedom of choice is the perfect location for predatory marketing schemes (so long as the placebo benchmark is maintained). You can live your life happily, mostly when you aren't aware of it.  
  
A counter argument would maintain that all we have achieved is a result of what could otherwise be described as suffering. Suffering is an inescapable part of life, you must find the joy where it exists. But what if you are satisfied with your contribution to society because you've already done more than others achieve in a whole generation of an impoverished family. Is it my duty to sacrifice more blood for a child to have another go in a world I detest?  
  
At what point may a human say that they have sufficiently contributed and the suffering imposed as a result of simple existence is not an acceptable trade?

and looking back at the revolution, the colonies were absolutely in the wrong for most of it. refusing to pay taxes, torturing tax collectors, antagonizing british soldiers, hanging black men who testified against them, throwing tea into the boston harbor while wearing extremely racist costumes. the colonist were a bunch of spoiled brats. and it was because of their entitlement, they caused a war where fathers, brothers, sons, and friends were mercilessly killed.  
  
throughout the years, we've seen numerous countries apologize for the atrocities that they committed in the past. i think it's high time that america acknowledge that they were in the wrong during the revolution and sincerely apologize to england. that we now understand that our fore fathers acted completely out of line and the fact that we are now living with the consequences of their actions has shown us that. i also think that the american government should try to track down the descendants of british soldiers who were killed in the revolution and pay them restitution, making sure that they live the rest of their lives in comfort.

2,2024-02-01,CMV: If incels were as bad as people made them out to be they'd be rapists not incels...,u/FlyingNFireType,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1agb5ud/cmv_if_incels_were_as_bad_as_people_made_them_out/,changemyview,"One thing that never clicked logically to me when people talk about incels is that they are entitled to sex... it just makes no sense to me if you feel intitled to something you don't ask permission you just take it, that's how rapists think and if incels were rapists well then they wouldn't be incels... that isn't to say an incel couldn't become a rapist but then they'd stop being an incel so again how exactly are incels these women hating monsters who feel entitled to their bodies when they don't act like they are entitled to their bodies. 

Incels from my perspective are lost, desperate, jaded and resentful. For the most part they certainly have tried to put in effort to reach their goal at some point and just not gotten any positive feedback or worse negative feedback and felt they did everything right or at least everything they were told but got nowhere or ended up worse off than when they started and then they become resentful and spiral. Now how much effort they actually put in and if that was the right place to put effort in will vary from individual to individual but it's not like there's a roadmap for this stuff either and if you can't see any results from your efforts it's very easy to lose heart and shift the blame to others, genetics or the system regardless of what the thing you put effort into. 

Like imagine working harder and getting better results than anyone else at work and being constantly passed over for promotion due to nepotism. I think that's how they feel and I think for at least some of them it's true. But I have no ideal where the whole entitlement thing came from... Thinking your efforts should pay off in a fair system isn't entitlement, it's kind of the opposite of entitlement, entitlements are things you get for free not stuff you have to work for. I have a very hard to believing that if there was a doable thing that they could do to get get a girl and they knew and believed it 100% they wouldn't do it, the problems are numerous but one of the main ones is they have no idea what they need to do. Working out helps and has imperial metrics that you can observe but outside of that there's nothing, over half the advice makes things worse or is too subjective like ""be confident"". 

If they truly felt entitled why would they bother will all this ""advice"" and ideology incel bullshit and not just grab the first girl they like and rape her? Actually entitled people do it all the time, rich people, politicians, actors, rockstars and athletes those people seem way more entitled than incels to me."

Basically, I don't like the dismissive connotation of calling something ""artificial."" We associate ""artificial"" with ""not real.""

One could say dogs are artificial since they're a product of centuries of selective breeding. The qualities of modern dogs have been designed with intent by humans.

The big algorithms that are used to create machine intelligence can almost all also be summarized as ""selective breeding."" This is very literal in the case of evolutionary algorithms, but they all boil down to eliminating undesirable traits and reinforcing good ones. 

If the result of these algorithms are AI, then so are dogs.

A counterargument I anticipate is: *this is just semantics, what people actually mean when they say ""AI"" is ""not biological.""*

Okay, but then let's stop saying AI and start calling it non-biological intelligence, then? That would have less dismissive connotations, I think.  
Or we start also calling dogs AI, which would either lead to people treating their dogs with less respect or force a change of perspective."
1,2024-02-01,"CMV: The next definition of the word porn (video/images) should be commonly accepted as the only correct one: ""Porn (video/images) is an explicit depiction of sex with at least 1 human with displaying any (or all) of the next body parts involved into the process of sex: penis, vagina, asshole.""",u/AggressiveTap9781,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1agbb6z/cmv_the_next_definition_of_the_word_porn/,changemyview,"Just to clarify: I use the word porn in connection to video/images only here (not including other forms, such as literature or audio recordings).

Reasoning behind my point of view:  
1. The definitions you can find in modern dictionaries are usually somewhat similar to the next one from the Merriam-Webster dictionary: ""the depiction of erotic behavior (as in pictures or writing) intended to cause sexual excitement"".

\- This definition has a huge flaw, because in order to call something a porn we need to find out what was the intention of its creators. Just answer to yourself: would you stop calling any random porn video from pornhub a porn, if you found out that the director of the video was making the video with the intention to create a new form of art and not to cause sexual excitement?

2. The requirement of showing sex explicitly (not hiding any details) is needed to be able to distinct porn form erotic (if there is no sex or sex is somewhat ""veiled"" / hidden, then it's erotic).

3. The requirement of showing penis and/or vagina and/or asshole involved into sex is needed to be able to make a clear distinction from what is commonly accepted as sex and some edge cases, where people would argue that everybody understand the word sex differently, therefore there is no way we all can have a commonly accepted definition of the word porn.

4. The requirement of having at least 1 human being involved into sex is needed to be able to distinguish porn from records of animals having sex, or robots imitating sex.

Taking into account the level of technologies (both robotic and AI), we should also agree that if somebody created a video where any of the mentioned points are emulated by robots or AI to the level where people can't distinguish them from real, then we should treat it the same way as if real human beings were shown on a video/picture, and call the result video/image a porn too.

Having clear commonly accepted definition of the word porn without subjective parts and the need to ""ask"" the creators about their intentions would allow us to understand each other better and to use the word porn as a purely technical genre of movies, similarly to the action-movies or musicals genres, which are purely technical technical and has nothing to do with story telling, intentions or emotions of a movie."

https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump

“The national debt has risen by almost $7.8 trillion during Trump’s time in office. That’s nearly twice as much as what Americans owe on student loans, car loans, credit cards and every other type of debt other than mortgages, combined, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It amounts to about $23,500 in new federal debt for every person in the country.”

Trump blew up the deficit more than any preside in HISTORY. No wonder the economy soared; when you infuse that much cash of course it’s going to do well. We’re also going to go bankrupt. Concerned about the deficit is demonstrably untrue. The last access was under a democratic not Republican president (Clinton). 

Crime:

They are supposedly for prosecuting crime yet they excuse the criminal behavior of their leaders.

McCarthy, R-Calif., Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Mo Brooks all defied Congressional subpoenas while they railed against Hunter Biden for asking for an open hearing.

They don’t say that Donald Trump Didn’t commit the crimes that he was charged with; merely that bringing them was political. 

So let me get this straight: Hunter Biden should be prosecuted for not testifying under subpoena ( except he did ultimately), and for unproven corruption, but Donald Trump who has been proven to have defied a subpoena and his family corrupt ( Saudi money to Kushner) should get away with it? As well as cheating on his taxes, and committing various kinds of fraud. 

If your black shoplifter throw the book ( YES!) but if it’s white collar or by their guys NBD ( throw the book at ALL CRIME or there’s no deterrent IMO). 

Corruption:

They talk about Hunter Biden’s influence peddling with Joe Biden which cannot be proven ignoring Jared Kushner’s 2 BILLION Saudis and Ivankas China deals. 

Parental rights:

They want the right to ban books for all children taking away the parental rights of my child access library books.

They’ve taken away AP African studies in Florida, my children no longer have the right to learn about black history.

They are trying to take away parental rights across the country to access care for an LGBT children despite the data that doing so could cause them to commit suicide.  Is that pro life? And do they know better than the parents and doctor of that child?

They want to decide that I can’t take my child to see a drag show but I can take them into an R-rated movie. Who are they to decide what’s right for my child? 

Free Speech: 

They claim to be free-speech absolutists yet try to impose their speech beliefs on private corporations which is the antithesis of the Republican message of let business be free ( Disney). 

Regulation: 

They are for free enterprise and minimal government intrusion on private business so as to encourage business investment. Yet they’re trying to proscribe what Disney can do and trying to force companies to do away with diversity equity and inclusion ( this battle they will lose). 

Family values:

The vote in or put up people like Matt Gaetz, Roy Moore. And their leader has been found guilty of rape in a civil court and oppresses the rape victim by lying about her. And talks about his freedom to grab them in the pussy. He’s also walked in on nude Miss America contestants intentionally and been accused of sexual assault with other women. He cheated on his wife with a porn star.

They claim to be for individual freedom and rail govt intrusion: 

They were very upset with vaccine mandates and mask mandates yet they will mandate a woman to carry a child to term. It’s too inconvenient to wear a mask but let’s force pregnancy and possibly death on someone.

Pro-life:

80% of Republicans are pro death penalty. Also they don’t care about the lives that are already here they voted against school lunches in summer for poor kids. They don’t want to expand any social programs to support the child once they’re here. Is that pro life or pro birth?

Immigration:

They say they want orderly immigration but now that a bill that could actually work (unlike a wall that people can dig under) is available they won’t pass it. 

Freedom of religion:

https://www.npr.org/2023/02/14/1156642544/more-than-half-of-republicans-support-christian-nationalism-according-to-a-new-s#:~:text=Researchers%20found%20that%20more%20than,with%20those%20views%20(33%25).


“ Researchers found that more than half of Republicans believe the country should be a strictly Christian nation, either adhering to the ideals of Christian nationalism (21%) or sympathizing with those views (33%).” 

That’s not freedom of religion that’s proscribing your religion. How is that different from Muslims wanting to insert sharia law?

348,2024-02-01,CMV: Humans are inherently cooperative and egalitarian versus the violent and selfish brutes that modern civilization has made us out to be.,u/notmepleaseokay,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1agdy9r/cmv_humans_are_inherently_cooperative_and/,changemyview,"Buckle up - this is going to be a long one.

I know this might seem counterintuitive to what is being observed in modern day societies. We have murder, rape, wars, genocide, slavery, hate crimes, and large disparities between classes of people. There’s so many examples of people hoarding resources from needy underserved populations. There’s many examples of corporate greed in which they know they’re poisoning the world (see: forever chemicals such as PFO/PFAs pushed by companies like DuPont and 3M that’s now in everyone - and I do mean everyone’s - blood streams) but fail to act because it would hurt their shareholders bottom line. 

Personally, I am a professional ecologist who works in the private sector in America and knows first hand how governments write and re-write laws to help bolster business profits at the expense of the environment. I am not naive to the throes of how every major system (social/racial/environmental) is basically fucked and in need of a major upheaval to get things back on track - if they were ever on track in the first place.

All of this can be chalked up to greed of the few at the expense of the many. This greed seems to trickle down to the everyday person because if you’re not looking out for number one you’ll get left behind in the poisonous dust, polluted air, and contaminated drinking water. You’ll be poor, uneducated, and forever stuck in the cycle of being exploited for what little you do have by those who want it all.

However, I am currently in the process of writing a book about how f*cked humans are, how we got here, and what we can do about it. Through my interdisciplinary research I have discovered surprising theories contrary to what is obviously happening to us all. Which has changed my pessimistic POV of what being human really means.

Richard Dawkins might be the proponent of the trickle up theory of how our genes are selfish which equates to us as humans being selfish but I have come to the conclusion that he is ultimately short sighted in his argument.

To begin let’s get some dates straight - humans (Homo sapien sapien) first appeared 200,000 years ago. The beginning of modern civilization was only birthed 10,000 years ago with advent of agriculture (the Neolithic Revolution) which changed the way humans lived from migratory hunter-gathering to a more sedentary lifestyle. The sedentary life style that agriculture required is what has done us in, not our biology.

We are taught that our selfish brutish behaviors are inherent to our biology because if we just look to our closest ancestors - the chimpanzee - we will see that they too are violent creatures that live in cyclical harmony but are fraught with war, infanticide, resource hoarding, and rape. We share 98% of our DNA with them, so this must be true. But what is frequently over looked is that the chimpanzee is not our only closest relative there are also the bonobos. 

Bonobos also share 98% of our DNA and they are free of war, rape, infanticide, and resource hoarding. They’re cooperative, have sex for pleasure and conflict resolution, and are matriarchal. Historically, pre-agriculture, we share more with bonobos than we ever did with chimpanzees. In our natural environment which we evolved for, not the current one we are living in, we share more with bonobos than we ever did with chimpanzees.

Anthropological and archaeological investigations into hunter and gatherer tribes of the modern day show that the predominant themes between them are that they are egalitarian, cooperative, friendly, and easy going. This can be extrapolated to pre-modern humans due to the fact that these tribes, as seen in aboriginals or the Inuits to name two, have lived a traditional lifestyle up until very recently. 

Hunter-gathering tribes consisted of up to approximately 150 individuals. Which means that everyone knows everyone which then equates to social accountability. These tribes, while there are always exceptions to the norm, shared resources and didn’t praise anyone above anyone else as everyone was doing their part in supporting the tribe. Those who might have been too aggressive, attempted to resource hoard, or were disruptive in any way were ostracized, isolated, or even killed when other means didn’t work so that social cohesion was maintained.

Agriculture, on the other hand, ballooned populations due to increase fertility of women (not really a good thing) to levels where no one could know everyone which led to decrease accountability. Agriculture invented property, first with land and water, and then people were seen as resources by those who needed more workers to plow their fields. Agriculture birthed the patriarchy and made women and children into property. Agriculture created classes of the have and have nots and that led to disparity. Agriculture invented slavery as “civilized” societies captured and drug in hunter and gathering societies by their feet into their communities for cheap labor. Agriculture caused those in power to hoard resources from the greater collective. Agriculture led to wars between societies looking for more resources. Agriculture is the root of zoonotic (influenza, SARs, chickenpox etc) diseases to spread through our species. Agriculture led to famines as climate patterns changed. Agriculture led to the balloon of mental health problems. Agriculture is what destroyed our egalitarian ways.

We lived for approximately 190,000 years as hunter gathers amongst our family and kin. We lived in an environment which we were evolved for and we as a species were better for it. As Darwin points out, altruism and cooperation was naturally selected for because it was better for the species and as social animals because protecting our communities was as important as important as protecting oneself.

So, no we aren’t inherently selfish like Dawkins tries to claim nor are we naturally violent as our chimpanzee cousins. These are both symptoms of a sickness caused by living in an unnatural system. Just as birds who are kept confined that pluck out all their feathers, we are losing our minds and what it means to be truly human because of modern society - something we are not evolved for.

TL;DR humans are not naturally violent and selfish as modern day evidence has led us to believe. We lived as egalitarian altruistic communities for 190,000 years before the invention of agriculture. Agriculture and the sedentary life style that it required is what has caused us to become who we are today and is not a true reflection of the human species."

Coordinated Effort: There's a coordinated effort involving high immigration rates, leniency towards immigrant crime, and a focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by large corporations, particularly those like BlackRock, which have significant stakes in global markets. The overarching goal is to drive up the population in developed markets to create new profit avenues for corporations.  
Immigration and Crime: High immigration rates, coupled with low prosecution of immigrant crime, serve multiple purposes. Firstly, it boosts the population in developed markets, potentially expanding consumer bases for various industries. Additionally, leniency towards immigrant crime may be seen as a strategy to maintain a welcoming image and avoid backlash that could hinder immigration policies.  
DEI Initiatives and Corporate Interests: DEI initiatives, spearheaded by major corporations like BlackRock, are viewed as part of a broader strategy to ensure a diverse and inclusive workforce. However, they also serve the interest of corporations by tapping into previously overlooked talent pools and expanding market reach to diverse communities.  
Population Growth and Profitability: The increased population in developed markets presents new opportunities for profit generation, particularly for companies like BlackRock, which have investments across various sectors. With more consumers and a diversified workforce, these corporations can explore new markets and products, driving up their profitability.  
Crime as Catalyst for Government Control: As crime rates potentially rise due to factors like immigration and social tensions, there's a hypothesis that governments might capitalize on public fear to implement stricter surveillance measures. This could include the introduction of government IDs for tracking individuals and the establishment of a cashless society through a CDC bank. These measures ostensibly aim to enhance security and combat crime but also create new revenue streams through transaction fees and provide unprecedented access to consumer behavior data.  
AI and Big Data for Profit Generation: The integration of AI and big data in this scenario enables governments and corporations to analyze vast amounts of information, identifying market trends, consumer preferences, and potential investment opportunities. This data-driven approach allows for the creation of targeted marketing strategies, product development, and investment decisions, further amplifying profitability.  
In summary, the theory suggests a symbiotic relationship between immigration policies, corporate interests, government control measures, and technological advancements, all converging to drive up population, enhance profitability, and exert control over society."

The meat industry has a huge impact on global warming, it takes up massive amounts of land, and most animals live and die in horribly cruel circumstances. I am not innocent of buying meat from the grocery store, but I only eat meat about once every two weeks and try to treat it like a luxury instead of an every day food.  

I mean, even from an animal rights standpoint, what is better? an animal living its life in nature, with plenty of land to roam, or stuck in a tiny poo covered pen and only fed corn? It reminds me of that Parks and Rec episode where Ron brings a pig to slaughter for a family BBQ. There was gonna be a dead pig either way, slaughtering it in front of you only reminds you that at one point it was a live animal.

When we try to be the change we want to see, sure, we might inspire some folks around us. But does that really make everyone happy? Happiness isn't one-size-fits-all.

But there's a big difference between asking for respect and wanting someone to change who they are at their core.

Demanding change from others, especially when it comes to their core traits or passions, is an overstep. Sure, if someone's actions are harmful or disrespectful, it's only right to expect better from them. That's about setting boundaries, not remolding their identity.

I learned that dish soap is not in any way anti-microbial but simply an emulsifier, i.e. helps dissolve any oils so that you can rinse away any food residue.

If your dish is non-porous, then as long as you remove all the food residue and make sure to completely dry the dish (not with a bacteria-ridden dish cloth), then you’re good to go. For a dish that’s not overly oily with and has no stubbornly stuck-on food, hot water and a clean dish rag could do the trick.

This is in fact part of why cast iron care works, only you don’t even remove the oil completely because heating the pan when you cook helps keep the harmful microbes at bay (still need to get that food residue off though - don’t be that person using under-seasoned cast iron!).

With porous dishes (like wooden spoons) the soap’s emulsification is essential to be sure you’ve completely removed all residue (and even then, you may want to use a dishwasher or boiling water to clean a particularly nasty spoon)."

I think the actual reason they are upset is that they feel like their art, their passion and joy, is being ripped away from them and being used against them, and they instinctally dislike and feel is theft. Well, here's something you have that AI will never: creativity. As long as you have that, you will find work, and you will have an edge over AI images."

There are two main reasons I hold this view.  

One: I have had so, so many experiences where the sensor is completely faulty, leading to one of two outcomes - you finish your business and then struggle to figure out where the hidden ""manual flush"" option is because nothing is moving, or it seems to be working in reverse and it flushes the second you sit down, leading to splashback.

Two: if you're having digestive issues, whether it's chronic or temporary, your waste can tell you a lot.  Maybe you need to take a quick visual check on things to make sure the color looks right, determine whether any blood might be present, see if that corn you ate the day before is moving through at a proper speed or if it's showing up four days after you ate it, and so on.  But when the toilet flushes the instant you try standing up, you lose the ability to check on that.

3,2024-02-01,cmv: Military conscription is immoral and no one has a moral obligation to answer it,u/Round_Ad8551,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1agkw4p/cmv_military_conscription_is_immoral_and_no_one/,changemyview,"Conscription is involuntary servitude. It is forced labor. It is immoral.  
  
One does not owe military service to the state. All the benefits we get from the state are already paid for in taxes, nothing is free.  
  
Conscription is not the same as taxation. In conscription, one is forced to do a job that he/she does not agree with. In taxation, one still gets to do a job that one chooses, and only pay a percentage of one’s income as taxes (which is fair because the state provides benefits such as public schools, roads, etc.). The state however, does not have the right to force you to serve simply because you’ve received free education - that benefit you received is already paid for in taxes.  
  
In the USA, the constitution (13th Amendment) forbids slavery and involuntary servitude. If you live in the USA and get drafted you should be able to invoke the 13th Amendment in court. Of course, the Supreme Court of the United States has had its own interpretation of the 13th Amendment. It (the Supreme Court) ruled during the Vietnam War that the 13th Amendment does not apply to conscription since such duty is “owed” by the civilian to the state. That interpretation is wrong and hypocritical as nobody owes the state anything once they have paid their taxes (even in taxation citizens still have the right to scrutinize and alter how their tax money is spent). The notion that people owe something or anything to the state beyond taxes is preposterous. Any state that supports that notion is a kleptocracy in my opinion. Involuntary servitude imposed by the state is still involuntary servitude.  
  
You have the right to your own life and limb and only you have the right to decide what you wish to work as without the state interfering and stealing from you.  
  
Conscription is also a form of communism. Countries that claim to have capitalist values while supporting conscription are actually committing hypocrisy as conscription is essentially stealing from the individual to give to the collective. It is taking the autonomy, time, life and limb, of the individual and giving it to the collective. It is where you have no control over your own body and how you choose to use it because the state has conscripted it for the collective.

Imagine you are a normal person minding your own business when one day the pieve of land you live on is invaded and the government orders you to go fight at the front where you will probably die just because od the actions of some politicians you have no control over. That is absurd."

Papers being rubbed together and chalk on a chalkboard are other examples for me. Don't even get me started on standardized tests requiring no2 pencils. On the writing portions of those tests, I would write the bare minimum, or nothing at all, to minimize the pain. That literally completely affects a child's education and life. Let's say a kid does bad on a standardized test because they couldn't stand to write more than one paragraph, they could be bumped down a few classes. Or, worst case scenario sent to a special education program. If it's a highschool, they could be forced into a classroom of kids younger than them, where they have no friends, feeling out of place. This happened to me, my standardized tests are the only reason I was moved down to the ""dumb kids"" classes, and separated from my friends. It made me who I am so I cant complain too much

 If you think I'm exaggerating, just imagine being paralyzed by bad migraines half your childhood just because you're forced to use a pencil instead of a pen, and nobody took you seriously when you told them what was happening. There is zero reason to teach a kid pencils are more standard than pens, it's just laziness. Erasable pens exist and do not trigger misophonia.

The headaches/migraines are caused by the natural jaw clenching when triggered by sounds. 

Instead of separating a kid from his peers, pens should be the norm in every classroom. Same with chalkboards, whiteboards should be the norm instead. I don't care if it's only a single child in the whole school being affected, seriously just stop using pencils where it's unnecessary

There are many sects within Judaism, many different ways to practice, many different rituals and structures and ways of life.

I believe that the label, like most other labels is appropriate for whomever wants to associate with it, but it does not mean that they share anything else with someone else who uses the same label.

There are those who push a narrative of Judaism as a race/ethnicity, but I don't think it qualifies as either. It certainly isn't a race as anyone can be Jewish, from any background, and similarly there may be some shared traits among sects but not all, and not enough for the term to encompass them all in an ethnicity sense.

The term ethno-religion is the one I see most often, combining the idea of shared culture and belief structure, but I don't believe these are shared at all.

There are sects which interpret the book of Ezra as meaning that Judaism is matrilinial, and others who claim to be Jewish with only patrilinial descent. There are Etheopian Jews, Chinese Jews, Ashkenasi, Sephardi, all kinds of people who decide the label Jewish fits their belief structure.

Jewish as a term in and of itself may cover all of these, but there are still the qualifiers to delineate specifics, Chabad, Neterui Karta, Orthodox, Reform, many many different varieties and strains. There is no genetic gatekeeping as a whole, you only get this from some sects who gatekeep within their own sect, but they can't control anyone else's.

I'd like to hear how Judaism may be a race/ethnicity despite this, and whether there's some understanding of race/ethnicity which still manages to cover everyone who uses the label Jewish. I think it's a religion/belief structure based on a range of historic texts, but which like many other religions does not have true commonalities between all members."

Locus of control
Locus of control is the degree to which people believe that they, as opposed to external forces, have control over the outcome of events in their lives.


I often see people who think their lives are doomed due to exterior forces.

They essentially forfeit any personal agency. Everything that seems to happen to them, happens TO them, not due to their actions. Their existence roughly boils down to ""the system is rigged, why bother"", despite many indicators showing that now is the best time to be alive in history. 


My rough guess is that it is a coping mechanism. It's likely easier to sleep at night thinking the government/your parents/politics/etc are the reason you do not have what you want, and that you can't really change it.

Open to perspectives and curious as to why people have internal vs external locuses of control on how that impacts their life."

My view - which I am open to being changed - is that ""sportsmanship"" applies to both sides equally. It's important for kids to learn to be gracious in defeat, but they also need to learn to be gracious in victory as well. And if it's only taught in a lopsided manner, especially to kids who are still developing and learning, it makes it doubly hard for the losers.

I am a Turkish Jew so they might think I am biased in favor of the Sacklers because they are also Jewish. I am very critical of many Jews that is not a worry. I hate having to start the post with this but I didn't want all the replies to be about that

&#x200B;

If you don't know I will keep it brief, the Sacklers are a Jewish American family who used to own and operate Purdue Pharma, this company made the perscription pain killer Oxycottin. The Sackelrs are accused of among other things knowing that Oxycottin is dangerous,knowing it is addictive and not caring. 

I will offer my perspective. This list isn't indexed in any way so just deal with it

1: The Sacklers have facilitated great social change. They have funded many great institutions such as Stanford and Yale. These Universities are leading the fight for diversity and progress, Yale's most prestigious organization Skull and bones does have a single white member. These are the future elite of the world.  they also worked with openly gay consultant Amit Paley who later went on to lead the Trevor Project the world's largest LGBT advocacy group and lead them to record growth in their outreach. 

2: About the alleged victims, most of them were white. The prescription opioid epidemic hasn't really hurt communities of color.  Everyone says they wanted something would uplift people of color and the opioid epidemic has in an indirect fashion did that. It caused whites to spend more money on opioids, it caused them to die and go to prison in greater numbers meaning less white votes. This is what everyone said they wanted. Dave Chapel agrees with me on this. He makes a lot of points I am making.

>Dave Chappelle On Ohio's Heroin Crisis | Netflix Is A Joke

The Sacklers knew how corrupt white American society was and sought to change it. They have arguably done more to hurt white supremacy then anyone in history. 

&#x200B;

Also about their settlement that people hate and Biden is trying (and probably going to fail at) to get overturned.  They chose to pay the a few billion dollars and in exchange they would be immune to civil lawsuits and the courts would stop harassing them. 

The Sacklers did not have to pay anything. They chose to because either they felt bad or they just wanted to be left alone. It's obvious that ""victims"" families just want to milk them for an easy pay day. In a court of law Jews already have a disadvantage. However the fact they are so rich and most of the people who are still hung up on oxycottin are poor. It's hard for a jury to side with them. Even though they did nothing wrong, the courts agree which is why they were allowed the settlement. A jury is flawed. OJ Simpson famously got found innocent despite basically admitting to committing the crimes he was accused of."

If this drove him to low self esteem, suicide or going on a rampage would it be the fault of women? I think we'd all agree of course not. 

But when it comes to unrealistic beauty standards the blame is placed on men and their preferences as a driving force for women who want to seek out those standards. If a man wants a woman with big boobs, a slim waist and big butt he's ridiculed for not knowing what real women look like...but real women can in fact look like this, both naturally and through surgery.

To be a male protecter and a provider means to be competent.  Our biology necessitates this. In the past, a man that had his shit together meant a much higher chance for survival for her and the children. Women are basically sexually wired to want someone smarter than them, stronger than them, more emotionally stable than them, etc... 

To be a man that can truly help a woman grow mentally and emotionally is something (most) women actually do seek, deep down. The reason why females are attracted to men with high status and power is because part of their fantasy is to be sexually overwhelmed by the huge gap between their status and his. (Fifty Shades of Grey,  I'm looking at you.) As long as you demonstrate that you are a high status man, there is no such thing as, ""mansplaining."" Women will listen to you and want you to guide them. You will say similar things as those that get labeled as mansplainers, but HER response will be a complete 180 from what society tell us will happen and she will normally be purring like a kitten as you lead. 

There is no difference between this behavior from high status men and what feminists have deemed, ""mansplaining"" aside from the sexual attraction factor. A high status man in his natural state and a woman attracted to said high-status man are going to (typically) \*organically\* enter a relationship where the man is the mentor/dom and the woman is the pupil/sub. Therefore, ""mansplaining"" is often just a tem women lacking self-awareness about their own sexual nature use to describe men they DON'T find sexually attractive attemtping to dominate them. If the man had been more articulate or more sexually attractive (or both) the woman would have responded completely different to him. He would not have been called a mansplainer, she would have instead gotten wet and would have wanted to fuck him.

I will add a caveat that there truly are men out there that are just arrogant pricks and tend to talk down to women, but in my experience those men typically talk down to anybody they can, not just women.

The people who are “anti gay” in Canada/US most of the time simply oppose gay marriage due to religious reasons. Very few people are looking to kill anyone for being gay and the ones that do end up in prison for murder. Unlike Uganda, our broader society doesn’t condone murdering people over their sexuality. If you view it from a Ugandan perspective, most of them would probably hate the fact western society has benign views on sexuality. There are many other countries I could mention but I think my point is clear. That said, I think in an individual level  certain people can immigrate and adapt to whatever new society they find themselves in but overall our collective societies are way too different for us to all live together as “one world, one people”. Borders exist for a reason."
1,2024-02-01,CMV: cash is an outdated form of currency and should be phased out soon.,u/DamnPlayer23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aguend/cmv_cash_is_an_outdated_form_of_currency_and/,changemyview,"As someone who has been working retail for almost a decade, I find that cash has just become increasingly outdated and frankly unprofessional. I really think we should just phase out cash, I have no clue why people don’t trust banks. It’s insane how people just willingly carry around huge amounts of money in their pockets. I just think in 2024 where most people pay debt/credit it’s far more beneficial to both parties, to be quite honest I just think it looks a little silly to be paying cash in such a modern society. 


For my points 

-it’s unsanitary 

I cannot tell you the amount of times a customer has handed me rust covered and god knows how “sticky” change. It’s nasty and I really hate touching people’s nasty bills. 

-half the time the bills are ripped 

WHY? Why are your 5$ bills ripped? How does that even happen! I don’t want to accept bills like that but due to business I have to. It’s annoying and super ghetto. 

-could be fake cash

At my previous dispensary job, we lost insane amounts of cash everyday from people short changing us and fake bills! We received over 5-10 fake bills a day and it got so bad, and I cannot imagine how much trouble and money we should have saved from just not accepting cash like why don’t more places just do that to avoid a loss? 

-it slows the flow down

When you have a long line of customers and your total bill is 8-15$ why must you had someone a damn 100$ bill “it’s all I have” and I have to hand you a ton of change because your emptying my entire till of money just because your too stuck up to pay debt? I could have served 2 customers in the time I was handing you all your change. 

Yes I see the point of just handing over exact chnage and yes more places should do that but I’m open to a wider discussion on this topic."
1,2024-02-01,Cmv: Fork then knife or spoon,u/Affectionate-Ad6239,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aguv45/cmv_fork_then_knife_or_spoon/,changemyview,"I've thought this for a while but never said it out loud, probably never will for fear of the reaction. Before I get into it I'd like to preface this by saying I'm aware of the social norms and the potential backlash. 

I'm not a bad person, I try to help people and I know deep down at least some part of you will agree with this view. Anyway, change my view... I think forks are the best utensil for spreading mayo onto bread. 

Let's start with the dollop. A knife provides a laughable amount of mayo, so you'll be going back to the jar two, maybe three times. Spoon is second best for dollop but still has the potential to drastically overload the sandwich. By the time you finish the sandwich you'll be wearing half of the mayo. 

Onto the spread. The spoon is obviously the worst, getting an even spread is impossible, the lowest valley of the spoon forces mayo towards the edges and creates a wave of mayo that ends up piling onto the edge of your sandwich, increasing spill danger. The knife is good, a lot of people would even say great. I'll use a knife if I'm in a pinch but a fork works just as well, with the added dollop bonus. The forks voids allow mayo to seep through, back into dollop position. From here it's easy to either spread it on a dry area of bread or send it right back into the tub.

It’s not 1802 anymore, lots of people are gay bi trans. Why not accept it and move on? 

What is wrong with letting people love who they love? Is spreading positivity is a bad thing? I don’t understand why people want to spread hate and harm trans and gay people so much? Straight men want to see 2 girls kiss but cry and yell when they see 2 men kissing. 

I bet half the people who are anti LGBTQ are closeted, because to take your hate to such an extreme is almost weird in a way. 

Being an alpha male is a whole other issue, why? Just  why? Starting wars and acting cold hearted to your wife, drinking beer. It’s all too much, what are your proving from acting like an alpha male? No one thinks it’s cool besides other “alphas”

Not one alpha male in the world has actually satisfied a women and uses this persona to make up for the fact that they have a small 🍌. It’s embarrassing that people like Andrew Tate think like this and hate on people just trying to love each other and live in peace. 

What do people gain from acting “alpha” can somone explain?"

He throws them into a form of sorites; but, as such, it is logically faulty and all he wishes to convey is this: Oblivious of the suffering to which life is subject, man begets children, and is thus the cause of old age and death. If he would only realize what suffering he would add to by his act, he would desist from the procreation of children; and so stop the operation of old age and death.

The one and only way to completely end suffering is to stop reproducing.  People choose not to do that now and inevitably keep the cycle going.  The suffering that would come from destroying natalism would be nothing compared to the people who will be born in the next millions of years and experience these things.  

“There’s happiness in life too!!” No you just live sheltered preppy lives compared to people who are at the bottom of society.   You people live off the back of people below you no different than the ultra wealthy

Atleast with sissymaxxing, you get to experience for the first time what it feels like to be sexually desired, but with over men. Transmaxxing will open more doors to potential partners/boyfriends depending on how passable you are. It will lead to you getting treated better by society (doors held open for you, men more likely to accept your favours) since society doesn’t give a fuck about men and only cares about women and children.

At the end of the day, there are way more positive outcomes from sissymaxxing or transitioning MtF, than living as a straight sub-5 male who gets shitted on by pretty much everybody"

1,2024-02-02,CMV: Paternity Leave should be paid and of equal length to Maternity Leave,u/Low-Way-4841,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1agz48b/cmv_paternity_leave_should_be_paid_and_of_equal/,changemyview,"As an advocate of equal parental leave (irrespective of the sex/gender of the couples) and an aspiring father, I believe that equal parental leave should be a policy that is legalised across the world, as it not only allows for us to support the mother of our children during a challenging period of time, but enables us to bond with our children and have healthy attachments with them during their formative years. I wanted to post this here to obtain different perspectives on this opinion, whether from mothers, fathers, business owners etc. 

Here are some possible benefits of such a policy being implemented. 

1. Promotes Gender Equality:

Equalizing paternity and maternity leave promotes gender equality by challenging traditional gender roles. It encourages the idea that both parents share the responsibility of caregiving and allows families to decide how to balance work and parenting responsibilities based on their individual circumstances.

2. Supports Parental Bonding:

Fathers, like mothers, should have the opportunity to bond with their newborns. Equal paternity leave allows fathers to be actively involved in the early stages of their child's life, fostering strong emotional bonds between fathers and children.

3. Enhances Child Development:

Both parents play crucial roles in a child's development. Equal leave for both parents ensures that children receive care and attention from both parents during their formative years, potentially contributing to improved cognitive and emotional development.

4. Improves Work-Life Balance:

Equalizing paternity and maternity leave helps in achieving a better work-life balance for both parents. It acknowledges that employees, regardless of gender, need time to care for and bond with their newborns without compromising their career aspirations.

5. Reduces Gender Stereotypes in the Workplace:

Equal leave policies challenge traditional stereotypes associated with gender roles in the workplace. It helps break down the notion that women are the primary caregivers and men are solely responsible for providing financially.

6. Boosts Employee Satisfaction and Loyalty:

Offering equal parental leave can enhance employee satisfaction and loyalty. Companies that support work-life balance and family-friendly policies are often viewed more positively by employees, leading to higher morale and retention rates.

7. Encourages Shared Parenting Responsibilities:

Equal paternity leave encourages shared parenting responsibilities, fostering a more equitable distribution of caregiving duties between partners. This can contribute to a more supportive family environment.

8. Facilitates Women's Career Advancement:

When both men and women take equal parental leave, it helps eliminate the perception that women are more likely to take extended career breaks due to caregiving responsibilities. This can contribute to reducing the gender pay gap and promoting women's career advancement.

9. Aligns with Changing Family Dynamics:

Family structures and dynamics have evolved, and many families no longer adhere to traditional roles. Equal paternity and maternity leave policies reflect and support diverse family arrangements."

I'll start with disease, aging, and then physical and mental anguish, and then miscellaneous suffering.

Disease:
 I am 20, I have osteoarthritis in my feet, a bunch of tendon problems, and some other shit. As far as the birth lottery goes, this is far from the worst. Some people have much much worse than me.

Aging:
If I am miserable with my current conditions, imagine what it will be like to live 20 years from now. My grandmother looks miserable, and my grandfather is dead. As you get older, everybody you know will die, probably painfully. And every time someone dies, the people they leave behind get to experience deep sadness and grief.

Physical and mental anguish:
Think of all the things that can hurt you physically or mentally. The human body is fragile. One bad fall, and you now have permanent nerve damage.  People evolved to reproduce, not to be happy. If you're missing a single thing, your body responds by making your life incredibly painful. Food, water, socializing, comfort, and so on.

Miscellaneous:
Look at nature. Does not seem like a very happy place. Then look at what humans have done. We took already mediocre lives of animals and stuffed them into factories where they live in 1 square foot their whole lives. Slavery, exploitation, hazing, etc. humans unintentionally create immense suffering just by existing. 

TLDR:
I could keep going but I don't think anybody will read any more. In my eyes, a truly happy life is not possible in reality. In a imaginary world, these many problems would not exist. 

The closest you could get in reality in 2024 is probably some machine that feeds you chemicals and drugs that feel good. 

Your body already does this with serotonin and dopamine to try and get you to reproduce.

 Social behavior, love, food, etc. are all just things that make reproduction more likely, and so they incentive it with chemicals and good feelings."

The state also uses practices such as military conscription to preserve itself at the cost of the freedom and lives of individual citizens.

The only fair system is anarcho-capitalism as it gives people the most freedom and choice.

And before some smooth brain guy says baselessly that anarcho-capitalism will devolve into feudalism, I call bs. In a free market it is impossible for a single organization to gain an exploitative monopoly as if it attempts that, customers will simply move on to competitor organizations which do not exploit their customers."

I'm a vegetarian for ethical reasons and I bond with pets so much I consider them my best friends.

Animals are less rational, so we typically consider them more emotional. My view is that they're both less rational AND less emotional, in the sense their inner lives are less rich and vivid, their feelings are not as intense. I believe highly intelligent animals like dogs, cats, parrots, corvids, elephants, whales etc feel loneliness, grief, joy and love, but in less intense ways.

Their lymbic systems are just smaller compared to their bodies and/or less dense. There's no way the emotions run with the same complexity. Also, as their prefrontal cortexes are even smaller/less dense, emotions won't be subject to the same amount of complexification via interaction with mores, ideas, culture, self awareness, etc, which is a huge part of how human emotions become so powerful.

I’m genuinely looking for other thoughts here. But I do think the humble and versatile Kettlebell will be hard to beat.

The Kettlebell and the myriad associated exercises can do cardio or strength. It can be dynamic with swings and snatches, or low impact and static.

It has no moving parts and is incredibly sturdy (I’m talking the proper iron ones, I know the cheaper sand/plastic imitations aren’t as reliable). It takes up a very small footprint.

The big downside would be that you choose a specific weight and live with it for a while. I could see a user hitting a plateau after a time.  But even there I think the kettlebell is dynamic enough where you can feel a certain amount of mastery and fluidity, which will give your workouts greater depth.

Interested to hear about other affordable home gym items folks are passionate about.

**Defining ‘Single Piece of Home Gym Equipment’:** We’re talking about something that is reasonably one ‘thing’ used in a workout.  

So a ‘set of dumbbells’ is pushing the concept, but I’d listen. Because you do sort of need two dumbbells to do alternating curls or other sorts of established dumbbell workouts.

A Jump Rope works. A Box Jump box works.  

An attachment for an existing workout station or squat rack you may have doesn’t work. But a standalone doorway pull up bar type attachment would.

Finding something used for under $50 is a valid loophole, but it’s gotta be reasonable. Just because you found a bowflex or a treadmill cheap on Craigslist doesn’t mean others could."

3. More money for the average person and reduced government spending. Cars are expensive to buy and maintain. Roads and parking lots are also very expensive to build and maintain.

It would be detrimental in the short term. Most people would have to make drastic changes to their lifestyle. Many would have to move or change jobs.

I'm a professional 3D artist, and I've come to believe that almost all teaching about ""color theory"" is misguided.

The way I see it, there are three flavors of color theory:

1. Color psychology
2. Color harmonies
3. Color space

I think color psychology is an absolute pseudoscience. Color harmonies are impressively misunderstood. *Color space is fine. I have no problem with actual color science.*

**Color psychology:**

**Tl;dr: it's too easy to make an image that doesn't fit its colors' ""meanings""**

The belief that an artist can communicate various concepts or emotions with their choice of color. It's usually communicated as ""blue is professional, orange is energetic,"" and the like. You'll find tables online giving you the list of meanings of colors.

Two problems:

1. It's exceedingly easy to make a picture communicate all the wrong things according to its color psychology. As an experiment, I sampled a bunch of words often associated with blue, and made a picture using absolutely no blue.  
Tranquility, cleanliness: [A still lake in the sunset.](https://imgur.com/dTBa8Qe)  
Freedom: [Open space](https://imgur.com/ulHoEnF).  
Freshness: [Lush vegetation](https://imgur.com/zy17EVN).  
Stability: [A castle](https://imgur.com/ALEtNyd).  
Authority, wisdom, sadness: [A somber old wizard](https://imgur.com/SQ5tAsf).  
And all the while, it was sore easy to avoid the concepts associated with my primary colors, orange and green: Orange: Youth, health, danger. Green: Prosperity, health, envy, corruption.
2. There are obviously connotations to different colors, but those are idiosyncratic to individuals and to cultures. It is not possible to say beforehand what association your audience will have with your color choices. That is unless you pick something unnatural. Blood will always be red, so if you paint green blood, it will look strange, and you can bank on your audience thinking it's strange.

**Color harmonies:**

**Tl;dr: Images that don't follow them can be beautiful, and images that do can be ugly**

Color harmonies are specific relationships of hues on the color wheel. There are many claims online about these, and I find most of them dubious, so it's hard to recount them faithfully. But I'll try.

People seem to say that the established schemes (triadic, analogous, complementary, etc.) simply ""look good"" together. Patently false. It's so easy to make them look terrible together that it's hard to fathom how this argument ever gained any foothold. It's also easy to make a color scheme that looks nice and *isn't* an established harmony on the wheel.

Some people say that they communicate different emotions. Complementary, for instance, has ""tension,"" since the colors are opposite each other on the wheel. Problem here is, people can't seem to agree on the emotion they convey. I also find sources stating that complementary schemes are ""naturally pleasant.""

And when people analyze classical paintings and movies, they seem to always miss something very important: There are millions of colors on the screen. When you look at a vectorscope (a color wheel where every pixel is plotted,) you'll almost always find that the image doesn't neatly fit into any scheme. It's usually all over the place.

&#x200B;

I'd love see what benefits people actually get from color theory. Bring it on! Help me learn."

The evidence from countless randomized controlled trials is incontrovertible. Vaccines have been shown to:

**Reduce Incidence of Diseases:** RCTs have conclusively demonstrated that vaccines dramatically reduce the incidence of diseases they target. For example, vaccines against measles, polio, and HPV have led to a significant decline in these diseases. Anyone disputing this is either uninformed or willfully ignorant of one of the most robust findings in medical science.

**Improve Public Health and Longevity:** Vaccination has played a momentous role in increasing life expectancy and improving public health. Diseases that once caused widespread morbidity and mortality have been brought under control or even eradicated in some cases, like smallpox. Denying this is akin to denying the earth is round – it goes against overwhelming empirical evidence.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** RCTs and subsequent epidemiological studies have shown that vaccines are a cost-effective public health intervention. Preventing disease invariably costs less than treating it, both in economic terms and in terms of human suffering.

**Safety:** Sure, no medical intervention is without risk, but the safety profile of vaccines is extraordinarily high, as evidenced by numerous RCTs and post-marketing surveillance. The incidence of serious adverse effects is exceedingly low compared to the benefits of vaccination. Any claim to the contrary is typically based on misinterpretation, cherry-picked data, or outright misinformation."

I see the number of past partners being constantly discussed and I'm just honestly surprised that people care so much about it.  
  
So here's my interpretation of it: underneath all the arguments about how it impacts relationship stability, your chances of finding a good partner later in life, what it says about your morals, and so on, is an undercurrent of plain old jealousy and resentment. Most guys actually dream they could get to the sort of numbers attractive women get and because they can't, they get resentful and lash out. It's all a veneer or rationality and argument, used to rationalise strong emotions.

I'm not saying this explains everything for everyone, but I think it's the real driving force. It certainly explains why people care so much even when it has nothing to do with them or the specific person they want to date."

Last but not least: He was friends with Anatoly Lukyanov, and as quoted by Wikipedia: ""Immediately after the attacks, the Supreme Council issued a letter to the people of the Soviet Union and to the rest of the world denouncing the attacks"".  
Anatoly had been chairman of the Supreme Council since Gorbachev left office and became the Kremlin which means that Anatoly tried to help cover up that it never happened or that it was exaggerated

What I'm saying is that adopting a version of black pill beliefs could be healthy.  
  
Let me demonstrate. If you go to therapy and you tell them about your regret for taking or not taking certain actions, or you tell them about how you feel fomo about something that isn't going to be available, they will tell you to come to peace with what happened and the circumstances, to accept them as they are and learn to be content with what they are.  
  
The black pill at it's core is similar to this. It tells you to acknowledge the way things are (take the black pill) to understand and accept the way things are (giving up on cope) and to come to terms with it. For most the bottom 80% of men, being as sexually successful and desirable as a chad is impossible or incredibly difficult to obtain without extreme work. For us men in the bottom 20%, being attractive or sexually successful is not possible regardless of effort. It's just nature.  
  
In the wild lesser males don't get to mate while the higher males monopolize on the females. The same was true for humans until the rules changed and made it so that women were financially dependent on men. Now things are back closer to the natural order of things and we see women exhibit their desired dating and sexual patterns. Unfortunately a lot men are excluded. There's a reason why passport bros exist, to replicate the previous false order of things.  
  
Adopting this view will be healthier than the current other alternatives. Believing a false hope or sinking into toxicity are both in the long run harmful to a persons happinesss. Just accepting dating and sex isn't in the cards is just better for your mind and body."

544,2024-02-03,CMV: The sentence of Bryn Spejcher for stabbing her boyfriend to death was ridiculous.,u/vuzz33,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ahyd7d/cmv_the_sentence_of_bryn_spejcher_for_stabbing/,changemyview,"I'm refering to the California woman who stabbed her boyfriend 108 times after consuming cannabis and only sentenced last month to 100 days of community service.

This case reminds me of Sarah Halimi's one in France where an elderly lady got thrown off a window by a man who had just taken cannabis before his rampage and was considered not criminally responsible penally.

Although, contrarily to that other murder I do think that Bryn was indeed in a serious state of psychosis as she not only stabbed her boyfriend but her dog, and herself. And when the police intervened, even taser and baton strikes were not very effective at stopping her.

That being said I do believe that the sentence she received was highly problematic (way too low) for these 4 reasons:

* Even if marijuana frenzies can potentially happen on rare occasions, I just don't believe a mentally stable person could reach such violence with only marijuana. This led me to believe that she either consumed other additional substances or that she has some sort of mental instability that can lead her to become violent in some instances. And if that second hypothesis is true, then she needs psychiatric treatment (which was the decision for Sarah Halimi's murderer)
* Maybe the most important of my 4 points: Her not being aware during the killing doesn't mean she isn't responsible for it. The fact that she willingly decided to take psychotropic drugs that could potentially cloud her judgment meant she was responsible for putting herself in that state. Correct me if I'm wrong but if a person after consuming alcohol becomes violent a attacks others, he will be convicted. Removing all responsibility for marijuana sounds like encouragement for murderers to use this excuse and be cleared of charges.
* Receiving only 100 days of community service after brutally killing someone is shameful and a total disrespect for the deceased and his family. It just isn't right.
* Let's not fool ourselves, she only got this miraculous judgment because she was an upper-class white woman. If it was a man, poor or of color that sentencing would have been different.

And for these 4 reasons are believe that Bryn judgment was not only unfair but dangerous."

1. Only so many men, say 1/10, attract women.
2. Men in this group date multiple women at once, creating a high demand for women
3. These men are able to attract women because they themselves are very good looking. 

Grossed myself out a bit typing that. Disclaimer: I don't think there is a group of men with these shared set of traits that attract women (by this I mean there is not a type of man all women are attracted to). However, even if there was such a group, the key trait wouldn't be attractiveness, but money. The men that do have a lot of sex with multiple women do so, because of money, and there's only so many women who are interested in that. 

I think incels make this mistake because for the most part, being ugly isn't a choice. In their redpilled world, being poor is. I think that's a more challenging unreality for them to face.

You can change my view if you can convince me that attractiveness plays a greater role than money, or if there's a third factor I haven't considered.

You can't change my view that there really is some group of men out there who are the only ones having sex. "

As a guy, this honestly sounds like a sweet deal, but there is no world that women would agree to that. Matriarchy is typically nothing more than a power fantasy that grants authority over men without any responsibility to provide for them and protect them. Women (typically) don't want to work the dangerous manual labor jobs, they don't (typically) want to provide for and protect men, and they don't (typically) want to sacrifice themselves to protect men.

In order for a state to exist it needs a monopoly on violence and it needs to abuse that monopoly to exploit the people by stealing their money and potentially sending them to their deaths in war.

No free person is required to involuntarily give money to someone or to involuntarily fight and die for someone. If a person is required to do these things, that person is not free.

And I want thorough critiques.

So I'd start off first with what the hell evil is in the first place.

There's this thing I've seen somewhere about the distinction between evil on a metaphyical level and evil on an epistemological level.
What I think is that evil on an epistemological level is the fundamental of what evil is in and of itself, so I think the distinction disappears; evil is metaphyically epistemological, how did I come to such conclusions, here's how;

The very concept of ""Evil"" necessitates an experiencer (psychological component) and an experienced (physical component)— a volcano splattering isn't ANY evil.. until it kills someone, displaces someone...

Even if you point out to a volcano destroying an empty world as evil, at least in an intuitive sense, 

The meta-hypothetical is that someone is experiencing THAT evil by the very virtue of you pointing that out.

So, Evil requires an experiencer; a psychological component to exist.

Now on the flip side, a person in a vacuum experiences no evil, by definition, cause there's nothing to experience.

So, Evil requires also a physical component.

Now what's the greatest possible evil?

Stepping on a pin is, at least intuitively, less evil than the Holocaust.

Why is that the case?

I propose this:

The reason is the difference in physical intensity obviously.

But also the differing psychological intensities — a pin step-on would make you wimp and remember all the times momma used to tell you not to be so rowdy, to watch where you're going;

A person in a chamber experiences existential dread of how they're nothing more than rats toyed with under the whims of their fellow human.

From the foregoing; The greatest evil is the synergy of:

**The greatest amount psychological intensity + The greatest amount of extra-psychological intensity.**"

They questioned his ability to handle the responsibility of the nuclear button. However, during his presidency, it seems that things remained relatively peaceful.  


Lets look at what has gone on in the past 4 years under a Biden presidency.  


1. Russia and Ukraine: The situation in Ukraine has escalated significantly since Biden took office. We've seen a full-scale invasion by Russia and countless lives lost.
2. Growing U.S.-China tensions: Under Biden, the relationship between the U.S. and China has become strained, with disputes over trade, human rights, and territorial claims in the South China Sea. The U.S. has also increased its military presence in the region
3. Iran: Biden freed up $6 billion toward Iran which just funded them for future and current wars they support 
4. North Korea: Under Biden, North Korea has been conducting more missile and nuclear tests, increasing the risk of an escalation in the region. Trump met and shook hands with Kim Jong Un in person.
5. Palestine-Israel Conflict: The situation in the Middle East has remained awful, with no significant progress towards peace. Countless lives have been lost.
6. US Troops Killed in Jordan: The recent attack on US troops in Jordan had 3 troops killed and 30 injured while they were sleeping.
7. Houthi Attacks: The Houthis have been launching attacks in the Red Sea.
8. US-China-Taiwan Relations: Tensions between the US and China have been on the rise, with the potential for conflict over Taiwan. China has been ramping up its military presence around Taiwan, making the possibility of conflict more likely.
9. U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan: The chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2021 has been criticized as a strategic failure. We left them weapons, vehicles and supplies for them to conduct more carnage.

Now, I'm not saying Trump was perfect by any means, but it seems like we were further away from World War 3 during his presidency, and things were relatively peaceful."

Why would anyone want to live in a non gentrified area? The properties would be absolute garbage, there would be run down shops and shitty infrastructure and top of that it would be unsafe and riddled with crime and homelessness.

Having real or fake naked pictures of you on the Internet will become normal and trivial, not anything anyone would fire you or cut your sponsorships or break up with you about.

Making or sharing such images without consent of the people depicted is not materially harmful to them other than through that stigma, and so there is no other reason to prohibit them."

Now that a crisis of immigration poses serious economic and humanitarian problems, the liberal government has mostly abdicated on responsibly handling it, and the reason is not because they hate America or are so anti-racist or humanitarian that they can’t see the damage of their policies. It’s because the policies advocated by the conservative opposition will “solve” the problem through a strategy based on racist paranoia rather than on economic concerns. (e.g. There are many policies that could reduce the downward effect of immigrant labor on wages, but many Republican politicians as well as conservative media outlets insist on a policy of force.)

In our political system that encourages factionalism instead of serious efforts to develop solutions, it is impossible to address this crisis, and it is mostly the fault of nativists for poisoning the well of discussion for the last 200 years.

I also know that my claim that Republican plans to address immigration through forceful border security measures ignore other ways to mitigate the downward effect on the price of labor that an influx of low-skill workers causes will get some push back. I should list some specific examples of this.

* The fear of immigrants of being caught is a part of why they accept being paid such low wages. Criminalizing immigration further will encourage this problem.
* Trade unions drive up the price of labor, and yet Republican leaders consistently appoint officers to the government who are hostile to organized labor.
* Republican Governors and voters like sending immigrants to sanctuary cities where they know the local economies will not be able to support the influx of people. However, there are many parts of the country that do not have shortages of space/shelter *and* that have shortages of labor where immigrant labor would be very valuable.
* Strengthening the regulatory state would reduce the scale of the exploitation of migrant labor that steals jobs from native-born Americans."

1,2024-02-03,CMV: Sometimes spankings are the only way.,u/Aspiring-Programmer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ai1j4i/cmv_sometimes_spankings_are_the_only_way/,changemyview,"Genuinely looking to have my mind changed on this situation, so please actually try with your comments this time.

My siblings and I all grew up getting spankings for bad behavior and we didn’t grow up to dislike our parents.

But even so, we accepted the new world ideas and tried to not spank the next generation of kids.

We used methods like timeout and stern talking tos, redirection and all that. For the most part it works to curb bad behavior.

But one of my nephews has a bad habit of taking things from the fridge and then hiding them. Rotting fruit behind couches and him eating raw bacon became an issue. He would also refuse to tell you where he hid it, and we wouldn’t find it until days later except by smell alone.

This last time, however, we were just over it and when he wouldn’t tell us where it was, he got a spanking. He still didn’t say where it was (this time), and we just found it after looking a while.

He’s just done it again today, however. He hid icecream and we wanted to find it before it melted. He wouldn’t tell us where it was. All it took was the threat of a spanking and he slowly walked us to where he hid it in a corner under a blanket.

No other punishment would’ve yielded those results in my opinion. He had to be spanked in order for him to stop lying to us and just tell us where it was, and we didn’t even have to repeat the spankings, just mention them.

Now yes, some of you might be inclined to say the solution is a child lock on the fridge but that’s skirting the issue that he willingly lies to adults and won’t tell the truth no matter what, until he was spanked. He does it for other things other than rotting food, this was just a quantifiable example."

People tend to form an opinion based on how you present yourself (first impression)=>I should always present myself as best as i could (hide flaws/enlarge qualities)=>Due to the nature of today's society, frequent interractions with the same person are unlikely so the other party won't learn of my ""fascade""=> Get labeled a certain way even though i only put in the effort to look a certain way for the occasion=> Repeats the behavior as many times as necessary to increase my social life success.

A personal anecdote of mine is that i had a lot of success dating when i started lying about my income,dressing extravangtly (i don't like dressing at all),wearing height increasing soles, weeseling my way through the conversation (acting knowledgeable when i don't know anything), and to my surprise people didn't call me on this.

1,2024-02-03,CMV: VideoGame developers get a lot of unwarranted hate online and yet deserve so much earned hate that goes undelivered.,u/efd731,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ai34r1/cmv_videogame_developers_get_a_lot_of_unwarranted/,changemyview,"Videogame developers and management receive abuse and death threats far too frequently (in general obviously) but specifically in regards to minor graphical details, videogame balance, imagined features invented by overhyped fanboys,  or stories told to an audience of millions not being to the subjective taste of a handful of dozens. the anonymity of the internet allows any random retard to sperg out at a moments notice and spew nonsensical abusive bullshit at anyone they can @ and that's genuinely terrible.  


now let me tell you why i believe Videogame devs deserve so much more\* abuse for better reasons.  


&#x200B;

1)Broken games: anybody with a pair of braincells to rub together is aware that Publishers or in the  case of independent studios CEO's/CFO's and shareholders are truly responsible for the absurd frequency of ""crunch"" in the industry and the rushed development schedules and early releases of busted ass games. However, dev's frequently publicly lie through their goddamn teeth to audiences of millions via twitter, regular marketing,livestreams and collabs with various youtube/twitch personalities. 

 Straight up entire falsehoods, deliberate misleading statements, trailers not only edited to look greater that the game could ever be(graphically) but containing events and characters that do not even exist in the game(TLOU2 for example). the Devs damn well know the state of their own game, but how often do we receive an anonymous leak forewarning the horrific impending state of a game?? literally never.  And so in my opinion, this makes the developers morally culpable for and complicit in the absurd bullshit the marketing and management folks come up with and implement. If any other industry engaged in such behaviour, the people who actually implement such things wouldn't escape criticism and judgement.  
 A Shitty Construction company cuts corners and uses substandard material on orders from the higher-ups, the Carpenter who built your house that collapsed knew what he was doing the entire time, and saying ""i couldnt do anything or i'd be punished/lose my job"" doesn't absolve them of their guilt. Why do people and the Dev's believe that being in some kind of creative medium somehow distances them from their own actions and the consequences thereof?  


  
2)Microtransactions: same argument as  above, ""oh i was just following orders"" or ""if i didn't do it somebody else would!! and i'd lose my job"" are totally understandable reactions to being told ""you coded this shit, it's directly your fault"".  But guess what, if it's your job to implement a monetization system that deliberately preys on ignorant kids with access to mom and dads credit cards, those with a weakness to gambling, and contains the worst kind of skinner box FOMO influenced borderline abusive tactics, guess what? You're a massive piece of shit doing something horrible. Beyond the basic monetization, many games are entirely Warped by/built around the microtransactions they contain, ensuring the entire game is made worse just by the presence of monetization, meaning other devs beyond the Monetization team choose to make their games worse deliberately to assist abusive practices. so they can get fucked too.  I don't care if it's your job, if your job requires you to be a piece of shit, you don't get to complain when someone calls you a piece of shit.  


in conclusion, carrying out malicious bullshit orders from above doesn't absolve you from the fact that you still did the shitty thing, and being a ""creative"" ""artistic"" type doesn't magically make you not responsible for your own actions."

My post today is about my experience after many years of playing multiplayer games and participating in online forums.  

Botting has always been a hot topic.  I would say my post mainly focuses on MMOs although I believe it extends to any game with marketable items *or* long term farmable rewards.  

Often in these communities you see a sentiment that companies are not doing enough to combat botting, but when they rarely comment, developers often cite the tens if not hundreds of thousands of bots they are banning yearly.  

It’s “not enough” though as any game with an economy quickly is plagued by bots profiting off of the selling of gold or even farmed accounts.  Players feel their time is devalued as the value of gold drops, and they feel their achievements are lessened as more bot accounts reach those milestones.  

There are generally two common arguments I see:

1). Companies either laying off or simply refusing to hire game masters to police their servers in real time.

This argument falls short for two reasons.  If these companies are really banning tens to hundreds of thousands of bots, even a dozen game masters would be a drop in the bucket.  They only make an impact by banning the most visible bots, at the highest and lowest end at the cost of hundreds of thousands.

2).  Companies don’t want bots banned because it hurts their revenue.

This argument is uninformed and conspiracy like.  Having spoken to many owners of bot farm, these people aren’t paying the company for new accounts, they are buying them for pennies on the dollar from “suppliers” who use stolen credit cards (which are eventually reversed) or in low cost currencies.  Some games (like RuneScape) have had to take drastic action after banks threatened to not work with them.

 Botting is an arms race that goes through cycles as both sides upgrade their technology.  From a player perspective it sucks, but is just an inevitability.

I am open to changing my view because I hate the impact bots have in games, I just don’t see it happening with what I know and haven’t seen any popular games do it successfully."
1,2024-02-03,CMV: Cultural appropriation is only cultural appropriation if you're actually trying to mimic and claim the culture.,u/Responsible-Poem-516,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ai5w5d/cmv_cultural_appropriation_is_only_cultural/,changemyview,"Let me explain : 

I can wear a crown of feathers in my hair with other animal paraphernalia. If I do, someone will inevitably tell me it is offensive to natives. However, it is only so if I'm actually trying to emulate a native headdress. Regardless of how close to a native headdress it is, if it truly was my creation and the resemblance is coincidence, I can add a disclaimer saying it was not my intention to culturally appropriate, but I *do not have to change this creation in ANY way* to look less like a headdress. 

The reality is, it was my creation. I did not intend to culturally appropriate. Beyond writing a disclaimer, am simply not obligated to put in the extra effort to suppress my art in order to be non-offensive because of a message that the audience hypervigilantlylooks for and decides to derive vs. it being one the artist actually intentionally tried to convey.

Just like a word can mean two different things, two different art styles can look incredibly similar without sharing inspiration.  

Just like being in a relationship with a partner with PTSD, you can provide a steady and healing environment, but you can not realistically anticipate every single trigger and make life safe for them, and when a meltdown happens, it's not your fault. The cause is the PTSD. (Which can be compared to the collective these days : very easily triggered after hundreds of years of generational trauma for some cultures. It's only natural to assume it would affect the collective like PTSD, in a way, and right now the entire world needs therapy.)

However : If I as a white woman create a headdress inspired by Native tradition and wear it, posting photos with a caption like ""Just embracing my inner native"" or otherwise claiming part ownership of a culture that my ancestors have tried to suppress at best and violently eradicate at worst, that *is* cultural appropriation and to profit through attention or money would be wrong. I would be knowingly doing a huge disservice to the culture.

Intention matters. You cannot derive an artists full intention just by looking at the art and forming your own opinion. Every person is an endless well of creativity, and deserves the chance to at least try to be original without all the red tape. All we can do is acknowledge cultures and write disclaimers, but I believe everyone should find the balance between respect of other cultures and respect for one's own creativity and should refuse to limit themselves for the sake of walking on eggshells. 

Be kind to others, but do not limit yourself. Do not compromise on this.

1,2024-02-03,CMV: The American feminist movement is the easiest fight for civil rights in history.,u/Scary-Ad-1345,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ai6wd7/cmv_the_american_feminist_movement_is_the_easiest/,changemyview,"I’ve been pondering the nature of various civil rights movements throughout American history and how they compare in terms of challenges faced and victories achieved. Specifically, I’ve come to believe that the American feminist movement, particularly its early stages, was relatively easier compared to other civil rights struggles. Here’s why:

	1.	Demographic and Societal Influence: Unlike other marginalized groups, women constitute roughly half the population. Early on, the feminist movement’s primary task was mobilizing this substantial demographic—particularly white women, who had access to certain societal privileges through their proximity to white men. This isn’t to overlook the genuine oppression women faced but to highlight the unique position they occupied within the societal structure.
	2.	Internal Consensus: A significant part of the movement’s effort was focused on convincing women themselves of the merits of seeking equality. The resistance to the movement wasn’t always external; it also came from within, as societal norms had ingrained a certain complacency and acceptance of the status quo among many women. The notion was that once a critical mass of women agreed on the need for equal rights, achieving these goals would be considerably more straightforward.
	3.	Nature of Opposition: The feminist movement, especially in its formative years, did not face the same level of violent backlash that civil rights movements for racial equality encountered. This is not to say women did not face oppression or violence, but rather that the systemic and violent opposition from the state and vigilantes was of a different scale and nature. The suffrage movement led to the 19th Amendment in 1920, less than a century after it began to gain momentum, marking a significant victory for women’s rights.
	4.	Economic and Educational Access: While certainly not universal, many white women had relatively better access to education and economic resources, which could be leveraged in the fight for rights. The ability to organize, fund, and advocate for change is significantly influenced by such resources.
	5.	Comparative Struggles: Consider the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, which was fighting against centuries of entrenched racial segregation and discrimination. African Americans, despite making up a large minority, faced not only systemic barriers but also widespread, often state-sanctioned, violence in their fight for basic rights. The contrast in what each movement was up against is stark.

In essence, the argument isn’t that the feminist movement didn’t face challenges or wasn’t necessary. Instead, it’s about recognizing the relatively advantageous position from which it started and questioning the narrative of the struggle. The movement did indeed result in profound changes and was crucial for advancing gender equality. However, comparing the paths different civil rights movements have had to take, the feminist movement appears to have had a clearer, & relatively easy, route to achieving its primary goals.

You can argue the amount, fair but unless you're paying their rent as much as money matters it's money, anyone can throw money in someone's face and the person still not completely feel appreciated, you can disagree that's cool 

Corporations and payment processor companies successfully brainwashed Americans into thinking if you dont want to you shouldn't even bother going out because YOU'RE BROKE. ""Maybe the corporations should pay their employees"" nah, you're broke, you wanna order food and it took a while so you didn't tip? You're the bad guy for not tipping, not the corporations that should be paying these people their money you're the bad guy for not covering the for the corporations. The server was rude and the food was bad? You're the bad guy for not tipping and even if the service is bad you should tip. Such a mindless nonsense way to think, tipping is optional, you got bad service but you should still tip and pay what the corporations should be paying their employees 

Some American states add the tip, so some businesses instead of paying their employees literally just make you pay the money they should be paying their employees and this is normal for them. The japanese dont accept tips, pretty much every other country tipping is optional and ironically when travelling to some of the poorer parts of the world they'll want me to eat for free, not sure if its because im nice but they're not money hungry like americans 

Corporations own America, corporations and banks own American's government and they even want you to tip self checkout? Tipping is optional, it's for very good service, the people working the job already get paid and its good to tip but this idea of people doing bad jobs and you still having to tip even though its supposed to be optional is strange 

They can either boycott tipping and I understand alot of people rely on tips but the fact that people's jobs relies on tips is enough to boycott, if not the corporations are gonna keep pushing tipping culture while they lower wages. This means even though you're all making less, you'll still be tipping and essentially paying the workers. America's corporatist economy and economic landscape has successfully saved corporations tons of money as they dont actually have to pay their workers"

Now that's out the way even though it most likely went over your head I can start the thread 

Anytime anything happens people rush to blame spooky free market capitalism and you'd be wrong especially if you're American. America isn't capitalist, it's a corporatist nation and if they actually had a good education system in America Americans would know the difference between free market capitalism and corporatism. ""Nooo it's capitalisms fault"", America's government is owned by corporations, corporations line the pockets of your politicians. How is it politicians in America are filthy rich when their salary doesn't match their assets? They give ""talks"" to banks and corporations like Obama did. Obama got paid something like 20 million for giving a 10 minute ""talk"" to bankers and corporate execs. American froze the stock market because the ""little guys"" on reddit were making a stand, under FREE market capitalism you dont freeze an entire market and not allow people to freely trade with their money when they're not breaking any rules. Pelosi is either the most successful trader ever or she's receiving information from corporate execs and that's why she's a near perfect trader, a member of government most people know is insider trading yet the government doesnt do anything, why? Corporations own America 

""Capitalism is still the problem"" under free market capitalism you dont have hyper aggressive lobbying, you dont have unregulated sale of goods alot of americans are eating literal poison, you dont big phrama over charging you 4000x on basic pharmaceuticals, you dont have banks handing out loans they know people wont be able to pay and you can disagree but you would be wrong. The reason all of this is allowed, the reason Pelosi can insider trade with no problems is because the corporations allow it 

If you want to find a source to a problem you don't blame man made systems you blame man, you blame human behaviour. You can run a simulation and have a capitalist country and a communist country, all with the same variables and you can program the behaviour of those people to function so the economic system is successful. For the capitalist country to work perfectly you would need to remove greed from the people in that country, greed is a human trait. KEITH LEE is a good example. he gave people $4,000 which they could've reinvested into food and staff, with the attention from KEITH made their money back x10 and then used that money for marketing and potentially a shop in the future to then further their brand. They chose greed and spent the $4,000 and now they're not gonna get much business. Is it the fault of capitalism Keith was nice enough to bless these people and give them a platform to grow and establish a name like so many others with businesses were by this man or is it greed's fault 

""Capitalism is still to blame for the lay offs"" 2017 I used to use the business side of facebook, it made me wonder why facebook hires so many people when they dont change or update much, they dont have any agents to talk to, the reviews get left unseen by staff and even though I know there's a ton of people doing actual work even then it was clear they overhired and probably overpaid a bunch of people. It was only until Elon bought twitter and straight away saw what I saw, he doesnt need that much staff, middle management, people posting their day on tiktok talking about how they do little work and sometimes dont even show up to meetings, people that literally havent got any work. There's many that have earned half a million working for netflix and they left because ""there was nothing to do"" and you can find this for yourself. Why are you blaming capitalism when your economy is corporatist, why are you blaming capitalism because that moron mark overhired and wasnt overseeing his coming he was working on oculus or too busy trying to make the beach in hawaii his private beach when he's not even a local. Blame the corporations, blame greed, blame human behaviour, blame mark for overhiring, blame the people that havent been looking at the actual data for the company instead of the economy system which is non existent  in your country. Saw a tiktok of a guy telling people to clean their showerhead, all the comments were for some reason blaming capitalism? I'm convinced people don't understand the words they use on social media, the clip of a woman being asked to define misogyny and instead of doing it she just runs off is how I see people that blame everything on capitalism. I would say the schools should teach elementary economics but schools arent to educate you about things like this but that's another thread in itself"

It's normal for women in the west say ""I'm a proud femcel misdranist"", I dont care who you are man or woman to be proud of hating an entire gender, race or group of people because you've been on social media too long and you think all men dont like women is wrong.

The fact people that actually think like this vote the most is why America votes the dumbest people into office.

145,2024-02-03,CMV: Hospitals should be required by law to charge the same amount to every insurance company,u/say_what_is_truth,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aibeey/cmv_hospitals_should_be_required_by_law_to_charge/,changemyview,"This CMV is about the US healthcare system.

Right now hospitals negotiate with every single insurance company for how much they will charge for different treatments. This is inefficient for the following reasons:

1. Every hospital needs an army of bureaucrats to do the negotiations.  
2. Every insurer needs an army of bureaucrats to do the negotiations.  
3. Doctors are unable to compare prices. Remembering prices for dozens of treatments is hard enough for doctors. When multiplied by the number of insurance companies, this is an impossible task. This leads to doctors choosing more expensive treatments than necessary, increasing the cost of healthcare.

Now, I think I understand why the current system emerged: For each insurance company it is in their interest to negotiate a lower price because this saves them (and consequently their insurees via lower premiums) money. But when every insurance company starts doing so it just raises the costs for everyone.

Governments are *the* tool to solve these collective action problems. Thus, I propose a nationwide law to force insurance companies to stop negotiating for lower prices. The simplest law that I think would work would be to require each hospitals to charge the same amount for each treatment to every insurance company.

Note that the law I am thinking about *does not* say that hospitals have to charge the same amount to insured people as uninsured people. I think hospitals should be allowed to price discriminate based on lack of insurance: If uninsured people are less likely to pay their bills (e.g. because they go bankrupt), the hospital needs to charge them more to recoup their losses. But insured people have the backing of a large, highly regulated insurance company behind them. Their insurance company will not go bankrupt.

One place this gets thorny is when insurance companies refuse to pay hospital bills, either because they deem the treatment ""experimental"" or ""not necessary"" or because the patient has a copay. This would lead to some insurance companies paying less than they ought to and thus having lower premiums--at the cost of the hospital and patient. I think this could be avoided by creating a second law holding insurance companies financially responsible for *all* treatments that occur (holding hospitals/doctors/patients criminally responsible for fraud/malpractice if they actually do perform unnecessary treatments, and letting the insurance company sue their insuree if they don't pay their copayment), but that is the topic of another CMV.

The main way you can change my view is if there is some negative consequence of requiring this that I do not currently foresee."
1,2024-02-03,CMV: Everything Is Comprehensible,u/Phasmus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aibti8/cmv_everything_is_comprehensible/,changemyview,"I see this brick wall of incomprehensibility come up in fiction and philosophy. It seems lazy. I have trouble accepting that there are elements of reality that humans are definitively incapable of grasping. 

In science we see walls defined by our ability to observe and experiment, but those walls move... sometimes. And we can imagine what might lie beyond them. 

Quantum physics might be counterintuitive and requires some effort to get the full mathematical background but a high level understanding can be imparted by a 20 minute YouTube video.

There's too much specialization for everyone to understand everything from top to bottom, sure. So maybe no one human can understand all the details about some things. But I'm looking is for any solid argument or evidence that there are concepts that can't be summarized to be understood by a reasonably intelligent human. Such that it would actually be fair for some hypothetical higher being to say ""THESE THINGS ARE BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSION"" instead of sitting down and talking about it for a couple hours. Maybe drawing some pictures. Or at worst sending the human in question for a few terms of college before resuming the conversation.

I don't consider the lack of evidence for such ideas to be evidence. Maybe we're just incapable of noticing or thinking about certain aspects of reality but that's a pretty extraordinary claim and my default assumption is that it is false.

I don't consider our inability to learn the truth about something (e.g. what is dark energy, really?) equivalent to incomprehensibility."
353,2024-02-03,CMV: Children are increasingly exposed to content they should not be and our society should work to preventing them from accessing harmful material.,u/LowPressureUsername,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aicm5a/cmv_children_are_increasingly_exposed_to_content/,changemyview,"You can see this in almost any space geared toward children. The “gacha heat” and “Minecraft monster school” trends are incredibly pervasive, pseudo-pornographic material that are geared toward children that deal with themes of rape, beastality, mind control, bondage, sex slavery etc. (You can find YouTube video documentation that goes further in-depth into this issue on YouTube.)

With the increasing access children have to internet enabled devices, it’s becoming apparent that more moderation is required to prevent young children from accessing potentially sensitive material.

You’re also seeing the recent attention of children being exposed to drag shows. Most commonly the defense of this is “well what about straight events?” This defense does not defend the practice of exposing children to drag, and is a whataboutism targeting something else that children shouldn’t be exposed to either. There have been instances where drag shows have introduced children to sexually provocative dances, bondage, etc. The heterosexual ual equivalent might be a stripclub. (I’m not just talking about small events about sexuality.) This issue could literally be solved by having members of the LGBT community remove or block children from being exposed to sexually provocative drag shows, along with heterosexual individuals blocking children’s access to other sexually explicit straight content. These are not hard asks.

The effect of pornography on the teenage brain is well understood to be detrimental. Children’s brains are also understood to be more susceptible than teenagers, if we as a society already acknowledge the risks and harms of young men and women sexualizing themselves and others why do we not even more vigorously acknowledge the adverse effects of young boys and girls sexualizing themselves?

These are not the only possible problems or solutions. Law enforcement could also moderate larger sexual events, both drag shows and “straight sex fests” or charge strippers/drag performers with indecent exposure."
1,2024-02-03,"CMV: In less than 20 years, most people will stop buying cars.",u/LostCrypt333,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aicqh8/cmv_in_less_than_20_years_most_people_will_stop/,changemyview,"I spoke about this with my parents the other day, and they disagreed that, within their lifetime, they would be in self-driving cars. They are only in their mid 50s. I am extremely confident that not only will self-driving become common, but so common that most people will actually *stop* buying cars (at least in developed countries).

Teslas (as one example) are already at the stage where they are safer than the average human driver when using full self-driving software. It's not even close. Eventually, we'll get to the point where we're having serious debates about the safety of non-autonomous cars. We used to say seatbelt laws were a restriction on our freedom, but we got used to that and now almost everyone is wearing seatbelts. 

Once legislators and the population realise that self-driving vehicles are clearly safer, we will see demand for them grow, especially in the wealthier countries. We'll get so comfortable with them driving around that we'll allow them to drive *without* anyone even in the car. Sure, there will be places that are hesitant to do this at first, but when countries see other countries allowing it, they will see what they're missing out on. 

At this point, instead of owning cars, people will be using transportation as a service (TaaS). This is the reason people will stop buying cars. People will own fleets of autonomous vehicles, which will drive to pick up people at the click of a button on an app (like Uber). There are several advantages to this:  
1. You won't need upfront capital to purchase a car  
2. You won't need garage space or street space to park your car  
3. You won't need to wash, service, or fix the car.   
4. You won't have a car that depreciates even though it's not being used  
5. You won't need to pay registration and insurance (this will be factored into the ride cost)  
6. It will also provide far greater accessibility for old and disabled people   
I believe the costs will come out to be cheaper than owning a car, because the people who own the fleets will benefit from the economies of scale."
1,2024-02-03,CMV: Atheism is a boring world view,u/RaindropDripDropTop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aieskw/cmv_atheism_is_a_boring_world_view/,changemyview,"First, I will clarify that I am not religious, I consider myself as an agnostic. I used to be firmly in the atheist camp, but lately I've been more on the fence about it. 

**""but atheism is not a world view, it's just the lack of belief in something""**

I'm going to preemptively address this argument because I'm sure some people thought this when they read the title. Feel free to skip to the next section if you don't care about the word choice. 

 I've heard people say stuff along the lines of ""not believing in the tooth fairy isn't a world view, so neither is atheism."" The way I see it, because religion is so prominent in human civilization and is something that the majority of people in human history strongly believe in, being skeptical of all religion and not believing in any deity or God is itself essentially a world view. I've also heard stuff along the lines of ""you're an atheist when it comes to every other religion except for one, I just went one step further."" The way I see it, most religions are essentially different versions of a very similar basic belief. I know some people are very devout about their specific religion, but I view things more on a broader level of general theism (or deism) vs atheism. Basically people who believe in some sort of deity vs people who don't. 

So anyway, if you disagree with me about whether atheism is a world view or not, that's fine. I am not really interested in arguing about what counts as a world view and what doesn't. If my choice of words really bothers you, then you can just imagine that instead of ""world view"" I used some other phrase that you deem more appropriate. The semantics don't really matter to me, ""world view"" is just a simple and easy way of describing it. 


**Why the atheist world view is boring**

How I would describe the atheist world view is that they approach the concept of god(s) or deities as if it was a scientific hypothesis. Their core mindset about this topic is based on evidence. They refuse to believe in any sort of deity until it can be verified through the scientific method. This is my first issue with atheism, and why I find it boring. The scientific method is wonderful and has helped humanity advance in countless ways, but you don't need to apply it to everything. Science is not the only form of knowledge or wisdom that exists. 

People have always been deeply moved by stories and parables, whether it was communicated through literature or word of mouth. Much of history is based on simply interpreting stuff that people wrote. People have also used intuition and life experience to form their beliefs. When it comes to religion, people have faith based on these forms of knowledge. Religious stories and myths have captivated humans for thousands of years. People have life experience that makes them feel like they have some sort of relationship with their deity. People have read about other people's life experiences regarding religion, and belong to communities where people share this information. Many people just find the idea of deities to be the most intuitive explanation for how life in the universe came to be. My point is that religious faith comes from outside of the realm of the scientific method. The atheist world view that is strict to the need for concrete evidence is narrow and boring. 

The next reason why I find the atheist worldview to be boring is that it's just so empty. If there really is no god or deity, then there is no free will. All of our thoughts and decisions would just be the product of brain chemistry that we have no real control over. Our brain is simply just a product of our genetics and environment, and free will is just a delusion. If there is no god or deity then we have no soul, we're just meaningless animals. Also, let's be real, the existence of some sort of supernatural element to the universe is more fun than the idea that it's all just material. 

The last thing I will mention is benefits. I feel like it's way more beneficial to be religious than it is to be an atheist. Religion is very helpful to people when it comes to dealing with grief or getting through hard times in their life. It also gives you a large community to be a part of - granted there are plenty of other communities you can be a part of, but religion has always been a core foundation for this, and nothing quite replaces it.


**Conclusion**

Nobody really knows whether a deity exists or not. It comes down to whether you have faith or not. Let's just say hypothetically for argument's sake that atheists are right and there is no deity that exists. Even if that's the case, we will never know anyway, and it's more beneficial and interesting to believe in religion, even if it's not true (which again, for all we know, it could be true)."

The use of such language tends to reduce the woman to a mere receptacle, casting her as a passive entity for the male's pleasure – a metaphorical scabbard for the male sword, considering the etymology of the word ""vagina"", which means sheath.  
  
I think that the use of terms like ""penetration"" may make women feel vulnerable during their most intimate moments. However, there's another perspective, often overlooked but worth acknowledging, that emphasizes the woman as an active participant in the act. Rather than framing it as the man ""fucking"" and the woman is ""getting fucked"", one can view it as the woman ""wrapping"" and the man is ""getting wrapped"". Words like ""penetration"" carry a violent connotation, implying entry without permission or invasion."

Incels from my perspective are lost, desperate, jaded and resentful. For the most part they certainly have tried to put in effort to reach their goal at some point and just not gotten any positive feedback or worse negative feedback and felt they did everything right or at least everything they were told but got nowhere or ended up worse off than when they started and then they become resentful and spiral. Now how much effort they actually put in and if that was the right place to put effort in will vary from individual to individual but it's not like there's a roadmap for this stuff either and if you can't see any results from your efforts it's very easy to lose heart and shift the blame to others, genetics or the system regardless of what the thing you put effort into.

Like imagine working harder and getting better results than anyone else at work and being constantly passed over for promotion due to nepotism. I think that's how they feel and I think for at least some of them it's true. But I have no ideal where the whole entitlement thing came from... Thinking your efforts should pay off in a fair system isn't entitlement, it's kind of the opposite of entitlement, entitlements are things you get for free not stuff you have to work for. I have a very hard to believing that if there was a doable thing that they could do to get get a girl and they knew and believed it 100% they wouldn't do it, the problems are numerous but one of the main ones is they have no idea what they need to do. Working out helps and has imperial metrics that you can observe but outside of that there's nothing, over half the advice makes things worse or is too subjective like ""be confident"".

If they truly felt entitled why would they bother will all this ""advice"" and ideology incel bullshit and not just grab the first girl they like and rape her? Actually entitled people do it all the time, rich people, politicians, actors, rockstars and athletes those people seem way more entitled than incels to me."

I see people on Twitter and Instagram supporting what Israel is doing and saying that Israel is acting on self-defense. This is wrong. Israel is under an Apartheid regime as per Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, UN, Israeli conscientious objectors and academics such as Ilan Pape, Raz Segal, etc., 

The regime detains men, women and children who are abused, and held without trial. Some are raped, many have detailed torture and even Israeli Supreme Court has admonished the use of detainees as human shields. 

It is terrible that the land of the poor Palestinian people was stolen, and that they were subjected to ethnic cleansing due to the creation of a settler, colonzing state. 

It is horrible that the people of Israel have been subjected to brainwash by the right-wing, to see Palestinians as undeserving of their homeland, to be proud of oppressing generations of Palestinians under an apartheid regime, of becoming cogs in the genocidal machinery that murders innocent civilians, rapes women, leaves infants to die and decompose in incubators, as seen in the current Gaza genocide. The worst part is that their own government conspired against them to retain power, such as Netanyahu allowing the funding of Hamas, as a counter to Palestinian Authority, in order to thwart the peaceful resolution of the conflict, leading to the Oct. 7 [massacre](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/).

The 1st reason for me believing so it that hard-work can get everybody a good job, whereas learning can only get geniuses a good job. I know many people who are not smart. They cannot understand certain concepts. However, what they can do is memorise the keywords, which is more than enough for them to get a good career and good marks in college. Whereas, only smart people can actually understand concepts. However, they are in the same situation as their not-so-smart peers, since they also have the same degree and job opportunities, provided they get similar marks in examinations. Remember; Silencer was also successful as well. He had a manaion, a rich girlfriend, a lot of wealth, and was going to sign a contract with a famous scientist, Phunsukh Wangdu, who had rejected all his clients who were international clients. This was how successful he was, since he had good grades. The other 2 who had tagged along with Rancho were not successful at all, since they were not smart enough to understand concepts.

The 2nd reason for me believing so is that India has the highest population! Almost all of them want to get a joob job with a good salary, right? There is no way to escape the rat race in order to get a good future! There is no proper way to check the understanding of lakhs of clients other than examinations! Therefore, they will be writing examinations for the rest of their lives! If writing examinations in the real-world is in any way, similar to writing examinations within academic institutions, then Virus's advice holds true! Understanding concepts is not going to get you anywhere if you do not know how to work hard and compete with others! Life will neither be fair in college, nor in real life!

The 3rd reason for me believing so is that many famous actors are famous due to competition and  hard-work. Eg.Shahrukh Khan did not have any links with famous people, and was instead orphaned. However, he worked day-and-night to compete with actors who had the benefit of nepotism. In the end, Shahrukh Khan has been the most famous actor worldwide, known in Eastern-Europe, Africa, and Asia, for 34 years. Mithun Chalraborthu has no links with famous people either, and he was well-known in Asia and the communist block too."

Alpha males are all insecure


You can hear the bitter undertones in these “alpha males”  when they disagree with a random 19-24 year old chick who is completely inexperienced they literally lose their minds, they start being petty and disrespectful and they start yelling. This behavior is a sign. A sign of a dude who has achieved so much… yet still holds resentment. An adult male would not act in such a way. 

I grew up around old country farmers & military old heads who went to wars, these guys are some of the absolute toughest dudes that exist  and you will see the difference in their demeanor.

They don’t yell, cry, argue, & they don’t complain about how hard it is when it comes to women.

Don’t fall down that path, it’s not a happy one.

The marriage wasn't perfect but in all honesty, I've never seen one that was. I still thought ours was the most functional with our main issue being a dead bedroom... and only I seemed to care about that but never complained or whined about it. So we go on and buy a beautiful piece of land, have a kid and build a house. We both had good jobs and things seemed fine till I catch her cheating. She blames me somehow and divorces me eventually... she claimed she needed time to think about things so I stupidly gave it to her. I did everything for this women and always with good intentions. The way she turned on me was sickening and all over some stupid fling for sex she'd never give me. 

So now here I am... broke and broken. Only get to see my daughter on Wednesday and every other weekend. Sold my house along with the land I worked so hard on for years to pay her off. Everything I worked so hard for is gone. And then to add insult to injury... I still owe the bitch $1000 per month for child support. She got rewarded for divorcing me and ruining what I had. She doesn't deserve anything more from me. And if she can't take care of my daughter on her own (she can just fine) then I should have custody. Whenever we get into an argument, she threatens to take more money from me for cs because I've had some decent raises over the past few years. 

Child support and alimony should only be awarded on a case my case basis. And in my case, I did nothing wrong. I was lied, cheated and now stolen from. It feels like she got away with a crime but it was totally legal. No wonder so many families are split up. The system rewards divorce!"

Curator Comments:  
the choice of positioning of the words in the non verse in fact it seems casual but dictated by a desire to emphasize the words key to the text so as to arouse and draw the attention of the passer-by: see the example,the separate provision, at opposite edges of the hexameter, of Aeolidis,proper noun expressed in the genitive case, and catellae, noun to define the-little dog‖; the word tumulum, ""burial, sepulcher"", is instead framed from the name indication and from the adjective festive and attributed to the animal.The adjective festivus is not found in other carmina5 and it is evident that it is here used to emphasize the playful liveliness of the animal. The second hexameterit ends with the noun fate, a term left deliberately isolated and centered in the last line to give prominence and depth to the concept of the transience of lifes object to the inevitability of the fatum6. The latter is also characterized from the adjective, in the ablative case, praepes-etis,which gives the lexical binomialan almost epic solemnity and gravity.The expression praepete fato does not occur elsewhere in the carmina: it is preferred, albeit rarely, and in high diegetic contexts, the equivalent formula properantia fata7.While the first verse focuses on the invitation to the viator (viathe imperative cerne) to look at the sepulcher of the jubilant dog14(topos also intensely exploited in funerary epigraphy) that it seems almost revived in the bas-relief, the second verse is instead characterized by boundless pain of the master for this death8. The choice of the verb dolēre(constructed with the accusation of the thing for which one feels suffering, in this case the relative pronoun quam), of the adverb in modice, and of the participle raptam contribute, albeit with extreme synthesis, to strengthen and enhance the deep sense of despair and helplessness that assails the master of Aeolis9. Aan interesting aspect is also constituted by the choice of the monumentum: it is in fact of a funerary altar on whose side faces urceus and patera are sculpted.This support, frequently used to house sepulchral inscriptions intended for humans, is used here for a little dog denoting inin the first place the economic possibility and the cultural stature of the client,moreover anonymous, and, secondly,what could be defined as the""Humanization process"" that involves the animal both in life and in death. The symbolic and ritual value linked to this choice therefore emerges with clarity and is further corroborated by the relief on the forehead of the aretta depicting the animal approaching a table set with food offerings. The bas-relief seems to recall the funeral banquet, practical central to the Roman funerary tradition. In fact, death and banquet are two strongly interconnected aspects and full of concrete and symbolic values: to such Aeolis, a little dog, takes part in the meal and therefore does not seem excluded from the ritual dimension reserved for men"

Here are some nonsense opinions that people make on reddit Too much text, do not read if you do not want:

1- 18 yo are not kids: if 18 yo date a 12, should it be punished? If you think no, then 18 is a child that needs to be educated. If your answer is yes, then a 18 is not a child and you are being hypocrate

For biology, you are a child til your 13, 14 to 16/17 you are a teenager (adolescent) after that you are adult. Simple as that. Being close to being a minor does not make you.a child in any meaninful way.

2- it's not ""grooming"" and predatory: just because I engage in sexual activities with a 18yo does not mean I manipulated her. What if she came to me? How come I use my grooming powers to make her do that? Telepathy?

3- ""If she comes to you then say no"": still doesn't prove any grooming point, just proves whoever says that for the sake of their opinions because they think it's weird.

4- ""There is a power imbalance"": Power imbalance happens when a person is in love and the other is not. There are several women getting nanipulated by guys same age.

5-""She is barely an adult"": There is no such thing as barely adult. Either you are or not. And if she just got out of high school, then it means she is not in HS anymore, simple as that.

6- ""You cannot get women your age, there is a reason this and that"": No, I am just attracted by younger just as some are more attracted to older or same age partners. Simple as that.

----AND: If I say you are just complaining because you cannot get younger girls, would it make sense? Just because I go after younger women does not mean I cannot get anyone older, just means I am attracted to younger bodies and that does not mean nothing.

7- ""It's unhealthy"": Like will both of us die or something? It can be super healty

8 - ""But your brain is almsot developed at 25"": Wrong, your pre frontal cortex develop between 25 and 30. Which means I may still have 6 years ahead, along with her. Yeah it may be a surprise but people DO mature differently, and women DO mature earlier. This is basic neurology and biology we learn before HS. Also, this 25 yo brain thing is old and several studies display development between 18 and 21.

9 - Finally It's not immoral.  Immoral is trying control other adults because you don't like age gaps and make up several reasons to condemn that like ""barely legal"" ""grooming"" and things of sort without any scientific background, while my topics pretty nuch are consent through all of scientific studies, whethwr men or women.

Consumption inequality is the only metric that matters.,u/aeroporn34,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aiuhik/cmv_wealthincome_inequality_doesnt_matter/,changemyview,"I've been thinking about economics lately and have come to the above conclusion. I think people tend to think about economics from an individual level because that's what they experience day to day, but they fail to understand how the economy works on a broader scale. Imagine you have a perfectly equal and happy society of 100 people who all have the same wealth/income. You then randomly give 10 of those people $1 billion. They put it in a bank account but don't spend it. Your equal society has suddenly become very unequal, but has anything in the economy changed? Of course not. The change only happens if those 10 people go to use their $1 billion, they'd price the other 90 people out of resources and drive up prices and inflation.

A common argument I hear all the time is ""the rich harm the economy by hoarding money. If only they spent it, it would go back into the economy and benefit everyone"", but if that was the case why wait for the rich to do it? Why doesn't the government just print more money and spend it themselves? What's the difference between Elon Musk spending $100 million on a yacht and the government printing and spending $100 million on a new school? They would create the same number of jobs and economic stimulus, but in one scenario a billionaire gets a yacht and in the other a community gets a school.

Why does this distinction matter? Because if it's true, then there's no point in fixating on or trying to tax net worth. We should be focused on the extravagant and frivolous consumption of the rich--that's when they damage the economy by driving up prices and swapping out their hoard of fake money for real resources. Elon Musk doesn't need a wealth tax. He's free to hoard as much monopoly money as he wants. But we should've taxed the shit out of him when he bought Twitter. We should be taxing the shit out of every yacht, private jet, and 4th vacation home purchase. If the economy is slowing down because the rich are siphoning money out of the economy and not spending it, we should just remind ourselves that money is fake and print more to replace what's removed."

NOTES for clarification:

1. I am not necessarily talking about individual variability. More about generations/collectives. 

2. “Modern day feminism” = the phrase i see most used by the “red-pilled” to describe “women who hate us and see us as useless”. imo it’s just women who are no longer tolerant to machismo behaviors but that’s really up to the individual. 

3. For those asking about “a response to what”. I think it’s pretty obvious that men have historically treated women like garbage (physically/enotionally/sexually/economically/sociopolitically/etc etc). Thus provoking this response. it makes sense to me that the pendulum would swing eventually. And it makes sense to me that the source of the issue is to be charged w the burden of fixing it.

0,2024-02-04,CMV: Human pregnancy lasts for 8.5 to 8.8 months (on average),u/QtoAotQ,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aix1sc/cmv_human_pregnancy_lasts_for_85_to_88_months_on/,changemyview,"Authoritative sources say pregnancy lasts on average 280 days or 40 weeks ([here](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-0705.1999.14010023.x) and [here](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/ask-acog/how-long-does-pregnancy-last)). There's no reason to doubt this, so lets just assume it's true. 

The 40 weeks number seems to have led to a new folk wisdom in which people go around saying things like, ""Have you heard? Pregnancy *actually* lasts for 10 months!"" (A quick search for ""pregnancy lasts for 10 months"" will pull up many sources claiming this.) I believe this is *total balderdash!* CMV.

There are two problems with the 10 months thing: 

1. 40 weeks does not equal 10 months, it is *less than 9.25 months*. 
2. The 40 week number counts from the first day of your last menstrual period *before conception*, which is probably about 2 to 3 weeks before conception. 

When you do the math, human pregnancy actually lasts for 8.5 to 8.8 months. I will unpack 1 and 2 to show how it leads to these numbers.

About 1: I guess what people are thinking is that there are 4 weeks in a month, so 40 divided by 4 = 10 months. Except 4 weeks = 28 days and there are obviously more than 28 days in a month, there are roughly 30.5. Here is a straightforward way to calculate how many months 40 weeks is: There are 52 weeks in a year. 40 divided by 52 is 0.77, which means that 40 weeks is 77% of a year. 0.77 times 12 is 9.24, which means that 9.24 months is 77% of the year. In other words, 40 weeks is equivalent to 9.24 months. Obviously, **9.24 is closer to 9 months than 10 months!** (Another way to do this math more directly and with less rounding is via a proportion: (40\*12)/52 = 9.23 months. If you do the same calculations with 280 days, you get (280\*12)/365 = 9.2 months because technically a year is slightly longer than 52 weeks. But the first link I gave above says that the average number of days in a pregnancy is really 282, which results in 9.27 months. Still closer to 9 than 10.) 

About 2: The 280 days/40 weeks number is supposed to start from the first day of your last period before conception. They count this way because it's the most effective way to predict the due date. Which is great, *if your question is ""When am I due?""* But obviously, if the question is, *""How long does the average pregnancy last?""*, no one would think we should include the 14 to 21 days *before conception* (or implantation in the uterine wall, if you prefer). So if we subtract 14 to 21 days from 40 weeks, we get 37 to 38 weeks. If you start with 37 to 38 weeks and do the same calculations I did in the last paragraph, the result is **8.5 to 8.8 months!** 

Now, maybe I've made some mistake in my reasoning, or maybe I've misunderstood something about the 280 days/40 weeks figure. After all, I am not a doctor or a medical researcher. If so, please change my view.

But a final note: I am *not* arguing that we shouldn't say ""40 weeks"". Based on what I've read, it is **extremely useful** for medical professionals to measure pregnancies and their progress using the 40 week figure. I'm just saying that the fuzzy back-of-the-envelope math that leads people to say, ""*Actually*, you won't be pregnant for 9 months, but 10,"" is wrong, afaict. On average, it takes *less* than 9 months, not more."
1,2024-02-04,CMV: Baseball would be better if the leading team never batted.,u/giveusyourlighter,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aixp2m/cmv_baseball_would_be_better_if_the_leading_team/,changemyview,"Baseball would be better if the innings were structured in a more ""king of the hill"" type format. 

Play begins like normal, with the teams tied, alternating hitting and pitching. Until one team takes a lead. Next inning when the trailing team comes to bat, if they're unable to surmount the lead in that inning, then they would go on to be the hitting team in the following inning as well. And this would continue until they surmount the lead, or until they've exhausted all 9 of their innings and they lose.

Why is this better?

Because it is more involving and suspenseful to watch a trailing team hit than a leading team. 

- If you are cheering for the trailing team then you want to watch them bat and regain their lead. You don't want to watch them pitch and maybe keep it close or let the game fall further out of reach.
- If you are cheering for the leading team you want your team to defend its lead and induce an ending to the game. It's scary when your team is pitching, but also very exciting every out that is made. You don't mind watching your team hit, but added runs don't feel nearly as good as those runs that flip the game in your team's favor.

KotH approach would make the average inning much more interesting to be involved in as a player, manager, or spectator.

Also there wouldn't be as much opportunity to run up the score, so ridiculous blow out games where nobody cares by the end would be much less frequent.

This could be taxing on pitchers, pitching multiple half-innings back to back, but it's a self-balancing problem. They get tired, pitch worse, give up the lead, then their team gets to bat and the pitcher gets a rest. Long breaks would also be outside the norm for how baseball is currently played, but I believe approaches to pitching could easily adapt.

Perhaps the main downside is that some would consider themselves cheated if they don't get to play or spectate 17-18 innings for a game. I wouldn't though."
1,2024-02-04,CMV: We should acknowledge that Israel was created via the UN’s willingness to excuse Zionist evils.,u/BiryaniEater10,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aixxkq/cmv_we_should_acknowledge_that_israel_was_created/,changemyview,"To be clear, I am more pro Israel than most on even Zionists on Reddit but you can be pro not dissolving nations, and understand that the creation of said nations was a top 5 evil event in history, just like we do for the USA or China. I  am more pro Israel because I respect her right to exist while knowing about the evil of her inception, while so called “Zionists” deny that this evil happened or claim that Israel was actually created because *Palestinians* refused a peaceful one state solution, which is insanity.

Anyone with any grasp of historical knowledge knows that the British are at fault for the conflict today. The British simply had to do one thing to avoid todays conflict. Simply say “no” to any new immigrants who wanted to come. This would’ve been an awesome and humanitarian move because all the existing Jewish and Arab communities in the region would’ve been able to coexist peacefully like they did under Ottoman rule (though to be clear ottoman rule wasn’t ethical either, only full determination of Palestinian communities as they were the majority of all the communities there and had no problem coexisting with Jews). 

Instead, they chose to legalize European invaders coming in who had expressed intent of ethnically cleansing Arabs (immigrating to establish a state where others are living is by definition ethnic cleansing). **Even if they didn’t express such intent, their very immigration for the purpose of creating a state that included communities where they had no majority (so essentially ruling over and/or displacing Arabs)  was inherently an extreme evil.** They made deals with said invaders that the colonial power would displace and kill natives so that they could establish an ethnostate, and pretend that they were trying to rectify the Holocaust. So yes, this conflict is the UK’s fault. They failed to use their colonial rule to stop invaders from immigrating to areas where their subjects lived. 

The problem with people on this sub is that they think you’re calling for the UK to kick out all the people they let invade. This is silliness as there’s no way the UK would dissolve its baby state. *What the UK should do is apologize to the Palestinians for letting anyone into their communities, much in the same way Germany did post Holocaust or the USA did for Japanese internment camps.*

And people will say, how does it bring us closer to peace if we rightfully acknowledge the UK’s role in the inception of Israel and the evils of Zionist migration. I say, it does not matter at all because the point of accurate history isn’t peace, but to keep an accurate record of the past to learn from. 

*Keeping an accurate record of history is important irregardless of if it brings peace or not. Not to mention we owe nothing to Israelis or Palestinians outside of keeping a solid record of the past and not demonizing the Palestinians of pre48 times, who were undisputed good guys.*

**Just like it would be evil to say or ignore the fact that Turks did commit genocide against Armenians, even though such denial wouldn’t
have any affect on peace in the region. Any historical revisionism is a huge evil.**"
0,2024-02-04,CMV: Elon Musks 55.8 Billion dollar compensation package was very reasonable and fair.,u/Mr_Axelg,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aiy2lz/cmv_elon_musks_558_billion_dollar_compensation/,changemyview,"This isn't about the court case where the judge doesn't seem to be happy about the boards communication to the shareholders about elons personal friendship with the board members who came up with this plan in the first place and there definitely is some merit to that but thats a different disucssion. 

I am specifically stating that the compensation [package](https://electrek.co/2020/05/28/tesla-elon-musk-first-tranche-compensation-plan-worth-million/) he received was reasonable and fair. To give some context in 2019 Tesla was worth around $50 billion in market cap. The compensation package was structured in a way that even if Tesla grew moderately by doubling in value, then Elon wouldn't actually get anything. No salary, no bonus, no stock options. He had to AT LEAST double Teslas value (the first tranche started at $100B market cap) and hit some specific revenue targets to qualify for literally any compensation. After that there were 12 market cap / revenue levels that if achieved gave Elon additional shares in the company. The better Tesla did, the more he got. 

This provides everyone with really good incentives where Elon has to try as hard as he can to make tesla succeed. Even if he does a decent job, he gets nothing, he has to perform a miracle and 10X the companies value to receive the full package which is what basically happened. 

This is in contrast with other large company CEO packages where the CEO could perform very badly and still earn hundreds of millions (such as Sundar Pichai for example). As far as I am concerned, more companies need to start giving out these crazy comp packages. Many mediocre CEOs just earn their yearly salary for just being there without caring for the long term. Elon was forced to think for the long term. 

If Elon did a bad job, well he wouldn't get anything and the shareholders wouldn't have to give him anything. If he hit all tranches, the shareholders would be up over 1000% on their shares (the last tranche was $650B market cap). This is what happened and I highly doubt there are any unhappy Tesla shareholders who held the stock for more than 3 years. The shareholders would be happy no matter what.

I would personally give Elon another package right now to get tesla to \~$5T market cap by lets say 2030. He can have another few hundred billion in options as a reward. As long as I hold my shares, I should be up another 10X. Win Win Win for everyone, including uncle sam who will tax all of that at the end. "
17,2024-02-04,"CMV: The failure of listeners to understand that music is the most subjective of all the arts leads to unnecessary, poor quality discourse",u/PourJarsInReservoirs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aiyfsv/cmv_the_failure_of_listeners_to_understand_that/,changemyview,"No other art form can either give pleasure or displeasure as rapidly and effectively as music.

Its immediacy, effect on the human (and even non human at times) nervous system, and leapfrogging over the rational analytical mind to the emotions make this  very true to me.

But my experience is people try to rationalize their advocacy of certain music through intellectual or cultural argument. 

In conversation this may show up as ""their [insert biographical or identity details] is so impressive"" ""they innovated [details]"" ""this is regarded as [appeal to authority from historians or professional criticism]"" ""they changed my/others life,"" ""they are so successful/undeservedly obscure"" ""they look amazing,"" and I'm sure many others. 

These are all (with one scenario being a notable exception) worthless.

Either it pleases the listener or it does not.

Music is literally energy moving through the air, AKA vibrations. And since people neurologically vibrate in different ways, and have unique histories and behaviors, either there is subjectively favorable resonance for them and they like certain music, or there is not and they dislike or are indifferent to the music.

If I take one of my musical likes characterized as ""difficult"" and put it on in a room with 100 people and 99 of them run out within one minute, apalled, should I be able to coax them back in the room and try to get them to like it if I explain its historical importance, or that the composer rescued kittens, or that they had some very positive biography, or look appealing? Should I look down on them if the answer is the expected no? I think the answer to this is OF COURSE NOT.

Yet the extreme subjectivity of music is something understood so infrequently and poorly, that people can get right up to or plain offended if you don't agree with them, after they try the type of defenses detailed earlier. 

The one exception to this is when a detail surrounding the music, or in it, may keep a listener interested enough to change their perception, sometimes over time - even a very long period of time. But in my experience this happens relatively rarely, and usually won't happen as a result of annoyance from someone's counterargument. 

So am I looking at this too dogmatically, or not understanding something? CMV."

1,2024-02-04,CMV: Men would be a lot less insecure about their penis sizes if women were more honest about preferences.,u/GorrilaRuffy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aiztuq/cmv_men_would_be_a_lot_less_insecure_about_their/,changemyview,"So I think penis size is an issue that is really stupid and is caused by a lot of things. I'm not trying to blame women for this issue, but I think they're the ones that can solve this. When I say this, I'm talking about relationships between cis men and cis women. I don't feel educated enough to discuss penis size when it comes to lgbt sexual relationships.  
  
So men are insecure about penis size for one big reason. We are scared of not being able to pleasure our partner in comparison to other men she has been with. This is an insecurity most men have because sexual prowess is a sign of masculinity. This comes in many fashions that are easy to address and some that are harder to address. Some men are worried that they won't find a partner because they are smaller than average. This is easy to solve. Tons of women don't even bang someone before they get commitment. Most women already like a guy she's dating by the time she sees his dick so that in most cases she won't leave him for it. It's not that serious of a thing to be worried about.  
  
The harder issue to solve is the feeling of inadequacy when it comes to penis size. Whether we like it or not, size matters when it comes to sexual pleasure. If you think otherwise, do you think a micro penis or a penis thats 13 inches is going to be pleasurable for a woman? Of course not. Size matters. Because of this knowledge there will always be comparison. Active or passive. Most women have a preferable size range and on average it's decently above average for it to be the ideal size. So most men have to learn to deal with the fact that they are too small for the ideal size. Some men will be too big, but I think most women would prefer a penis that's bigger than they prefer than smaller. And the majority of men don't fall into this category.  
  
So inadequacy prevails. Men aren't made of stone and men are allowed to have feelings. However this is not a great feeling to have. So many women simply lie. Tell them ""oh I actually prefer 5 inches"" and ""the bigger ones hurt"" when if you look at polling this isn't the case. So men are placed in a weird position. The word from women who care about his feelings is that 5 inches is fine but the word from every other woman is the opposite. I mean look at what the guys on r/bigdickproblems get told by their wives and girlfriends.  
  
So now we get to my main point. I think the best thing for this insecurity is for women to just be honest with men from now on. Stop placating men about penis size. This makes things better in two ways, helps men to learn to do more in bed without their penises and helps them to accept things the way they are. Both of which are things I think the constant lying to men about penis size preference hurts."

It usually assumes that democracy is more moral than authoritarianism (which I agree with to a certain extant), therefore the USA's foreign policy is broadly moral.

But that's just not true.

America allies with undemocratic states all the time, most notably Egypt and Saudi Arabia today, but also in the past. South Korea and Taiwan were dictatorships until 1987. Pakistan has shifted between democracy and military rule numerous times. The USA has often directly propped up dictators in other places as well like South Vietnam and Indonesia to secure their economic interests. Sometimes they even toppled governments that were elected democratically or were in favour of democracy, like in Iran and countless times in Latin America.

This pattern in foreign policy cannot be explained by the USA's willingness to protect democracy, but its willingness to secure its own economic interest. Egypt controls the Suez Canal and Saudi Arabia controls the oil. The USA must work with these authoritarian countries to ensure control over its own economic interests. 

Can someone please explain to me how so many Americans believe that the USA is the bastion of democracy? I would love to hear from you to change my mind."

The reason they ignore muslims is because they dont want to be seen as Islamophobic, there's no word or atleast a word on that level for Christians so Christians take most of the flack from the left 

If the left dont want to be hypocrites you should be in the comments getting mad at muslims when they post on social media too? If the left dont want to be hypocrites whenever they see a muslim say ""Ameen"" they should get just as mad as when they get mad Christians that say ""God Bless You"". I saw a bunch of leftists mad at a Christian car meet where everyone is welcome, it's just mostly Christians. If the left dont want to be hypocrites when you see muslims in the street promoting islam you should be taking their signs too, same with hindus, same with sikhs, same with jewish people 

I saw someone on the left who is a ""he him she her they them trans gay Christian"" and when I asked them what Christian ideals align with your own personal ideals or belifs they couldn't say. When I asked them why they were Christian they couldnt say.

I’m asking why non-sober people are obsessing over NA.)

It can’t be about the calories, because there isn’t a caloric difference and there’s low cal beer anyways.

I don’t buy the “social buy-in” argument, as in someone doesn’t want to get drunk but they want to fit in with their friends who are drinking so they grab a NA beer. We are adults, outside of college no one cares what you’re drinking.

I hear people say “I want to drink without getting drunk.” This is the main one I don’t understand. I find it hard to believe that someone likes the taste of beer so much that they want to drink it without the warning alcohol feeling. I’m obsessed with the process, flavor, and art of brewing beer and distilling whiskey. And I certainly don’t drink a lot, maybe 3-5 drinks per week? But I wouldn’t drink them if the warming, comforting embrace from the alcohol wasn’t also a part of the experience. What’s the point? Drinks are nothing without the alcohol in them, even if you’re not getting drunk. Even if I take just 1 sip of whiskey, I sure as hell hope it will have that warming alcohol feeling, or else the sip is lacking something. At the very least it requires a “sting” to taste right. 

And if you just want something without alcohol in it, you can get something way better than a NA beer or a mocktail. Water, seltzer, coke, any other soda, sherry temple, juice, coffee, energy drinks, any other bottled/canned drink, etc.

What am I missing?

Is the thing I’m missing just that some people genuinely love the flavor of NA drinks without the alcohol in it? If so, please explain that because it’s fascinating to me.

Or is there no real explanation and it’s just a trend that makes no sense at the end of the day? Like people who don’t have Celiac disease eating no gluten? They just do it to do it."

Also, the banning of augmented reality for driving totally, probably defined as looking through any transparent screen or screen and camera combination being considered obstructed vision for sake of driving, is itself a bad idea, given that would also ban several cars with heads up displays in their windshields, as well as everyone who wants augmented reality to allow them to look through their own car, something which will eventually replace screen and camera setups for reverse cameras, and generally allow people to see everything their car does through it's cameras for autopilot."

However, after several decades, I've come to see this advice as being utterly reprehensible. I can improve my life and my social skills all I want, but ultimately, none of it will help with loneliness. Only the reciprocation of other people can do that. Worse yet, withdrawing and 'working ' on yourself means you aren't engaging in friendships and relationships, which brings you further and further behind and only intensifies the problem of loneliness. Getting a promotion at work or winning a tournament or discovering new information from a passionate deep dive loses alot of it's luster when you have no one to share these moments with."

But what made me want to post here again was this. I logged back onto Facebook after a year and a half, and the first thing that I see on it was the fact that someone who I went to school with who's only a year older than myself posted a pic that he was expecting his first child in August. And to say that it made me devoid of any feeling is an understatement. Now this guy, unlike many others, isn't someone I resent even though he was a sporty guy, cause he was at least a semi-decent person, but it just makes me quiver in fear at the prospect of many others that I didn't see on Facebook doing better than me in this main aspect.

Nevertheless, I feel like this post really reinforced something that I felt the need to address for the longest time, and that is the fact that I'm starting to really believe that dating/finding love/getting married is mostly about luck and not effort. 

Here's why I say that, in no particular order. 

1. I live in Toronto, Canada, literally one of the worst cities in the world to make lifelong connections outside of childhood (which of course I missed).
2. I've actually tried to ""put myself out there"" and ""work on myself"" to develop a ""social circle"". Beyond the usual school, I've joined clubs, taken classes,  (dance, photography, improv etc.), asked my existing connections if they knew people they could connect me with, and guess what? All led to absolutely nothing. With regards to classes I've joined, most of  the time, the people there are significantly older than me and quite frankly wasting both my time and theirs with their attendance. In terms of clubs, if they aren't sausage fests, a lot of them just simply have no consistency in the people that show up, so no chance for the ""repeated unplanned social interaction blah blah blah"" stuff that ""experts"" preach about. 
3. Going off of the ""mutual"" introduction, if said mutual connections aren't losers like myself who don't know people they could introduce me to, they simply are people who for whatever, reason never think of or never follow up on introducing me to others, even when I ask them and explain my situation in the politest way possible.
4. Even in the most optimal situation of all, it still didn't work out. I am literally the only male in my master's cohort of 15 people, and yet pretty much every woman that I thought interesting to connect with are either in relationships or simply incompatible with me (due to them being religious). If I couldn't find someone even in the most supposedly optimal situation, then that means I'm practically screwed for the future.
5. Some other necessary information that I feel reinforces this point and also a reminder for those who may not have been following. I'm mildly autistic, 5'6.5"", Iranian descent, balding, slightly above average weight. So you can probably imagine that online dating is a shitshow for someone like myself, which is why I vowed to never succumb to that BS ever again, but even meeting people IRL is practically a nightmare given the aforementioned points.
6. The only reason I even got my first kiss back in December was due to sheer, dumb luck. I met that woman on an outdoor club camping trip, but what I did was practically no different than what I did (or wished to do other times), it's just that... well... the circumstances worked out. She was someone I was into, she was single, and she wasn't a jerk like many others who brushed me off for being different and introverted. Even if it took 16 months for us to really get intimate, that just seems to further go against all the people that put me down constantly. 
7. I have a friend who got married to her husband after 8 years together, but that situation is literally the epitome of luck. They met in the first day of their university tutorials, and somehow, she, unlike many others, wasn't repulsed by him being friendless for most of his life, and actually took the initiative to connect with him. Had they gone to uni during COVID times, he never would never have met her, and would never have gotten married.
8. It seems like in the current world, there are practically no opportunities for people to meet organically anymore outside of either mutual friends or online dating, and given that neither option works out for me no matter what I do, it seems to only reinforce my view that my situation is mostly luck at this point. 

I could name MANY other points, but I think these are the best ones I could say regarding my current viewpoint and what led me to post it. And trust me, I'm not excited for them, but I definitely am expecting a bunch of enlightened platitudes such as ""if it smells like crap everywhere blah blah blah"" or ""everyone goes at their own pace"". It would be much appreciated if you guys took the time to really consider my viewpoint and what I have done to improve my situation, which is a lot more than can be said for many people on the spectrum and even not on the spectrum. And for the record, for those who may not have been following, I am currently on my 12th therapist in 9.5 years given how practically all of them have been garbage in helping me through these issues, and some of whom even reinforced my feelings of bitterness."

Hi guys, so I was wondering if you could debunk my views about public unions. I live in NY so my views may be jaded and I have a slight anti boomer hinge 


-Financial Ruin- Public unions have a history of bankrupting governments like Illinois, Detroit and NYC’s MTA where they place demands and politicians just comply for votes along with crazy tax hikes where in case of NY a lot of these retirees leave for Florida and then complain about NYS taxes

-Better perks than many Jobs especially corporate. I live in NYC and government jobs are often desired because they have far better perks than anything found in the private sector (pensions, quality healthcare etc.) Also a lot of these jobs are inaccessible to most ordinary people especially outsiders.

-Corruption-money in politics as they sponsor candidates like how is that different from corporations. Also bribery, stealing etc. Tammany hall originates from Public Unions"

Men commit close to 80% of violent crimes. The issue is that it’s not 80% or men committing these crimes. It’s not like every male victim of a violent crime deserves it. It’s is extremely relevant that men are more likely to be victims of violent crimes than women. This narrative that men don’t have fear and never have to be cautious in life just doesn’t make any sense. & if someone says “well men are also victims of most of these crimes” saying “well men are committing them as well” just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. The same men committing these acts are not the same as the victims. It’s not the same people. At. All.

1,2024-02-05,CMV: There is no reason for incest to be illegal or as big of a deal as it is,u/Arthur_Author,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ajcz3e/cmv_there_is_no_reason_for_incest_to_be_illegal/,changemyview,"I have a difficult time understanding why incest is seen as some big huge crime on the level of even child abuse in some cases, so, I figured maybe Im missing something. But to lay my case;

Any incestuous relationship that is bad would also be bad if the actors were not related. Pedophilia is bad even if the actors are not related. Grooming and abuse are bad even if they are not related. And in a situation where there is a perfectly acceptable average couple, them being related does not make the situation more toxic or abusive in a way that comes to my mind.

While children of incestuous couples have a higher chance of having certain issues, not all incestuous couples would have kids, and also, while frowned upon, we do not view ""action that might have the baby be born with issues"" as big of a deal as incest. Think drinking or smoking. In fact, in some places Id guess incest is more taboo than hitting kids.

So, I fail to see any reason for it to be a big deal. As long as it is 2 consenting adults and there is no abuse going on, there doesnt seem to be an issue."
1,2024-02-05,CMV: Many people are literally too stupid for the Socratic method to work on them,u/Realistic_Ad5850,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aje2dm/cmv_many_people_are_literally_too_stupid_for_the/,changemyview,"My thesis: In order to reach greater understanding, humans need only have a rational exchange of ideas. In theory, 100% of problems and conflicts can easily be resolved if both parties are willing to absorb information given to them and to respond in good faith. However, one wrench thrown in this system is that many (I'd say *most* but I don't want the whole debate to be about if it's over or under 50%) humans are literally too stupid to absorb information or to engage honestly with other people's ideas and questions. As such, even the Socratic method cannot work on those people, and it is therefore impossible to ever come to a greater understanding as long as this sort of people is allowed to have equal standing to intelligent human beings.

It's not part of my thesis, but I personally believe these people should be singled out, tested for their ability to intellectually engage with ideas, and if they are incapable, they should be excluded from civilized society until they change, if ever. Those people, and those people ALONE, are solely responsible for every war, every conflict, every genocide, every example of abuse ever seen in history, for climate change, for fascism, etc. If those people were forced to actually confront the contradictions of their own beliefs, they would not be able to continue supporting evil while feeling good about themselves, but they keep being allowed to do exactly that and to reject every attempt at making them see what they are doing wrong. In my opinion, if this ONE thing was enforced, if idiots were forced to either put up and answer Socratic questions or shut up and let the real human beings talk, then every single problem in the world would be solved. 

----------------------------

Even though you are 100% correct, you have evidence and can prove without the shadow of a doubt that you are correct, you will ""lose"" debates with a huge portion of humanity simply because those people are unwilling or unable to intellectually engage with you. When faced with one such specimen, the exchange will **always** end the same way: You make your arguments, you back them up, you ask questions of your opponent to force them to face their own contradictions... and your opponent just says ""I refuse to continue this conversation"" and leaves. Or worse, they stubbornly continue to repeat their opinion over and over, usually louder every time to try to shut you up. Ultimately, without fail, they will end all communication and walk away convinced that they ""won"" and that you're in the wrong. 

The Socratic method consists of asking someone questions to make them rethink their positions in order to be able to answer the questions, which either leads them into obvious contradictions or forces them to realize they were wrong and change their mind. I have always heard that the Socratic method is the ultimate way of teaching and reaching across the aisle because, when someone has to defend their position from questions, they have to re-explore their own opinions and supposedly realize the flaws of those opinions. However, it is my personal experience that essentially nobody actually re-evaluates themselves, instead they metaphorically put their fingers in their ears and go ""LALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU SHUT UP SHUT UP!"" then, when you shut up, they resume their life convinced that they were right all along.

One example is my mother, who's the queen of that attitude. She votes for our country's Nazi party (literally, it was founded by a Waffen SS officer) despite us being brown-skinned African immigrants. Back when I still spoke to her, I tried to tell her that her party is made up of Nazis. Her opinion is that Nazis cannot be allowed to run for office, ever, therefore the Nazi party is not actually Nazi. I argued that Hitler reached power democratically and his Nazi party won elections in Germany. She told me it was nonsense, no Nazi ever ran for office. So I looked up the Nazi party page on Wikipedia and tried to show it to her. She physically closed her eyes to not have to look at the wiki page proving her wrong, and she screamed at me to leave her alone and to stop trying to make her feel bad. She stills votes for the Nazi party to this day, her opinion stronger than ever.

Another example is shooting galleries. Shooting galleries are where addicts can consume drugs under medical supervision, usually inside a hospital. They allow drug-addicted people to consume drugs in a safe and controlled environment. Instead of dying of overdoses, they are safe thanks to the medical professionals there. Instead of taking tainted drugs, they are guaranteed to only consume pure and safe drugs. Instead of being left to their own devices, free to go wild and get worse, they are surrounded by professionals capable of slowly weening them off the drugs safely with lower dosages and by replacing heroin and meth with less addictive alternatives. Those galleries also make the streets safer for EVERYONE. Instead of addicts roaming the streets during their bad trips, the addicts are safe in a shooting gallery watching spongebob on a couch under the eye of doctors. It gets basically rid of all drug dens, make dangerous neighborhoods much safer, and it rids the streets of discarded syringes. Pure net positive. There was an incident in my hometown where a guy punched a doctor in the face because the doctor worked in a shooting gallery. The assaulter' ONLY argument was to repeat ""drugs are bad."" Nothing substantial at all, he was totally incapable of spelling out what is bad about shooting galleries other than the association with ""giving addicts drugs."" He just repeated ""drugs are bad. This doctor gives addicts drugs. Drugs are bad."" To this day, shooting galleries continue to receive a lot of pushback from people incapable of interacting with ideas beyond ""I find this thing yucky, therefore I hate it"" without ever understanding the benefits of it.

Another example that happened today on reddit: Someone was saying there is never, ever any reason to draw underage fictional characters in sexualized ways, and they were literally calling for the brutal murder of everyone who ever drew such a thing. I personally did that exact thing, still do it to some degree. I suffered from long-term sexual abuse from my mother among others as a child, and I was extremely isolated and lonely. I watched anime and I drew fanart of characters I loved, that was my only outlet. As a pubescent gay boy, of course I had crushes on those characters, and I drew sexual fanart of them - and of course, given that anime settings are often in school, those characters are underage. When I was myself a child, I drew porn of characters as young as 12, in my late teens and 20s, I have been drawing porn of characters like [Bakugo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FR3AayRXEAQMfjQ.jpg) (14-15yo), [Luffy](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/ea37168f-58bf-43ec-b98d-f15c62f681dd/dehuqx8-618b457d-c424-4d3f-ac58-f03eb8d52176.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2VhMzcxNjhmLTU4YmYtNDNlYy1iOThkLWYxNWM2MmY2ODFkZFwvZGVodXF4OC02MThiNDU3ZC1jNDI0LTRkM2YtYWM1OC1mMDNlYjhkNTIxNzYucG5nIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.-dLNILvfhhqmu_szpuHbS0SBpbNmGL0IB3NAsRIyI1s) (17yo) and [Ichigo](https://saviorichigo.weebly.com/uploads/2/2/0/4/22045354/240320892.jpg?487) (15yo), characters whose age in canon only serves to put them in a certain setting (school...) while they look and act like adults. I have been very clear that I only draw those characters because I love them, if they were university students (they already LOOK and ACT like adults), I'd be drawing the same characters because they matter to me emotionally. There is no appeal to them being ""minors"" because they look nothing like minors - 6ft+ with washboard abs and on a quest to save the universe while having killed many people each. But the idiot in question insists: this is unacceptable and I deserve to die a painful death for that.

So, I tried the Socratic method. Asked that person a few questions that, if answered, would definitely force them to face their own contradictions and see the holes in their opinion:

Who is being hurt by drawings of a naked Luffy? Their only point is that ""it's yucky"" with nothing else to back it up, but I brought up that pedophiles are born pedophiles, and they will be pedophiles their whole lives. Ignoring them and pretending they don't exist only leads to ONE outcome: they get so sexually frustrated that they rape a real-life child. But with a harmless outlet like drawings of underage fictional characters, pedophiles get to release themselves and appease their urges, and studies have found that they develop a taste for 2D drawings over real children, which actively prevents child rapes. So, it is a purely harmless activity that potentially saves the lives of countless children, it's great! ... but the idiot in question refused to answer the question, instead choosing to just repeat their previous points, unchanged, as if the question was never asked.

I also asked where the line was between child and not child, in their view, for anime characters. They said ""I do not care if she is a 5000 year old loli. I don't care if he's a 12 year old that looks 30. I don't care if they are real or not."" So I asked: What are the criteria to determine what is ok and what is not? With a real child, you can just see their age. But a drawing does not have an age. I gave two examples:

[Bakugo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FR3AayRXEAQMfjQ.jpg) (from My Hero Academia) is 14 years old - he's also 6 feet tall with the attitude of a young adult and washboard abs.

[Honey](https://ohayouanime.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/ohshc-honey1.jpg) (from Ouran High School Host Club) is 18 years old - he's also 4 foot nothing, has the appearance of a prepubescent child, carries a stuffed bunny everywhere and speaks like a particularly immature kindergartener.

So, what do we consider ok? Is Honey ok because he's an adult according to the number the author wrote next to his age? Or is porn of Honey pedophilia because he looks, sounds and acts like a little child? Same questions with Bakugo. Is it pedophilia to do porn of Bakugo because he is apparently 14 according to the author, or is it acceptable because he's tall, mature, built like a tank and never has anything resembling childishness in his appearance or attitude? Just them answering the question would inevitably lead to them actually having to think about it and potentially realize that their take is nonsensical... which is why they pretended the question did not exist and just insulted me again so they would never have to think about it. Same thing with Luffy: Luffy appears as both a minor and a 19yo ""adult"" in the same story, but he looks strictly identical in both ages, with the only exception of a scar. 19yo Luffy has one extra scar that he didn't have at 17. So, if someone draws porn of Luffy without the scar, they are a vile pedophile and must be hanged for it... but the artist just adds that scar without changing ANYTHING else in the picture, suddenly it's moral and good and not pedophilia at all?

If, as they say, it does not matter what the character looks like AND it does not matter what fictional age the author decided to give the character, and it's ALWAYS pedophilia and wrong, then surely it means liking a character like [Asuma](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/7/7c/Asuma.png/revision/latest?cb=20210117153743&path-prefix=fr) from Naruto is also pedophilia, despite him being 30 and looking 30. Except that the idiot did not have that opinion and would surely have scoffed at the very notion (the idiot in questions draws a ton of porn of characters who look barely 20), but the idiot would have needed to actually think about it and consider the reality of it if they replied to the question, which is why they chose to blow it off.

I made several more points. About the fact that drawing such sexual content is well-documented to be an outlet for trauma for people victim of sexual abuse (like me). About the fact that giving an outlet to pedophiles actively prevents them from sexually abusing children. Etc etc. The idiot ignored it ALL and just said ""I'm not going to reply to you."" They had the gall to get offended at me being ""rude"" to them while they actively called for my murder and wished endless misery on me for doing something they refused and were unable to back up as being ""immoral."" Calling for my murder is okay, but saying they're an idiot for refusing to read my points or answer my questions is somehow not okay.

From my experience, the vast majority of humanity is of that sort. Humans are willing to interact and exchange... as long as nothing challenges them. The second they are asked a question that they know would force them to admit they're wrong in order to answer it, they withdraw from the conversation, close up like a clam and act like they are victimized by being invited to confront the contradictions of their opinions. But they virtually never actually just answer the damn questions.

--------------------------

I make this post because I desperately want to be wrong about this. I spent a lifetime understanding that humans are just too stupid and stubborn to ever communicate in good faith and learn from each other, and it depresses me to no end. I have struggled with the desire to end my own life for years because of the understanding that, as long as people like my mother, like the guy who punched a doctor and today's reddit idiot exist, then humanity does not have a future at all. I really, really want to hear counterarguments if there is any, because I am not capable of coming up with any, and it makes me incredibly depressed."

I can't even imagine how these people feel when they find stuff like this on the internet. I hope they don't look at it, ever, because it would make me sick to my stomach to see myself in that light and talked about in such a way.

And I'm still waiting for someone to explain to me why r/womenarethings and r/womenaretoilets still exist and are active. How is that allowed?

I don't give two shits if it's supposed to be ""just a kink"". The fact that it's a kink is already concerning in itself, but all of us acting as if it's OKAY and people SHOULDN'T BE SHAMED FOR IT is dystopian. How the fuck are we as a society accepting this shit when we're supposed to be at the height of feminism and gender equality? Kinks the demean women are misogyny disguised as ""sex positivity"" and a ""kink friendly"" attitude.

Are we not aware of how dangerous it is to normalize these kinds of activities when there are SO MANY degenerates out there who can hide behind the ""kink friendly"" attitude to fulfill their violent and misogynistic fantasies?"

I often use my view as an argument to challenge many views here and never really got a compelling answer back. But for instance, there are often views which argue that prostitution should be illegal with the argument that many prostitutes are only prositutes for the money, not because they truly enjoy the work, to which then invariably about 50 people reply with that that's the same for about any profession. Typically the original poster then claims that sex work is different, sometimes with the argument that it carries certain dangers, and then people again point out that many other lines of work are also dangerous and then the conversation typically stops.

There are many other examples such as sex crimes being treated as especially uniquely by many individuals who want a special case in defamation laws for being accused of one, “rape shield laws” to exist, an “sex offender registries” which exist for no other crimes.

Or for instance people who require that the sex of the protagonist of a work of fiction be their own to find it enjoyable to find the protagonist “relatable”. In which case others typically respond with that they're already say, 25 year old Mexicans who are watching a teenage Japanese protagonist who on top of that lives in a world where people regularly have magical powers so it should be so far removed from themselves that sex is a drop in the bucket. Then they will sometimes say that sex makes more of a differece in relatability than the country one is born and raised in. And then I will simply say that that is silly. A Mexican conversing with a Japanese person will typically not even have a language in common, and if we can ignore that, there will be many culture shocks. I have never heard of males and females living in the same country having grown up together and attended the same primary school classes having culture shocks talking to each other. Perhaps this would happen in a culture where sexes live completely segregated from one another but at the end male and female Mexicans and Japanese persons mingle with each other and go to school and work together while Mexicans and Japanese persons live apart from each other with a giant pacific ocean between them for the most part.

In all these cases when I offered these challenges I was the one challenging others and they typically elected not to respond or ignore it, and I might add sometimes in a very aggressive tone as though they felt very confronted but now, others are challenging me so I can hopefully get a response."

This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism. Our whole educational system suffers from this evil. An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career. I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by a educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilised in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.

There are certainly other examples of this where bills just end up dying for no other reason than the speaker just not calling a vote. This tactic restricts voters from being able to make conscientious decisions on who to vote for based on what their representative votes for, it muzzles public sentiment and greatly restricts representatives' ability to do their job. One person should not have the ability to do this and it eliminates one of the founding principles of the US government, which is checks and balances. Sure there is the option to oust the speaker if there is a majority opposition, but only on rare occasions does that happen.

46,2024-02-05,CMV: Parents have no right to hit their child. Spanking a child is a form of physical abuse that requires intervention and counseling by CPS or other authorities.,u/Plastic-Abroc67a8282,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ajlwj2/cmv_parents_have_no_right_to_hit_their_child/,changemyview,"  
It is commonly agreed that denying a child food or medical care constitutes child abuse, because of the adverse impacts on the child's health, physical and emotional development, and wellbeing. We have reached this conclusion based on numerous long term research studies that have demonstrated the adverse impacts of these practices. Drinking while pregnant with your child is similarly considered a form of child abuse, because of its negative effects on child development.  


However, despite decades of scientific research and an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that spanking or corporal punishment in children creates a host of adverse effects on the child, we still accept that parents have the right to punish their children in this manner.   


**What does the research say?**  


* A landmark meta-analysis published in 2002 showed that **of** **27 studies on physical punishment and child aggression,** **all found a significant positive relation,** regardless of the size of the sample, location of study, ages of the children or any other variable. (Gershoff ET. Corporal punishment by parents and associated child behaviors and experiences: a meta-analytic and theoretical review. Psychol Bull 2002;128:539–79)  

* Physical punishment is **associated with a range of mental health problems in children, youth and adults, including depression, unhappiness, anxiety, feelings of hopelessness, use of drugs and alcohol,** and general psychological maladjustment. (Turner HA, Muller PA. Long-term effects of child corporal punishment on depressive symptoms in young adults: potential moderators and mediators. J Fam Issues 2004;25:761–82)  

* Intriguing results are now emerging from neuroimaging studies, which suggest that **physical punishment may reduce the volume of the brain’s grey matter** in areas associated with performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III). (Tomoda A, Suzuki H, Rabi K, et al. Reduced prefrontal cortical gray matter volume in young adults exposed to harsh corporal punishment. Neuroimage 2009;47:T66–71)  

* Physical punishment can cause **alterations in the dopaminergic regions associated with vulnerability to the abuse of drugs and alcohol.** (Sheu Y-S, Polcan A, Anderson CM, et al. Harsh corporal punishment is associated with increased T2 relaxation time in dopamine-rich regions. Neuroimage 2010;53:412–9)

&#x200B;

* Researchers are also finding that **physical punishment is linked to slower cognitive development and adversely affects academic achievement.** (Straus MA, Paschall MJ. Corporal punishment by mothers and development of children’s cognitive ability: a longitudinal study of two nationally representative age cohorts. J Aggress Maltreat Trauma 2000;18:459–83)

  
Similarly, research has demonstrated that there is a high correlation between spanking and serious physical abuse.  The Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS 1998) showed that 75% of substantiated physical abuse of children occurred during episodes of physical punishment.  Another large Canadian study found that children who were spanked by their parents were seven times more likely to be severely assaulted by their parents (e.g., punched or kicked) than children who were not spanked. In an American study, infants in their first year of life who had been spanked by their parents in the previous month were 2.3 times more likely to suffer an injury requiring medical attention than infants who had not been spanked. (Crandall M, Chiu B, Sheehan K. Injury in the first year of life: risk factors and solutions for high-risk families. J Surg Res 2006; 133:7–10) This indicates to me that allowing corporal punishment opens the door for other forms of more severe physical violence.   
**To me it's simple: parents have no right to permanently damage their child's brain, whether that's drinking while pregnant or hitting it after it's born. Any action which permanently harms a child's brain development is a form of child abuse that requires intervention.** "
1,2024-02-05,"CMV: The arguments around what constitutes a ""man"" and a ""woman"" are dishonest and unrealistic.",u/Ex_Machina_1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ajm0t2/cmv_the_arguments_around_what_constitutes_a_man/,changemyview,"Hi all. 

I've notice a few sentiments, mostly online, that all seem to say the following: the terms ""man"" and ""woman"" are constructs of gender and not tied to sex.  This then leads to the sentiment that man and woman are in essence personalities as opposed to biological realities (which are denoted by male and female). 

I reject these notions because it doesn't fit the actual reality of common, everyday social interaction when these term are used.

Most people use the terms man, woman, male, female in colloquial contexts interchangeably. That is to say, that when a person calls someone a woman, they're assuming (usually correctly) this person has a vagina, uterus, and so on. Likewise for a man (assuming they have testes, penis, etc.)

This lead to my next point -- most people don't identify men and women by their ""constructs"" but by their sexually dimorphic traits. Humans are a sexually dimorphic species, which means that our sex chromosomes typically produce identifiable physical differences amongst ourselves that aren't just tied to our genitals.. And the ability to identify these traits *is not learned*. Being able to identify our reproductive opposites is crucial to reproduction and therefore is not a learned trait; its automatic/unconscious. 

So, an intellectually honest conversation about gender and sex necessitates starting from a point of recognizing that the terms man and woman are used interchangeablely with male and female, and how we identify each other is simply based on evolution; being able to discern and identify our reproductive partners facilitates reproduction and thus goes beyond any gender comstruct."

Beyonce has won 32 Grammy Awards. She is the all-time winner in the history of music. In terms of the Grammy Awards and subjectiness of art... She is considered the all-time best.

Several black artists have won the top prize over the years, including pure hip-hop like OutKast.

In terms of hip-hop being disrespected, didn't they dedicate last year's show to the history of hip-hop? I believe that Questlove produced it, and 20+ acts performed.

The telecast is the telecast, but the Grammys is genre based. They still have to give awards to the best Americana and Polka albums at some point, too. It can't all be a tribute to Beyonce.

* There is a genuine border crisis that started at the end of Title 42 and the coronavirus pandemic. This is not the same hysterics and hyperbole that Trump used in 2015 or others have talked about in the past, it is a real and unprecedented crisis.

* The bipartisan bill drafted by the Senate, misleadingly called the ""Border Security and Enforcement Act"", contains only $20.23B for border security while spending three times that on military support for Ukraine as well as $14B for Israel, $10B for Gaza, and $5B for Ind-Pacific countries.

* The reason these things are attached is broadly that Democrats don't want to spend on border security and Republicans don't want to spend on international aid. Not to say some from each party don't, or that either party doesn't want to spend anything on the opposing issue, but that's the trade here. 

* A standalone border bill may NOT pass - because Republicans don't want to give Joe Biden problem for addressing this crisis. 

* By not presenting a standalone border bill for Republicans to put up or shut up about, Democrats are ceding the issue. Republicans can rightly say the bill is about sending military aid overseas and not about border security. 

* Lastly, the border crisis is routinely polling as the first or second issue of concern along with inflation, including in the 7-8 swing states likely to decide the 2024 election. By not forcing Republicans to vote on a clean border bill, Democrats risk losing in 2024 on this one issue alone."

I was circumcised as a newborn due to a malformed urethra, and it was a decision my parents hesitated to execute, but it had to be done.

That’s it, that’s the only valid excuse to have a circumcision done on babies: if it’s medically necessary. Otherwise it is invasive and takes away the children’s freedom of choice on his own body. Do I personally wish I had a foreskin? Not really, but that is my own thoughts on my own body. Plenty of circumcised men, whether necessary or not, do not feel the same way.

And the excuses?

“It minimises cancer!!!” Yeah, so does cutting your entire cock, balls, and prostate. Should we do that? Besides, you are more likely to get other more aggressive cancers as opposed to penile cancer, which isn’t even that hard to treat or catch.

“It’s more hygienic!!!” Barely. All you have to do as a parent is teach your boys how to wash themselves. Washing under your foreskin is simply 10 more seconds of work. I know tons of uncircumcised men who were, like me, unaware of the existence of smegma.

“But my religion/tradition!!!” Your culture is teaching you to mutilate your sons? Lol. Not even going deeper into this one.

 “But phimosis!!!” This is the most valid excuse, and is another instance in which a circumcision would need to be performed. One problem though: you can just teach your sons how a normal penis should function, and they can see for themselves if it is functioning. Has your son determined that he has a tight foreskin? Now is when take your son to get circumcised. Phimosis isn’t a deadly condition. Your son can survive a few more weeks with a tight foreskin.

As I said before, circumcision is an amputation. Doing it without your son’s consent is mutilation. It’s barbaric.

As far as practical implications are concerned such a narrative is futile at best. I’m sure drilling down the idea of theft being horrible is important to protect property rights and whatever.

Without further ado… Let’s define theft. Theft is defined by the action or crime of stealing. Stealing is the act of taking somebody else’s property. 

I’m an atheist who believes that morality is subjective. However, I’ve always asked the rhetorical question, “if god owns everything, who owns anything?” How can anybody claim anything to be theirs? How can you say you own a tree, or wood or even land? Is it finders keepers? Or is it losers weepers? If it’s finders keepers… it belongs to the Indians. If it’s losers weepers… it belongs to the cowboys. As far as I’m concerned there seems to be no moral consistent claim to who owns anything, surely that’s where idea of moral objectivity and hence gods intentions become very convenient.

On a smaller level. Let’s say, I steal a baseball glove that a father intended to pass down to his son, after I stole it, I passed it down to my son. If his son comes back one day and steals it from my son is he in the wrong? Whose property is it? 

When I see situations like the Israel and Palestine or other wars that seem to be about a challenge on land, watching people pick a side to which group of people should be morally entitled to the land is weird. Look around for Pete’s sake, there’s no precedent. If anything it seems to be losers weepers and then one day everybody forgets and pretends as if the “natives” of a country grew out of the roots of the ground or something. 

I’ve asked this question to a couple people and they have all failed to give an adequate answer in my opinion and it’s got to the point where I’m indifferent to the idea of theft from a moral standpoint. If I got caught robbing a bank, I couldn’t say I’d ever be generally remorseful about it.

138,2024-02-05,CMV: People on the far left in the US labor movement are too focused on ideas outside of the scope of the unions.,u/ChunkMcDangles,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ajrygu/cmv_people_on_the_far_left_in_the_us_labor/,changemyview,"There is a common thread that I've noticed in the last several years within the resurgeance of the labor movement in the US where many on the far left want the unions to work on huge issues like geopolitics and overthrowing entire economic systems.

Take for example [this article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2024/02/grad-students-furious-united-auto-workers-endorses-biden.html) which explains how many grad students who are a part of the union are upset with the union because they endorsed Biden who they feel is antithetical to their aims with the Israel-Palestine conflict. 

I've seen first hand how issues like worker solidarity pushing for fairer wages are undermined by the disunity caused by a bunch of people that are upset because the union isn't taking a stand on Israel. 

However, I feel that a union should be more focused on material, achievable goals that aren't as driven by ideological ambitions as they are driven by addressing a real need by the workers themselves. This is the main view that I would like to be challenged rather than arguing about some vague technicalities on the edges of my argument."
32,2024-02-05,CMV: It is no more incumbent on the average white person to change systems benefitting white people than it is everybody else in society,u/ICuriosityCatI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ajsa71/cmv_it_is_no_more_incumbent_on_the_average_white/,changemyview,"To be clear, I do think racism is a serious issue. 

What I've never understood is why so many people seem to think the average white person has an obligation to tear down racist systems. 

There's a case to be made that if a white person votes for a racist system they contributed to the problem even if their one vote didn't make the difference. But the white person who has always voted in support of civil rights, who has learned about about racism and slavery, who has always tried to treat people the same... I don't see what more they can do. 

Beyond that, it seems like you quickly get into fuzzy territory. The case could be made that not chiding your racist relative was encouraging racism, but the case could also be made that chiding them increased their racism. There are plenty of studies supporting the latter. Unless something was done with racist intent OR something had an objectively racist outcome regardless of intent, how could somebody possibly bear responsibility for racism when the qualities that determine skin color are completely separate from the ones that determine racist attitudes. 

It seems like manipulation to me. Make somebody think they're responsible or they have some sort of additional obligation so they focus a huge amount of time on the problem and the problem is more likely to be fixed even though there's no case to be made that the individual actually was, in any way, responsible. Because I just do not see how anybody could made the case that a white person has an extra obligation to fix racism because of their skin color. 

But that's why I'm here, so CMV!"

I have yet to hear an argument for guns that I can understand, people say it’s for protection, but look at how many other countries are doing just fine without guns. Yes there are stabbing, murders and other things in other countries, but never to the level you hear about in the states. 

It’s all “freedom this” and “constitution” that, but at the end of the day these are things meant for killing, which I feel like so many Americans have no problem with doing. 

I know other countries have guns yeah, but I feel like even then, the American people have too many deranged people, and making it so easy for them to access these weapons is a recipe for disaster, but no it’s not the guns fault, that person was crazy.

I firmly believe that a means-based welfare state is vastly superior to a Universal Basic Income (UBI) system, and I’m here to present my arguments, hoping to engage in productive discussions and perhaps see perspectives that could challenge my view.

1. UBI’s Flawed Distribution: Helping the Wealthy Unnecessarily

One of my primary concerns with UBI is its inherent nature of providing free money to everyone, regardless of their financial status. This universality means that even the wealthiest individuals, who do not need additional financial support, receive this benefit. It seems counterintuitive to allocate scarce resources to the wealthy when those very resources could be more impactful if directed towards the poor, the disabled, and those in genuine need. The essence of welfare should be to uplift those at the bottom of the economic ladder, not to provide additional benefits to those who are already well off.

2. Resource Reallocation: Diminishing Support for the Vulnerable

By implementing a UBI, funds that could have been allocated to targeted welfare programs for the poor and disabled may be redirected or diluted across the entire population. This redistribution could lead to a net loss of support for those who rely on these programs the most. A means-based approach ensures that the resources are channeled to individuals and families based on their specific needs and circumstances, providing a safety net that is more responsive and effective in addressing poverty and vulnerability.

3. Inadequacy of UBI in Addressing Complex Needs

UBI proponents often argue that it simplifies welfare and eliminates bureaucratic overhead. While simplification is appealing, it overlooks the fact that money alone cannot address all the social services required by many citizens. For instance, individuals with disabilities or chronic illnesses may need specialized care, support services, and medical interventions that go beyond what a flat monetary benefit can provide. Similarly, the impoverished need access to tailored programs that address education, healthcare, housing, and employment opportunities. A means-based welfare system is better equipped to offer these comprehensive support mechanisms that cater to the diverse needs of the population.

Conclusion

While UBI presents an attractive model of simplicity and universality, it falls short in providing equitable and effective support for those who need it most. A means-based welfare system, with its focus on targeted assistance, remains a more efficient and just approach to addressing social and economic disparities."

So whaling is very cool but if we just let people do it all the whales would be killed and in a boring dumb way too. If we could make it that you're allowed to hunt whales but only in wooden sails ships with harpoons that would give me something to do and it would be really cool.

It serves no purpose and is counter intuitive to learning.

The homework is virtual and for each question or series of questions you get a certain amount of points. Along with that you get 3 tries to answer the question correctly but it only averages the score. Say you have a series of 3 questions. Unless you answer all 3 questions right the first time it's impossible to get the full score even if you answer it right the next 2 times. If you get the question wrong 3 times it's impossible to get any points for the that question. I see absolutely no benefit to this method. If someone is doing homework they should be given the ability to make mistakes, learn what the mistake was and then correct it without being penalized. 

This method basically turns the home work into gambling and doesn't influence actually understanding. If I get a 3/3 on a problem, even if i don't fully understand what I did, it would be stupid of me to redo the problem to make sure I understand it because at that point I risk getting a lower score. Same with problem that you get a lower score on. If I completely fail the problem 3 times and get a zero I have no incentive to waste my time doing the problem over because I won't get points.

""It prevents guessing"" you might say but even guessing is a better method than this. Even when someone is guessing the answer to a problem there is still some amount of understanding they need to have to  make an educated guess. It's also not multiple choice so that doesn't make any sense.

Overall it's just an idiotic method to me but maybe someone else here understands it. CMV"

Think of it - if numerous NATO bases were massed along the Russia-China border, would it have any energy left for Taiwan?

if you want to get several different answers to a question, one question that will guarantee multiple different responses is ""what is the best disneyworld ride"". everyone has their favorites. spaceship earth, space mountain, splash mountain, expedition everest, etc. but for me, there is no better ride in disneyworld then epcot's soarin. now, most people might think that that's a bit of a weird statement since, while soarin is often considered to be one of the best disneyworld rides, very few people would consider it their all time favorite. well, here are my arguments.  
  
1: the premise  
  
this is pretty self explanatory. have you ever wanted to go hang gliding without having to worry about anything going wrong? soarin is the ride for you. it basically makes you feel like you're hang gliding through different parts of the world. it's an ambitious premise and thankfully, the ride pulls it off.  
  
  
2: the visuals  
  
as one might expect from a ride that makes heavy usage of ariel shots and gives us glimpses of different parts of the world, the visuals in soarin are absolutely amazing. they are extremely immersive, making you feel like you are actually on a hang glider and seeing all these amazing sights. for some people, this is the closest some of them will ever get to seeing these places in real life. for them, the ride is an amazing glimpse at these places.  
  
  
3: the music  
  
the music for soarin was done by jerry goldsmith, one of the most famous movie composers of all time. you may know him as the composer for the omen, the original planet of the apes, mulan, and the universal logo. in my opinion, his soarin score is among his best. if there was ever a piece of music that perfectly captured the feeling of flight, the music of soarin is that piece of music. if you haven't heard it, i strongly suggest to listen to it. there are plenty of videos available on youtube. the soarin score was one of goldsmith's last score, with the attraction opening a mere two years before his death. and to say that he went out on a high note would be a massive understatement.  
  
  
4: the simplicity  
  
soarin is a testament to the power of simplicity. unlike most of the rides in disneyworld, there's no story. there are no animatronics and no thrilling set pieces. instead, it's just a tour of the world. however, soarin shows that, sometimes less can be more. there is no dialogue on the ride, meaning that visitors to the parks who don't speak much english can enjoy the ride. plus, the premise, while simple, is a good one that doesn't really need much else. indeed, soarin doesn't work in spite of it's simplicity but rather because of it.

Someone said circumcision is “barbaric” and another described it as a heinous form of disfiguring abuse. I think people are right when they say we should stop circumcising babies with no medical need for the procedure, but I disagree that it’s abuse.

Circumcision is generally quite safe, babies do not remember the pain of the procedure, and the effects on their life afterwards are not significant. I was circumcised and it’s just not something that affects my life. Some people have compared circumcision to female genital mutilation but that’s frankly ridiculous. FGM is a horrific, life altering procedure which often leads to lifelong sexual dysfunction or worse.

If I have a baby boy, I would not want them circumcise because there is some small risk and there’s no purpose. However, if my wife strongly desires it for religious reasons it’s not a hill worth dying on."

I grew up hating the guy and the Patriots, but at this point to recognize this guy as anything but the Greatest Of All Time (GOAT) would be insane. Brady has 7 Super Bowl rings and hold every single major passing record for both playoffs and regular season. 

I love Patrick Mahomes. He has been my favorite player for the past 5 years and I think he is fantastic. He is off to arguably the best start of any professional athlete ever outside of maybe Magic Johnson or Mbappe.

The main reasons that I believe that Patrick can’t pass Tom are the 0-2 playoff record (one being a blow out IN THE SUPERBOWL). I know Patrick played pretty well in that game but the reality of sports is that you are only as good as your record and at the end of the day he has never beaten Brady when it matters most. The other reason, he still has to get at least 3 more rings and at a minimum 3+ MVP’s while putting together consistent season that give him all time stats that either rival or surpass Brady which would involve playing another 13-15 years at the highest level with no injuries. 

I want Patrick to do it. I want him to be the GOAT. I just don’t see how he can. That loss in the Super Bowl to Brady is like if instead of LeBron losing to the Spurs in 2007, he lost to a Michael Jordan lead Kings team. In that scenario, the NBA Goat debate would be over and that’s essentially what happened here. 

Things that would change my view:

1. Realistic things that Patrick Mahomes could do/accomplish that would make him greater than Brady in the eyes of the average sports fan (obviously if he wins 10 Super Bowls or 10 MVP’s and plays 30 seasons he would be the GOAT, but that isn’t realistic)

2. Evidence that his losses to Brady in the playoffs aren’t a death sentence to his GOAT campaign"

semaphores, and that technology is ages old at this point. That's an  
above-average simplification, though: there's a lot more technology, of  
increasing complexity, that powers our traffic grid. Boil it down, though, its  
colored lights and timers basically.  
Modern automakers, working competitively, have already invested billions at  
this point to bring us very reliable lane keeping, adaptive cruise control,  
and visual/auditory warning systems that have no doubt saved lives. Despite  
its tortured governance history, Tesla has made quite impressive advances in  
demonstrating point-to-point autonomous travel that includes destination  
identification, routing, travel, and parking under ideal conditions.  
As a national priority, and with a partnership across industry (has the tech,  
resources) and government (has everything else), I believe it is possible,  
within five years, to build a network of standardized, fixed-position sensors  
on the ground that work together with in-car sensors to provide complete  
situational awareness during travel.  
It may seem like a pretty ambitious endeavor, but it also may our only option  
left? We are clearly dead set against high-speed rail. Air travel is a 20 year  
old joke that just changes punch lines every couple of months. And we do love  
our cars and trucks, but probably because we love driving them, but probably  
because they make them so fun to drive!   
Anyway, aside from flying cars, fully autonomous automobiles - as a national  
priority - could be rolled out in 5 years and would be a nice way to lead the  
world in something that could return mobility to millions of seniors, prevent  
alcohol-related fatalities and all the associated heartbreak around that, and  
revolutionize public transportation.

1,2024-02-06,CMV: Regulation of Public Speech is Essential for Healthy Democracies,u/loadoverthestatusquo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1akbo1b/cmv_regulation_of_public_speech_is_essential_for/,changemyview,"I want to start my post by pointing out that I think freedom of speech is one of the fundamental human rights, I have nothing against individuals expressing their opinions. My argument is against when politicians and public office holders/officials tell blatant lies that ultimately convert into votes in future  elections. I am not talking about promises that would never be fulfilled, that is understandable. I am talking about when they tell something that is an apparent lie (it's not factual) and is carefully tailored by campaign advisors to manipulate voters, often emotionally (often using topics like immigrants, terrorism, religion etc.). I think this needs to be one of the most disgusting crimes that would be punishable by law. If the law would only be about the factuality of the speech, I think it would like black/white law, the court simply needs to do a fact-check. If you keep telling BS to get votes, you go to jail. That's it.  


For example, if Trump spreads non-factual information about immigrants/covid, he should be punished. When he says ""you can inject soap in your veins"" as a covid precaution, he should be taken to court for threatening public health. Another example I want to give is president Erdogan, from Turkey. Turkey has regular elections, they are not rigged on a scale to change the results and the turnout is always above \~80%. Still, Turkey has one of the worst economies in Europe, scores terribly in most human-rights/freedom indices, is infested with terrorists on its eastern border and have a population that is extremely polarized and hate each other. This is all thanks to the 20+ year rule of Erdogan, which is built on top of lies. If there would be a law about factuality for people who are politicians or have the potential to affect the public opinion, I feel like everyone would be extremely careful about what they talk about. I can't see what is the counter-argument to this. I am aware that these problems are seen less among educated voters, but this is another problem. See, if the population is uneducated and/or polarized, the situation becomes a vicious cycle. As the elected government becomes more powerful, they indoctrinate younger generations and spread more misinformation that fuels the polarization and hate between people, which eventually leads to even more votes for the tyrannical elected officials.  


Please show me how narrow my mindset is and save me from this dark pit of hopelessness. Thanks!"

I understand that, and I’d probably do the same in their situation. 

However, with this whole Texas thing going on, I’ve realized there’s a lot of messed up shit with letting people in illegally: 

1.) Illegal immigrants are being given free healthcare in California. This is great for the immigrants, obviously, but why do they get healthcare for FREE when they don’t pay taxes and most of the country has to pay $50 for a Tylenol at the hospital. Our money should not be being used to fund people who aren’t even citizens when we barely have enough money to fund our own people. For example, schools. I’m 16 and homeschooled this year, but every other year i’ve gone to a real school and they SUCK. Half the bathrooms are out of order, the air conditioner is always breaking, the wifi doesn’t work, and teachers are completely burnt out. Why don’t we use taxpayers’ money to pay teachers and make sure students have bathrooms and don’t have to walk halfway across the school and wait in line for 15 minutes to take a piss in the one bathroom on campus that works. Another thing, the social security disability situation. My dad is disabled; his right arm is paralyzed, he has a brain injury, struggled in the past with addiction, and now he has a fracture in his spine. He has tried twice already to get put on disability because he literally CANNOT work. He’s been living with my grandma, his mom, for months trying to get approved but they keep denying him. Why? Because one, they’re assholes, and two, they don’t have have fucking money. My moms friend had cancer, was divorced with two kids, and couldn’t afford to pay for both chemotherapy and rent. So he applied for disability and died before they could even contact him. It’s bullshit, and I understand that this is basically the same thing Mexicans have to go through to get citizenship, but why are they more important than us? 

Okay, after writing that I realized I only have one reason, but it’s a good one so…

Please correct me if I have any wrong information here. I’m trying to understand and I figured i’d get the most insightful responses here."

Democrats want permanent power and are using pure numbers of illegals to get it no matter how it hurts anyone else. California actually lost a congressional seat for the first time. Democrats have gone so far left that people are leaving the party.

I knew him, but not terribly well. However, listening to the priest talk about how this only goodbye for now, that everlasting life and happiness are on the other side. That God takes care of us and selected this man's soul for how good it was and that's why he was taken so quickly. (Metastasized lung cancer, not uncovered until a month or so before his death. All they could do was diagnose him and send him home to die there.) 

Listening to this, while looking around at all the people who gathered, the family crying, I started thinking about what the sense was. Why do we keep doing this to ourselves? 

Particularly when the priest said that this is how it was, is, and will be. 

Then I thought about myself and a life without children. What would be the downsides? 

The biggest is that no one will care about you when you're older. They'll bury you, sure. However, no one will support you when you're down emotionally or financially. You have to hope for the kindness of strangers otherwise known as ""the community"". 

It would be a painful old age for me. Very lonely.

Then I thought of my grandparents, and all the other people I will one day probably bury. The pain I will need to go through. The people who will show up that I know are assholes. Then I thought about my own death and the suffering some will experience from that.

However, I can't imagine sentencing someone to live. Ripping them from the void and forcing on them life, suffering and death. 

I'm not happy to be here and I couldn't guarantee my theoretical child's safety or happiness. The only real reasons to have them is to make me feel better. 

The only way to have them anyway, is to ignore the suffering or explain it to myself like ""oh well ever person goes through things"". Even that though... yeah, we do all go through things, but some go through worse things than others."
1,2024-02-06,CMV: The US is too large and diverse to be governed by a single federal government.,u/GroundUpGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1akeip3/cmv_the_us_is_too_large_and_diverse_to_be/,changemyview,"There are obviously many pros to having a federal government. I personally find libertarianism obtuse and ignorant of our history. As someone who was raised in the south and has now spent over a decade living in the north. I believe the political climate/structure and the diverse views of the US population by region are too extreme and a sole federal body will never be able to properly govern the population as a whole. 

The constitution and the structure of the US must stay in place. This is crucial if we want to maintain our constitutional rights. However, as one might argue against the right to own guns as being out of date, is it a stretch to say that our current system is out of date as well? We see how horrible a two party system is. The division and chaos it causes is unnecessary. So many people are stuck in limbo with their political views because it is impossible for two groups to encompass their beliefs. But even splitting the country into two doesn’t even come close to benefiting most of the population.

What I suggest is you keep the current federal body and system but branch out below it 4 separate minor bodies that individually govern above the states in the region. The regions will be split into NE/SE/SW/NW. Each region will have its own election for their “RP” Regional President.  Elected congressman will only be able to introduce bills for their region. Which they will send to the RP who has the power to sign the bill. Governors will still act on behalf of their individual states. Senators on the other hand will process federal law and pass it to the RPs. The RP’s must unanimously agree to pass a new federal law. If they pass it, it will land on the president’s desk who has the final signature. We will still hold an election for the US president that will reside over the 4 regions and maintain our constitution and democracy. 

This will allow an extra layer of democracy to the people that’s not as divisive or blind to the regional differences within the US. This will also eventually kill the 2 party system, as a smaller election area will allow other parties to rise. 

Maybe I have a pessimistic view of the current landscape but I think this could be successful."

1,2024-02-06,CMV: US Survival Hinges on Third-Party inclusion - We MUST USE Proportional Elections.,u/Dr_Macunayme,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1akf9hi/cmv_us_survival_hinges_on_thirdparty_inclusion_we/,changemyview,"I contend that the United States isn't inherently polarized, and a significant number of individuals don't align exclusively with either Team Red or Team Blue. Politics exists on a spectrum, yet the prevailing representation often forces voters into choosing a packaged deal that may compromise their values. The current system, where parties act as broad tents, distorts everyone's understanding of what they truly get when electing either the GOP or Dems to power.

A potential solution to break this pattern involves giving third parties a fair chance. While not advocating for existing third parties, creating a viable path for them to enter the House or Senate can breathe new life into U.S. politics and new future parties.

I propose adopting the Mixed-Member Proportional Representation system, inspired by the German model but tailored to our unique needs. In this system, half of the politicians are elected directly, and the other half indirectly. Here's a breakdown:

1. Each district features candidates from major parties (Republicans and Democrats) and potentially third parties (Green, Libertarians, Constitution, Natural Law).
2. Voters cast their first vote for a local candidate, similar to the current direct election system. The candidate with the most votes in each district wins a seat in the House.
3. Voters also cast a second vote for a political party. This is a national vote for the remaining 218 seats. Parties submit candidate lists, and individuals from these lists enter the House based on their party's national vote percentage, contributing to proportional representation.

Let's assume all 217 seats on the direct ballot go to the GOP and Dems:

* GOP: 93 seats
* Dems: 124 seats

**Here's the kicker!** Now, *even if* Dems and GOP secure 80-90% of the party vote in this second ballot, the **remaining 10-20% of seats are allocated proportionally to other parties:**

GOP: 100 seats (45.9% of 218) Dems: 90 seats (41.3% of 218) Green Party: 15 seats (6.9% of 218) Libertarians: 7 seats (3.2% of 218) Constitution Party: 3 seats (1.4% of 218) Socialist Party: 3 seats (1.4% of 218).

Total Allocation:

* GOP: 193 seats (93 + 100)
* Dems: 214 seats (124 + 90)
* Green Party: 15 seats (0 + 15)
* Libertarians: 7 seats (0 + 7)
* Constitution Party: 3 seats (0 + 3)
* Socialist Party: 3 seats (0 + 3)

This approach offers a more nuanced representation, allowing diverse voices to be heard in the legislative process. PS, I believe this means, we will have to end independent representation."

My experience and observations have led me to see a disconnect, particularly in how racial and socioeconomic factors are acknowledged and prioritized. For instance, the emphasis on sexual assault, while critical, sometimes overshadows other profound issues like racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparities. These are equally vital in understanding privilege and victimhood. Additionally, there's a tendency within some feminist circles to overlook the complex ways race and gender intersect for men of color. The narrative that ""men can't be assaulted"" or that sexual assault is the paramount struggle ignores the realities faced by many, including myself as a black man who has experienced assault. The approach often taken seems to oversimplify the intricate dynamics of privilege, especially when considering the socioeconomic standing of white women compared to other groups. This perspective suggests a need for a more nuanced understanding of intersectionality that fully incorporates race and class alongside gender."

My relatives used to work on impoverished farms within plots of land handed by the government, but now thanks to the gradual opening of the economy starting in 1978 along with investments from the United States, my families are now living better lives than ever (even with some current economic difficulties).Much of this growth I believe, could be attributed to the integrated world economy to which the United States is the current steward of, and has been since 1992 (maybe even before the USSR collapse). By being able to participate in this global economy, many countries can grow their economies, receive investments, and thus better the lives of their citizens.

The problem starts when the United States has the de facto economic leverage to sanction any countries who’s ruling ideology the United States disagrees with. This happened with Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, Russia, and some other countries. By cutting these investments and trade opportunities off, these countries are essentially left to fend for themselves in a dying economy while ordinary citizens suffer. If the United States were to sanction China, many of my relatives will have to endure worse lives just because the United States hates the government. Sanctions do nothing except to galvanize the population towards the regimes that the United States is against. It can’t force a regime change since the governments can simply find an alternative source of income.

In contrast, if we have multiple blocs of superpowers in this world, no single bloc could completely cripple the economy of any nation they disagree with. They could simply diversify their economies like any good investor and maintain their ruling governments and way of life without being blackmailed by one superpower."

The main reason is that, as far as I am concerned, the guitar is the only instrument that can be bought and played with a designated handedness and I see no reason for it


Some can argue that left handed drumming is a thing, I’ll give you that but left handed drummers are few and far between and all you need to do is rearrange a kit instead of buying specific gear


Some might argue about dexterity in a dominant hand, but I don’t buy this because for a few examples, a trumpet is played with your right hand, end of story. A piano is always made with bass keys on the left, treble/melody playing on the right, end of story. Various woodwind instruments are right hand on bottom, left hand on the top. Again for drummer, to break it down simply you keep time in your right hand, except for some few and far between exceptions (like open handed playing when required, see Misfit Love by QOTSA lol)


I also have a theory I can’t prove, and that’s that most peoples exposure to guitar and guitar players is seeing someone play a regular guitar. I’ve watched left handed non-guitar players air guitar and it’s always the standard way to play, so I have a feeling there’s some sort of imprinting that can happen for a left handed person to play the normal way 


TO BE CLEAR, this is coming from a competent lefty guitar player who never considered using a left handed instrument. In fact, my brother and I are both leftys (satans children) and both play normal guitars in a band with zero problem"
269,2024-02-06,CMV: Replacement level fertility is impossible in liberal urbanized populations,u/KitezhGrad,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1akitl9/cmv_replacement_level_fertility_is_impossible_in/,changemyview,"The reason none of the world's freest, most prosperous societies have a replacement level birthrate is that once you have removed archaic cultural hangups that penalize female childlessness, barriers to women's education and career advancement as well as minimize the prevalence of rural lifestyles, thereby eliminating the free labor force incentive to produce multiple children exclusively present in rural settings — there are no compelling reasons for the average woman to produce at least 2 children. 

Therefore, the birthrate per woman in an urbanized liberal society will always be below replacement. Case in point: not a single Nordic country has managed to get to replacement level fertility despite their heavily subsidized childcare as well as other welfare programs.

The ugly truth is that replacement level fertility in urbanized populations can only be the result of society-wide cultural and/or economic coercion, so, for example, European countries' only choices are replacement migration and regression to a pro-family culture that would by definition stigmatize childlessness."
58,2024-02-06,CMV: the healthcare standard should always be to try therapy before antidepressants (SSRIs) except in cases of immediate danger.,u/Square-Dragonfruit76,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1akj0rc/cmv_the_healthcare_standard_should_always_be_to/,changemyview,"First of all, when I say ""healthcare standard,'"" I mean the standard recommendation from medical boards, insurance companies, and typical doctor recommendations. I do not mean patients should be forced to choose therapy, but I do mean that it should be the default.

Reasoning:

1) The psychical side effects of medication are always a risk and can sometimes be severe. Meanwhile therapy should not have any physical effects.

2) For many of the most common disorders for which antidepressants are prescribed, therapy works just as well or can even have a higher success rate. For instance, cognitive behavioral therapy has approximately equivalent success rates for anxiety and depression, and exposure therapy has higher success rates for OCD.

3) Medication can have withdrawal or return of symptoms when you stop taking it. The ideal should not be to stay on medication forever if possible. In that sense, it is also more economically viable to do therapy, considering that you may be able to stop after a few years.

4) In some cases, taking antidepressants can have _permanent_ side effects. Such as PSSD."

But there's so many reasons you should lie to your doctor (whether ethical or unethical). Whatever you say is going on your permanent medical record , accessible to all your healthcare providers. 

You should never admit to tobacco use, drug use, or mental health problems (unless you need help and are actually gonna do something about it). There's tons of jobs, whether CIA, military, pilot, Supreme Court Justice, etc., where having these things on your record would be automatic disqualification. Yes, HIPAA, but how comfortable are you lying with a written record by a physician out there that would prove that you're lying? 

Plus, who knows when a judge can subpoena your health records for whatever reason? No jury looks at a person with any history of mental illness as credible. 

Finally, what does telling your doctor achieve anyways?

 ""Ah, I see you do cocaine. Don't do that. It's not good for you"" (as if you already didn't know).

""Oh, you're depressed? That sucks. You gonna kill yourself anytime soon? Let me know so then I can put you in involuntary confinement. Best I can do is toss random drugs at you, see if it works, and tell you to exercise"".

I watched a video created by a lady on the spectrum, and she pointed out some inappropriate ways in which the creators of this show exploit them and moreover infantilise them. 

1.  When they are talking about each cast member, they have someone say in a very singsong voice,  “Billy likes teddy bears, but does not like asparagus. Wtf. Why are they discussing the most basic desires of said person. They certainly would not do this on another dating show. Why not just discuss their age or some thing they have a passion for at work. Why would they say something like someone’s likes teddy bears or doesn’t like loud noises. This is totally infantilizing.

2. The music they use throughout is very childlike and whimsical. Almost like a song for kids or music for kittens running through glass. 

3. They edit the show to highlight their awkwardness. Maybe it’s relatable, but pull it back a bit. 

4. So many people say awwww, isn’t that so cute, oh, are they just so adorable, hee, hee. When I watch other dating shows, I never say oh that’s so cute and adorable. I just make comments about the date or who the person is. Are we to feel sorry for people on the spectrum or try to be on their side and support them and appreciate that they may be different on a date. I don’t know if the producers wanted people to say aw how cute they are. I don’t know I think we should treat them like adults.

5. So much masking. Poor Tanner was so conscious of everything, like his eyebrows. The speed dating was a sensory assault. When Connor checks no on a girl, the editors told him it was a bad idea on the show. 

6. Poor Steve. They set him up on a nightmare date with a woman who was sexually aggressive with him. It was heartbreaking. Did they know they were putting him on a date with someone who was an extreme extrovert and he was very handsy? Did they know that this was such an inappropriate date that it would Garner a lot of  viewership? Poor journey was put on dates with such an awkward people. One girl showed up and she was a foot taller with a Goth look. Just not appropriate dates.

7. The cost is not paid even one penny, where is people on other dating shows are paid $8000 or more. Why? They tell these people that it’s a documentary and that they won’t be paid. But it’s listed as a reality dating show. That’s also taking advantage of.

8. They only show fairly high needs people and don’t show lower needs people. So now NT people will think this is how all people on the spectrum are, and it absolutely is not. I know it doesn’t or more people on the spectrum and they are nothing like any of these cast members. I mean they don’t have to be like that, but now we’re in our third or fourth season between Australia in the US and there’s not one super high functioning person.

There was probably enough benefit in the show for the cast members to be on it, but they probably do realize, maybe, that it is slightly infantilizing. My only hope is that they would keep the show on, but maybe just change up a few things to make them more real and more independent and more adult like.

If anyone wants to approach this conversation in an adult manner, I will answer, otherwise, I will not engage in an extreme debate or arguments about autistic people.

While I disagree with this mentality and chose to vote for the best candidate 100% of the time (if the party wants my vote, they can put forth better candidates/policy), I can at least appreciate the argument that if you live in a swing state, who you vote for could alter the results of your state's electoral votes.

My CMV is specifically regarding voting for the best candidate, independents included, **if you live in a partisan state that reliably gives its electoral votes to a specific party** (eg. California, West Virginia, Illinois, Oklahoma, etc.)  
 

Why?

1. Your vote won't get the other guy elected as your vote won't change the outcome in your state.
2. Your vote for a non-establishment candidate expresses your frustration at the parties, which, if enough people vote non-party, should nudge them to advocate for policy more Americans can stand behind / run better candidates."

Denying them the right to vote is denying them one of their major rights in determining how Del Norte goes. It is a right—much like the right to healthcare. States like California have determined that undocumented citizens have that right regardless of their country of origin. It is much like a right to an education. Del Norte has determined that attending school is a right that should not be taken from undocumented citizens just because their country of origin may not be Del Norte. 


It only follows that because voting is a right and they are even counted in the census that undocumented citizens be given the right to vote and determine the outcome of Del Norte. They have earned that right more than all white people of European descent—and denying them such a right is inhumane and unjust."

They said that time felt like they had more time when working at afternoon, and they said that if to them if feels like true, then it is true, but honestly to me it doesn't make any physical sense.

We don't get together to talk, laugh, dance, love, share. If I don't contact them, then we won't talk. When there's a family reunion, the only reason I know about it is because they told my mom, so it's never directly towards me. The only reason they know my birthday is because my mom posts it all over social media. Now of course my mom loves me, I'm her child, but if we weren't related, we would not get along; she doesn't even introduce me to her friends and the relatives she grew up with.

I have never dated in my life and I'm almost 33. I'll admit I don't go out that often but I don't see a difference between going out and doing online dating, which I've been doing for more than a few years now. Sure, you're not meeting face to face but you're still meeting people and potentially talking to them, just not in a traditional sense. Not once have I gotten lucky on the different dating sites I've tried.

I have **zero** friends. The only friend I made was in elementary school but that was because our parents went to high school together. All throughout school, I didn't make a single friend. I was never lonely, but I wasn't sought after either. The only people who gave me attention were the ones I already knew years before high school but we never became friends. Now I'm in university, having been there for 3 years, and I haven't met a single person interested in getting to know me.

Now here's a brief introduction about myself: I've been overweight my whole life, I have never dressed up to look presentable, I have never, and don't plan on ever, wearing makeup, I have no hobbies because I like staying home and I'm a very quiet person because I don't have much to say.

I'm 100% certain there are millions of people out there in almost the exact same situation as I'm in, the only difference is that their looks or personality more than makes up for it while mine doesn't. Not to say that my personality is bad but it's not enough to keep people interested, as unattractive people have to work harder to get, and keep, attention.

All this to say, if my own kin doesn't love me, then something is wrong with you if you do."

It’s entirely likely that Hispanics may become America’s largest ethnic group in about 100 years. We had a black president with Obama so it’s not like we’ve been 100% whitey in the 21st century with presidents. If they speak fluent Spanish, a Hispanic president would be great for foreign relations with Latin America, Spain and negotiating immigration issues.

However, my gut feeling is that we probably won’t get a Hispanic president for a while. People are super into identity politics nowadays but our two most likely presidential nominees are two old white guys that belong in a retirement home, not the White House. The closest we have gotten recently was probably in 2016 with Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, with Ted Cruz arguably being more white than Hispanic in both a literal, linguistic and cultural sense. There’s also the issue that there doesn’t appear to be anyone in either the Republican or Democratic Party that is considered to be a successor to Trump or Biden within the wings ready to take over. A decent amount of Hispanics are ineligible to vote and a lot of the more active voters are old people who are usually white but can also be black. The potential of the border closing in a literal and metaphorical sense due to a 2nd Donald Trump policy could decrease the growth of the Hispanic population and decrease the likelihood a Hispanic person will secure the presidential nomination soon."
16,2024-02-06,CMV:US Security Assistance in the Middle East Should Go Only to More Loyal Allies,u/M_de_M,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1akrun0/cmvus_security_assistance_in_the_middle_east/,changemyview,"It is my general view that the US should withdraw the majority of its military forces and funding from the Middle East. I think the current policy is neither in the US' strategic interest (it's an expensive deployment in a region that is far less important to the US than Europe, Asia, or the Americas) nor morally praiseworthy (the majority of people in the region do not want our forces there). 

However, I think there is a bit of an implementation issue in carrying this view out. I don't think the US should simply abandon the various Middle Eastern allies we've promised to protect, from either a strategic perspective (it's terrible for credibility) or a moral one (it will lead to a lot of deaths).

So I think the US should make Middle Eastern countries the following offer. The US will protect them with bases, ships, soldiers, security aid funding, and ultimately a treaty alliance if and only if they (a) match US sanctions and trade policy (e.g., copy all our sanctions and trade restrictions on Iran, Russia, China, and any other countries we choose), (b) maintain a human rights baseline along the lines of ""no killing or arbitrarily imprisoning their own people"", and possibly (c) agree to help the US in any future conflict in the region (this one can be negotiable). Currently none of the countries the US is guaranteeing the security of in the Middle East meet (a) and few of them meet (b). That should not be allowed to stand - it's a wild degree of free riding and disloyalty from states we are protecting and do not actually need as allies.

If none of the states in the Middle East want to take this deal, fine, we can withdraw all our forces and aid from the region. Lives and money saved. If some of them do, great - we've gained allies considerably more useful than the ones we have currently. 

Some arguments I have considered:
* The US needs oil from the Middle East. It really doesn't. The US is a net oil exporter. What US presidential administrations do want (largely for silly reasons relating to the domestic political importance of consumer gasoline prices) is for global gasoline prices to remain stable. But this can be achieved in lots of ways besides current US Middle East policy, and I'm frankly skeptical that current US Middle East policy is even keeping global gasoline prices stable.
* These countries will all pick a new patron (China, Russia, Iran) if America is less of an obliging sugar daddy. I suspect the new patron will find dealing with the various infighting countries of the Middle East as unrewarding as America has. The odds that this results in a dangerous unified alliance of Middle Eastern countries capable of making trouble for America outside the Middle East strike me as low.
* America should protect all countries’ sovereignty with force of arms regardless of what they do for it. I don’t think this is feasible for the US, and it’s not a role the rest of the world has asked for.
* The US should just leave the area entirely. I think abandoning places we promised to protect is not a wise or just way to handle things. If Bahrain or wherever was immediately conquered once we withdrew our forces, quite apart from the hit to US credibility, that would be a tragic harm to its people we could have prevented."
192,2024-02-06,CMV: I shouldn’t be asked to speak out against other peoples racism or sexism even if I disagree,u/bwall2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aksqa4/cmv_i_shouldnt_be_asked_to_speak_out_against/,changemyview,"My girlfriend and I have been talking about harassment and men’s lockeroom talk behavior at work. I’ve worked as an engineer in construction, and individuals I worked with often had a lot to say. I stayed silent even when they made remarks that I find objectionable, keep in mind we aren’t talking about harassment, which I would speak out against. Just general sexist or racist comments that aren’t hurting the all male all white group. I did not laugh or nod along, generally just pretend I’m uninterested and deaf. I have heard often from others that this somehow makes me complicit in their racism or sexism. Equivalents I’ve heard is that if you saw someone hurting another person you would do something about it. Shitty comments like this are supposedly the same way. While I agree that doing nothing in a crisis where someone could get hurt is shitty, I don’t agree with the equivalency.

My main problem is, I don’t think I could change these individuals behavior even if I did speak up. They don’t even respect my opinion on things I’m educated to speak on. They certainly don’t respect me as a person. I see little reason to rock the boat and piss off the people I have to work with for non work related issues.

Secondly these comments don’t really hurt anyone and I don’t think it’s my job to police them. It’s a shitty opinion, and a wrong one in my eyes, but nevertheless an opinion. If they were my friends, I would probably speak up or not hang out with them. Also it is a relatively victimless issue. There are of course women and minorities around, but I have never heard them say anything bad while they’re in earshot. 

Third, I have no idea what to say. I’m socially awkward enough as it is without trying to engage in witty pseudo political sparring with my coworkers. I also am not really these people’s supervisor. I don’t think either that reporting them to their supervisor would be helpful in fixing their behavior or helping me not be public enemy No. 1 on the job-site.

Interested in what people say, kinda wish I thought differently but I can’t see a good reason to speak up."

511,2024-02-06,CMV: talking about politics early in a relationship (even on the first date) is healthy and shouldn't be frowned upon especially in the United states,u/SnooPeripherals2455,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aktlq9/cmv_talking_about_politics_early_in_a/,changemyview,"I was inspired to post this here after reading an article in late 2022 early 2023 after the Supreme Court decision that overturned the federal constitutional right to abortion (the Dobbs decision) that overturned roe v wade. 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/29/relationships-post-roe/&ved=2ahUKEwif6JzHkZiEAxXsm4kEHQ-1AmQ4ChDF9AEoAHoECAsQAg&usg=AOvVaw1d0y_ODgBmhuXN63xJR_KK

It says that more and more couples are reevaluating their long term relationships with their partners or spouses over the controversial dobbs decision in June of 2022. Many hadn't had that conversation with their partners or considered their partners postions at all. In the article it states how many are asking new partners or dates how they feel about it early on to see if they would be on the same page or if they should end the relationship before it gets more serious.

Now that got me thinking. I believe that it's extremely healthy for dates and new couples to talk extensively about politics in the beginning of relationships. When you think of it politics controls alot of out lives whether its a supreme court decision like dobbs or roe or a local issue like the town council expanding a local park both those issues involve politics. So how does not talking about politics early in a relationship not benefit people really by seeing if a potential spouse and you have the same values in life. Even ben Shapiro agrees with this 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dr1cK1WoL2HE&ved=2ahUKEwi59cuplpiEAxU_jYkEHc4ZBzIQFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2QWbRsuE0M6ksLhrHZza3O

Now many will say politics doesn't equal values and that you shouldn't limit yourself or not want to date people bases on their political opinions. A famous couple who are in a relationship like that are democratic strategist James Carville and his wife republican strategist Mary matalin make it work (despite her joining the libertarian party with the rise of trump). I argue relationships like that came to be in an Era when Americans weren't ""political"" in a sense but since 2016 America has become a very political nation like European counties. Which can be shown with this study from the United Kingdom 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dating-relationships-tory-politics-b2095705.html&ved=2ahUKEwjNkr78pZiEAxXsjIkEHXkgDkcQFnoECBQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0Q6gE6zFYeFPiTgHYYsdoN

So I think debating and learning someone's politics early in a relationship is a healthy thing to do. Why would I want to invest time and energy in a relationship with someone whom I don't share my values (this is especially true if your non religious) why would I want to buy a house with someone who doesn't think climate change is real and wants to buy a beach house because nothing will happen. Why would I want to date someone who treats a homeless person with disdain if I value empathy and especially with bodily autonomy why would a woman want to date a man who doesn't value her bodily autonomy and why should I who might value euthanasia and ""pulling the plug"" want to date someone who doesn't belive in that either.

This creates an inordinate burden on the young productive members of your society to produce enough and subsidize the larger retirement population of your country. Clearly we must fix this! We need to increase our population growth so that we are creating more workers than we’re losing! And we will presumably need to continue doing this for the foreseeable if we want to avoid this economic catastrophe. So clearly we need our population grow at greater and greater quantities until the end of time!

But wait a second, did our chain of logic to solving an economic problem LITERALLY just become we need an infinitely increasing population? That’s ridiculous there is no infinite earth.

This right here is almost a memetic representation of the problems with unrestrained capitalism: you can’t enforce the artificial restraints of infinite growth inherent to a capitalist system on the real finite and limited world. And the fact the economic demands of the current system are viewed as inelastic compared to having a population which never decreases or just maintains  in size demonstrates how ingrained it is. 

People might answer “sure we need to increase the population now but not forever. We can work on having a steady population size create a steady economic state in the future”. 

I would ask “why the hell would now not be the perfect time to work at a steady state?”.  If you are a first world country that is facing these types of issues you have a massive amount of resources being produced per capita due to technology. Society has never been in such a clear position of having so much surplus that it could clearly maintain a constant population in good conditions if it figured out how to distribute stuff. We are also naturally having populations decline. If you don’t try and solve this problem when your own population naturally starts to decrease when else are going to solve it? 

It just seems like shunting the problem to the nebulous future like how we dealt with climate and environmental problems. 

Obviously implementation of the transition to an economy which functions with a constant population will be difficult and I am personally not equipped for drafting a proposal for such robust changes to our economic framework. But if the alternative viewpoint leads to the unexamined suggestion of REQUIRING literally infinite future population growth to maintain a stable economy then perhaps we should acknowledge the inherent impossibility and absurdity of that."

The upvote already does the job of curating top content while moving lesser content down. 

1. Downvotes remove any sort of discussion or need for discussion. It is a copout to downvote and not offer any rebuttal. If you disagree don’t upvote and if you really want to pushback you should engage and explain why they are wrong. 

2. Downvotes can bury or hide opinions that may very well be obscure but not wrong. We have far too many examples of people who have opposing views to common thought only to be proven right later (doctors washing their hands is a famous one. Many doctors disagreed with washing hands before work and thought it was silly). 

People should be allowed to be wrong and seen as being wrong. 

3. While I think karma is silly I think enough people take karma seriously enough where downvotes might actually do more harm than good. If Reddit did care about people and their feelings I think removing the downvote option (or at least not negate karma) so open discussion can happen. This is hard to prove but I think downvotes are more personal than it should be. I don’t see the cost-benefit of negating the comment. 

Overall, I like Reddit for discussion and I like the upvotes and how it can curate comments and articles towards the top. Some of the funniest and wise comments can be at the top. But I think that upvotes already moves other content down so there isn’t a need to push articles or comments down further. 

I feel pretty secure in this idea. But I’m open to hearing reasons why I’m wrong."

* This isn't about who is better president
* I am not citizen of US, i am citizen of Republic of Serbia
* This is my personal opinion, based on my feeling
* I don't have accredited knowledge about this topic (except reading literature and watching YT videos)
* I don't have data for things that i will say, but it can be googled

  
United States of America is most powerful country of the world, and actions of USA have consequences of all nations.   


When Trump was President, i have a feeling that whole world liked USA, most leaders feared and respected Trump, not because he could attack them, but because he knew how to negotiate, he held relations with everyone including North Korea and Russia. He had good relations with China, despite imposing tariffs on goods coming from China, he had relations with every world leader and even if they disagreed, they respected each other, and everybody knew, don't fu\*\* with USA on topics that are important to USA, and on everything else, we can negotiate and compromise. 

He knew how to negotiate, my feeling is that world was safe place. Even if that negotiations were bad, there were negotiations, today we don't have that. 

Tucker went to interview Putin, and some policymakers said (i can't remember name) that ""We should stop Tucker coming back to USA"". It's not a problem that they said that, they have a right to say that, the problem is they can influence other politicians to actually stop Tucker coming back to USA, and the guy isn't even on Putin side, he is doing a job that ambassador should do, you see what i am talking about? I don't think that Tucker wouldn't be allowed to comeback to USA but there is small probability to escalate thing to a degree that Tucker can't comeback to USA.    


I want to state one more thing, i am pro Trump, but not because i think that he is better president, but because i think that he is more capable of handling foreign policy than Joe Biden. I am speaking only from a view of a citizen of another country that depends on actions of bigger countries, and has it's own fears.      


This is very difficult situation for every president, and also Americans have their own opinions, requests and etc, but it is a very dangerous and delicate situation.  

If you need more information from me, please ask me, don't assume my opinions.   


I am truly looking forward for arguments that will change my mind, especially because i am not citizen of USA. Cheers.

I believe this will be the best for energy, as you come back fresh for every 2 day block of work.

Not only will this help workers feel that work is an aspect of their life, and not a pullback from it - it will also make workers more productive during the hours they have, as they have more energy during those days of effort. Also, a weekend from 2 days of work can be spent more fully enjoying yourself and working on personal projects, since you aren't just mentally and physically recovering from the 4 days of consistent effort you just did. So in a way, you get more happy weekend and less recovery weekend

TL;DR: extra day off wednesday better than friday/monday better because you work in smaller bursts and dont have spend as much time recovering from the effort you just excerted"

This isn't about humor; it's about accountability and the lack thereof.

Sure, let's address the obvious: humor is subjective, but the impact of words is not. When someone says ""it's just a joke,"" they're essentially arguing that their intention to amuse somehow negates the impact of their words. That's a fallacious reasoning, specifically an appeal to motive. It suggests that if the intent wasn't serious, the outcome shouldn't be taken seriously either. This is nonsense. Intent doesn’t negate impact. A joke at someone's expense can cause real harm, regardless of the joker's intentions.

On top of that, this excuse is often a cowardly attempt to dodge responsibility. It's a way to say something offensive, inflammatory, or just plain stupid without having to own the consequences. If the response is negative, they retreat behind the facade of humor. But if the response is positive, they bask in the approval. This isn't only intellectually dishonest but also morally reprehensible.

You're not obliged to tolerate disrespect under the guise of humor. Don't let someone's ""joke"" diminish your right to be treated with basic human decency."

I don't think it's debatable that U.S. Universities are way more left than the average U.S. citizen or even the average university member internationally. Data from his think tank. Ratio of right-wing to left-wing students in U.S. universities:  
\- PhD: 10.8x  
\- Master: 7.9x  
\- Undergraduate: 9.2x  
\- 18-24 non-uni student: 3.2x  
Anecdotally most people would say that universities are substantially more leftist than the population, therefore, I'll accept this as a factual truth. Now try to understand why is that.

In recent months, I have become a reader of the Richard Hanania's Newsletter. I generally disagree with him in most stuff (I'm liberal, he's conservative), but I generally like his descriptions of how the world works, particularly with regards to universities.

Here's a brief summary by ChatGPT of [Why Everything is Liberal](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/why-is-everything-liberal):

>Hanania's argument delves into the phenomenon of ""Woke Capital"" and the apparent political leanings of major American institutions towards liberal positions, despite a near-even split in national political preference. He suggests that the difference in influence between conservatives and liberals isn't due to the number of votes each side garners but rather the level of engagement and intensity (cardinal utility) with which liberals pursue their political objectives. Liberals, he argues, are more likely to donate, protest, and engage in other forms of political activism, thereby exerting a disproportionate influence on institutions outside of election cycles. This engagement results in institutions and professional fields appearing to lean left, reflecting the preferences of the more politically active liberal minority rather than the electoral parity between conservative and liberal voters. Hanania explores various facets of this dynamic, including donor patterns, protest participation, and ideological representation in academia and the media, to illustrate why institutions might align with liberal preferences despite a divided electorate.

A second explanation of his generally comes from the excellent text [Liberals read, conservatives watcH TV](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/liberals-read-conservatives-watch). Again from ChatGPT:

>Richard Hanania's post explores the ideological divide between conservatives and liberals in American politics, attributing the effectiveness and dominance of liberal agendas to the intellectual and written-word culture within liberal circles, contrasted with the more visceral, television-based culture of conservatives. He argues that liberals, driven by a deeper engagement with ideas and a willingness to push boundaries, influence institutions and policy more effectively than conservatives, who focus more on tribal loyalty and personality-driven politics. This dynamic allows liberals to shape public opinion and policy over time, even if it costs them short-term electoral success, while conservatives struggle to make lasting ideological impacts despite occasional electoral victories. Hanania suggests that this difference in approach explains why liberal positions tend to advance in society and institutions, despite a roughly even political divide in the electorate.

In recent podcast episodes, Hanania has radicalized his position even more and he thinks that most smart people are liberal and he is very concerned with the ability of Republicans to fill positions in future administrations given the brain drain they are suffering since 2016.

Therefore, a possible two-pronged explanation of why U.S. universities are so leftist is:

1. Most smart people tend to be liberal, and universities are populated with smart people
2. University isn't the best paying job, so you tend to attract people that are motivated by ideas and prestige rather than money. E.g.: You attract the optimist kid who will make a PhD in economics to help make the world better rather than going to work in Wall Street.

**Obviously, this is one explanation, and you aren't bound by Hanania's or anyone else's view of the world. You can try changing my mind by suggesting a third model to be the** ***main*** **one.**

My argument is that the opportunity cost for Americans to pursue PhDs is very high. The U.S. have much longer PhD timelines than most places in the world, some people graduating after 7 years. And if you're out of a top 30 university, exactly the ones we're, you can get better jobs on corporate America that often pay 3-5x more than you'd get from a stipend during PhD. Even after PhD, it isn't obvious you're set for life, you may need still a post-doc, so it's an almost a decade of below-average income.

But if you're a foreigner this works nice. 1- This is one of the best immigration path. 2- If you're Indian, Latino, Chinese, and so on, the stipend creates a better quality of life than you'd get on your home country. [According to the NSF, 56% of PhD students are foreign-born in the U.S.](https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/sei/one-pagers/Foreign-Born.pdf)

It is very hard to be conservative in the U.S. if you're foreign born, particularly if you're not a U.S. citizen! But PhD students and mostly later when they become professors and researchers, they have an outstanding ability to shape public discourse. And they use it! If now you're in the democrat big tent, you end up getting the other stuff from the liberal/leftist world-view. 

**A corollary is that Republicans would benefit a lot if they were to soft their instance on immigration of highly educated individuals. If F-2/J-2 visa were better for family members, you had easier paths to H1-Bs and green cards as a PhD student, and so on, they'd have much less of a key issue to join the democrat tent.** Obviously, I don't think they'd suddenly become conservative, lol, but maybe you get PhD lib to conservative proportion back to 5x, 4x, and unis would make a bit less opposition to republicans. You can too try to change my mind on this one."

That's a separate topic.

The Constitution has a ban on ""cruel and unusual"" punishment. But death-penalty advocates have taken this to such an extreme that they consider even the slightest discomfort or pain to be ""cruel and unusual."" If the lethal-injection chemicals cause discomfort in the vein, that's ""cruel and unusual."" If they cause chest discomfort or other discomfort, that's ""cruel and unusual."" When Alabama was using nitrogen to execute an inmate (which is literally one of the most humane methods possible,) they claimed it was cruel and unusual. etc. 

My interpretation of the Constitution is that ""cruel and unusual"" means some form of punishment that goes *exceptionally, intentionally, far beyond the norm*. So, for instance, if the state of Texas were to sentence a criminal to die by being fed alive into a wood chipper or roasted alive over a barbecue, that would be cruel and unusual. That would clearly be done for no purpose other than sadism. But normal methods of execution - such as lethal injection - fall perfectly well within ""acceptable parameters"" of an execution. There may be some discomfort involved (after all, this is a procedure meant to *kill* you) but as long as it's within *normal* parameters, it is permissible. Bear in mind that at the time that the Founders wrote the Constitution, death by hanging was a perfectly normal and acceptable form of execution - certainly a method considerably more painful than nitrogen.

In other words, I think the originalist intent is that ""normal"" executions are okay and a certain amount of pain and discomfort does **not** count as ""cruel and unusual.""

But death penalty opponents have taken their stance to such an extreme that any form of execution that isn't floating away on blissful clouds of serene peace and tranquility, without a care in the world, is considered to be ""cruel and unusual.""

Finally, if the suffering is the objection, death-penalty opponents are missing out on the main point of the matter anyway: A big part of the suffering involved in the death penalty is the mental suspense, waiting and anticipation of all that time on death row. Making the execution as discomfort-free as possible still doesn't solve that problem - the knowledge you're going to die.

The liberal anti-Zionist scholars in Israel/the United States, the ones who confuse self flagellation with a moral virtue,  sell an image of a, ashkenazi (white) European Jew who, drunk on religious extremism that looks suspiciously like white supremacy from America, takes land from innocent Palestinians because they’re arabs. 

But the moral bankruptcy of these lies becomes clear when you really start digging. As a non Jewish American, Israelis can imagine my surprise to learn about the mahapakh and Mizrahim shift from the secular Left to the Religious Right. You can imagine my surprise to hear that Likud, the party I’ve been told is the far right extremist analogue to America’s GOP, has a strong political base amongst deeply religious Mizrahim.

There’s no discussion of that at all in the media. No discussion of the different views Arab Palestinians and Arab Jews toward settlements. Just a binary of the white oppressor and the brown oppressed."

It's at a point that it's even hard to imagine(a scenario) seeing a bunch of white girls chasing black boybands around because that rarely have happened/happens. It's not hard to imagine a melting pot of girls from different backgrounds chasing white boybands around because that have happened over the many years of existence.

Religious people live their lives the way they do because they believe that a higher power is the ultimate authority on what good/evil. If there truly is a being that created us and gave us a set of rules to live by it’d make sense that breaking those rules would be considered immoral because it’d be going against concrete “law” set by something/someone more knowledgeable than human beings. 

Now let’s assume the opposite is true and that there is no God? Who/what is the arbiter of morality? Even if we agreed on the things are good/bad our reasons would all differ. For example, I think killing is wrong because I have no interest in doing something that physically harms another human being. Other people might think it’s wrong simply because they don’t want to go to prison for it. Some people might find it wrong in some circumstances but not others. Some find no issue with killing other people at all. 

If there is no God how can morality be anything more than our own subjective opinions/biases?"

Sure, maybe. But that's the world we live in. We're able to communicate with people we don't know now more than ever, and when that happens, people will say things that others disagree with.

And when people disagree, they can either have a nice, civil discussion about it where they both share their views in a non-confrontational way, or we can get what mostly happens in any online discussion.

Traditional social media is a nightmare for this-- there's a reason Twitter is stereotyped as a bunch of people cursing each other out in 280 characters or less because they disagree.

Reddit *would* be the next best bet, since there are subs for pretty much everything, *including unpopular or controversial takes*, but even those places end up becoming hostile.

And yes, this is all from my own perspective. Yes, people have different levels of tolerance for passive aggressiveness from others, and mine is admittedly not very high. I don't like being downvoted for simply sharing my opinion, nor do I like being talked down to or trolled for the same reason.

And yes, that's my problem and no one else's, but I would love, for once, to be able to share opinions and not get attacked and/or downvoted for it."

It will most likely be said that we shouldn’t allow presidents to serve more than two terms but frankly I don’t see why. It’s an artificial barrier that prevents the best qualified and most popular candidate from running. The one time we had a president serve more than twice was FDR, and he’s gone down as one of our greatest presidents.

Obama is more qualified than either Trump or Biden, more competent than either, more popular than either, and decades younger. He’s more globally respected and has a better track record in virtually every way. He is a categorically superior candidate and most likely the best person for the job right now."

My current “main source of income” consists of looking at extremely wide angle lenses, and sex acts.

Which is what the majority of this movie is.

This movie, to me, is just my everyday job with a bigger budget and you kind of tell all departments to do whatever the fuck they want.

I guess I’ll question what I always question while working… is the script I’ve been provided with worth the effort of making something good? or just winging it.

I'm 5'7. Yes, I am short for a guy. But I've literally had women on dating apps tell me I'm short, as if I didn't know. My ex's best friend asked me 3 times in a night (while drinking), ""how tall are you again?"" In my opinion, that's offensive.

Listen. If my friend drunkenly came up and asked my girlfriend ""how much do you weigh?"" even once, I would say something. Because the question in and of itself is degrading.

Liberals like conservatives believe in private ownership of corporations, private ownership of the means of production, and private ownership of land. 

Liberals like conservatives believe in not just market based, but market driven economies

In Europe and Australia liberals are synonymous with free market conservatives/libertarians 

>Over time, the meaning of liberalism began to diverge in different parts of the world. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica: ""In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and laissez-faire economic policies.""[29] Consequently, the ideas of individualism and laissez-faire economics previously associated with classical liberalism are key components of modern American conservatism

So conservatism and liberalism would have a lot of overlap. This is especially representative with neoliberalism. 

Neoliberalism would have a huge wave in the 1980's brought on by American republican Ronald Reagan, British conservative Margaret Thatcher, and other conservative parties throughout the world including the Canadian conservative party, the Australian liberal party, and more. But it is important to note they are all right wing parties. 

Don't get me wrong, liberalism has some things it shares with socialism 

Liberalism and socialism both believe in a secular state and freedom of religion

Both liberalism and socialism share a focus on human and civil rights 

However I'm reluctant to call liberalism a left wing ideology because it lacks many things other left wing ideologies have in common like social ownership. There's multiple different types of social ownership, but liberalism doesn't offer any of them. 

Union strengthening, union support are hallmarks of socialism, yet liberal parties give unions the bare minimum. The countries with strong unions have them because of democratic socialist parties that strengthened them. 

There's no redistribution of wealth under liberalism. 

Under liberalism, public infrastructure and public health still gets minimal spending, and private companies are still invited in all the time to increase costs by asking for profit on top of cost of materials and labour, which either means the government pays more or the labourers get paid less, but usually it's a bit of both. This happens in public healthcare and public infrastructure construction. 

(When I say socialism, I don't mean communist, or anarchist and when I say conservative I don't mean fascist, monarchists, or anarcho-capatilists.)

And socialism, liberalism, and conservatism also all share ideologies as well.  they all believe in a state governed by a citizen elected body. They all believe in the rule of law. They all believe 

But overall I would have to say Liberalism is not a very left wing ideology at all, and amounts to something near moderate centrism."

Also, using logic to choose a side in a worldwide issue or debate can help you choose what you truly believe in. If you were to put in your opinion on world hunger, the basic and obvious response would be, ""I want to help those whose struggling with hunger and hope to make a difference in this issue."" This is what your guts tell you is right, but when you use your own head, you can push out what you truly believe in.

This, furthermore, will give your response a more original and creative look on the outside and make you feel good that you put in what you believe in on the inside.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter  
  
  
  
We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.  
  
  
  
Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:  
  
  
  
I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.  
  
If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.  
  
Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.  
  
Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.  
  
If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.  
  
  
  
We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable  
  
  
  
If you think there are higher priority policy goals for the American Left, what are they and why?"

I see people bring up the idea that literary fiction has complex themes and characters. But why can't so called ""popular fiction"" not have that too? In fact, when I read, I read for the purpose of enjoying deep, complex plot, characters, and story. I just don't understand the appeal of complex writing that is flowery and obfuscates the actual story. 

Some people say they like the challenge of complex prose. Which is fine I suppose, I just don't see how that's better than my preference of getting straight to the characters and plot.

1,2024-02-08,cmv: the Kailasa temple and the golden temple are better representations of India than the Taj Mahal,u/SleekSilver22,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aloj7e/cmv_the_kailasa_temple_and_the_golden_temple_are/,changemyview,"I’m sure you all know that the Taj Mahal is commonly used to represent India, it’s one of the most popular tourist destinations and whenever India is mentioned in movies or books or on presentations, there’s always a picture of the Taj Mahal to accompany it, however the kailasa temple and the golden temple are both better representations of India than the Taj Mahal.

If you don’t know what the kailasa temple is I suggest you look it up, it’s very impressive. The golden temple is basically the Kaaba of Sikhs, it’s the holiest place in Sikhism 

First of the kailasa is more impressive, it’s the largest monolithic structure in the world and was cut from top to bottom out of a single piece of rock in a cave, much more impressive than how the Taj Mahal was built 

Second of all kailasa temple and golden temple are older, built in 773 and 1589, vs the Taj Mahal which was built in 1632, so both have more history in India than the Taj Mahal 

And finally, they both represent Indian culture better than the Taj Mahal. India is known for its for being one of the few polytheistic countries left and for its beautiful temples, so why is the symbol of India a piece of Islamic architecture from an empire known for destroying temples? Kailasha is one of the most beautiful temples in India and actually represents Indias culture and polytheistic traditions. And the golden temple is the holiest place in Indias first indigenous monotheistic religion. Sure India has other monotheistic religions like Cochin Judaism and st Thomas Christianity as well as zoroastrianism, but they all originated somewhere else and came here and absorbed culture from India. Sikhism was the first indigenous Indian monotheistic religion so the golden temple is a very significant Indian temple, and it represents India better than the Taj Mahal 

Also the Taj Mahal is just a really bad representation of India, as it is a building made by Muslims, for a muslim(the kings wife), and it’s made in Islamic architecture so it’s going to connect with Muslims more than your average Indian because being made in Islamic architectural style, it’s more part of Muslim heritage than Indian heritage. Being a work of Islamic art, your average Muslim from the Middle East would probably feel a stronger connection to it than your average Indian, who is probably Hindu, Sikh, or Buddhist(for me personally I am Hindu and I feel no connection to the Taj Mahal either). 

Also like I said earlier India is know for beautiful temples and also for diversity of religion and cultures, and Muslim empires(especially the Mughal empire)in India have been known for destroying temples and trying to ethnically cleanse India of non muslims so why is the symbol of a diverse country with many beautiful temples a building built by the people who constantly try to get rid of that diversity and destroy temples?

Although the Taj Mahal is beautiful, it does not represent India as well as the kailasa temple or the golden temple, which both have a closer connection to Indian culture than the Taj Mahal and the Indian government should work to promote both the kailasa temple and the golden temple to be as popular as the Taj Mahal."

children are not sexual and do not understand sex

two:

children cannot consent because they dont understand the implications of sex

now for the first one.

children are not sexual? really? maybe if youre 5, but puberty can happen as early as 9 years old and typically happens around 11 or 12. the best orgasms i ever had were my first ones at about 12 years old. i was masturbating every single day and thinking about tits and pussy. i have no doubt i would have fucked a grown woman if i had the chance. but thats not being sexual? i think people are uncomfortable with children being sexual early, but thats just reality. every boy that i knew at my school started masturbating at around the same age as me. also, sex is not rocket science. i understood it at like 5 or 6 when my mom made me read a book about it. penis goes into vagina. sperm comes out of penis. woman gets pregnant. baby comes out of women. if children can understand algebra, they can understand sex.

now for the second one. so people say, even if a child clearly tells you they want to suck your dick, or they want you to fuck them, that doesnt count as consent because they dont understand the implications of that. and thats it. thats the whole argument. well what the hell are the implications of sex? the only ones i've ever heard and pregnancy and stds. both of which are really not complex at all. childrens are not morons, if you simply tell them how pregnancy and stds work, they will understand. 

the only argument i see being good is power dynamics, but tell me why im wrong about the other 2"

A crime against Ukrainian statehood that the Russians have committed not since 2022, but since 2014, when their puppet president, Viktor Yanukovych, was rightfully removed from office. 

I am curious to see who can claim otherwise. It's like saying somehow that the State of Alaska belongs to the Russian ""Federation"" (let's be real, they're pretty much a dictatorial empire in all but name). A ludicrous claim also perpetrated by the Russian state. "

1: ABA Is like dog training but for autistic people (mostly children). It is all about obedience and compliance. If the child does something that the therapist likes, they get a reward. If the child does something the therapist doesn't like, they get a punishment or as they call it, a ""negative reinforcement). I know that a lot of ABA centres these days don't use negative reinforcement but with positive inforcements, they are manipulating the child or the client to do what the therapist wants them to do.

2: In a lot of these places, food is used as a reward so food will be withheld from the child until the child does what the therapist wants them to do. You don't ever withhold food from a child, ever.

3: In a lot of these places, non-harmful stims are supressed and the child is forced or manipulated into making eye contact with the therapist. This teaches masking which can lead to mental health issues which can lead to a lot of horrible things (such as suicide). The suicide rate for autistic people is much higher than for people who are not autistic. I know making eye contact is what you are ""supposed"" to do but if a person forces themselves to make eye contact to the point where they have mental health issues/burnout. It is a problem. 

4: ABA teaches their clients that their feelings/boundaries don't matter. If the child needs a break, give them a break. Respect that. If they are overwhelmed and need a break, give them a break. If they don't like loud noises/touch, respect that

A lot of people say that it's different now. But ask yourself. Is your child forced to surpress their stims or make eye contact? Are they being punished or manipulated into compliance? Is food withheld from them? Are their boundaries being respected?

I know things changes with time, but how much has ABA really changed?"

Therefore, perfectly appropriate posts that counter consensus thought often get buried. 

This encourages healthy debates to be judged upon the number of people who vote one way or another rather than letting individuals truly decide for themselves. Of course most people want to feel like they agree with the thought that is ‘quantifiably correct’ when they read through a debate. Therefore, many people don’t truly think for themselves, and instead just vote along with what others already have.

It encourages perfectly polite posts to be made invisible just because they counter conventional thought. Therefore it encourages a mob mentality of thought rather than critical engagement with one’s own assumptions, and society’s assumptions. Therefore, the downvote feature should be totally revamped.

I think it is fine to have another partner before that process is completely finished. For me, a romantic relationship is one of the nicer things in life, so I don't really want to miss out on that for a long time. It will boost my mood, make my life more enjoyable and possibly even help me get over the ex partner.

You should still work through your emotions, but that is entirely possible while meeting someone else. The new relationship will probably start slowly anyway, so you will have enough capacity to work through whatever is left to work through. Besides, having some emotional issues is just part of life, as far as I can tell. So why is this particular issue seen as a no-go for starting a relationship and others are not?

Of course, you should not lie about being emotionally available if you are not, or make promises that you cannot keep. But if you are open about your situation and both are fine with it, what's the harm?

I should say that I personally do need some time alone after a breakup, about one or two months. But I see no harm in someone else taking less time, if they feel like it."

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish, that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state. Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease."

Some of these are:

* FPTP at a constituency level means non-proportional results at a national level. In extreme cases, the party that comes second in national vote share can will a majority of seats (see also: US Presidential elections). 
* Small parties have no chance of fair representation, which means people are discouraged from voting first preference, if they prefer a small party. 
* Various technical points around social utility and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem.

My view for discussion is that approval voting -- that is, vote for as many candidates as you like -- would be the quickest and simplest way to improve this. This is because:

* It's easy to understand. ""Vote for as many candidates as you like.""
* It's easy to count. Whoever gets the most votes, wins. 
* It takes away the risk of voting third party. You can simply vote for the third party AND for whichever you prefer of the main two. 
* It removes the need to rank (implicitly or explicitly) candidates.

I have progressive parents, I grew up watching movies like A League Of Their Own, Mulan, Aliens, etc

It's never made sense to me think of women as inherently inferior in anything. It's clear to me that women can do just about anything they want to do, and usually the *only* thing stopping them is sexism from men, not anything inherent about womanhood.

But I do keep wondering if the word feminist/feminism is doing more harm than good. For example, consider the word ""racist.""

There's racists, and then there's everyone else. There's no word that means ""not a racist"" because that's the *norm.* It's how you're supposed to be. There's racists, and then there's normal people. That's it. We need a term for racists because they're strayed outside the norm.

Shouldn't it be the same for sexist? Right now, if you're not a sexist, it seems you have to declare feminism. As if the world is separated into sexists and feminists.

But the problem is that gives sexists a target. Now they can use language to make it seem like there is a culture war, or that both sides have some sort of equal legitimacy. Just look at how many times you can find people speaking out against perceived ""radical feminism"" or ""feminazis.""

Thing is, it's a lot harder to criticize people who are simply fighting against sexism. But if they're fighting *for feminism*, then people can twist their motives and lie to the gullible that they're trying to promote women to be above the status of men.

It's like, fighting against sexism is fighting for equality, but it's too easy for sexists lacking self-awareness to perceive fighting for feminism as just fighting for women, at the expense of men.

It's similar to how right-wingers had to start campaigning against ""woke."" As far as I can tell, ""woke"" just means tolerance. You can't gain public support if you're fighting against tolerance, but if ""woke"" is just some nebulous thing that left-wingers do, you can proudly declare yourself ""anti-woke"" and gain support from small-minded people who just aren't noticing that what you're really fighting for is anti-tolerance.

I think the same thing has been happening with feminism. It's a lot easier to fight against feminism than it is to fight *for sexism* which is what the sexists are actually doing, by using propaganda to make people view feminism as something radical and, ironically, sexist. 

Which has never been the objective of feminism, aka trying to dismantle sexism.

Does any of this make sense? Should it just be sexism versus normal people, or are there benefits to creating the feminism label?"

Is it a moral failing on my part to not have that, even if it’s due to child abuse/ just naturally being a more introverted, quiet person? I think I am still a personable, kind, interesting person despite this. The thing is that none of that matters because I lack “confidence”, while someone who treats others badly, objectifies women, or is just generally kinda insufferable, will always have priority over someone like me. Why are all of their negative traits excused by one good trait, while all my positive traits are pushed under because of one negative?

Low testosterone can lead to more oestrogen based emotions, mental health problems, lack of masculinity feeling and so on, testosterone is well known as the male hormone and you can sense a high testosterone male a mile off.

Recently, I have looked into getting back into the game, but the game has radically changed. Link and pendulum monsters and all the new rules about the game have made the it much less fun. It seems the strategy is to just mill until you win within 5 rounds. 

Even though synchros and XZs could pack a punch, it wasn't over within 5 rounds unless you or your opponent could not defend or draw anything useful. With the functionally unlimited summoning power from link and pendulum monsters as well as the newer format and broken ability chains, it takes what used to be a fun game into a 10 minute wait time while your opponent runs through half his/her deck.

It really bums me out. What used to be a great time hanging with friends and chit chatting while your opponent swapped comments about your decks and life and such has now turned into a silent speedrun of the trading card game.

The American left loves to see people who don’t share their views die off or go through immense suffering. Only view social media to see what I mean, everyone says things like “rest in piss” and other cruel things when people who are even slightly to the right pass away. I’ve never seen the right do anything like that except the underage children who think that being an edgy asshole is cute. But full grown adults on the left behave this way. Even so recently as Toby Keith I’ve seen people say that it’s a win for Black Lives Matter. That does not garner support for your cause, it makes me further away from it and reform my stance that both the left and right are wolves in sheep’s clothing. Sure the right isn’t much better, but the left openly shares their horrible hatred for opposing ideas"

You can get decent grades for mathematics if you just practice enough, but for languages, it is impossible to get good grades by just practicing. It entirely depends on which questions you get for exams, and practicing will not do much because the questions will always be hard to answer.

The idea (especially in its modern form) is that, since the ultimate truth about God is (allegedly) unknowable, everyone should be free to believe and worship a God, or many gods, or no gods, in whatever manner he so chooses, alone or with others, so long as the ""law is respected"" / the ""tenets that make up our society aren't infringed""

The question is though...where do **those** tenets come from?

- If a country is to have laws, the laws must ultimately be based on some sort of morality or moral system. ""Government neutrality"" on morality is a myth that has never existed in practice. If we're going to have any form of government, much less self-government, it requires the people and their leaders to have some conception about what is right, and what is wrong, and to have a desire to do good and avoid evil. Few speak in these terms today but this has never ceased being true

- Now, all systems of morality can only exist on faith. There is no moral system which can be ""scientifically proven"" or ""backed up with studies,"" as the secularists like everything to be. Science may be able to show you why stealing from somebody makes them sad and lowers their utility; it cannot show you why it is ""wrong"" to do it anyways, valuing your own utility more.

- Utilitarian Secularists and liberals may object that ""morality"" in this classical sense is fake, but we can still discern some knowledge about how we ought to be governed from the light of human reason alone, without any faith. For example, they may appeal to game-theory principles and say that we shouldn't ban murder because it's ""wrong"" - we should ban it because it creates better incentives for our expected utility to go up, or something. Average expected life happiness goes up in a society where murderers are punished than a society where they are not. But this itself relies on unprovable tenets that it takes on faith - namely, that ""utility maximization"" is the ultimate goal and that it should be measured based on the ""average expected result"" for someone in your society, and not, say, one's own utility at the expense of everyone else. These aren't provable dogmas - Utilitarians ""have faith"" in them without any proof.

- Therefore, some sort of ""unifying moral code"" is needed to have any sort of a society - a moral code that can not be proven, one taken on faith. I don't see how it matters whether or not a deity is invoked in the moral code or not - this means that every state has a mandatory public religion. 

- Many who laugh at religion and who espouse ""freedom of religion"" cling to unprovable (and often absurd) dogmas more closely than any religious zealot, and they don't generally have any qualms about saying that their dogmas ought to govern public life, and that dissent from them (in action, even if they may be willing to tolerate dissenting speech) should be forbidden

- Such ""dogmas"" of the modern American/UN/Western public religion are: Equality is good, discrimination is bad, national borders are these super-sacred things that it's super evil to trample and invade, animals have ""rights,"" free speech is good, people have ""bodily autonomy,"" ""consent"" is the ultimate standard when it comes to sexual morality, cruel and unusual punishment is ""bad"", Democracy is the best method of government and there's a ""right"" to vote, etc.

- There is 0 ""proof"" for any of these things. These are dogmas of a religion

- One may object that this regime doesn't constitute a ""state religion"" for America because America tolerates the practices of other religions, so long as they don't contradict the state religion. But this is nothing new. Most religions allow for a variety in ways of practicing them as long as the dogmas aren't violated. 

Every society is going to worship something, whether it's God or a bunch of ideas cooked up in the heads of enlightenment thinkers and freemasons and animal-rights people. 

The sooner we stop playing make-believe that the current moral regime that governs America is some sort of ""objective"" truth, whereas religions are mere unprovable tales, the better.

1,2024-02-08,CMV: It is easier to argue against religion than it is to argue in favor of it,u/DaleGribble2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1am6xdz/cmv_it_is_easier_to_argue_against_religion_than/,changemyview,"For context I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints otherwise known as the Mormon

Because society as a whole is starting to get lex in its practicing of religion or is eschewing it all together, anyone trying to advocate for any kind of religion is having a harder time with convincing people to join their faith or for members to stay in it who are thinking of leaving.

One issue is that because there is the assumption made by many believers of a certain religion that it is the perfect religion and the only way to gain enlightenment/salvation and that their God/gods are perfect. If any flaw is to be found in the leadership of the church, their actions, doctrines and policies, then the whole arguments of the religious crumble because “if your religion is supposed to be perfect, then what about…” This can happen by bringing up controversial events that happened in the past such as The Church Of Jesus Christ not allowing African members to hold the priesthood until the 1970’s or more current scandals and events like stories about recent sexual abuse by members of church leadership.

Also, religion often advocates for abstaining from or restraining oneself from the many pleasures you can partake in as a human such  sex, drugs, alcohol and so on. These things can be addicting, and it’s hard for people to restrain or abstain themselves from addicting substances or practices. 

It’s easier and more pleasurable in the moment to have sex with whoever you want whenever you want, do drugs, drink alcohol and watch porn than it is to adhere to strict religious guidelines that restrict or completely forbid those sorts of things or activities.

People can say “I don’t need a religion to live a good life, I’ll just do stuff in moderation”

People nowadays hate being told what to do by religion but seem to be ok if it’s by the government, social media or celebrities

It’s also easier for people to lounge around at home or participate in their favorite leisure activities than it is for them to regularly attend religious worship services.

There are also a lot of misconceptions or stereotypes about religion in general or specific religions that may prevent people from joining religion or a specific religion, where those stereotypes or info they know about the religion is true or not.

I could go on but those seem to be the main reasons why it’s hard to convert people to religion or keep them within a religion"

I have always thought that GNR should be placed in that narrative as well.

A bias formed, as they didn't really come from a small record label. They weren't really an extension of the college radio world.

They looked Sunset Strip, but music fans would know they were a tad different.

They weren't cosplaying as pretty boys. They really did live the authentic life that matched their personas.

They certainly weren't Bob Jovi or Warrant.

And their influences were not only hard rock, but they had punk rock credentials.... and a love of the Beatles, Prince... etc.

You can see that reflected in the music they wrote and played. It was just different.

Again, I feel like they were an alternative rock group. 

I can't put my finger on any other groups they were copying.

There was a bias that they didn't quite have the sensitivies of an R.E.M. or U2. 

They achieve mainstream success. And like Nirvana, their brand of music made all the other hair bands look like idiot novelties.

The tastemaker hipster UK class loved them. They were often on the cover of NME."

At a point in the game King Shark dons the Green Lantern ring and immediately uses it to great, but uncontrolled effect. The team is forced to remove the ring from Sharks finger as he is unable to control it and it threatens to harm them. All in all, It’s a great scene immediately coming off the back of the player beating a boss. 

The discourse surrounding this scene has a vocal element complaining that the scene broke canon as that isn’t how the lantern ring canonically works…and this is where I take issue. 

The scene was narratively effective, and a great little award for the players having just defeated the Green Lantern. Had canon been followed we would have been denied that great scene.

We’ve tried. Look at the NYC public school system. We’ve shoveled dump trucks worth of money into their pockets and, while seeing some *marginal* improvements among some elements of the student body, have gotten nothing for it beyond more debt. America can’t wipe our asses for us, it’s not our mommy/daddy and we need to take responsibility for our lives and the lives of our children. And that means buckling down and making sure your kid is studying, doing their homework, **going to class** and in general giving two shits about their academic performance. No amount of money from the nanny state can fix that. Unfortunately, this problem is so deep and widely rooted I don’t know how the government *can* fix it.

In addition, the racial climate in America right now is just not conducive to discussions on a child’s poor performance. 69% of urban public schoolteachers in the United States are white. Using the New York state example, [https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/12/10/americas-public-school-teachers-are-far-less-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-than-their-students/ft_21-11-17_studentteacherrace_3/] (black and latino students are more then 40% more likely to have a white public-school teacher then one more congruent to their skin color (though how this takes into effect mixed race schoolteachers and mixed-race students I have no clue.). To be clear, I’d rather slam my hand in a door then get between *any* parent and their child. But it gets even harder when you’re a blonde, white woman telling a black parent/parents “hey x kid is a real shithead in class and doesn’t work hard, study, or in general attend.” without immediately losing the parents or at the very least, raising severely their hackles.

Parents are already extremely defensive about their children and then if you add the ugly history of race relations in America on top of it? Not a conducive environment for early interventions in troubled students lives. It’s the sad truth but you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. If the kid don’t care about reading, writing, or education in general you can’t force them to care. It has to come from the parent or guardian. And even then some people are happy to do the bare minimum required until they become magically rich via lotto ticket or until they die and when they have kids they pass the same values onto them, not explicitly obviously but via example."

First basically every ""victim"" has turned out to be a complete Charlatan

You can't just separate Epstein from his Jewish identity, even if some of what he did was despicable his loyalty to our people shaped a lot of his decisions outside of his sex crimes.  
Also he spared Jewish children from his wrath, a small courtesy but still.

Are us as Jews in a position where we can afford to care more about goy children then our own power and by extension our own survival ?

Allen Dershowitz has come to bat for him and he is a legend when it comes to law and fighting antisemitism 

&#x200B;

I hope you can see it from our perspective that he did do so much for our people and our community, we are at war with the goyim threatening to exterminate us  
Should we be concerned about their lives when they don't care about ours ?  
Should we disown our own because they hurt them ?  
Would they do the same ?  
I admit that I don't know what the answer is, this has always been a problem with existing as a Jew, sometimes we are forced to turn a blind eye to things we don't personally think are right because we don't have a lot of fat to trim, if we hand over our wrongdoers to the goyim will they be happy with that or will they take that taste of Jewish blood and go after our innocents ?

We suspect the narrative around Epstein to have lies 

we know it is wrong because it fits into the antisemitic blood libel narratives that have been used to persecute Jews since the dawn of time.  
I am not defending Epstein but I do feel like he gets more hate then a goy in his position would, a lot of gentiles are jealous of the wealth and influence he had and how he used that to help the Jewish community. They were looking for an excuse to hate him and to turn that hatred against all Jews.  
I knew of some rich Europeans who would fly to Algeria and Libya to abuse and dominate the women there under false pretenses of taking them back to Europe.  
I bet these goyim wish they could rape little Jewish girls, of course they never do because one they are cowards and two they are to poor to get away with it.

I am not saying he was good, I just think that antisemitic people are using this to spread a narrative that Jews are an oppressor class who hates them  
They do what they always do, take a small seed of truth and grow a tree of lies. Yes Epstein was bad that is a seed of truth, another seed of truth is that yes compared to most goyim Jews are very rich and most white goyim are poor, but like who's fault is that ? It's their fault.

Also he was one of us, that is unfortunate that we can't have better advocates but you can't always pick your allies. Jews of the past were able to work with Poles to fight Jewish oppression, Poles are some of the most barbaric animals on this planet.  
If Hypothetically there was a White goyim would was as rich and powerful as Epstein (hard to imagine I know but let's pretend here) who raped little Jewish girls, do you think the majority of goyim would come out to condemn him ? Not hey would not  
that is the terms the goyim set, we just need to worry about surviving.  
Are we in a position where we can thrown our own to the wolves to appease goyim ?  
Especially someone who was a huge power player in our communities ?  
Also I ask again  
If Hypothetically there was a White goyim would was as rich and powerful as Epsten (hard to imagine I know but let's pretend here) who raped little Jewish girls, do you think the majority of goyim would come out to condemn him ? Not hey would not.

I care about my people having a future on this earth, we might have to make some tough decisions if we follow the goyim's laws then we will be their slaves.  
That will be bad for all of humanity because they need us more then we need them, what have goyim ever created that was worthwhile ? All the most important science and art was made by Jews. Frit'z Haber's discovery is the only reason they don't starve to death.

  
Also they project a lot. A lot of gentile men lust after our women and it's not even arguable. I had this one rich white boy (one of the very few) and he was going so hard after my little sister, so much love bombing and taking her on trips to Europe. He almost got her to convert to catholicism but luckily we managed to get him to go away and talked some sense into her.  


Things are complicated, There are a lot of Jews who have done bad things obviously, but I feel like they always had a somewhat justifiable reason for doing what they did, meanwhile the evil goyim have no excuse, like the Painter man, what excuse could you make for what he did ? Ferdinand back in Spain, there is no excuse for this  
We were talking about Epstein right, Obviously I do not condone everything Epstein did, but he had a somewhat justifiable motivation from the outset, the desire to build wealth and by extension power to protect his people from facing another witchunt  
Also at some point it always comes down to us vs them, I do wish it didn't have to be this way but it does, I see some Jews try to say that we haven't done a good enough job being open and tolerant with gentiles but I don't think that is true. They just don't care and won't settle for less then our total destruction.

Moreover, based on the many internal criticisms that have been voiced by US officials within the State Department and foreign policy establishment as well the current President’s own words in recent days, it is increasingly becoming clear that the *façade* of Israeli actions in Gaza and the West Bank being “justifiable” or “legitimate” is becoming demonstrably more difficult to uphold as the indiscriminate violence continues on a daily basis. 

Even as this inkling of criticism and frustration has begun to reach the public eye through reporting and public statements, official U.S. diplomatic, military, economic, and political support remain firmly entrenched on siding with Israel. 

Increasingly (especially in Yemen currently, but also with the current strikes in Iraq and Syria) the US appears more than willing to allow this conflict to boil over into an entire region-wide proxy conflict if it means that U.S. influence and power in the Middle East region can be maintained while minimizing and pushing back against the growing influence of Iran. 

The facts and evidence are abundantly clear, Israel is willingly targeting civilians, civilian infrastructure, and deliberately cutting access to food, drinkable water, medicine, and fuel. The Israeli government is openly committing an ethnic cleansing campaign in Gaza, within government ministers and politicians now advocating for the establishment of Israeli “settlements” (read: colonies) in the Gaza Strip after the war has concluded. 

The U.S. Government and our leaders completely understand that this is happening, yet they are willing to continue supporting this travesty so long as America can remain the dominant power in the region, and they view Israel as the keystone that holds up U.S. hegemony in the Middle East."

For a generation not used to regular wars, seeing ruined cities in Gaza and Ukraine seems like a crime against humanity, a once in a generation atrocity. 

But it really isn’t. Russia launching a war of aggression is not a war crime. Every war has an aggressor. Until the late 20th century, countries constantly fought wars between each other over what they claimed was their rightful ethnic land. And unfortunately, war is destructive.

 Cities get ruined, civilian infrastructure is crippled. This is an inevitable reality of war, not a war crime. What is happening in Gaza is exactly what you’d expect when a war is fought in a dense urban area. The allies did NOT beat Nazi Germany through ceasefires and agreements. They beat Nazi Germany by bombing it to hell and back and forcing an unconditional surrender. And Nazi Germany was far less densely populated than Hamas controlled Gaza, so obviously there will be a civilian death toll proportional to population density. Genocidal regimes whose ideology clearly dictates a fight to the death before any negotiations simply cannot be conquered by any other means than total war. And a war to conquer a neighboring country, however unjust it may be, is NOT a war crime and never historically has been. 

Instances of war crimes within these wars are a whole other topic. I am not denying that war crimes occur within wars. I am simply arguing that war in and of itself is lawful. It is not a war crime to fight a war. Maybe one day humanity will advance past our need to fight each other to the death, but we’re clearly not at that point yet."

I honestly just see being upset “/s” as being entitled and elitist regarding humor/communication. If someone is wanting to be understood in what they’re trying to convey, why is that upsetting? It’s like gatekeeping humor or communication or something? I really don’t understand it, and I’m just trying to make sense of it. Why do so many people care so much about something so unimportant or interesting? And with so much passion and dedication to hating the one specific tone tag. People have made spam bots regarding this.

Some people use the argument that autistic people shouldn’t be viewed as “disabled and helpless,” (yes someone actually said this.) But disabled people are DISABLED. Yes, they have “deficits,” or whatever you’d like to call it, but that doesn’t change anything about being a person? Being “helpless” should not be looked down upon, and being disabled should not be looked down upon. Needing accommodations is not pathetic or bad. So why are people so upset that people use tone tags? 

Someone has also said they have been forced to use tone tags. I’ve never seen anyone being forced to use tone tags? I acknowledge that just because I haven’t experienced it doesn’t mean it never happens. But, I’m pretty well oriented in the neurodivergent community online, and have never seen any instances of this. It seems like some bs argument that I should probably just ignore, but it is one of them out there. 

I seek understanding by learning from opposing perspectives. I always want to expand my views and try my best not to be ignorant. I hope to learn from you all, and not argue. Thank you."

205,2024-02-08,CMV: It's okay for NFL fans to feel fatigued by Taylor Swift,u/daysofdre,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1amegzw/cmv_its_okay_for_nfl_fans_to_feel_fatigued_by/,changemyview,"Swifties, please don't murder me. I mean no disrespect to your queen.   


I don't believe a lot of the fatigue around Taylor Swift has to do with the person. After all, as a grown adult, she's entitled to enjoy a football game and cheer on her partner, like the rest of us.   


The fatigue that I, and many of us are feeling are not directed at Taylor Swift the person, but the cottage industry that's been promoted by the NFL around the brand of Taylor Swift - two separate entities. 

I'm not complaining about the 30 seconds of airtime they give Taylor every Chiefs game. We've seen attention given to celebrities at sports events since I can remember. 

Spike Lee is prominently featured at Knicks games. Those old enough to remember the infamous battle he had on the sidelines with Reggie Miller understand how sports and celebrity merge into a melting pot of entertainment.   


During the 2018-19 basketball playoffs, we witnessed Drake coaching a team from the sidelines, giving hi-fives and pep talks to members of the Toronto Raptors, and yelling at coach Nick Nurse to put players in rotation as they won their championship. 

I didn't have a problem with any of that then - I don't have a problem with it now. 

The issue, as I see it, is where these lines begin and end. 

Whereas with these previous examples, I was happy to partake in the pageantry that was those celebrity x sports moments, but I expected them to go no further than the end of the game. Maybe a spot or two on ESPN where replays are shown, and Drake highlights from these games. 

But ever since Taylor showed up to her first Chiefs game to support Travis Kelce, there has been an entire sub-industry built around that, that bleeds into unexpected parts of the sports ecosystem. 

Case-in-point, within an hour of the Chiefs beating the Ravens, I received an Apple news alert that there was a way that Taylor could make it to the Superbowl from her Eras tour in Japan. 

I tune into my favorite fantasy football program and watch a 62-year-old man wearing a Taylor Swift t-shirt, breaking out into a segment where he is schooling the younger members on set on how to be a better swifty. Things that would seem, as the kids put it, 'creepy' and 'awkward' are now mainstream. 

I tune into a sports caster's show and have to sit through a lecture stating that if I have any objections to Taylor Swift, I am a misogynist loser and I don't have any strong women around me.

As if Taylor needed a bunch of middle-aged guys to come to her rescue.

These types of arguments might have some merit if these sports pundits throwing judgment weren't gaining financially from their speech. If they didn't look at the numbers and realize that the industry around Taylor Swift is good for their bottom line. 

Unfortunately, this has done nothing but once again polarize the country - you're either a swifty, flags out riding high, or you're a cave-dwelling ogre that has no place in society. When in reality, most of us sane people that may feel fatigued are not objecting to Taylor the person - we're objecting to the consequences of the rampant exploitation of her name.

The same sports league that blackballed Colin Kaepernick for being too political - hurting their money - is now welcoming this cottage industry that to them, makes sense on paper. If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what is.

But don't take my word for it - Travis Kelce, who is as close to the situation as one can get, also says that [the NFL is overdoing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P32_Y7xKb-E) when it comes to Taylor's brand.

I have also had friends let a woman know they’re not interested in the purely because of their body fat %. They get ripped on by the girl and/ or her friends. It causes a big commotion.

On both sides it is still preference. Some people will say “oh you can workout to lose weight but can’t do anything other than surgery to get taller”.  

While either way it is derogatory to call someone short or call someone fat.

Women claim all the time that size doesn't matter and they claim body positivity. This phrase is classic body shaming by claiming someone is worse or of less value if they seem like they'd have a small dick. This also shows you that women do in fact prefer large ones and are disingenuous about size not mattering. Why are women disingenuous about the things that they want? Only God knows.

I recommend checking out the full audio or transcript for a thorough understanding.  
  
*Trump’s Argument: ""Claims Colorado wronged him by blocking his access to electors and asks the Supreme Court for intervention, regardless of his eligibility.""*  
  
*Original Plaintiff: ""Argues Colorado has the right to reject ineligible presidential candidates to protect its citizens' votes.""*  
  
*Colorado’s Response: ""Says they followed due process, leading to his ineligibility for the ballot.""*  
  
My main concern is the lack of representation for the American people, whom Trump suggests are ultimately causing him harm. It's perplexing to claim injury from not being considered for a public service role, especially when such a claim seems to bypass the core issue. The debate avoided this central point, focusing on side issues instead.  
  
I’m skeptical that a state’s electoral process can be seen as causing harm by not selecting someone for presidency. This seems off-topic. Trump’s impeachment is another issue, but it doesn’t directly address whether being excluded as a candidate constitutes legal harm.  
  
As a moderate conservative, I find the argument's logic elusive and wonder why there wasn't a more direct discussion. In fact, my central question is: **""Why was the solicitor general absent to argue the merits of the proceedings themselves and keep the arguments on topic and central to the core issue which is: Can the US electorate actually harm someone by refusing them access to electors in a vote for a civil servant post?""**"

And it pains me, because its something I legitimately desire.

In order for change to be enacted there needs to be support for the change to begin with.

Politicians do not benefit from being soft on crime. They benefit from being tough on crime. When politicians pass laws strengthening punitive measures it aids their campaigns. It gives their campaigns strength.

Because there's one guy who somehow molested 500 underaged girls, all prisoners must be treated horribly. That is what I believe the general attitude of Americans is. 

For all notion of ""protect the children"", many of our laws do not effectively serve to effectively reduce criminal activity. For criminal activity to be reduced in America, it would require many things to be done. Not just prison reform. Currently, our political sphere seems disinterested in actually aiding the common man.

As a result of this sort of general problem with American politics, issues like prisons will never actually improve.

It will continue to be slavery, it will continue to be overcrowded, it will continue to be ineffective. And it will be like this for a long, long time. Possibly forever."

(I also notice this attitude is more popular in the context of girls' cartoons than boys' cartoons, but I'm not sure whether that's relevant or not.)

&#x200B;

People condemn YouTube for showing sexually explicit ads, because ""what if a kid sees that""? Meanwhile, countries that know what they're doing, like Sweden, prohibit advertising aimed at kids *at all.*

&#x200B;

But who gets to say what's appropriate for kids? There is no way around how subjective it is. American versions of foreign shows often censor homosexuality, even at the most mild level (affection, etc.) to cater to parents who don't want their kids exposed to it. You could argue they could censor it ""just in case,"" but other parents may believe just as strongly that kids *should* be exposed to its existence early. Even if you think there's one ""objectively right"" answer to that issue, what about distinct subjects? What about cartoons that present innocuous homages to the most squeaky-clean of rap tracks, and parents who think that anything that could make a child curious about hip-hop is a slippery slope to discovering Eminem or Snoop Dogg lyrics?

&#x200B;

In radio and television, the answer is obvious. Parents who want their kids exposed to hip-hop but not homosexuality have one channel for them. Parents who want their kids exposed to homosexuality but not hip-hop have another for them. Parents who want their kids exposed to both have another for them. Parents who want their kids exposed to neither have another for them. The list goes on and on, for every distinct opinion one could have about what's appropriate for kids.

&#x200B;

With the Internet, the *whole world* shares *one* medium. So even if you were to censor the Internet  to cater to parents' ideas of appropriacy for children, you can't please everyone.

&#x200B;

And in the name of this, people would be throwing away a unique opportunity to have the medium uniquely free from corporate power double as the medium uniquely free from ""think of the children"" self-censorship. And in light of the introductory example, arguably undermine the former role of the Internet *anyway*.

&#x200B;

And once you achieve that, what's stopping hackers from introducing stuff that violates whatever standard a plurality of parents agreed to? What if they're from a geopolitically hostile country that refuses to prosecute them for hacking? Again, the whole world is sharing one medium here.

&#x200B;

To me, that the Internet is hopelessly inappropriate for children and they should be kept away from it is an irreplaceable solution. I don't know how; co-ordinating with other parents on a societal scale might be part of it; but I know the alternative can't be to enable parents in doing otherwise by self-censoring. This would just end in more parents letting more kids wade through more of the Internet more often, putting them at risk of being targeted by hackers and scammers and cult leaders and predators far more nefarious than the occasional R34 artist or inappropriate ad director *ever* was."

Read the lyrics of the entire album, from start to finish, and understand the perspective zooms in and out, sometimes switching between victims and perpetrators, or acknowledging either could be both, at once, or in sequence.

The narrator is clearly playing roles most love to hate. A conqueror on a battlefield. A rapist. A pundit who encourages lawlessness. An executioner. A condemned soul. A high-ranking Nazi. A homosexual cannibal. Satan themselves. 

We, the educated among the audience, know those writers/performers are not truly any of those things. They are satirizing those things, in an expression of anger, frustration, and derision. Fans of the band often gathered to listen to the live performance of the material, and shove eachother around, in mosh pits, in a cathartic, communal release of justified anger, at the state of the world depicted. 

The material promotes understanding the perspectives of others, even those we may find distasteful, the abandonment of dogmatic bias or bigoted thinking, and even the need for compassion, grace, and salvation, to save tarnished souls from a system that would otherwise predetermine their terrible fates. 

I also tend to believe castigators of the material are either ignorant to its true nature, and the intention and Hindenburg humanity behind it, or they are insecure about depicted tendencies within themselves. 

Is Slayer in general most likely an unhealthy thing to obsess over? Probably, but the same can be said about almost any obsession. Have some listeners identified too much with the roles depicted, and emulated them, to a point of committing crimes against others? Probably. Has at least one of its members repeatedly said he wanted to be a 'bad' influence, in the form of a devil on the listener's shoulder? Yes.

Would the album be and has the album been an apt soundtrack to violent crime? Probably. Are the artists guilty of terrorism and incitement? Arguably. Would their powerful music industry lawyers get them off, if ever tried, while lower-status artists are jailed, for far less serious or impactful offences? Likely. 

Could potentially anyone of any race, gender, creed, political persuasion, or lack thereof, enjoy the album, regardless? Possibly. Have some women suggested we have sex, to the album? Yes.

I view the world as being in relationship, with no separation (but of course with distinction as far as our observation goes).

No organism is separate from it's environment, and cannot be understood without knowledge of the environment. You can't understand the role of lungs without understanding air anymore than you can understand gills without understanding fluid gills interact with.

You can't understand an eye without involving the role of light, and so on.

In this way the universe is not broken down into pieces, but we as humans will often apply certain labels to certain things, which are a feature of language and not the reality language represents.

The person I was speaking with on these ideas before called them silly and contrary to science, which I don't agree with.

I'm open to hearing how the perspective might be flawed, or not an accurate one for experiencing the world."

Will check replies soon.

# Good vs Bad laws

Very important to realize here is that both good laws and bad laws exist. Many people, myself included, are able to apply common sense to tell whether a law should or shouldn't be strictly followed (sometimes depending on a situation)

* Should ""don't murder"" be obeyed? Obviously: yes.
* Should ""wait at the red light"" be obeyed when, you have perfect 360 view and you're 100% sure that there is absolutely no traffic in a one mile distance around you? Obviously no.

Note: I'm not saying that ""wait at the red light"" is a bad law by default. But in this   
 specific example, it is. Even good laws are not always useful in every situation.

# Flawed politicians, flawed laws

There are people with good intentions and there are people with bad intentions. How do we prevent bad people from doing bad things? Right by making laws. But ooops we run into a problem: laws have to be made by HUMANS. So there is a chance laws will be made by a person with bad intentions. Now what good does that do? And no, this is not a question of ""what if"" - bad or useless laws already exist

""you are not above the law"" No. I'm not necessarily above the law.. but im not below it either. The law is made by another human, just as capable of making mistakes and having bad intentions, who is no better than me, therefore I have no reason to obey.

The law saying ""don't murder"" could have been ""you have to murder someone every day"". Fortunately it isnt this way, but since politicians are human like all of us, and one day a politician might think murder is a very good thing, its possible that this law could exist. It proves my point, the only thing making this world a better place is good people, not laws. Making rules or guidelines is okay but no one should have to follow those if they don't want to.

# Laws that are not about morality

You might even say laws are not always about morality: for example, the law says everyone has to be on the right side of the road. Good, this prevents many crashes. But if you ask me, even this law is not necessary. Remove the law and people will still be on the right side of the road as an unwritten rule. If someone chooses the left side and crashes into oncoming traffic, then they are an idiot for driving into oncoming traffic, not for disobeying the law.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

If laws didnt exist then yes bad people would be able to do bad things and get away with it. But when laws exist, bad people can become politicians and make bad laws. So laws either way its a lose-lose situation.

In a world with only good people, laws are not needed.

In a world with only bad people, there is not one good person who can make good laws.

In this world murder is illegal but somewhere in another universe there is a law that forces people to murder. You might say ""youre not above the law"" but all I can say: the law is not above me either.

The best way to live life is to be a good person and apply common sense to each unique situation. There is no reason to live your life in the way that someone in a suit wants you to.

Note: if I don't murder, that doesn't automatically mean I'm obeying the law. I would only be obeying the law if I intended to murder, but didnt because its illegal. But in my case, I don't murder because I don't desire to do that. Its my own decision, not the decision of someone in a suit."

I was born with a deadly allergy to milk, which I fortunately no longer have. What this means is that I did not grow up eating milk with cereal, and instead tried it for the first time as an adult.

And that shit is *nasty*. 

It is a soggy wet mess. ""Oh but just eat it in the half a second before it becomes wet cardboard"" you say. Listen to yourself! Why would you do this to your food? No other food becomes disgusting in a single digit number of seconds after it's served. Whenever we eat anything else comparable - soup with bread, oreos and milk - you serve them separately and dip each bite individually. Cereal is the only food where people went ""you know what's great? *Sopping wet bread.*""

So what is the best way to eat cereal? Dry, of course. Like popcorn or potato chips. It has all the flavor plus it's crunchy instead of soggy. You want the combination of the cereal and milk? *Drink a glass of milk while you eat the cereal*. All of the benefits and none of the downsides. 

Wet cereal is gross as hell. CMV."

1,2024-02-09,CMV: Opinions/Perspectives are more largely based on IQ level than on experience.,u/SirDavidDAR,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1amvwnx/cmv_opinionsperspectives_are_more_largely_based/,changemyview,"Had a though. Your opinion or perspective on any subject is rooted more from your IQ and intellectual ability rather than your experiences, and the whole nurture vs nature concept. 

For my purposes, I will define IQ/ intelligence as the ability to learn through experience without outside guidance. Not the typical I know more math and science than you.

One point to make clear, your intelligence also creates your experience. For example, I have no idea how to cook. Cooking is boring where I follow a recipe and my opinion is that cooking is a chore rather than a hobby. Now had I had some knowledge base of how flavors and ingredients work together I could use lemon or acid to balance sweetness in my baked goods. I could use Mayo as a fat to substitute for butter when searing a steak. With a knowledge base I would have the freedom to “play” with recipes from scratch. Cooking would be more enjoyable.

Taking the thought a level deeper, your knowledge base on everything you do throughout a day, determines how easily or difficult it is for you and thus shapes your perception, perspective and opinion, not only on that topic but throughout everything else in life. Social skills, athletic ability, comprehension skills and mindfulness can all be learned at some level that is capped by your intelligence level to learn beyond predefined courses and text, through experience.

So your ability to adapt and understand the world around you shapes how you view it and shapes your opinions. BUT it is more about your ability (IQ) to understand and improve yourself to the world, than it is the objective truth in the world. How well you can LEARN cook defines how well it is perceived by you. Might seem confusing or like common sense at this point but that same application goes for politics and religion or more controversial topics of opinion. 

If we grouped together group based on IQ (again my definition not a score on a test) I bet there would be stark similarities of opinion at each level."

These two reasons make life not worth living.",u/Hydravion,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1and7ty/cmv_once_civilization_is_fully_developed_life/,changemyview,"Hello everyone,  

I hope you're well. I've been wrestling with two ""philosophical"" questions that
I find quite unsettling, to the point where I feel like life may not be worth
living because of what they imply. Hopefully someone here will offer me a new
perspective on them that will give me a more positive outlook on life.  

---

**(1) Why live this life and do anything at all if humanity is doomed to go extinct?**  

I think that, if we do not take religious beliefs into account, humanity is
doomed to go extinct, and therefore, everything we do is ultimately for nothing,
as the end result will always be the same: an empty and silent universe devoid of human
life and consciousness.    

I think that humanity is doomed to go extinct, because it needs a source of
energy (e.g. the Sun) to survive. However, the Sun will eventually die and life
on Earth will become impossible. Even if we colonize other habitable planets,
the stars they are orbiting will eventually die too, so on and so forth until
every star in the universe has died and every planet has become inhabitable.  
Even if we manage to live on an artificial planet, or in some sort of human-made
spaceship, we will still need a source of energy to live off of, and one day there
will be none left.  
Therefore, the end result will always be the same: a universe devoid of human
life and consciousness with the remnants of human civilization (and Elon Musk's Tesla)
silently floating in space as a testament to our bygone existence. It then does not
matter if we develop economically, scientifically, and technologically; if we end
world hunger and cure cancer; if we bring poverty and human suffering to an end, etc.;
we might as well put an end to our collective existence today. If we try to live a happy
life nonetheless, we'll still know deep down that nothing we do really matters.  

Why do anything at all, if all we do is ultimately for nothing?

---

**(2) Why live this life if the development of civilization will eventually lead
to a life devoid of fulfilment and happiness?**  

I also think that if, in a remote future, humanity has managed to develop
civilization to its fullest extent, having founded every company imaginable;
having proved every theorem, run every experiment and conducted every scientific
study possible; having invented every technology conceivable; having automated
all meaningful work there is: how then will we manage to find fulfilment in life
through work?  

At such time, all work, and especially all fulfilling work, will have already
been done or automated by someone else, so there will be no work left to do.  

If we fall back to leisure, I believe that we will eventually run out of
leisurely activities to do. We will have read every book, watched every
movie, played every game, eaten at every restaurant, laid on every beach,
swum in every sea: we will eventually get bored of every hobby there is and
of all the fun to be had. (Even if we cannot literally read every book or watch
every movie there is, we will still eventually find their stories and plots to be
similar and repetitive.)  

At such time, all leisure will become unappealing and boring.  

Therefore, when we reach that era, we will become unable to find fulfillment and
happiness in life neither through work nor through leisure. We will then not
have much to do, but to wait for our death.  

In that case, why live and work to develop civilization and solve all of the
world's problems if doing so will eventually lead us to a state of unfulfillment,
boredom and misery? How will we manage to remain happy even then?  

---

I know that these scenarios are hypothetical and will only be relevant in a
very far future, but I find them disturbing and they genuinely bother me, in the
sense that their implications seem to rationally make life not worth living.  

I'd appreciate any thoughts and arguments that could help me put these ideas into
perspective and put them behind me, especially if they can settle these questions for
good and definitively prove these reasonings to be flawed or wrong, rather than offer
coping mechanisms to live happily in spite of them being true.

The quote essentially means that if you can't prove it's malice then just assume it's stupidity. However there's the underlining assumption in our culture or perhaps it's even implied in the quote that stupidity isn't as bad as malice... and often people take this a step further an think there should be no punishment at all for blatant repeated incompetence that may or may not be actual malice and outright criminal intent. 

I live in Canada and the ArriveCan app an app that could easily be built for 100k costed 54 million. So two basic possibilities. First it's blatant criminal fraud with dozens of government workers and MPs involved. Second every single MP and government employee involved in it in anyway as well as the people who they hired to built the app is insanely stupid and incompetent. Like we are talking about a level like taking a random 5 year old out of kindergarten and giving them an unlimited budget and time to do something that they are currently incapable of but not as some kind of study or experiment something that the government actually needs done as soon as possible... 

How the fuck is that level of stupidity better than criminal fraud? How is it acceptable that any of those people have a fucking job and get elected? Maybe morally if they really are that just that fucking stupid it's the fault of the people who put them in that position but who's to say those people aren't just that fucking stupid to. I don't really think there's an argument that anyone who votes for Trudeau and his liberals at this point (and even last election) isn't extremely stupid. 

Logistically, mechanically that level of stupidity is just unforgivable to me, especially when it's people in positions of power. It's just as bad as malice probably even more dangerous (in the case of Trudeau's Liberals I believe to be both criminal malice and insane incompetence) at least if someone is a sane actor unless they explicitly want to destroy everything if they are just looking to enrich themselves they would do a much better job even with criminal fraud than someone that fucking stupid. 

Stupidity needs consequences we can't just keep doing like like paying 54 Million for something that should cost 100k or bringing in 1.6 million people a year in a country that builds 250k housing units. A fucking 3rd grader could realize how bad these policies are with their level of math skills yet the people in charge are too fucking stupid to? And because we can't prove outright malice and they could just be that fucking stupid there's no consequences? No removals, no pitchforks no guillotines. Hell they don't even lose that many votes... If someone that stupid had a normal job they'd be fired in 2 days."

1. Representation of minority/ discriminated  groups 
2. Representation of minority/ alternative views, ideology and religion 

(1)is what is commonly viewed as diversity. The easiest example being the inclusions of various groups in films. E.g the Marvel/ Disney  films. In institutions this is ""diversity in the work place"". Institutions promote and hire a spectrum of individuals.

However I believe (1) is wrong because it is ultimately superficial diversity. It is diversity based on appearance and not ideology. The worker/ character is expected to act as the marjority. The ""diversity"" is a marketing tool used to only spread the institutions ideology to the minority group. In the worst case scenario this is a member of a discriminated group, running the very system that oppresses  their community 

(2)Is the true diversity as it not focused on assimilation but acceptance. The differences in views are integrated into the framework of the institution. Not used as ""token"" elements of diversity. 

People don't want (2) because it would lead to real change and reform of the systems rather than continue it with everyone."

In fact, any drug that's stronger than Caffeine is a risk. Looking at the 'benefits' of Psychadelics is just not convincing enough to legalize it; it just seems like they're so desperate for LSD, Psilocybin or MDMA to be miracle drugs, when in reality, being high just feels nice - Alcoholics and other addicts, as well as people suffering from depression will eventually slide back into their old ways after use of, say, LSD. In my personal experience, the most obnoxious addicts were addicted to Weed - they were having to leave the room every few hours to get high, and all they could talk about were the same, tired talking points about how 'The government is going to legalize it soon' and 'It cures Parkinsons and Cancer'.  
  
The amount of research and interest that LSD and similar psychoactive substances are receiving right now, in my opinion, are mostly a waste of time. I just don't think there's anything incredible about these substances that are worth exploring, and think time is spent elsewhere. I'm not saying that nobody should be allowed to take these drugs (I have had 2 LSD trips and value the experiences), I just feel as if they're reaching for a conclusion that doesn't exist. The best, currently illegal drug (in the UK at least) seems to be Psilocybin, as that seems the safest and benefical to users.  
  
Even Microdosing; you know, this amazing, wonderful discovery that is curing depression, anxiety, and every other mental deffieciency under the sun? Yeah, it's a complete placebo effect, and there's a shit ton of studies to back that up. The reason for the current obsession with these drugs stems from the harsh laws put in place for dubious reasons by the American governement (and the rest of the world following suit), so we need to legalize it to make sure interested users get safe substances that aren't laced, and get advice on how to properly use it. Makes sense, right? Except, in theory, the work being done on LSD, MDMA etc, are being done in labs through government funding - this means that if you wanted a 'government safe' LSD trip, you'd most likely have to go to a specific area and be monitored by a doctor or relevant healthcare professional. Sounds like a fucking buzzkill to me.  
  
Longterm Ketamine use causes brain damage and depression, and Cannabis damages your lungs, kills your memory, your motivation; all under the stoned haze of 'I'm out of the system, man. You can't control me!' Except, no; you're exactly where the government wants you: In your house, sitting docile and eating junk food while watching Netflix (an activity that you can ONLY do while high!).   
  
In short: Should you probably do LSD? Yeah  
  
Should you hope for it to change your life? No

I am **not** talking about ""good contacts"", like good colleagues at work with whom you can work with pretty well or if they help you. I too have lots of ""good contacts"" at my university. But outside of PhD/work related stuff, we don't talk to each other, and I could drop them in an instant if I were to change jobs/university. 

Because of this, I honestly think that it's very important to make friends for life when you're a teenager or early in college, because afterwards it's just impossible. We are not teens anymore and the dynamics are vastly different when you're an adult with responsibilities.

utopia starts in a nuetral position and he looks for utopia until realizes utopia is found within god.

after watching both you're really able to see the similarities between both the albums.  the reason i say utopia is a simplified version is because  damn is such a deep work thats its still being interpreted to this day. theres various ways to view the story. damn also has this reversal concept where u get a completely different storyline if you listen to it backwards. utopia is more about travis's personal story while damn focuses on a more of a hypothetical story.  


overall utopia isnt stupider its just , as  previously mentioned, a simpler album, with its concept. both are beautifully composed.  
the depth is what makes damn a masterpiece, and makes utopia a great album.

This is not a war; this is a one-sided, intentional butchering.   
Netanyahu and the Israelis who agree with him have been pretending that they can have their cake and eat it too by indefinitely occupying Palestinians without having to either annex the land (and treat Palestinians as equal citizens) or leave the territory and stop treating it as de-facto Israel. It is obvious to everyone with a pulse that expanding the settlements and murdering Palestinians who won't give up their homes, laying siege to Gaza, sniping children and elderly and refusing to make any compromises even for Palestinian's basic human rights, will not give you security. You cannot antagonize your neighbor and cause them immense human suffering and expect security. You can only expect resistance."

1,2024-02-10,CMV: the post text has a better definition of racism in the US than any others now existing.,u/tolkienfan2759,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1anjkzy/cmv_the_post_text_has_a_better_definition_of/,changemyview,"Definition:  Racism in America is a silent war on black people.  It is brutal, insidious, political, constantly changing, appearing and disappearing, and unidirectional.  Its signature displays of power are in the past, with race riots, lynchings, assassinations, and Jim Crow; today it can be seen in the disparate outcomes observable in a wide range of settings, such as housing, employment, education, health care and the justice system, and in the wildly skewed marriage rates, between whites and blacks.  If you go by marriage rates, as some do, we are (as a country) at 98% of our capacity for racism.  The cure for racism is to raise those marriage rates, and become one people.  We could do this, very easily, but unfortunately this is in fact a racist country, and we don't want to.

Defense:  the problem with existing definitions is, none of them give you any feel for what racism really is.  They define it as though it were easy to confuse racism with normal behavior.  And in some cases it is; but in general, no.  Taken as a whole, racism is very different from normal behavior.  And whatever definition we use should make that clear.  So my first defense is:  this succeeds at that.

Secondly, the suggestion that only blacks suffer from racism, in the US, needs some defense.  To me, the marriage rate discrepancies make clear:  racism, at its bottom, is an insult, not of a person by another person, but of a people by another people.  It's a group thing.  A social behavior, just like ants build nests.  One ant, all by itself, doesn't build nests; it wanders around and dies.  It takes a village, to be racist.  A people.  And so whether individual white guys do or do not marry black women has nothing to do with it.  It's a tendency of the society, observable only in the bulk statistics.  No black person can ever insult a white person by evoking or referencing that social insult, because it doesn't exist on the black side.  And so racism is just one way.

I might add that I think an excellent test of the sincerity of conservative and Republican opposition to racism ought to be found in their embrace of a unidirectional definition of racism.  If they accept a unidirectional definition, then we can lower the temperature on the topic and have a real discussion.  Not until then.

The other defense of the idea that only blacks suffer from racism, in the US, is addressed to those who say, good golly, there are other races here!  No.  There aren't.  There are whites, pseudo-whites, and blacks, and that is all.  If you can find me another so called race that a) is geographically contiguous with white people and b) exhibits a similar marriage barrier with white people, I will admit I'm wrong.  In the absence of a similar other-race/white marriage barrier - and if, as I suspect, every other so called race in the US works to perpetuate a pseudo-white marriage barrier with black people - these other so called races are either white or pseudo-white.

Now I want to explain the adjectives I used to characterize the whole, just in case there's some misunderstanding:

Brutal should need no introduction, but it's not mentioned in any other definition of racism.  That is just wrong.  Brutality is the most important attribute of racism.

Insidious is normally used to give emotional effect, and I do mean that by it, but I also mean racism pops up here and there, seemingly out of nowhere, and seems to hide very well and be able to spend a long time considering its next move, which often seems carefully considered and politically sophisticated.  Racism has access to our best legal and political minds, and uses them with great effect.  There might be a better word than insidious, if brutal were not the first word, but since it is, insidious is probably the best second descriptor.

Political is important because someone reading the dictionary definition today, the standard issue, left or right, might not be able to imagine how much access racism has to the levers of political power, or how frighteningly unstoppable a steamroller can appear when political forces align behind it.

And finally, no standard definition, left or right, points to a cure.  If you look up malaria in the dictionary, you'll find the name of the bug that causes it.  Shouldn't we do that, with racism?  This definition does that."

These policies give insight into the attitudes and goals of the Likud government relating to Palestine more broadly.

It is more profitable for news companies to only focus on the most dramatic thing happening at any given point in time, but other information is essential to understanding the realities of complex political situations and for the citizens of democracies to make good judgements on how to guide our institutions to bring peace and freedom to the people of both Israel and Palestine."

An absolutely closed border would not allow any people or goods to pass. No one could enter. No one could leave. Even North Korea is not so closed. An absolutely open border would allow everyone and everything to legally pass: immigrants, criminals, drugs, weapons, nuclear material. No country as far as I know has completely open borders.

Probably no one who talks about open or closed borders means either of these things. But what point between do they mean? Does a closed border mean no immigration at all? Does it mean no temporary foreign visitors as well? Is an open border any border that's not closed, for whatever that means, or does an open border mean anyone and everyone from any country can legally immigrate?

Without a clear definition, everyone who advocates for ""closed borders"" can appear to agree, but if one of them actually implemented their plans, another one might be frustrated by the excessive restrictions. We saw things like that happen with Brexit. Without a clear definition of open borders, someone can factually accuse a politician of supporting open borders and trigger a lot of outrage, when actually the politician's policies might be only mildly controversial proposals like slightly expanding the volume of legal immigration.

It should be fairly easy to change my view. If multiple people can be specific about who and what can come and go across closed borders and across open borders, and they more or less agree, then I'll have a clearer understanding about what people are talking about."

Everything else society wise, seems to be up to debate and subsequent consensus.",u/Embarrassed_Slide659,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ankm1j/cmv_we_need_21_babies_per_person_able_to_give/,changemyview,"As it says on the tin, I have observed the silly culture wars, and the equally silly subwar of the gender wars. When I try to solve a problem, I try to dissolve and pick away at an issue until I have a sort of base dataset. The base requirement for humanity to survive in the future is the infamous 2.1 children per woman/whichever you prefer to call it. Reaching this, kind of, ephemeral statistic, would need a paradigm shift in how we, as humankind, as individuals, relate to the collective. While no kids would obviously lead to the demise of humanity, it would seem that more than three kids would, progressively, infringe on the kid's individuality (as the older kids become defacto babysitters), not to mention render the birth giver (if this is a forced position) into little more than breeding livestock. Now, there has to be a balance between the relationship between partners, the children and the respective freedom to realize themselves beyond parenthood. Furthermore, I see this, also, as a way of making the kids/offspring the most educated and qualified people for society at large, making this design the optimal way of furthering societal progress.

How would this be implemented in basic terms?

This obviously ends up running into the widely agreed and equally contentious idea of a ""breeding license"", which rubs up the sides of eugenics much more than most people are comfortable with. While that is a whole other intersecting debate, I'm not here to debate that in detail so I will refrain.

On a macro scale, everybody that can give birth to children have the right to make two children. Now it's often mentioned that most of rich countries do not have the sufficient 2.1 babies per birth giver, which sometimes gets pushed closer to the 2.1 via immigration. I'm the following I'm not necessarily going into the ethics, as this is already on shaky grounds without solidly consented-to foundation. We'd be here all day.

The 0.1 is to counter the unnatural deaths before an individual is able to multiply in the statistically median period one has children. With more people rendered infertile by genetics or pollution, this number would obviously rise. Getting past this, every birth giver, would have 2 children, and if they're interested in another, it would be compared to the national birth rate and be entered into a lottery. If the amount of ""needed"" babies is bigger than the amount of applicants, everybody gets an approval.

I think a lot of the initial ""I don't want to have a child""-reaction is, because society is made to be perpetually unsafe and unstable with badly designed laws and incentives that are badly thought through, which forces individuals to choose either parenthood or career, because it is assessed that doing both is way too stressful, expensive and difficult. I, personally, think that blaming individuals for not having children is barking up the wrong tree, because we are not even trying to make the environment conducive to bringing around the result, which seems to go against basic social scientific axioms.

I know this is a controversial take, but without, at the very least, theoretical experiments, it's going to be very hard to direct the way society evolves."

Free education, free healthcare, free food, etc. Some of these are income dependent but the fact is, when a child is in need, ALL of society steps up to help. 

Except one case, which is child support. Now it is directly on the parents (or perceived parents) to support the child. There is no shortage of deadbeat dads and deadbeat moms are more common. This creates a horrible network of trying to get them to court, get judgements, garnish wages, etc. There is also problems with going after the other parent if they work under the table or self-employed odd jobs person. 

But if this money is so pivotal to the child, as we say... child support isn't punishment it is supporting the child, why not guarantee it via the state? If a father, or mother, wants out of the parenting, then the state should allow that and step in. Then collectively we can all pay taxes to support that child just as we all collectively pay to educate that child. 

This leads me to believe child support on a parent that doesn't want to is more about retaliation and punishment. We have a very easy, already setup system for child support via the state. I will also point out that in the state foster care / adoption, a child is supported by the state until 18. Even if you adopt, you will continue to be paid by the state to support that child. 

Last point is that by going after the other parent that doesn't want to be involved, it creates hostilities and in the worst case, death. The most dangerous time for non-pregnancy related deaths as fathers that don't want to be parents will do anything to avoid it, much like women will do almost anything to abort when forced to give birth. Then after the birth, going after the parent can cause them to retaliate against you. 

So Change My View, why should we continue to go after the parents for child support, a known failing system, rather than just having the state step up and pay for the child? "

1,2024-02-10,CMV: Getting Into a High-Paying Profession is Mostly About Genetics Rather Than Hard Work,u/NomadicContrarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1annjde/cmv_getting_into_a_highpaying_profession_is/,changemyview,"**TLDR AT THE BOTTOM**

So, I think it's time I made a different kind of post that doesn't have to do much with dating/relationships, but nevertheless has been on my mind for the past 10 years ever since I became a more ""competitive"" person so to speak. 

To give you context, I (24M) am of Iranian descent and live in Toronto (literally one of the most status-obsessed cities in the West), and it seems like in this city (and more specifically in Iranian culture), the only people worth respect and good things in life are doctors, dentists, lawyers, or engineers (or similar paying professions). My parents, being the financial failures that they are (mom works at a college as a learning centre coordinator and dad as a pharmacy manager in a grocery store whom my mom kept insisting to invest into a business but he was too spineless to take such a risk and now we're suffering financially as a result), couldn't seem to find it within themselves to be one of these high paying professions, so obviously I had to be the one to go take the mantle, all the while having to to watch so many rich spoiled peers my age indulging in themselves in things like big houses, nice cars, proper travelling, etc. 

In grade 11, I thought of pursuing dentistry, but the problem was that not only did I struggle with math a lot, I also was dealing with a plethora of other conditions like my autism, depression, anxiety, and potential BPD (which a psychiatrist implied I might have when I saw them 2 years ago). Even with the accommodations I got though, I just couldn't seem to grasp many of the academic concepts required for these high-paying careers during my high school and undergrad years. As a result, me being the depressed, anxious, short-sighted person I was, decided to simply pursue nutrition sciences and become a dietitian because it was the easiest thing I could do. Of course, I now realize that it was a trash decision because dietitians aren't paid jack squat in this economy, and now I feel aimless in what I really want to do as I am now simply doing a master's in nutrition science with a thesis, and for what? Feeble academic jobs?

To be honest, I can't understand all these people my age who I keep seeing getting into med school, dental school, law school, or various engineering/finance programs, all the while I struggled with most of the foundational concepts, and let's not forget all of the ""experience gathering"" that would've been required for me to get into any of these schools to begin with.

As such, it got me thinking that these people were simply blessed with the genetics/talent to be able to grasp the academic concepts required to be able to get into these schools and inevitably succeed in them, whilst I couldn't no matter how hard I tried. Perhaps there might be some confounding given that I was dealing with a crap ton of mental stuff in my formative years, but a part of me thinks that even if I didn't have those negative experiences, that I still wouldn't be able to be one of these professions cause I just didn't have the genetics to be able to make it.

**TLDR:** Becoming a high paying profession like a doctor, lawyer, engineer, banker (or other similar-paying careers) are mostly about genetic talent rather than hard work."

In test screenings, the reactions were overwhelmingly positive by the audience. 

But WBD CEO David Zaslav decided that it would be better to never release the film for the company to get a tax off in its earnings. The movie is already finished and it’s just there, getting dust. 

My view: WBD doesn’t want to release the film themselves nor sell it to other studios. With that, it would be perfectly ok (although illegal) for someone to leak the film on the internet, just like they did with “Scooby and Krypto”, a movie that would have had the same fate if not for a leak. 

What would change my view: arguments that don’t revolve around the illegality of leaking and arguments that don’t revolve around “the film is WBD’s property and they should do what they want”.  

Zaslav just sound like the embodiment of corporate greed and have zero creative vision for the company."

I’m talking about those who have the capability to walk but choose not to at certain times to benefit themselves at certain times. 

While traveling out of the country, one large person caught my eye from the time I arrived at the airport (state side) to the time we got to customs in a different country.

This person was pushed through security in a wheel chair (by a little guy that probably weighed less than her arms).

Later on I saw she had no problem standing in line for Chick-fil-A.

Back at the gate… plopped back in her wheelchair, pushed to the plane so she could board early. 

Landed. Guess who was able to waddle their way to customs & didn’t need to wait for a wheelchair.

Bottom line, there are people who actually need wheel chairs and then there are people who want one because not having one would make them participate in some sort of exercise and or they want to skip the lines. 

Those people who are have a want but not a need are taking resources from the others. I think (if it becomes a problem) they should scan boarding for departures and arrivals for those who use wheel chairs. Those who get off the plane and don’t wait (because they don’t actually need one) would be charged once they don’t get that arrival scan. 

Hopefully that will deter some fat and lazy people from just using them to get through security faster and board earlier."

However, the lyrics make no mention of Christmas, Jesus, or Santa Claus. Therefore, Jingle Bells is not a Christmas song. I know the facts support my view, but I have yet to change anyone else’s mind to match my way of thinking about it. 

Here are the lyrics:

Verse 1
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

[Chorus]
Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Verse 2
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot

Verse 3
A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie
But quickly drove away

Verse 4
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack, you'll take the lead"

To make sure they have ""growth"", they raise prices a little. The next year they give their drivers less.
And on and on until they lose their customers/drivers, and the people left in charge are forced to sell.

Netflix is another unfortunate example.

I'm 42 years old and a lifelong Democratic voter. I've worked on campaigns at a local level.

Obviously, everyone ages differently. Not everyone can be a Betty White or Mike Wallace. Curiosities who were approaching 100 years old, but seemed to be as cognitive as a 20-year-old.

The old (conspiracy or smear) attempted at Joe Biden in 2020 was that he was mentally falling apart. Those fears were mostly shut down when Biden performed very well with speeches, convention, and debates.

Yes, Biden occasionally stuttered or misspoke, but it wasn't anything of major concern… yet. He still was this bridge that got us away from Trump.

I'm feeling like this is sort of  “dog ate my homework” moment recently.

2024 Joe Biden actually DOES now seem a bit frail and decrepit. I feel a heavy sadness watching him. This has been a rough week, and the mainstream media is now locked-on to the issue. 

Biden is “skipping” the traditional Super Bowl interview.  Watching his recent public appearances, It feels like I'm holding my breath to just survive it. The expression on his face seems different from 2020. It's more of a bewilderment blankness.

The campaign hasn't really started yet. Biden will need to give tons of speeches, interviews, and debates.

I think there is a legitimate feeling that he just… can't… do… it.

You need someone very strong to make the case against Donald Trump, and I just don't see it happening here.

I think a bit of history needs to be made here. He needs to be encouraged to step down before it's too late. Then again, who is going to tell him? If there was an effort to talk to him, and this leaked…. It would be too explosive. Obama tried it with Ruth Gader Ginsberg."

With 330 million people in America, it's impossible to individually sift through and analyze every single liberal and conservative mind on a person-by-person basis.

Obama once said that progressives have a circular firing squad, and he would certainly know better, first-hand, than most people, from experience.

In general, from what I've seen, if one agrees with a conservative on most things, the conservative is okay and thinks, ""It's good that this person agrees with me on the majority of things. We're allies.""

On the other hand, if you agree with a progressive on most things, but disagree with them on one or a few things - especially if it's an emotionally-charged subject like abortion, race, LGBT, feminism or whatnot - you are likely to be classified as a 'bigot' despite the fact that you agreed with the majority of their views.  

I'm not here to debate whether conservatism or liberalism are good causes - that's a separate issue. I'm just stating that that's the different **standard** \- that conservatives generally require you to only meet a fairly low standard (""agree with me on most things"") in order to be good in their eyes, but progressives require a much tougher standard (""agree with me on all, or nearly-all, things"") in order to be good in their eyes.

86,2024-02-10,"CMV: Within at least a couple of centuries, most popular culture from the last 100 years will be largely forgotten by the general public.",u/DCFVBTEG,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1antqto/cmv_within_at_least_a_couple_of_centuries_most/,changemyview,"Mass media is still kind of new. Television for example has only been a major form of entertainment for about 70 years. Movies as we know them today are only around 100 years old. As such most people are still aware of ""old"" movies, T.V. shows and other pop culture. I can reference stuff like Citizen Cain or I Love Lucy and people would still know what I'm talking about. Yet I feel that's simply because we're so early into the age of those mediums. I find it easy to imagine by the end of the millennium or even much sooner. most of this stuff will be completely forgotten.  
  
To prove this I'll take a look at literature. Ya the format of how stories where written has changed a bit. But I think it's fair to say written works of fiction and stuff we'd today call novels have been around since the invention of writing. So it's an easy way to compare television and film to a much more ancient medium.  
  
I'll list all the novels, novellas, short stories, and epics that I can think of that are still well known and widely read today both for common education and recreation. I'll also take into account if the characters in the stories are well known staples of popular culture like Sherlock Holms or Count Dracula.  
  
It's hard to say what great works of literature from the 21st century that will be considered highly remembered at least for a little while. Besides Harry Potter much to the dismay of J.K. haters. I also think the Hunger games has a decent chance at being considered a piece of classic literature.  
  
But the 20th century is filled to the brim with stories that are not only known by the general public. but still widely read and referenced in popular culture here are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head.  
  
A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, All Quiet on the Western Front, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Basically any Dr. Sues book, Charlotte's Web, Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, Animal Farm, The Jungle, Of Mice and Men, The Grapes of Wrath, Gone with the Wind, The Great Gatsby, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies, Ulysses, The Most Dangerous Game, Stranger in a Strange Land, The Man In the High Castle (I'm not actually sure how well this book did on its own, But its amazon series was pretty popular) and The Shining.  
  
The 19th century is similarly prolific. with a countless number of tales still known today which include but aren't limited to the following.  
  
Hansel and Gretel, Alice in Wonderland, Pinocchio, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Tell-Tale Heart, The Raven, Dracula, basically any Sherlock Holmes book, Around the World in Eighty Days, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas, Journey to the Center of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, Oliver Twist, A Christmas Carol, A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations,  
  
  
(It just occurred to me how influential Dickens and Verne were. Besides the fact they both individually have more of their works listed on here than any other writer so far. One was partially responsible for reviving the popularity of an entire holiday. And the other helped popularize an entirely new genre of fiction. pretty cool. Moving on)  
  
Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, Uncle Tom's Cabin, Moby-Dick, Rip Van Winkle, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, War and Peace (Charlie Brown Loves this one!), The Time Machine, The Invisible Man, The War of the Worlds, Frankenstein, Pride and Prejudice, The Last of the Mohicans, Jane Eyre, The Three Musketeers, and Les Misérables  
  
But then we reach the early modern period. A time spanning 300 years from the beginning of the 16th century to the end of the 18th. Despite being longer than the 18 and 1900s combined. I can personally name less books that I feel are still popular in the present day. There is Robinson Crusoe, Don Quixote, Gulliver's Travels, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and Puss in Boots (I'm not sure what story he originated from but I'm pretty sure the character emerged around this time.)  
  
That's a total of 7 stories over a 300 year timespan. almost half of which are from William Shakespeare who is a special case given he is arguably one of the most influential writers in history. so it's really only 4.  
  
going back further to the middle ages. A time period spanning around 1000 years of history. Here are the ones I can think of. the Divine Comedy, Robin Hood, King Arthur, The Canterbury Tales, the Pied Piper (Charlie Brown loves this one as well!), and a few other folktales and national epics that I know exist but can't name.  
  
That's it. 1000 years of history filled to the brim with books largely forgotten. Things get worse when you get to classical and ancient history. Besides a few titles such as the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Epic of Gilgamesh there aren't really any stories from that time that are still known today.  
  
So that's my point. The vast majority of the books known today are from the last 200 years. much of the rest of it has been forgotten with time. It's because of this I feel art isn't really timeless. we tend to get bored with the stuff we have and discard it with new crap forgetting our heritage.  
  
I know some of you will argue that the rise in the recent amount of books is simply because more are being published. As technology advances the amount of content being produced rises as well. Which is an understandable take, but still proves my point. Humans have been on this earth for around 200,000 years. I believe a species usually lasts around 1 to 10 million years before going extinct. meaning humans will likely be around for a very long time. And given the amount of content being produced nowadays. means our culture will soon be oversaturated with an exponentially rising amount of content most of which we will forget.  
  
It's because of this I imagine that in 1000 years or even much sooner, most tv shows, music, video games, movies, and books from our age will be cast at the wayside. While I imagine some stuff, like The Godfather or The Twilight Zone will stand the test of time due to their massive influence on human culture. Most other stuff will not.  
  
I guess I'll close this off with one last literary analogy. Orwell predicted a world where books were banned, Huxley imagined one where we lost our passion for books, Bradbury believed we'd come to fear books. But in reality, mankind's dystopia will be a world where there are so many books that we simply can't appreciate them all.  
  
Or Maybe I'm just a pretentious piece of crap who underestimates humanity's ability to preserve its heritage. Idk, I'd love to here some counter arguments.

1,2024-02-10,CMV: People Should Not Be Held Accountable For Their Past Actions.,u/Miles-David251,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1anuzbn/cmv_people_should_not_be_held_accountable_for/,changemyview,"In the labyrinthine corridors of ethical discourse, one finds themselves confounded by the inexplicable insistence on holding individuals accountable for their actions. It is with a somber countenance and a furrowed brow that I dare to challenge this veritable orthodoxy of our time. Allow me to unfurl the tapestry of reasoning behind this seemingly audacious assertion.

First and foremost, it is imperative to delineate the ethical boundaries within which human accountability ought to reside. To hold an individual culpable for actions perpetrated by entities external to their own volition is not just, nay, it is a travesty against the very fabric of moral rectitude. How, pray tell, can one be held accountable for the deeds of others, for the machinations of fate, or the capricious whims of circumstance?

Next, let us wade into the murky waters of human ontology. Humans are but ephemeral beings traversing the boundless expanse of time. With each passing moment, we shed the husk of our former selves, metamorphosing into entities distinct from our erstwhile incarnations. Thus, to tether an individual to the spectral chains of their past transgressions is to deny them the fundamental essence of their being—the capacity for growth, for change, for redemption.

Consider, if you will, the ceaseless march of temporal progression. Can we, in good conscience, castigate an individual for actions committed in epochs long past, actions which bear no semblance to the person they have since become? To do so is to erect a citadel of injustice upon the very foundations of our moral edifice.

In short, it is my fervent entreaty that we emancipate ourselves from the shackles of antiquated notions of accountability. Let us, instead, embrace a paradigm wherein individuals are judged not by the shadows of their past, but by the radiance of their present selves. For in the crucible of human existence, it is the flames of forgiveness and understanding that forge the path towards a more enlightened future.

I await, with bated breath, the clarion call of dissenting voices, eager to engage in the dialectic dance of ideas.

TLDR; If it is wrong to punish one for the deeds of a separate entity, and humans constantly become unique entities as they evolve into subsequent incarnations, then it is wrong to pushing people for their pasts actions."

If you can be foreclosed on, you are just renting your home. Use of a mortgage or loan and a down payment should not be considered ownership and this should even extend to basic repairs and fixes. If your property is mortgaged, the bank is your landlord and should be treated as a such. 

Also the government should then raise property values so that schools can get appropriate funding, OR property values should be attached to police funding and NOT school funding. Instead we have really shiny cops and really dumpy schools.

But civil war isn't the only way in which America could see a huge uptick in politically motivated violence. While there is no where near the amount of political unity from the conservative party to do any sort of large scale secession, and that's not considering that most talk of secession coming from politicians is all political theatre, that doesn't mean that individuals who do believe that their state should be able to secede won't do anything to carry out their ideals. While even those people aren't enough to form any sort of army, there are likely enough of them that in the case of a massive controversial political event, I'm betting on Trump being arrested **before** he loses in the election, it could motivate one but more likely many of these individuals to form together in these small domestic terrorist groups and carry out attacks on groups or politicians they are politically opposed to.

The curriculums you can get are excellent. A parent does NOT have to be a brainiac to get their kid through High school. If you combine a motivated kid with the correct curriculum and a solid co-op, said kid will waltz through with flying colors, and wonderful SAT scores.

Pros:

- schoolwork can be completed by 1pm every day EASILY with zero additional homework without the need to wait around for 20+ other kids in the classroom. This allows the kids more time to pursue their passions/ find out who they actually are.

- socialization is incredibly easy if you find a good co-op. I know this group hates personal anecdotes (and I get that) but I have more friends that im still incredibly close to from my high-school years as a homeschooler than anybody I know who went to public school. When I tell people I was homeschooled for most of my life, they are always shocked. 

- data supports homeschooled kids not only testing incredibly well in high-school, but adjusting great in college as well.

Cons:

It all comes down to accumulating pleasant memories, there is no more intrinsic value associated with “life to the fullest experiences” than there is with materialism. Experiences are equivocal to money in this instance. 

I don’t think most people really sit with and analyze their feelings or thoughts. A person can think of or daydream of a hypothetical scenario in which they accomplish all their dreams and even if they do accomplish those specific goals, later in the future when they reminisce about those accomplishments they will feel essentially the same as when they were daydreaming about it before they accomplished it, so please tell me why wasting all that time and effort to feel exactly the same way is more significant than people who like to buy fancy things"
1,2024-02-10,CMV: In the English language the use of articles a and an should be entirely optional. The might have its usage,u/vaikrunta,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1anxq4n/cmv_in_the_english_language_the_use_of_articles_a/,changemyview,"Hello, 

Let me start by saying I am not a native English speaker hence the CMV for me to understand the nuance of the language better and to appreciate it better.

I feel the use of articles **a** and **an** are entirely redundant and they do not offer anything functional to the sentence. The way I was taught in school, **a** and **an** are used for nouns which aren't specific and **the** is used for pointing to a specific thing. For example, 'this is a star' vs 'this is the sun' as we are referring to the one and only sun. Or say, 'give a package to a guy' is very general as opposed to 'give the package to the guy' is about a specific package to be given to a specific guy.

I am not contesting the value of **the,** In most senses it is offering something. (but not always, look at the string '*The English language*' from the title of this post, here English is capitalised, the **the** before it is functionally not giving anything).at correct places. (Grammarly just suggested me put the before correct in thiat correct places. (Grammarly just suggested I put the before correct in this sentence, which I am not getting why)

As a non-native, non-first-language English speaker, 'give package to guy' or 'this is star' does not feel odd to my ears and hence I always keep making this mistake while typing or speaking only to be corrected constantly by tools like Grammarly or such. For the life of me, I can not remember (or be bothered to) put **a** and **an** at correct places. (Grammarly just suggested me to **put** the before **correct** in this sentence, which I am not getting why)

I am curious to know if this is one of the quirks of the language like silent letters, or like the past tense of Go is Went. If it is a relic then I am okay to be fated to be corrected all the time by these tools even when functionally not getting anything. "

I am an American immigrant, I immigrate Deere when I was a child, whereas people from where I came from only got the chance to immigrate here when they were full grown adults or teenagers, so I am very grateful that I got the chance to live an American lifestyle.

America is a diverse and unique country in all aspects. Race, culture, land, history, etc. There is not one thing about America that I can think of that is not diverse.

Not only that but we Americans are extremely privileged. Our children have access to FREE public education to go to a school that will provide them a decent, even good education that they are not required to pay for, which is something that millions of children still don’t have.
Children in America are allowed to play in playgrounds and park without worry of a missile strike, or their houses being destroyed, or then being killed.

Being poor or low class / low middle class in America is different from poor in the rest of the world. American low class is considered a luxury to a third world person, low middle class would be a dream for them.
Even in America, the ‘poor’ kids can afford for example, an Xbox or a few items that would be considered a luxury.

Whereas in a third world country people survive off mud, grains of rice, and whatever they can find. Calling America a third world country wrapped in a Gucci in a belt just shows you’ve never been or lived in a third world country, it’s ignorant.

Children and adults don’t have to worry about going to work and wonder if their school or building will get blown up, or if one day a missile strike will bomb their house. Or if they’ll have to use the little canned goods they have. American children do not even have to consider working in the fields to make the iPhones they have, or being without water because of a war waged on your country. Or being unable to go to school safely with an extremist group tracking you down.

So many Americans are ungrateful for the plethora of privileges they have, and maybe it’s because they’ve only lived in America for all their lives. Any other Americans reading this, can you please just be grateful for what you have?"

For example, many people suggested that there should be an election which determines whether Ukraine stays sovereign or not. So why does Ukraine get the power to be independent but US states do not?

For clarity, I do support Ukrainian independence, but also the independence of any US state. Though this is not the view I'm trying to challenge here."

My 1st reason is that it is already popular throughout Asia and Africa. It is popular in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Oman, China, Japan, Morrocco, Russia, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, etc. However, Hollywood and local cinema are also huge competitors for Bollywood. This is because of their relatibility to larger audiences and their focus on telling good stories. Moreso, they have songs in them, which are frequently played at parties and other social events in the countries mentioned above. Due to the songs gaining popularity, more people would be inclined to watch these movies, which is why they have songs in them. Moreso, Bollywood releases more movies than Hollywood annually.

My 2nd reason is that South-Indian movies such as R.R.R., Enthiran 2, Bahubali, Bahubali 2, etc, have helped them gain popularity in countries such as Canada, the United States of America, France, The United Kingdom, Cuba, Germany, etc! 2022 was such a horrible year for Bollywood, with it releasing horrible movies such as Phone Bhoot, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Cirkus, etc! However, last year, which was 2023, Bollywood released such amazing movies such as Pathaan, Jawan, Dunki, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, Gadar 2, etc, while only 2 good South-Indian mpvies came out; Jailer and Salaar 1! However, Pathaan has been the most popular film worldwide, with Dunki not being far behind! This is because South-Indian movies have been the perfect introduction to most Europeans and Americans to Indian cinema!

My 3rd reason is that Bollywood releases more movies per year. This means that there would be more hits than Hollywood. Eg.In 2014, films such as PK, Haider, Humpti Sharma Ki Dulhania, Happy New Year, Kick, Singham 2, etc, were all Bollywood films, whereas Hollywood only had The Hobbit:The Battle of the Five Armies, Maleficent, and Guardians of the Galaxy, which are only 3 films, compared to Bollywood's 6 films, which is as much as twice as much as Hollywood's. Another example is that in 2009, films such as Wanted, Rocket Singh:Salesman of the Year, 3 Idiots, Rab Ne Bana De Jodi, My Name Is Khan, Luck By Chance, etc, were all hit Bollywood movies, while only Up, Star Trek, and Avatar, were superhit movies released by Hollywood. Again, Bollywood released as many as twice as many hits as Hollywood."

In 10 states abortion is legal up until a certain amount of weeks, and 14 states have a near total ban. 

And there are numerous amounts of ways to stop a pregnancy before a abortion is ever needed. So if the women takes enough responsibility they will never require a abortion for a unwanted pregnancy. And ''men'' can get pregnant now and in the states abortion is illegal they wouldn't be allowed to get a abortion either. So the laws would be applied equally to both genders. They don't have any more or less rights. 

Now lets go into what Men have to deal with.

1. The draft, all men when they turn 18 are required by law to sign up for the draft, yes the government is essentially forcing all men once they turn into a adult to use their bodys for war at any time they see fit, and they will jail and fine you if you decide not go.
2. There are protections against female circumcision but not Male, I was circumcised against my will before I ever had a chance to utter my first word. Why is it unlawful to circumcise women? But men can be butchered. Should be illegal in both cases. 
3. Women and Children are first being legal precedent as Naval Policy. Its a legal precedent or a naval policy that requires women and children to be prioritized for rescue in the event of a shipwreck.
4. If a women decides to keep a baby through pregnancy, and the man wants nothing to do with the baby/wants it aborted and doesn't want to support it. He has 0 choice, he has to pay child support at the very least. 
5. No attempt to reduce the disparity of workplace deaths or suicides, both overwhelmingly male. Even though there are a lot of people working on disparities of other types of jobs/work.

I was taught science is intristically about knowing & understanding the unknown. 
I don’t know when exactly it happened, but at some point our society stopped caring about understanding and began to only care about creating and ultimately manipulating the world around us.
When the periodic table of elements was first being created, Mendeleev was able to predict the existence of naturally occurring elements by understanding the elements. Eventually we stopped trying to predict elements and started focusing our resources on creating unnatural, unstable, and purposefully useless elements.

I like guys my height or just a bit taller, they’re just as attractive and masculine as the taller ones and I never had a problem with their height and it doesn’t make me feel small. Only thing is when wearing heels it sucks when I am taller than them lol but I just switch to flats instead, overall I think we shouldn’t shame guys who aren’t tall because it’s not their fault and there’s nothing wrong with being short, they’re just as cool as the tall ones.

As I'm looking for new places, I'm mostly being forced to choose between having either a dishwasher or a washer/dryer. No dishwasher is a dealbreaker for me, but several of my friends say they'd rather go without a dishwasher in exchange for having laundry in the building and not having to go to a laundromat. Here is why I feel they are wrong:

1. Frequency. Doing dishes happens way more often than doing laundry. You only have to do laundry once every couple of weeks, at most once a week if you have kids. Doing dishes happens every day, nearly constantly. Plus, if you are someone who likes to cook, it's not as simple as wiping down a few plates -- you've got kitchen tools and things crusted on pans after baking, and this requires a lot of work to clean.

2. Quality of clean. Whether you have laundry in your building or go to a laundromat, you are getting the same quality of clean. If you hand wash your dishes, you are losing out on the sanitation portion of the dishwasher cycle, which kills remaining bacteria. Therefore, sacrificing a dishwasher in exchange for laundry gives you a lower net level of clean.

3. Options. If I don't have laundry in the building, I can choose a wash & fold and pay someone to do it for me. Some places will even pick up and drop off my laundry for me, so I don't even have to think about it. I cannot pay somebody to do my dishes for me if I choose, I must do them myself, even when I don't feel like it.

All of these things combined make having a dishwasher much better for someone's quality of life than having laundry in the building, and a dishwasher should never be sacrificed in order to avoid having to use a laundromat."

1,2024-02-11,CMV: blockchains are awesome community controlled computers,u/CarefreeCastle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aoe3ot/cmv_blockchains_are_awesome_community_controlled/,changemyview,"a blockchain is a virtual computer made up of a network of physical computers all running the same software, with each person incentivized to do so by the resulting product of the chain. these computers allow us to make strong and reliably commitments.

once a public blockchain is created, it can create it's own money within the network, and use it to incentivize people to join the network and to run it, and keep running. it can create it's own money within the network because each person in the network can run the software and protocol for the computer themselves, and independently produce a shared and reliable global state. everyone in the network can trust the global shared state is correct, because they can run and write and rewrite and remix and fork the software as much as they like, independently verifying that everyone else's state matches their own. in this case, the global state is literally the money.

one of the things you can do when you have a system like this is create money. that's what bitcoin is. it's just the first instance of a blockchain in the wild. the computer is incredibly simple: it just manages btc, controlling who can spend and create which coins. other blockchains are far more extensible.

the key feature of the blockchain - the thing that's immediately notable - is that this global computer behaves predictably and reliably, even when vast wealth is on the line. sticking with bitcoin: blackrock and all the etf issuers are all relying on the bitcoin computer to maintain accurate state of everyone's balances, and not print new coins out of schedule. it's amazing that this can happen at all. because no one is being forced to maintain bitcoin, or run any specific version of it. anyone can fork it off at any moment; and yet it persists, resilient to change and corruption.

moving on to other chains: bringing programability to blockchains allows people to apply the same type of commitments made about btc by bitcoin to other digital objects. in the same way that the bitcoin network ensures that only I can spend my bitcoin, ethereum and the ens onchain contract ensures that only I can update or transfer my ens domain. this is true of any digital object that anyone wants to add to ethereum. ethereum can be used to create any kind of digital object, like stocks, bonds, domain names, etc. and they can all be fully under the control of their owners. just like btc. 

the majority of failures in blockchains are failures of central control. bridge hacks are generally the fault of multi-sigs. the majority of centralized exchange collapses are due to paper promises made by companies.

the modern world is built on paper promises, each given their fire and power by legal and social precedent. the majority of the things we find valuable online are granted to us via easily broken paper promises; terms of service that no one reads. 

blockchains are computers we can use to make commitments that are practically infeasible to break, unlike a traditional terms of service. 

there's no real reason blockchains need be limited to meme coins and ape pics. there's also no reason why only degens would want to use uniswap or aave or maker or ens. there's no reason why only tether and usdc would want to issue stablecoins on ethereum and other programmable chains. banks and governments can use blockchains to issue assets and create markets. 

once a public blockchain is up and running at large scale with many disparate nodes, it can become global public infrastructure for identity, property, markets, and more.

think about online identity. your reddit account lives within reddit. they control it, and they let you use it. it is not truly yours. it belongs to reddit, and they can take it if they please. same goes for twitter, youtube, and all the others. contrast this with eth. no one can take my eth from me but the entire ethereum network and community. they would all in unison need to update their code to alter their shared state to cut my property from me. it would be a incredibly significant ordeal, and highly impractical and implausible. this also applies to other tokens I have in my possession: my ens domain, for example.

this is all because identity is a first class citizen of blockchain networks. global accounts are needed for the system to work. this means that anyone can create applications that use ethereum accounts/wallets as the basis for their users identities, in the same way that other traditional companies rely on twitter, apple, google, or facebook. but unlike any of those platforms, ethereum is far less likely to pull the rug out from under you, or change the rules, or take away your users. countless wallets and apps allow users to move freely between them, keeping a shared identity and record of property.

I believe all of this is insanely valuable. because it's so obviously preferable to the current world written in ink.

signatures onchain are cryptographic: practically impossible to forge, and trivial to verify.

bitcoin is boring; but it's also money without a state. it has a fixed monetary policy that no one alone can change. that's pretty fascinating and incredible.

ethereum and other chains bring the [hardness](https://stark.mirror.xyz/n2UpRqwdf7yjuiPKVICPpGoUNeDhlWxGqjulrlpyYi0) of the commitments made by bitcoin about btc to any other digital object. anything that can be written in code on ethereum can behave like btc. 

more random beliefs:

\- once a chain is created, it can be incredibly difficult to update it's software. because anyone can join the network, and you need to convince a majority of the network to update together.  
\- blockchains can scale via rollups and zk.  
\- proof of work isn't required for blockchains to work. the expended energy in mining is more accurately depicted as a proof of costliness, and can be substituted with other cryptographically provable costliness.  
\- there's no fundamental reason why legal systems and frameworks around the world can't be written to include legal use of blockchains as public infrastructure.  
\- user experience issues can, will be, and is currently being simplified. account abstraction will help greatly here. privvy is an example.  
\- just as most websites people create are stupid, so too are most tokens and onchain objects.  
\- smart contract risks will always be an issue. the code and chain is public. the more usage a protocol has; the more value is secures, the more reasonable it is to rely on it. for example: uniswap, audited by everyone infinite times over, and having transacted hundreds of billions of dollars of tokens can be considered more reliable than an audited new contract just published, which is more reliable than an unaudited new contract. but even with this risk present, in the fullness of time, the guarantees provided by an onchain contract can be stronger and more reliable than a commitment made by someone on paper.

that's what I believe. what do I get wrong? can you change my view?"
1,2024-02-11,CMV: I think you should be able to buy any firearm in another state,u/Eli-Had-A-Book-,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aoe7f9/cmv_i_think_you_should_be_able_to_buy_any_firearm/,changemyview,"So in the US you have a right to possess a firearm. Some states have taken it upon themselves to make it more difficult for people to obtain something they have the right to own. However, there is a good amount of states that don’t make things more difficult and if they are willing, you should be able to purchase any firearm from other states you are not a resident of.

Currently, if you live in one state, you can only purchase a rifle in another state, not a handgun.

So for example, if you live in GA, you can be in TN and see a nice AR style rifle and want to buy it. You go through the process, you pay, the dealer hands you your new rifle & you’re out the door. If you wanted a handgun, you couldn’t do this. You would have to pay for the gun there, the dealer would ship it to a dealer in your state and then you could get it. That makes no sense. 

I think if you’re of the right age and pass the check, you should be able to get a rifle or handgun in the store even if you aren’t a a resident."

0,2024-02-11,CMV: LGBTQ people complain too much,u/Joel_H_Embiid,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aogm2k/cmv_lgbtq_people_complain_too_much/,changemyview,"So this isn’t an anti-LGBT post, and for the most part I absolutely don’t care about the orientations of folks. I used to be homophobic in the past (never hurt anyone, just expressed extreme views online as a teen) but grew up a long time since then. I have had trans, gay and bi friends and still do. 

I just want to bring an example where there are sexual practices I have engaged in (and others here) which have been treated similarly as LGBTQ acts. LGBTQ practices aren’t the only ones that have been suppressed or even punished (even if they are more prominently so). 

Let’s take two practices: oral sex and anal sex between straight people. I have as a straight person received and given oral sex, I have yet to engage in the second. Regardless, both have historically been suppressed, there are still laws forbidding them and historically they were both categorized as “sodomy.” 

If there was a campus preacher telling me that I am going to hell for getting head, I just don’t see myself asking for people to March in the streets or castigate anti blowjob views. If I read that Saudi Arabia executed a guy who was caught receiving a blow job, I’d just say “crazy country,” but would never see it as any more of an attack on who I am than when they do other crazy shit. More importantly, I can’t see myself asking to designate as hate groups religious organizations which preach that blowjobs are a sin.

As long as I am free to receive head in the privacy of my dorm room (in my case) without being personally harrased, I see no issue.

What’s stopping individual LGBTQ people who are in the same position as me (ie are not personally being harassed and are able to engage in their sex acts) from being like me? Why are they any more offended by a pastor who says that gay sex is sin than any of us are offended when a conservative Muslim preaches that blowjobs are a sin?"

I thought this was common knowledge. That is the literal appeal. the fact that they look + act, and sometimes are children.

they are CLEARLY a child or at least trying to portray a child and are attracted to children, fictional, anime, cartoons, dolls. is WEIRD. 

I don't think these people are going to go out and hurt real children or look for real cp.

Incels start from this correct premise and immediately conclude that, because they're ugly, they will never be able to have a relationship and are therefore doomed to die alone.

Rush Limbaugh was a curiosity. Yet, mainstream politics were still debated within the pages of the National Review. There was still a sense that you needed to be a political wonk if you wanted to be in the game.

Bill Clinton got a blowjob, and with the rising popularity of cable news (and the internet), the whole thing has taken a turn into pure political entertainment. 

This current election cycle has little to do with ideas or accomplishments. It's gotten closer to reading a joke tabloid for news. We follow the drama. “What's going to happen next?”

People give themselves political labels like “liberal” and “conservative,” but I have strong doubt that anyone could actually define what any of those mean. It's more of a collective sport to just berate other people. You feel grievance deep-down inside somewhere, and you get a chance to vent under the guise of being politically active.

1. Bringing People Together: The combo of Taylor's star power and Kelce's athletic prowess has a way of pulling everyone into the same vibe. It's kinda rare these days to find something that everyone can get behind, right? Their win felt like one of those moments where it didn't matter where you were from or what music you liked; it was just pure, shared excitement.

2. The Whole Inspiration Thing: Kelce's grind to get to the Super Bowl, with Taylor cheering him on, kinda lights a fire under you. It's like a real-life example of sticking to your guns and making big things happen. Whenever I see someone chasing their dreams like that, it makes me want to up my own game.

3. Doing Good with the Spotlight: Both of them have this knack for turning the spotlight into a force for good. With all the attention from the win, they've been able to shine a bigger light on causes they care about. It's pretty cool to see success being used to make a difference, you know?

I really think their win is more than just a game. It's about creating moments that bring us together, inspire us, and remind us to look out for each other.

If your partner can provide adequate proof of disloyalty or infidelity on your part, then you should no longer be entitled to any money or property in any divorce settlements.

You can extend this to say that if the father later finds out that your children are not really his, then again you have also forfeited all rights you have to divorce settlements.

>I only cheated because I wasn't happy with my partner for xyz reasons

Should be irrelevant. You cheated. It's your fault. Nothing your partner did wrong can justify your actions. No matter how hard it is going to be for you to take care of yourself after the split, you should still be entitled to nothing. 

The only exception would be things like when children are involved. If the father has been determined to not be able to take care of the children on his own then you should get help (and if he can take care of them, the children should again belong to him because YOU cheated)."

We constantly hear coaches talk about the turnover battle, but not all turnovers are the same. A RB fumble that's not returned is basically a spot turn over. Meanwhile, a muffed punt (or one that hits a blocker in the back of the leg) can be the equivalent of a 60 yard gain for the punting team.  

Then we have rush issues. These include running into or roughing the punter, which automatically (roughing) or often (running into) result in first downs at a time the other team's trying to give you the ball back. Or they make it short and fourth and now your defense has to make another stop. There's also jumping offsides, which gives tons of free first downs. And there are fakes, which work against teams not playing it safe but trying to rush the punt. 

There are also defensive issues on punts like blocks in the back, and holding.

Keep in mind this is all happening at a time when the defense is actively trying to give you the ball back.

So for all this risk, we get, what? The one in a hundred punt block (which usually happens because your team is so much better than the other one that your special teamers are five stars riding the bench)? The incredibly rare decent return? A fair catch that saves about two first downs worth of yardage? That might have mattered in the three yards and a cloud of dust, 10-3 final score days of football, but these days it's just not worth the risk.

Sit in your base defense, don't rush, let them kick you the ball and let it roll dead. Start your offense void of risk, and save the time practicing punt returns to practice more of your offense."

That being said, I believe modern science disproves religion. For example, regarding the Bible, people can't walk on water, make new versions of themselves out of ribs, etc. Now, I understand that the teachings of a lot of these books can be taken metaphorically, in the sense that you should always be kind and courteous to people, etc. But I take issue with religion being used as an excuse for abuse. Being queer, I have encountered so many religious people who tell me that my existence, which is something far more real than their supposed 'gods', goes against the laws of nature and faith, and that I am a lying f\*ggot, etc. I understand not every religion shares this view, but on the whole, I believe it is built off of the premises of the beliefs hundreds of years previously, which obviously contain heavy bias. I don't understand why there are many laws in governments about protecting religion, as there are so many instances of it hurting people, and wars being waged because of it, etc. (I understand this isn't the only factor, but it is definitely important in some cases!).

To me, although a lot of our universe still contains unanswered questions, I believe technology and science thus far have disproved any notion of an over-arching powerful being. Additionally, there are so many terrible things going on in the world that I don't believe anyone here is protected by said being at all.

I mean, children dying of malaria aren't exactly happy, are they? What about the suicide rates? People are killing themselves, dying of terminal illnesses, losing loved ones to gang violence and drug overdoses, and people say it is due to the mercy of a god? How is any of this justifiable?

Additionally (and here, I don't follow this religion, so I may be misinformed!), so many women are wearing hijabs and body coverings. Please know that if you do this for your religion, I have the utmost respect for you, and I accept your beliefs, but to me it seems like a form of systematic oppression designed by men to hold down the women in their life in the name of a god. I don't understand how this is fair or just.

To me it seems like the world would be a more peaceful place without religion. Now, I do not hold any resentment if you are religious, but I would love someone to contest this view. I have not encountered a shred of evidence thus far that religion has done anything but divide and brainwash people."

I'm all for a woman sleeping with whoever she likes, however many times she likes, yet i don't think i could take a woman that has too high of a body count, whether it be because of my christian beliefs or because of some other reason. How can i claim to not care about a woman's body count when it's very woman but a woman i would hypothetically be dating/sleeping with or whatever?
I agree that women get paid less, but at the same time i do see the merit in the argument that they typically take lower paying jobs.

I agree we need more women in congress, but also i think there's been a good majority that may have been propelled to higher positions just because they're women, or women of color, or disabled women etc. instead of being put in those positions because of political skill.

I've never cared about being seen as an ally to women, if i have to constantly prove or defend my position as an ally then i'm probably not an ally. so, what would you tell to someone in this situation? i just feel like i pick and choose which accepts of pro or anti feminism suit me the best instead of actually caring or respecting women? i've never had anyone tell me that i don't respect women i just feel personally that i probably don't do enough? does any of this make sense posting at 5am idk?"

This issue has become controversial recently because some people believe that it applies to Donald Trump, because of his role in the events of January 6, 2021.

I'm not here to debate that legal question of whether someone can be removed from a ballot if they commit insurrection against the United States, because I don't think it applies to Trump. 

In the United States, we have a presumption of innocence. The government of Colorado is ignoring this right, by punishing Trump with a crime before they charge him with one. Rebellion or Insurrection (18 U.S.C. § 2383 - U.S. Code) says that ""Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States."" This is the law that reinforces the 14th amendment, and makes it a tangible thing someone can violate. Someone cannot be charged with ""violating the ____th amendment"", they have to be charged with the crime. 

That's why every amendment where the amendment focuses on something that you can't do (13th, 18th, 24th, etc), rather than a freedom from something (1st-8th) or an amendment about how the government works (25th, 17th, etc.) has a section saying that Congress can create legislature enforcing it, because without that the amendment can't be enforced by the government. 

The 14th amendment has this section, where it says ""The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article"", and that law has been created, and it is the Rebellion or Insurrection law, which Trump has not been convicted of breaking, meaning he can't be punished by the 14th amendment.

Arguing over the case itself, whether or not someone convicted of insurrection can be president is not the point. CMV.

TLDR: Trump has not been convicted of violating the Rebellion or Insurrection Law, which the 14th amendment requires to be enforceable, and therefore cannot be removed from Colorado's ballot, CMV.

1,2024-02-12,CMV: I think people have an great misunderstanding of what the patriarchy is,u/anotherblackanon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aozqek/cmv_i_think_people_have_an_great_misunderstanding/,changemyview,"  
 before I say anything I will say that patriarchal oppression of women is a bad thing and most instances of it happening is unnatural and because of a man's ego and sexism.   
  
the patriarchy is a natural occurrence in human societies because of the biological differences between men and women and many of the career differences between men is women is not usually because of sexism but how men and women make different decisions because of their sex. I am not making an appeal to nature argument, just because something is natural doesn't mean its always good but in the case of the patriarchy it is because it was never born out of men oppressing women but instead its born out of men and women usually making choices because of their biological differences.   
  
the biological differences between men and women are why we live in a patriarchy and there has never been an matriarchy in human history despite there being societies where women had ruling positions or have held power. the fact that women could get pregnant meant they had to take on a household position which left them having less freedom because they couldn't do much when being pregnant for most of the year and had to feed their baby, men did have their familial responsibilities but could have more freedom and pursue more risk taking careers that women usually couldn't. this is why the gender pay gap exists and why we have always lived in a patriarchy, women will take more time off for their children than men would and would take jobs that weren't paying as much but could leave them having more time for their children.  
  
I'm not saying every single women is like this and women in the modern day who did not want children can have a higher chance at succeeding more than men can. I am just saying that a large percentage of women did want children and as such could not have the same freedoms as men can. the patriarchy is born out of the biological reality of men and women rather than oppression of women, the patriarchy is just a society where men hold the majority of ""power"" and the matriarchy would be the exact same thing but women holding it. saying the patriarchy is inherently a bad thing or oppressive also means the existence of the matriarchy is built off of the oppression of men because both can only exist due to biological differences between men and women and either sex taking up the majority of positions of power.

also this is the video that inspired this post as it meaningfully analyzes what the patriarchy is. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHZdUTB0hUI&t=610s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHZdUTB0hUI&t=610s) "

And every single player on every single team is a United States citizen, either by birth or through legal immigration and citizenship processes (the latter of whom make up a teeny tiny fraction of all players).

So why does it make sense to call the winners of the league's final game the ""world champions"" if they didn't compete against a single team from any other country?  To me, the answer is simply ""it doesn't"".  It doesn't make any sense to me at all.  Use the phrase ""National Champions"" all day long.  They've proven to be the best team in the country.  But the world?  They're not competing on the world stage.  They play *in* other countries sometimes just to try to get more money for the league, but they're still only playing against each other.

There's no way to know, and being downvoted also kinda sucks. Being social creatures, we're susceptible to being upset when someone disapproves of what we say or do, especially when we don't know why.

Yes, I know there are plenty of people who don't care about downvotes, and that's great for them, but not all of us are like that. There's a reason people weaponize downvotes and use them to passive-aggressively attack someone just because they don't like their opinion.

1,2024-02-12,CMV: “I could care less” is an acceptable way to say you don’t care very much,u/Toomuchlychee_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ap60vd/cmv_i_could_care_less_is_an_acceptable_way_to_say/,changemyview,"I’ve thought about this a lot but I’ll try to keep this short and sweet. Please don’t patronizingly explain to me that “I could care less” actually means I do care, I’ve heard this explanation many times and I will refer to the opening paragraph of my post if that’s your response. 

Reason one: Its purely idiomatic and you know what it means. Sometimes we negate sayings and they mean the same thing as they did because we’re so familiar with the saying. Example: “I can’t hardly wait” means the same as “I can hardly wait.” Bob Dylan’s song “you ain’t going nowhere” would’ve had the same meaning as if it were called “you ain’t going anywhere”

Reason two: It makes a little sense because if you don’t care very much, you probably don’t care enough to get the saying “right.” The idiom itself is about not caring, and so it’s fitting that one would make a remark that isn’t wholly accurate when properly parsed. 

Reason three: Just because you COULD care less doesn’t mean you care a lot. 0 is less than 0.000001. 

Reason four: If you grew up around people who used the saying “I could care less” the it has a certain meaning to you based on context and not on the actual meaning of the words. Nobody ever uses “I could care less” to mean that they indeed care. So I feel the disagreement about this saying is subtly about differences in culture and upbringing so maybe we shouldn’t be so pedantic about it."

A common place that it is seen is in debate about immigration numbers in where people like Rishi Sunak, Priti Patel and Vivek Ramaswamy have been labeled as traitors to their race for wanting to decrease immigration numbers or implement stricter criteria. To me it makes no logical sense that someone should have to uphold the system they benefitted from. Systems and rules should be evaluated based on the overall effect that they produce not some one off scenario. Additionally when someone is accused of being a race traitor for reducing immigration numbers it ironically increases anti-immigration sentiment as it gives members outside of the group the idea that people in that group are more concerned about their own community that the wellbeing of the country as a whole. To take an example of this behavior that could be more common on the right wing it is also dumb when conservatives criticize billionaires who advocate for taxes being higher on the rich. Just because the billionaire does not pay the tax rate proposed under their ideal policy does not necessarily make them hypocrites. The billionaire might believe that while their own charitable contributions are a better use of money than what the general tax pool is used for but they can also be of the mindset that as a whole billionaires don't donate enough to charitable causes or that the causes donated to are less optimal for society than if they were collected as tax revenue. 

&#x200B;

In a similar realm it is also foolish when people take offense to criticism of a system they benefitted from. This is seen in criticisms of affirmative action where people who believe they were hired due to AA policies take offense to the policies being criticized and act as though the criticiser is calling them incompetent. Just because someone believes that a system as a whole is unjust or suboptimal does not mean that they believe that in all instances they believe the system reached the incorrect outcome.  Even taking for example, people who were promoted due to sleeping with their boss or hired due to nepotism. The law of large numbers would dictate that some of these people actually did happen to outperform the people who would have beat them in a traditional hiring process."

He was already starting to have issues with AppleTV. It was a small space, so I'm not sure that people noticed too much. AppleTV wasn't thrilled with a few of his takes.

Jon Stewart wants to call out Trump for being a piece of sh*t, but he also wants to call out Biden for being too old. (Accomplished with his brand of comedy and satire)

I don't know if viewers can handle that anymore. I don't think the tribes of American politics have seen this type of content for a long time.

1,2024-02-12,"CMV: To self-censor online is enabling parents in their indefensible decision to let their kids use the Internet, and is unfair to parents who were assertive enough not to.",u/ShortUsername01,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ap7wzf/cmv_to_selfcensor_online_is_enabling_parents_in/,changemyview,"People who otherwise lament whatever semblance of power copyright holders have over the Internet celebrate when overzealous companies use it crack down on R34 of cartoon characters, supposedly because ""what if a kid sees that""? (I also notice this attitude is more popular in the context of girls' cartoons than boys' cartoons, but I'm not sure whether that's relevant or not.)  
  
  
  
People condemn YouTube for showing sexually explicit ads, because ""what if a kid sees that""? Meanwhile, countries that know what they're doing, like Sweden, prohibit advertising aimed at kids at all.  
  
  
  
But who gets to say what's appropriate for kids? There is no way around how subjective it is. American versions of foreign shows often censor homosexuality, even at the most mild level (affection, flirting, etc.) to cater to parents who don't want their kids exposed to it. You could argue they could censor it ""just in case,"" but other parents may believe just as strongly that kids should be exposed to its existence early and that it'd be wrong *not* to do so. Even if you think there's one ""objectively right"" answer to that issue, what about distinct subjects? What about cartoons that present innocuous homages to the most squeaky-clean of rap tracks, and parents who think that anything that could make a child curious about hip-hop is a slippery slope to discovering Eminem or Dr. Dre lyrics?  
  
  
  
In radio and television, the answer is obvious. Parents who want their kids exposed to hip-hop but not homosexuality have one channel for them. Parents who want their kids exposed to homosexuality but not hip-hop have another for them. Parents who want their kids exposed to both have another for them. Parents who want their kids exposed to neither have another for them. The list goes on and on, for every distinct opinion one could have about what's appropriate for kids.  
  
  
  
With the Internet, the whole world shares one medium. So even if you were to censor the Internet to cater to parents' ideas of appropriacy for children, you can't please *everyone*.  
  
  
  
And in the name of this unfeasible goal, people would be throwing away a unique opportunity to have the medium unusually free from corporate power double as the medium unusually free from ""think of the children"" self-censorship. And in light of the introductory example, arguably undermine the former role of the Internet anyway.  
  
  
  
And once you achieve that, what's stopping hackers from introducing stuff that violates whatever standard a plurality of parents agreed to? What if they're from some geopolitically hostile country that refuses to prosecute them for hacking? Again, the whole world is sharing one medium here.  
  
  
  
To me, that the Internet is hopelessly inappropriate for children and they should be kept away from it is an irreplaceable part of the solution. I don't know how; co-ordinating with other parents on a societal scale might be part of it; but I know the alternative can't be to self-censor and in so doing enable parents in continuing to let their kids use the Internet. This would just end in more parents letting more kids wade through more of the Internet more often, putting them at risk of being targeted by hackers and scammers and cult leaders and predators far more nefarious than the occasional R34 artist or inappropriate ad director ever was."

Mainly because I was simply confused about the game that is college. Because that’s what it is, a game.

I wasn’t learning anything, I was just completing tasks and hoping the professor wouldn’t fail me.

Explain to me how a course can be so historically “hard” that everyone knows if you get a C/D, it’ll be curved to an A/B? This is one of the main things that led to me dropping out. I couldn’t grasp being okay with barely passing the class. What was the point?

I couldn’t grasp just being okay with being confused, and being okay with failing a midterm. But everyone else was okay with it. Everyone else was good at the game. They didn’t care about learning they knew the game was to just pass.

I didn’t learn that until my second attempt at college, and my degree is literally pointless. I can count on one hand the amount of useful things I learned in college. I’d need a football team to count the amount of assignments I had curved when we all should’ve failed.

In summary, you go through 4 years of stress and piles of homework to not learn anything, and to receive a participation trophy at the end. That’s all a degree is these days. A participation trophy. Because everyone gets one if they understand the rules of the game."

AI is a growing technology in our society and i think with AI glasses where you could wear glasses that film around you or even with AI text to image and video, i can't even imagine how internet won't be flooded with random picture of random people.

In fact i predict that this will be the new porn industry, people won't masturbate to porn star but to the hot girl/guy they saw on the street, with them inside with the AI text to video.

By that logic, such video will leak to the internet and you could have a dozen video of you doing some crazy BDSM shit that even if you are a virgin, just because of that technology.

Also maybe it is here where many will disagree with me, but i don't think using such technology for yourself is bad, you do thing and keep them for yourself or delete them, but if you leak them i think that is very bad.

In my opinion someone making fake AI porn of you shouldn't be illegal as long as they keep it to themself, and i think it will become the norm, where people see a hot person they saw on the street and make some fake AI porn. For example people already masturbate to actor and i don't think doing it to random people is bad.

One of the consequence is also that people will have to to devellop a thick skin to not be offended if some person made some video about you naked and that people who have suffered about revenge porn will suffer less of a stigma because everyone will have private photo of them online. Finally one of the truly unfornatee and shitty part will be that porn of kid will probably sky rocket."

Take the racist POS in Buffalo, NY in America.  He shot up a supermarket and murdered over a dozen people because the shopper were black and he thought they were replacing white people. He will be justifiably executed by the federal government. The families agree. But here’s something else, notice how nobody’s protesting the sentence? Nobody’s advocating for him to be sentenced to life instead?

People don’t really care that he’ll die. It will be no great loss. 

Exposure firsthand to evil, to great amounts of violence, makes people less merciful. Look at Mexico for example, in the capital it’s not uncommon for gangs of citizens to beat the shit out of street thieves or pickpockets if  they’re found out and caught. Not because mexicans are more cruel or unenlightened, but because they’re sick of being robbed. It’s not something people can turn the other cheek to anymore. And that’s just with petty crime let alone murder and rape. 

El Salvador is another example we see in the news. Regardless of whether Bukele’s current plans are sustainable or not, El Salvador’s citizens are for it. Because they want these criminals to suffer, to feel the pain and fear they’ve had to, to be put away so they can suffer the way they’ve had to.

1,2024-02-12,CMV: The innocence of being a virgin as a man does not lower your masculinity,u/kimchiii1992,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1apa988/cmv_the_innocence_of_being_a_virgin_as_a_man_does/,changemyview,"A lot of people are probably going to disagree with me on this but I think it needs to be said. The innocence of being a virgin as a young man in your 20's or even your 30's does not lower your masculinity, rather it actually increases it and virgins should not feel shame for it.  
  
If you remain a virgin, that means you have so much self control over your animal instincts. It's easy not to be a virgin while it's hard to be a virgin. Masculinity is doing the hard stuff, not the easy stuff. I have zero respect for a 21 year old who goes around telling his buddies ""Bro I'm smashing all these girls on campus"" - yeah you're nothing more than a rabbit, good for you. Like control yourself. And I am not trying to shame anyone who sleeps around - I'm just challenging AM to be better. If someone is sleeping around all the time, deep down they are probably mentally tormented if they're a man.  
  
They are going to be accused of rape at any time by some girl that wakes up and has a different version of events...and in today's life, that can destroy your life  
  
You can have an STD and/or you have just have cheapened the sacred/holy. You have something holy - why share it with every random girl you meet at Tinder or at the nightclub? Save it for your soul person or the person you want to spend the rest of your life with.' I understand, it's not easy. But the fulfilling life is for those people who do ""hard"" stuff, not ""easy"" stuff. It is a very difficult path to say no to hookup culture in 2024, I get it. Now how do you get yourself or your friends to see sex as more sacred? I mean, it's hard - it's just that you guys look at it through a highly pornified sexualized lens.  
  
Now many people may argue ""you don't just date a girl to marry her""  
  
Well, you should.  
  
You shouldn't even date without the intention to marry. Dating is not recreational, it's not for sex, it should be with the intent to find a soulmate. If you say to myself, ""I will never marry someone of a different religion"", which is perfectly respectable and you happen to be dating somebody of a different religion just for the sex and companionship, I think that's highly immoral. You're leading her on and you're leading yourself on - it's like a placeholder and the whole thing is screwed up. Now you may also argue, ""If you don't want to commit to marriage too quickly in a relationship, isn't intimacy a big part of the relationship? So why would you save yourself for marriage?"".  
  
You should save yourself for marriage.  
  
Why? Because the sacred should only be shared with the person when the vows are shared in my ideal. I know that is unrealistic and so hard for a generation that's so sexualized to get this. But to describe how awesome it is to not have to worry that your partner had to share that with somebody else and you didn't have to share it, it can happen because your grandfather's generation and your great grandfather's generation did that and they lived happier and better lives. It can be done where you're both not wondering, ""am I living up to a previous partner?"" or ""am I thinking about a different partner?"".  
  
With women in particular, there is a study that shows that there is a chemical and attachment that young women have as soon as they have sex with somebody and it's very hard for hard them - and it's very hard for young women to overcome that. And that's where you sometimes get ""ex-girlfriend syndrome"". It's honestly understandable. Biologically, they're not wired to have 15+ partners, right? Men on the other hand have a much easier time moving on from one partner to the other but they should be restraining their animal instincts .We should say ""Okay, just because it's hard doesn't mean we shouldn't set the standard"". It's possible. Yes, there's pressure and external stuff but there's evidence that shows that public opinion can be moved. For example, how many of you guys know people that smoke tobacco regularly? If you would have went to college in the 70's, you would have seen a lot of kids with cigarettes. You probably don't see that very often. We moved public opinion on cigarettes (although unfortunately it has now replaced it with other things).  
  
You can get people to change their behaviors is the point I am trying to make. Sometimes good, sometimes bad and we should try to challenge young men to not have sex with everything that moves. I think we all need to acknowledge that marriage is the ideal - it's not impossible but it's very difficult. You need to eat to survive. You need to drink water to survive. You certainly do not need to have sex to survive. You're only tempted towards it, you're drawn towards it, and you're not going to die. So I actually think it creates stronger men with a better ability to find their place in the world - less depression, more purpose, and all the studies show this: Couples that save themselves for marriage have far less rates of alcoholism, far less rates of domestic abuse and it could be a sampling error because you're like ""Oh it's not fair because those are the people that actually have more disciplined lives"" - or maybe did they develop disciplined lives by saying no to the thing that they were most tempted to do?"

I was all in, thinking about the massive perks for animals, our environment, and our health. I mean, who wouldn’t want to dodge heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, right? Plus, the thought of reducing my carbon footprint and fighting against water pollution felt super empowering.

But, life has its twists. Despite nailing my vegan recipes and being that friend who could turn any skeptic into a tofu lover, my body started sending me SOS signals. I was dealing with some health hiccups that no amount of avocados or B12 supplements could fix. That’s when I crossed paths with this cool doc who’s not only a nutrition genius but also rocks a keto vibe, digs deep into regenerative agriculture. Kind of a game-changer.

Here’s the real tea: reintroducing animal products under the doc's guidance was like flipping a switch for my health. My energy levels went from ""barely there"" to ""let’s conquer the world,"" and those nagging health issues? They started to fade away, making it clear my body was missing out on something crucial. It was a humbling moment, realizing that maybe, just maybe, a one-size-fits-all approach to diet isn’t the key.

This doc opened my eyes to a different perspective—imagine, sustainable animal farming that’s kind to the planet *and* meets our nutritional needs. It was a lot to process, considering my commitment to veganism. But hearing about ethical ways to integrate animal products, and how regenerative farming can actually help heal the earth, got me thinking. Maybe there’s more to this story than I realized.

So here I am, reaching out to you guys. I’m all about growth and keeping an open mind. Is there a middle ground where we can meet our health needs, respect our animal pals, and still look out for Mother Earth? Has anyone else felt this health vs. ethics dilemma?

I think in some cases the accuser is the one with ulterior motives, but I think in many cases the accuser actually believes the comment was in fact dog whistling. And since dog whistles, by definition, cannot be heard by most it is impossible to prove one way or the other. It's like if somebody says ""you acted this way because of unconscious racism."" The difference of course being that the falsely accused person knows they weren't trying to dog whistle but they can't prove it. Because everything they say in defense is similar to what somebody who was trying to dog whistle would say. 

If it's blatant bigotry, it's not dogwhistling. And if it's not blatant bigotry, unless the person has outed themselves as a bigot, I see no reason to assume it's a dogwhistle.

Also, throwing cash around to people who will spend it will directly drive inflation if it’s done in a large enough quantity to make any difference.  Give all 330M Americans 1M dollars and the economy would fall apart completely.  People would quit lower paying jobs, now we don’t have those good being produced anymore and demand is high, so prices skyrocket.  Yea we could increase wages a little bit, but honestly if you take any major company and divide CEO wages by number of employees it turns to pennies per person.  Hell, divide net income by total employees and 2080 (full time annual hours) and you usually get just a few dollars an hour per person.  That’s the max they could do if they weren’t making anything at all.

Billionaires having massive funds and not spending them is no different than the government not printing extra money to throw in the streets.  It’s just numbers on banks’ ledgers.

The jealousy and anger is unreal, and doesn’t do anything productive.  A wealth tax just moves numbers around, it doesn’t increase productivity or increase supply of goods, which ultimately control prices.  The government can print a trillion if they want with no damage done to our currency.  Taking more from billionaires that aren’t spending isn’t an inflation proof way to raise money.  Inflation happens when that money is getting spent (demand) in higher volumes than supply can match.  Spend all their wealth at once and it would do the same thing as printing a few billion and spending it at once.

While there is an undercurrent of fear regarding the eventual sentience of AI, the more practical and current concern is how AI will eventually change the job market.

Companies are now laying off employees and replacing them with AI, like [Google firing 30,000 employees](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-plans-layoff-30000-employees-fight-between-ai-humans-nath-esj8c/). While some have speculated that AI won't take over the majority of jobs, only improving workflow, I find this thought to be naive.

AI is not the printer press, the cotton gin, or the automobile. While those innovations did replace certain industries (the automobile made blacksmiths and ferriers unnecessary since everyone eventually stopped riding around in horse and buggy), they also created new industries that increased production within the overall job market.

This is not what AI does. AI does not simply make one or two industries obsolete; it has the potential to make the *majority* of human workers in most industries obsolete. It does not have the means to increase production beyond what it takes away from the job market.

This isn't simply, ""Oh you lost your job due to innovation? You should find new skills."" Because beyond labor workers (construction, trade skills, military, etc.), *all* skills can eventually be done by AI and done better.

And people are skeptical saying, ""Well, it can't write code write now."" or ""The blogs it writes are terrible."" While that may be so, the exponential growth means that AI will eventually be good enough to replace the majority of white collar and creative jobs.

It's not simply a new innovation. It will eventually be (and I presume very quickly) an entire restructuring of work. Why should companies pay actual humans that are falable when they hire however many workers to run the AI and produce whatever the organization needs for exponentially cheaper?

Eventually, and I'm guessing within 15 years, AI will reshape the job market to the point where universal basic income will become a necessity for people to simply get money and survive.

I'm hopeful that someone can change my view on this because I certainly don't want this to happen. I would like the majority of people to keep their jobs, but I currently don't see a future where one of three things happen:

1. UBI is mandated.
2. Laws are passed that require companies to have X% of human workers.
3. A combination of the two."

However, I see that while in (Western) education there is a general consensus that, while individual student’s intrinsic motivation and openness to learning is crucial, partially it is also the responsibility of the educational establishment and educators to keep students motivated on their journey. I am not talking about gamifying everything - but about improving the material, improving teacher-student interactions, helping establish student (study-related) communities, trying to make learning - no, not a 24/7 fun ride, of course - but pleasant and rewarding, etc. This can be done in various ways depending on the type of establishment. 

With therapy, however, it seems like the expectation is that the client should come motivated to change. If they are not, then the therapist can just shrug and say “well… they were not ready! What a bummer! Tough luck indeed”. But that is insane. While keeping yourself motivated and interested in academic materials can be difficult, keeping yourself motivated to work on your mentality is even more difficult. It is very normal that a client does not feel intrinsically motivated to do that. Of course a therapist is never fully responsible for their client’s motivation, and it is impossible to ensure every client stays motivated (and that is very normal, no teacher has a 100% success rate either), but it sure as hell must be their job to help the client stay motivated, find out what motivates their brain to be more receptive to the techniques they are applying, helping to make sessions feel rewarding, etc. It is insane that one professional that directly works with one’s psyche can just sit back and exhume a deep thought(tm) that some people are not motivated to change. No shit Sherlock! You should be motivating them! That must be part of your job!"

I usually don’t like communism because it usually ends up with an authoritarian dictatorship with famines and killing of anyone that criticizes the government. However, Kerala is different, they are so much better than every other Indian states because they reap all the benefits of communism like collectivism and more central planning and redistribution of wealth, all while not suffering from the negative consequences of communism such as turning into a batshit insane authoritarian dictatorship that causes famines and kills anyone who criticizes the government like China and North Korea. This is because the Indian national government is watching over them and holding them accountable.

This seems to work well for Kerala, so as long as it’s instituted carefully in other states it should work, as long as the federal government is watching over them. Imagine how developed India would be if all states were like Kerala. However like I said earlier, the federal government needs to watch them to ensure they don’t become like North Korea or China."

Why do we force many of these people to suffer in pain versus giving them a humane way out of life?

If you have cancer, then they put you in Hospice, and they make you suffer and suffer and suffer until they give you the final dose. There is no death with dignity in this scenario. It’s the only model we have right now for people who are terminally ill.

The only option for people with severe anxiety or depression is just a bunch of pills that can make life even more unbearable from many. Sometimes there are treatment resistant problems. 

Many people live with chronic pain from something extremely serious, that is resistant to pain management, or any type of surgery, so is someone just supposed to lay around and scream and yell until they kill themselves? Doesn’t seem humane. 

So right now I think we have about 7 to 12 states that allow death with dignity, but I hear it’s extremely difficult, but at least those states allow it. Switzerland and a few other countries allow it as well, but I know it can cost up to $50,000 or more, I’m not really sure. 

If we had euthanasia clinics or death with dignity clinics in every state, and made death with dignity federally legal, then qualified people, could feel at rest and possibly be surrounded by their family and not carry around the stigma of suicide or have a painful death or have their family members be traumatized. 

Why do we make it so difficult? Well one would think that the doctors are just so, so nice and they just really want to make sure that you can get cared for. Primarily this is bullshit. The reason they have hospice patients is because they can make a lot of money from hospice patients. Why do they have clinics for people who have depression and anxiety, because there’s a lot of money in pills. Why do we have opioids and surgeries that never even work? Because there’s a lot of money in surgery and pills. 

If people have tried these things for a certain number of years, and they are done with life, why not help them out and give them that dignity?

There would be a cost associated with it, and obviously a screaming, so that the healthcare providers that would not be held responsible, but it shouldn’t cost so much money, and it shouldn’t take so much time.

No, this would not be for some young guy who’s lost his girlfriend or someone who’s even had a loss in the family, but for very extreme issues, like terminal illness, unresolved, depression, and anxiety or unrelenting pain.

But if this is bothering you, it is bothering me as much.  It’s no great mystery he misunderstands the west, that his strategy is founded on misapprehensions, that he is a creature of the Cold War and that he is extremely dangerous.  But I think he’s keeping nuclear brinksmanship in his tool box, and I think he thinks this is wise and prudent.  
A few members of Team Putin have already hinted at this already. Medvedev, certainly. There doesn’t seem to have been much editorial or official response to this, but I don’t think that tells us what is going on in the minds of Langley or the Pentagon as a result.   
So by whatever stratagem and with whatever end goal he’s really got, I think at some point Putin uncorks the nuclear genie, maybe. He rattles that rattle and sits smugly back, thinking and believing this will all work out.    
But to his horror and consternation, it doesn’t.  The West responds with equal if not greater menace.  At this point I’m not sure what would come next, but in all the chaos and confusion something could and probably would go wrong.    
And is not a chance to take.  This is why giving up on Ukraine, and by extension Europe, won’t appease or placate the Monster.  It hasn’t worked in the other conflicts.  It won’t work here.  He’ll keep going.  
If things get too difficult for him, the Russian President will use the threat of nuclear war as a last resort, expecting a climb down and accommodation from us.

1,2024-02-12,"CMV: In relation to white women, black men don’t benefit from anything that would be considered “male privilege”",u/Scary-Ad-1345,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1apfjtl/cmv_in_relation_to_white_women_black_men_dont/,changemyview,"I’ve been pondering this topic for a while now, especially after coming across several opinions online that made me question the common perceptions of “male privilege” and how it applies to black men versus white women. It’s a complex issue, and I think it’s worth dissecting a bit, especially with real-life experiences and some statistics to back it up. Let’s dive in.

Privilege and Perception

1a. Male Privilege: A common understanding is that men, by default, have certain advantages, like being promoted/hired without their capabilities being attributed to anything other than merit, and having their professional opinions taken more seriously.

1b. The Reality for Black Men: If a black man like myself gets promoted, there’s an immediate whisper campaign about affirmative action being the real reason, not my qualifications or hard work. And seriously, if you think black men are uniformly taken seriously in the workplace, I’ve got a bridge to sell you.

Assault and Safety

2a. Safety Concerns: A facet of male privilege is not having to worry about being sexually assaulted at the same rates as women.

2b. A Harsher Reality for Black Men: What isn’t often discussed is that black men are significantly more likely to be victims of physical assault or hate crimes. This isn’t just a statistic; it’s a daily concern that overshadows the supposed “privilege” of simply being male.

Representation and Isolation

3a. Being the Only One: It’s rare for men to be the only man in a professional setting, which is highlighted as a sign of male privilege.

3b. The Loneliness of Being the Only Black Man: I can tell you firsthand, being the only black man in a room full of white people is not just lonely; it’s downright alienating. At one point, among approximately 1500 management-level employees across 500 locations in my former company, I was the sole black man. Imagine being the only one in meetings with hundreds of managers. That’s not privilege; it’s isolation. (Yes, there was a meaningful % white female managers)

Trust and Emergencies

4a. Emergencies and Trust: Men are often not questioned about their reliability or intentions in emergencies in the way women are.

4b. Doubt and Discrimination: As a black man, any emergency I’m involved in comes with a default suspicion. Jail, dishonesty, you name it - I’ve been accused of it all without cause. This isn’t just hurtful; it contradicts the very notion of male privilege in my context.

Conclusion

The concept of “male privilege” is not one-size-fits-all. For black men, any perceived advantage is often undercut by the realities of racial discrimination and stereotypes. It’s essential to consider intersectionality and the ways in which race and gender interact to complicate the picture of privilege"

Patronize comes from Latin patronus ""protector, master,"" related to pater ""father."" So if you patronize a person, you talk down to them like a father might do to his child or a master to his apprentice.

The only reason for the creation of the word 'mansplain' is to re-gender a word that has evolved with the understanding that condescending behaviour isn't limited to men.

Also note:

* It ignores numerous instances where 'man' already exists as a gender neutral morpheme for person in words like manmade and woman

Let’s assume, for the sake of the argument, there’s no morals or stakes in the current massacre of Palestinian civilians happening. **You can blame whoever you want for it,** but that is a fact that can’t be denied, too many Palestinian civilians are dying.

Albeit, personal “Bias” should be obvious so consider that when you’re discussing things.

People are more than what the technological advancements of their nation. And I truly, truly, mean nothing by this, but folks like the Hamas and Hezbollah are just dudes with socks, sandals, ARs, and such. 

People are smart and 10/7 was, as far as reliable sources say, a successful military operation on their part. They infiltrated Israeli bases stationed by the border cage in a layout they’ve never been in before, delayed reinforcements, shocked israel’s military, and took hostages which they plan on using to barter the release of Palestinian hostages, and have. This is only to mean people are more than their technology and tech savvyness

Point is they aren’t concerned with convincing people like you. Not me, you. People like me have gone through enough at the hands of people like you to be biased towards their side, so they don’t need to convince black Americans as much as they ought white Americans or Europeans. But I’m sure I’m not 100% right, the exceptions are as lost as everyone else.

They are only concerned with their objective. However noble or evil you want to believe it is. They don’t have enough resources to convince useless citizens across the ocean that they are right and why they are right. Nothing we say or think matters to them because nothing we say or think will stop the money funneling from European and the US government directly into Israel.

Israel, on the other hand, needs to look like a victim. Whether or not they actually are is not important, they need to look that way long enough to gain a potential income source’s unconditional support. Like they have of the US. So 10/7, for example, needs to look as dirty as possible. Even if you feel if was unprovoked and terrible so many details regarding it have been disproved, tons of inconsistencies too.

They need it, and they also have the resources to do it. The tech savvyness and the connections to make sure anything they say gets boosted in mainstream media.

Hamas cannot win an information war against Israel. Vietnam still lost the information war against the US. Haiti lost the information war against France. Etc."

In the show 'The King of Queens"", Carrie is extremely misandrist and abusive to Doug, who is scared of his wife, and it's played as a funny thing. I was watching paternity court and whenever a man says something like ""Women love to trap men with babies"" the judge (a woman) will go off on them but then in a different episode will make statements like ""men will tell you whatever in order to get you in bed"". 

I think one of the good things is that it's starting to be talked about a bit more but the fact that there's still a debate about it is insane to me. I can't think of any other form of bigotry that is not only present but also defended in common society.

I have friends that are sexy. I have tried to pursue relationships with people who I find attractive. And in all of these cases I definitely had sexual thoughts about that person. I may have even masturbated to the thought of being with them.

And sure, this is all in my own mind. It’s only thoughts. But having these thoughts over and over again without the other person okaying it creates an unstated tension in the relationship. I want something from them that they may not want from me. And if they have made it clear that a sexual relationship is not appropriate either directly or by implication it is unfair to create any tension in the relationship by harboring secret fantasy.

*Example:* I dated someone briefly who I found insanely attractive. We had sex and it was amazing. Then she told me she wanted to the friends. I accepted this but for months afterwards I would privately jerk off to her instagram. But then I decided this was wrong and stopped.

A notable exception is sex workers. These individuals have a financial benefit from you being attracted to them, so it’s fine to fantasize about them. If anything, this helps them make more money. 

Other celebrities are a gray area. They know people are going to see them as sex objects, but most celebrities are mainly interested in their job or perfomance: acting, singing, dancing, whatever.

This one is rather unclear but I'll just play out scenarios like the Allies just letting the Nazis and Soviets battle it out till the Soviets lost and then the Allies fought and defeated the Nazis from there. Either way, the presumption holds there was no longer any communist Soviet influence following WW2 due to the collapse of the hegemony. 

Only geopolitical issue I could see still remaining would be China-US since China's communism was largely independent from the Soviets and there was also the Soviet-Sino split. But regardless China wouldn't have another massive ally on their side today if Russia was never communist 

Now I know some of you are gonna make the argument saying Russia was a major contributor to winning the war against the Nazis but if you think about it... could the Allies *still have won* without the Russians? What we do know is the Russians back then were already inevitably fighting the Nazis after Op. Barborossa so either way, they would have vastly weakened the Nazis for the Allies. "

My racist friend eventually apologized to me, and admitted he was wrong to form such assumptions of my race. If I had never befriended him, I could never have gotten him to change his mind

My transphobic friend eventually admitted she had never considered their feelings, and while she still has hurdles to cross, she at least sympathize with them more greatly

My religious pro-life friend also admitted she did not realize the circumstances behind abortions and what many pregnant women faced, and while she has not changed her religion, she has stopped demonizing pro-choice (and I hope in time, I can effect further change on her)

1,2024-02-12,CMV: I don't believe Christine Blasey Ford's story.,u/ChampionOfBaiting,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1apkihd/cmv_i_dont_believe_christine_blasey_fords_story/,changemyview,"The story about, of course, Brent Kavanaugh assaulting her at a party when they were young. The whole debacle reminds me of Smollett's story because of how weird the claims are, and I want someone to explain what I'm missing here that makes it plausible.

In short, nothing about her allegation makes sense to me if she were telling the truth, but it makes total sense if she made it up. I don't find her accusation to be ""credible"", a word I keep running into when looking her up, because my definition of ""credible"" involves proof beyond someone's say-so.

The ideal made-up story is unfalsifiable. There can be no crucial details that can be debunked and prove part of the story couldn't have happened. That's what makes me disbelieve Ford's accusation; no part of it is falsifiable, and every time an aspect of her story was disproven, she changed her story.

She doesn't know where it happened and she doesn't know exactly when it happened. She claims it happened at a house party with friends from her high school, but she claims to not remember where it was or even whose house it was. And none of her friends who have commented on her accusation remember any such party. Thing is, this should be *really* easy to figure out. The house must have belonged to someone in her high school or a friend of one of her friends, so all she'd have to do is pull out a yearbook and email whoever she could find with any details about the house she does remember. Like, ""whose house had the green carpet in the living room and all the paintings of birds on the walls?"" *Someone* would remember exactly what house that was. Finding out where the assault took place would be crucial for any investigation into the assault. So why hadn't she tried to locate it?

If her accusation were true, and she hoped this accusation would bring justice against a sexual predator, there's no reason for her to avoid locating the house when it would be so simple to do. But if her accusation were a lie, this is *exactly* what she would do.

If she were lying, and she claimed the assault happened at a house that she remembered one of her high school friends living in, that would introduce a falsifiable detail. If it turned out, for example, that her friend didn't live in that house at the time Ford claimed the assault happened, her whole story falls apart. She would have to pile on more lies to explain why she believed the assault happened in a different house than she remembered.

Of course, she did give *some* details about the house, and she's backtracked on almost all of them. She initially claimed the house was near a country club, but retracted that when it turned out none of the relevant parties had a house in that area. She also described a floor plan of the house, but backtracked on that as well after investigators couldn't find *any* house with her description.

She also gave an initial timeframe of the alleged assault, claiming it happened in the ""mid 1980's"", but after it was revealed Kavanaugh was in Yale since 1983, she revised her claim to the summer of 1982. Yet another detail that was re-remembered such that Kavanaugh remained the suspect.

Most bizarrely of all, to me anyway, is that she can't remember how she got to the party or how she got home afterwards. It's unlikely she walked, because if she had, it would mean she was so familiar with the area that she could navigate back to her home on foot, which would therefore make it a little incredible that she can't recall where the house was. So she must have been driven. But if she named a driver, or said she called a cab, that's a falsifiable detail. If she claimed a friend drove her, and that friend didn't remember ever driving a distraught girl with bruises from a party, that would look pretty bad for her case. If she called a cab, that's information that can be located by the authorities. Taxi companies may still have records from 1982, and if it turned out there were no calls to or from any of her acquaintances' houses that year, that would also suggest she was lying.

Let's assume Ford was assaulted and truly believes her story. The *only* detail she's claimed to be 100% certain of is that Kavanaugh assaulted her. This, to me, seems pretty absurd. When every other critical detail about the event has been false initially or conspicuously absent from her memory, it's clearly possible she's also misremembering the identity of the person who assaulted her.

My view is that she's lying. Someone who believes what they are saying wouldn't do their best to keep details too vague to investigate. They wouldn't change their story multiple times to ensure a particular person remains the suspect. I think her motivation was political, and intended to keep a conservative judge out of the SCOTUS. She happened to know him in high school, and used that connection to make a plausible-enough accusation against him in the hopes it would damage his political career. I do believe some people are craven enough to make their life a circus to take down someone they dislike. Reality TV is proof that there's a lot of people out there willing to do degrading things for 15 minutes of fame, and I think Ford is one of them.

I want to know: what is so convincing about her story that makes people believe her? What part of her allegation is credible? I want my view challenged here."

Americans are overworked and underpaid to a ridiculous extent. Somewhere along the way the 9 to 5 turned into the 8 to ""And We'll see how long we need you and you can't leave"". The cost of living is rising to sky high levels while wages have stagnated for the last 16 some odd years. 

Anyone who disagrees is either a boomer who no longer lives in reality, or is too young to have experienced true reality, or has found themselves in an incredibly lucky position in life and are looking down on others wondering why they are not just ""Working Harder"". 

And that's right, you heard me right. 

It doesn't just take hard work anymore to climb out of poverty. It takes a steady flow of good luck and meeting the right people. Being somewhere at the right time in the right place. Sure grit, hard work and determination may help you get better luck, but luck is still needed in this economy where the 1 and 2% own just about everything and are spending BILLIONS in government to get leverage for the things they want. 

The only possible thing I can think of to counter this is that giving people more money while less hours wont make the country competitive. Bullshit. Germany and Brittan have WAY more workers rights and representation and guess what, those countries currencies currently as I am writing this, have more spending power than the US dollar. It seems insane to me that we have people running for office (Not naming names) who want to raise the retirement age to 70 or older and people in the working class nod and agree with that. I think there is a concerted effort not to fix healthcare because people in this country want us to be literally worked to death. People are given the work load of 1.5 people and its steadily getting worse. 

I get that things don't have to be ""fair"" but having everyone under 35 not be able to afford housing ever in their lives and people just shrugging their shoulders and saying ""Meh, what are ya gonna do, this is the new normal"" while simultaneously raising rent prices so high that landowners can sit on their ass and retire comfortably at 50 making passive income while wanting to raise the retirement age for workers to 100 is nothing short of comical."

I am a genuinely a very accepting person and don’t want to be bigoted. I support LGBT rights and overall think people should be able to live and do what they like. 

That said, they/them pronouns, and variations of it (she/they), just don’t make sense. In public I don’t disrespect anybody and I will correctly call people by their preferred they/them pronouns to others in conversation, but it very often leads to confusion and an explanation that they prefer “they/them”. 

Example that happened to me today:

**Customer: Can you ask Alex for an ETA on that quote?

Me: Yeah, they said they’ll get it done later today

Customer: Oh, who else is working on it?

Me: No it’s just Alex. They’ll get it done today.**

My customer knows who Alex is but immediately (and I’d argue, fairly) got confused and then we both had to draw attention to the fact that Alex is different.

I know the retorts already 

- Yes, I understand that “they” can be used in the singular when talking about someone who’s gender is unknown. But it’s not typically used after you already know someone. It also has correct plural usage, for both people you know and people you don’t know. 

All of this leads to a lot of confusion. 

- Will people over time be able to pick it up using context clues? Sure. But wouldn’t it be both better and less intrusive to Alex if they had a singular or different pronoun that myself and others wouldn’t logically get confused by?

I’m not sure of a better solution, but I think they/them is actually doing more harm than good, even with people who want to support them."

We decided not to wear socks. He did say ""no homo"" but I whispered back ""yes homo"". At one point he was also fucking my skull as rough as humanly possible.

In my view, we as voters would be better served by specific, intentional negotiations in Congress to craft a solution to problems in their isolation that everyone can agree upon.

https://www.fastcompany.com/90252729/kids-arent-failing-school-school-is-failing-kids

There's also a racial aspect to this. With the naacp launching a lawsuit against one school district who kept passing a student, all the way through getting a diploma, while the student was functionally illiterate. The case claimed his civil rights were denied because he was not given an education.

https://edsource.org/2022/the-right-to-read-it-took-a-lawsuit-against-california/678069

Worth noting, students in predominantly white districts are often held to very different standards in the same state. Certain behaviors are tolerated and worse yet, actually getting worse grades is considered passing. This creates two tiers of an education system that's also based on race to a degree. 

But it gets worse. Because these students then come out of high school knowing less, but they go on to college, often going into debt, and then they quit after realizing they're nowhere near the level which it takes to pass a college level course. This sets up these students for even worse prospects in life. Worth noting, this is also why California quietly ended affirmative action admissions years ago  at many state universities. It was having negative repercussions for students of color. 

https://www.npr.org/2023/06/30/1185226895/heres-what-happened-when-affirmative-action-ended-at-california-public-colleges

Students who have learning disabilities or need special help can also request it in this system. It's called an IEP and this allows for accommodations for their disability. So a student can get extra time, or individual tutoring should they fall behind. If they really want to, they're going to pass. 

And this isn't even touching on the grade inflation we've seen on the last couple decades. C level work is now considered A level. Curriculums have been dumbed down to the point where showing up and doing the bare minimum is enough. Well, fsr less than the bare minimum. The numbers themselves are pretty shocking. Whereas it's common for predominantly white school districts to have around 85% on grade level, in many cities across the us this drops to just 25% of black students in cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland. 

https://www.realcleareducation.com/articles/2022/11/24/large_racial_reading_and_math_performance_gaps_persist_as_children_age_110794.html

The answer isn't to continue to just pass everyone with a heartbeat, but have actual repercussions for students. Of course some accommodations should be made and in some instances students should be able to retake certain tests, but overall as it currently stands, there's not much a school will do to a student who is far below grade level, and also having multiple absences. The approach now is just to push them along. This creates a situation that's worse for everyone. The student, the other kids in the class, the teacher, and the district."

Most classic example is current Palestine/Lebanon-Israel war. The organization that runs Palestine knows it can launch a war on Israel and not suffer any long-term drawbacks such as territorial losses. Once the war ends, nothing changes and a war could be started again in a few years. They do not fear war because it will have no long-term consequence on its people. 

An example from the past which actually prevented further war: In 1967, President Nasser of Egypt said in his famous speech, ""The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel."". This casued the wars in 1967 and 1973, of which the outcome was Israel capturing Egypt's Sinai. Then in 1979 a peace treaty was signed between Israel and Egypt based on returning the Sinai to Egypt. This treaty lasts to this very day. 

Russia has also shown it can invade Ukraine and not suffer any long-term consequence. It knows there's no real risk to its territories or statehood, so it can do whatever it wants. From the West point of view, the solution is to stop the war and behave as if it never happened.

In summary, there should be drawbacks to starting a war, otherwise war will never stop. The Western policy of ""Stop and lets pretend everything is fine"" simply doesn't work and gets taken advantage of. When a war breaks out, there should be long-term consequences on whoever started the war, otherwise it will just break out again in a few years."

First off, billionaires already contribute a massive chunk of their income in taxes. Like, way more than any of us will probably pay in our entire lives. 

Sure, their tax rate might be lower at times due to capital gains or other legal tax loopholes, but in absolute numbers? It's huge. They're contributing millions, if not billions, to our government's cotters.

Secondly, this common notion that every billionaire got rich by exploiting others just doesn't hold water. Yes, there are definitely some shady characters out there, but there are also those who've made their fortunes through innovation, providing services or products that we all love and use. Think of the industries who revolutionized how we communicate, or increased quality of life or those who've created thousands of jobs with their companies. It's not fair to lump all billionaires into the ""evil exploiter"" category.

I think we need to reevaluate this idea of slapping more taxes on billionaires simply because they are billionaires and f the rich. 

What are governments actually doing with that money or the money they currently to improve the wellbeing of people less fortunate, not a lot. So I don't expect them to when they tax billionaires.

Some of these statistics show that in some places Islamic people are more likely to advocate Sharia.

This kind of bigotry should be called out.

The same is true when people use statistics to say that black people are more likely to be criminals, or in gangs, and so on.

However ""men"" as a subgroup seems to be an exception. I think it's common to see people argue that it's obvious they aren't talking about all men, or that they are talking about all men because the good ones don't do enough. This is in discourse around gender based violence, where the statistics show that men are responsible for the majority of rapes, sexual assaults etc.

However, basing your view on men as a group on statistics is as flawed as basing your opinion of Muslims, blacks, and anyone else on statistics. It's by definition prejudice, and shoobe called out.

When you highlight that not all black people are criminals and that you shouldn't assume that from their race it is  socially just. The same goes for calling out prejudice against men based on statistics.

If there is a valid reason why men as a group should not be afforded the same mindset as other groups I should like to hear it."

Imo this could just be in the states but have heard a lot of how ""privleged,"" White men are in dating and think a lot of this is hugely overblown.

Basically be attractive, doesn't matter the race and being physically or Mentally Masculine is a plus."

Expressing anger or even ""fighting words"" not only has no bearing on how right you are, but in fact can often be acceptable or even correct and proper.",u/Jimithyashford,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1apvklk/cmv_a_ad_hominem_attack_is_fallacy_only_if/,changemyview,"TL:DR- It's not a fallacy to call someone a name or get rude and it doesn't mean you're wrong or have lost the argument. There are some topics where it is right and just and proper to get mad about them, especially when the polite approach has already been tried and hasn't worked. People like to weaponize cordiality and expectations of politeness to dodge issues and score hollow rhetorical victories.  


  
People on reddit (everywhere really, but Reddit seems particularly bad about it) REALLY like to spot an instance of name calling or overt rudeness in a debate and say something along the lines of ""oh I see you can't actually beat my argument, so you resort to name calling"" or overtly label it an ad hominem fallacy and use that to claim victory and end the conversation.   


So, I want to clear up a technical point, and then make a broader case.  


A Ad Hominem attack is only a fallacy if it's delivered INSTEAD OF an actual argument, not when delivered IN ADDITION TO one. So an easy simple example. If you say ""2+2=5"" and I just roll my eyes and say ""you're an idiot"" in response, well you may well be an idiot, but that would be an ad hominem fallacy. I did not reply in a substantive way other than to insult you. However, if I say ""No, 2+2=4....you idiot"" then that is not an ad hominem fallacy. I responded to your point AND ALSO expressed my disdain for your stupidity. They are not mutually exclusive; you can do both.

&#x200B;

I find that often on Reddit when people cite the ad hominem fallacy or try to claim victory in an argument because the other person name called, that usually there was an actual argument being made, it was just accompanied by some language of frustration. 

Moreover, I think a lot of people, maybe more subconsciously than as a deliberate conscious strategy, have developed a reflex in online argument to weaponize frustration in pursuit of purely rhetorical victories. As in, if you can stay calmer longer, the first person to express frustration or exasperation somehow is the loser. Of course, that ""victory"" is meaningless, as it did not derive from any actual refutation of the other person's position in the argument, you just managed to be insufferable long enough to annoy the other person out of cordiality.   


And lastly, I think the expectation that, no matter the topic, people always maintain an air of polite cordiality while debating, can sometimes be incredibly insulting and is an expectation that can only dictated from a position of nauseating privilege. What do I mean?   


If the topic on hand is, for example, the % sales tax increase to be levied to fix local potholes, then ok, we should be able to politely disagree and debate that. But if the topic is one that substantially impacts the life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness of some group, as in this topic has or will have a major impact on the quality of their lives, or maybe even in some cases the existence of their lives, then there is a perfectly natural human expectation that they would get their dander up, and that would be expressed in their language. Not only do they have a right to get angry, if polite conversation isn't doing the trick, they almost have a duty to get angry, to fight for the cause with all due anger on behalf of those that will also be impacted but don't happen to have that stage at that moment.   


The easiest and cheapest example is the jews in pre-ww2 Germany. The holocaust didn't just suddenly happen, a long series of gradual encroachments on their liberties lead up to it. Anyone who would have admonished the German jews for getting rude, who would have insisted they politely debate and remain cordial while arguing about the dissolution of their rights and their ultimate extermination, would have been a monster. Such an injunction would have only served the purpose of empowering the villains, catering to their conversational comfort while they debated the merit of doing this terrible thing.

&#x200B;

Somewhere between the extremely imminent and personal and impactful example of the Jews in Germany, and the extremely dispersed and impersonal and mundane example of sales taxes for potholes, lies the threshold where it becomes acceptable to get angry and use fighting words. I can't tell you EXACTLY where that line falls, but I believe it does exist, and I usually know it when I come across it."

14,2024-02-13,CMV: The film “Lost In Translation (2003)” offers a theme never seen before in cinema.,u/DougieSlug,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1apwm6s/cmv_the_film_lost_in_translation_2003_offers_a/,changemyview,"“Lost In Translation” by Sofia Coppola is probably my favorite film of all time.

It's an impressionistic film. It's a vibe film. Likewise, it's a film where many people will (understandably) say that they don't get it. The critic Roger Ebert said it was on a frequency that most people might not be tuned into at first viewing.

“Lost” is a keyword here. And the title is a clever pun, but instead of Translation, it more like Transition.

The film depicts an EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIP instead of a PHYSICAL one. This is a rarity as a main theme of a film. A relationship that is never consummated. It shows the bond between two people that mimics the closeness and emotional intimacy of a romantic relationship. It's not depicted as long term, but as an unspoken quickie affair. There is a level of absolute sweetness about. When you need someone... anyone.

The intimacy of the film are the quiet moments of making a connection with someone. Instead of the cliché of sex, we are shown two people laying on a bed and simply talking about life.

I feel like people in their life have waaaaay more emotional relationships in their lives, rather than physical ones. It's not something that is frankly ever talked about.

Those people you look up on social media once a year to see how they are doing in life. They might still be in your lives, or maybe they naturally drifted away.

Maybe it's that 2nd grade crush...

That person in high school or college...

That coworker or friend...

I've thought a lot about traditional love stories in Hollywood films, and I can't think of many that get close to Lost In Translation.

Obviously, there is a bit more going on in the film, but I have always been very impressed that this type of theme was captured in a film.

2,2024-02-13,"CMV: Mardi Gras in New Orleans is, at its core, a racist and wasteful tradition, and should either be massively overhauled or abandoned.",u/9to5Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1apx9tz/cmv_mardi_gras_in_new_orleans_is_at_its_core_a/,changemyview,"Happy Mardi Gras! Let's get spicy. I've seen many Mardi Gras parades now, and recently read a book about the history of the tradition in New Orleans, and have concluded that though it may be fun and bring tourists dollars into the city (though the overall net benefit of Mardi Gras to New Orleans is a much more complex argument than many want to have) it is still at its core racist and obviously wasteful. 

Racism:

Mardi Gras grew out of secret society - esque luncheon clubs that only wealthy white men could enjoy. There was also many members who were also part of the Klan throughout these clubs histories. To this day, the majority of the club members are white men, and many of the float riders wear costumes that look eerily similar to a klansmen outfit. Some of the costumes are even [white](https://previews.123rf.com/images/slugnola/slugnola1106/slugnola110600046/9868022-a-white-knight-adjusts-his-mask-while-getting-ready-to-ride-in-a-mardi-gras-parade-in-new-orleans.jpg). Yes, they aren't quite the same, but given the historical context of Mardi Gras and the south generally, it's a very small leap to make. Secondly, most of the clubs (krewes) have issues with riders throwing racially charged items, such as confederate flags, maga hats, etc. Locals will brush this off as something that is always the case... but does that matter? It reminds me of [Black Pete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwarte_Piet) in the netherlands. To this day, many Dutch will defend the use of black face because its part of their tradition. To that I say, time to change your tradition.

Wastefulness:

A key element of a Mardi Gras parade are the ""throws"". These are the beads and other items float riders throw to the crowds. Over a four week period, you can imagine how many plastic beads and other useless trinkets are thrown to crowds. There are some attempts to reduce waste, but the best and easiest way would be to simply stop doing this. Remove the market for all of these throws, and don't add to the the landfills in a city and state that is already in constant environmental disaster mode.

So, to my mind, the options are to cancel, or overhaul. If cancelled, New Orleans would lose one of its key economies, but may find that it was diverting so many public funds (and the time and money of the wealthy locals who are in these clubs) could be used for the many public needs of the city. The other option is overhaul. To that I think there are two key important factors. 

1) Ban anything remotely resembling a klansmen outfit, and ban all masks and secrecy. 

2) Ban all throws. Parades run as they usually do, riders just wave to the crowds."

Easy access ensures timely interventions, reducing risks to women's health and well-being. Restricting access disproportionately affects marginalized communities, exacerbating inequalities. Accessibility respects bodily autonomy, empowering individuals to make informed choices about their lives. It promotes safer procedures, minimizing the need for dangerous alternatives. Ultimately, it upholds human rights by affirming individuals' control over their bodies and futures.

For the record, agree it’s a baby the second it’s conceived. I just don’t give a shit lol. it’s your baby do what you want, it’s not my problem. If you allow for more abortion, it will get rid of the irresponsible useless parents giving birth to kids cause they will abort.

Additionally, if you kill an animal, you should either receive life in prison or the death sentence. This should be for factory, farmers, or for people who harm and abuse animals for fun. The only way killing an animal should be legal would be in a highly ethical and organic manner so the animal is not  abused during their lives.

Factory farming should be outlawed. Hunting for sport should be outlawed circuses should be banned, using animals for entertainment should be banned as well.

I see so many cats and dogs or farm animals or any animal being abused for fun or because someone is mentally damaged. These people usually get a little slap on the hand or a couple of months in jail. Why is such a short time? The short time is certainly not a deterrent. if we find someone who’s abusing their dog or cat, they should be held accountable for it in a very severe and harsh way.

Also, if you neglect your animal, the animal should be taken away. Not enough people are responsible pet owners.  Just like we have adult protective services or child protective services there should be an animal protective services. I believe there is PETA and a few other organizations, but it doesn’t seem to be very helpful, as I constantly sea, animal abuse, and neglect, and the site a factory farming completely has me traumatized.

I am not a vegan, but I wish I was. I try to only eat organic meat, and even then I sit there, thinking if that animal was abused or not. I don’t know how people go through life just going through and eating drive-through meat or chicken, knowing that that animal was so terribly abused. 

I think if someone harms an animal, Lake, skins a dog or a cat, they should essentially get the death penalty, or spend life in prison. Because at the end of the day, most likely, a human will be next on their list. I don’t think that there is any rehabilitation for people who harm animals, much less people. 

I know this is a radical view and hypothetical, but I hope at some point, we hold responsible these awful people. Animals can love. Animals can comprehend, animals have hearts. I love animals more than I do people. 

Maybe this is not the right place for this, but I always wondered why people who abuse and harm animals are usually just not sentenced at all. Or if they are, it’s for a very short time. 

I believe there are some states who have ramped up there, abuses, but in a red state, where I live, there’s really no protection for the sweet animals."

“The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum — even encourage the more critical and dissident views.

23,2024-02-13,"CMV: News reports of small, individual incidents should not be covered by national/international news sources.",u/TheSambassador,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aq0x4p/cmv_news_reports_of_small_individual_incidents/,changemyview,"If you look at the front page of /r/news , more often than not you'll see a lot of local, isolated incidents. [Here's what it looks like right now](https://imgur.com/a/ZDl1UE5) - at least 4 of the top 20 posts are one-off clickbait articles (marked in red) and maybe another 3 that have questionable value to a non-local audience (marked in yellow). ""Parents fuming after Montreal-area teacher allegedly lists students' art for sale online"" is #3. ""Warrant: 12-year-old boy found cold, stiff at NC wilderness camp"" is #7. Is there any actual value in reporting these incidents to a national or even international audience?

The world seems to be more and more afraid - afraid of other people, afraid of scary group X, afraid of diseases that might not even exist. People feel like violent crime is on the rise, even when statistics show the opposite. I think this fear comes from the constant exposure to the entire world's terrible events, even the small stuff that happens thousands of miles away. This type of news reporting fills us with a constant feeling of dread and allows us to be easily manipulated into false beliefs about the world. Covering these small news stories leads to a lot of problems:

- It's easy to push a specific narrative through selective coverage. Want to push islamophobia? Publish every random incident of a Muslim immigrant attacking someone, but don't cover the violence committed by other groups. Want to make people think that trans people are a huge problem? Report on every time that a trans athlete wins something (and ignore all of the times that they don't). These stories almost always ignore context and don't report actual statistics, and they're usually emotionally charged in some way. 

- We have a finite amount of attention to give to news, these stories overwhelm our attention and allow more important news to slip by. 

- Excessive coverage of terrible things happening in the world erode our faith in humanity and promote an unhealthy sense of nihilism. If you're only shown terrible examples of human behavior (without mentioning the actual statistics and/or context of that behavior), why bother trying to improve things or help people?

- These problems are even more exaggerated with news sharing/aggregation on sites like Reddit or Facebook, as they encourage people to only read headlines and to overlook news sources.

I believe that these one-off incidences should really only be covered by local news, and they shouldn't be shoved into headlines read by far away readers unless they actually have some significance to that audience. I'm aware that this is where things get murky - how do you define ""significance""? At a bare minimum, if a national news organization is showing me an article about a random incident between a few people across the country, they need to provide a wider context and address why it's an important event that non-locals should care about. 

There's one place where my view gets tripped up, and it's why I'm posting this CMV. There have been small, isolated incidents whose coverage becomes symbolic of actual, larger issues. The murder of George Floyd is an example - without the horrific coverage of his death, we might not be having a national conversation about justice reform. Obviously we had had plenty of articles and evidence of police brutality before George Floyd, but the first hand videos of the event forced America face to face with a major issue. We do need to be aware of issues in order to face them, and this type of coverage did help us get more aware.

It's not useful for anyone to read an article about a random mom killing her children 2000 miles away. Instead, publish an article that looks at the statistics of parent-child killings, common warning signs, and places where resources for parents could be improved to address possible causes."

They couldn't be denied access by law and if ever a government body tried to keep them out it would instantly be huge news.

When a reporter in the White House press briefing room complains that none of his questions (or the questions of many of the smaller media outlets) are being answered the mainstream media shout him down because they need to maintain their ""access"" to the White House.

When the media needs to cultivate access they are no longer independent.  When the media needs to chase an audience they are no longer reporting the news and trying to minimize the bias in their reporting.

The BBC News has beat reporters and doesn't need to chase money.  They can be run like an old school news agency.  They could have access by law.  If one less biased agency was reporting a story that the mainstream media is suppressing the mainstream media would be shown to be corrupt so they would have to at least do a better job of being actual news people to not be embarrassed.

He was less hawkish than most and seemed to know exactly what he was elected to do. China releasing that virus screwed our country and Trump got blamed, except the only criticisms never seemed to have a better solution, just Trump is bad.

Biden has been a terrible president and the policies have been hot garbage. The Afghan withdrawal, the war in Gaza, the blank check the USA writes Ukraine, the open border invasion.

It shows a case of “southern justice” and rounding up the usual suspects. 

All the clichés of bad police work — false confessions, losing evidence and tainting the crime scene.

A ridiculous trial that involved witchcraft, Satan, occult, Metallica and Stephen King!

A tragedy, as it appears that Jesse Misskelley is borderline “mentally-retarded” (a phrase we no longer use in society).

A super tragedy that Jason Baldwin looks completely out of place here. Most viewers can look at this young man, and realize deep-down in their gut that he got caught up in the Salem Witch Trial vibes. There isn't anything that has ever manifested beyond a very questionable confession that even places him at the murder. Super smart and aware young man. His biggest crime seems to be that he liked Metallica, and barely knew Echols.

My issue with the case is why it feels like it was either the three… or none at all. They were technically tried separately. 

The documentary does leave out a few keep pieces and a big chunk of narrative.

I don't think the pro-WM3 media ever really went into who Damien Echols was. They really couldn't.

He was a very disturbed young man. He was considered a menace to society. 

Damien had been suspended from school several times for fights and starting fires. At one point, almost gouging out the eyes of another student with his fingers.

Stints in juvenile detentions centers with written reports of attacking another child, and sucking blood from his wounds and rubbing it on his face.

Hospitalized numerous times for suicidal intent. One stint lasted a month.

He is institutionalized. The disturbing mental illness continues, I can't even list all his issues. When you read this long list, it's almost unbelievable.

https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/summary-of-damiens-mental-health-history.134624/

My question is this. Even if the trial was complete bullshit, why aren't we ever allowed to question if Damien Echols was involved? His medical/illness history isn't mentioned much in the documentaries. It's just framed that he was a typical outsider kid… he wasn't.

We are led to believe that various parents and “Mr. Bojangles” are likely explanations for the murders, but Damien is off limits.

When we look at school shooters, we see all these behavior clues.

Then again, the documentaries and advocates for the WMP make it clear that Damien had zero possibility of committing these murders.

In my younger years (I'm only joking, I am 24), I used to go out to the bars and clubs with my friends. I had not been to a bar or a club in the past 2 years, but my friends spontaneously wanted to go one night. I have never been a big drinker and had not had a drink in over a year, so I did not see the point in drinking.  
  
My sobriety during the evening opened my eyes. Men and women behave a lot like animals. The club/bar setting is a perfect example. Ritualistic dancing and substance intoxication, all in hopes of attracting a potential mate. The way the men break from their ""pack"" to approach a group of women or the way women will dance provocatively to entice people's attention, seems something akin to our long lost ancestors.  
  
This initial realization has only expounded. For example, I saw a road rage incident this morning. The anger and idiotic behavior of one person directed at another all for a simple traffic miscommunication, seems overtly aggressive.  
  
I think that people disillusioned themselves with the idea that humans have become something ""more"" than animals. If you strip away the façade of society though, we are really all animals masquerading as something else."

Okay. So I won't make it too long, but I've held this position for years and it has recently been crystallized into a more clear and communicable idea, after Robert Sapolsky's new book came out (and he has done a whirlwind tour of podcast interviews that I have consumed).

I want to start with what this CMV is NOT:

* It's not an attempt to argue that free will does not exist,
* It's not a discussion about the deterministic universe
* It's not an argument that not believing in free will makes you inherently more moral or a better person.

I also want to generally exclude discussions of 'compatibilism', as the idea that free will is a descriptor of behaviour, while interesting,  is not the kind of free will I am talking about. I am talking about Libertarian Free Will (that we have some ability to act outside of the influence of the natural, material world).

What it IS, is a post where I make the argument that to be a person who holds moral beliefs that I think the majority of human (or maybe specifically western) society aligns with, discarding the belief in Free Will is incredibly helpful. Further, it aligns with many of the ideas that we increasingly share about empathy, compassion, and justice.

CMV: Believing we lack 'free will' allows us to approach harmful behaviors with more understanding and focus on solutions, thus creating a more compassionate and just society.  Let me give an example...

When we think of people as products of their environments and genetics, then we are more capable of navigating their behavior in a way that does not blame them when something goes 'awry'. For this example, let's say a 40-year-old man was arrested for a violent outburst in a shopping center. People think he is disgusting and maybe say all kinds of not-nice things about his character. Then you find out that he suffers from CTE from a life of playing football. Ah well... okay we know more about CTE and how it impacts you, so maybe he's not a monster, but still, that's what you get for playing football. Ah then you found out he grew up in a very poor neighborhood with poor schooling, but genetically was predisposed to being quite large and this was a way for him to provide for himself and his family. Hmmm... okay maybe less of a monster. And we can go on and over and find that often, these people that we think are terrible or who are doing terrible things, are products (like we all are).

This view doesn't negate or ignore the need for consequences. The CTE example illustrates the difference. We  understand he might require intervention or restrictions, not necessarily out of blame, but out of necessity to protect both himself and others. Our responses might include things like treatment, restrictions, or reintegration programs. Additionally we should look at the situations that caused him to get there in the first place, like football protective gear, or the incentivization structure in and of itself – the point isn't to ignore bad acts, but to focus on solutions that go beyond simplistic retribution.

This view aligns with society's growing focus on empathy and understanding root causes of problems. However,  people struggle with applying it to extremists like Nazis or terrorists. I argue that it's  most essential in these cases. Understanding complex circumstances leading to harmful ideologies helps us dismantle them without demonizing individuals. This isn't about excusing actions, but about more effective societal and rehabilitative responses that actually prevent future harm.

Lots of people I know find this view uncomfortable, and I want to understand why. It often feels like people agree with me on one level, but don't want to fully accept the implications. Thank you for reading this and please, feel free to change my view."

 I've been thinking a lot about the disparities in support for various causes and I'm hoping to have an open and respectful discussion about it. I've noticed that, at times, it seems that there is more widespread and passionate support for causes such as rescuing nearly extinct animals and promoting pet adoption in comparison to causes that directly address poverty and hardship especially in third world countries, especially the challenges faced by black people. Like what's the point of saving animals when actual people you can talk to are dying everyday. 

I'm curious about the possible reasons behind this discrepancy. Is it because campaigns for saving animals and promoting pet adoption are often more visible and accessible through social media and other platforms, therefore gaining more attention? Or could it be that these causes resonate more with certain communities and that contributes to the difference in support?

I fully understand that both animal welfare and addressing poverty and hardship in third world countries are important issues, and they represent just a small part of the overall picture. I'm genuinely interested in hearing your thoughts and insights on why certain causes seem to garner different levels of support and how we can work towards creating more balanced awareness and assistance across various societal issues."
1,2024-02-13,CMV: Only men can naturally be considered 10s...,u/geemav,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aq82pu/cmv_only_men_can_naturally_be_considered_10s/,changemyview,"Every woman that's socially deemed as a 10 on the rating scale at the *bare minimum* has a full face of makeup. I'm talking about a general consensus 10 at a club or on tv, even your favorite celebrities. Sure male celebrities wear makeup sometimes too, but it's not a requirement for their attractiveness. And in every day life if a stunning man is around it's almost guaranteed no artificial enhancements are involved. 

Consider if Megan Fox appeared in a movie without makeup; it would likely spark widespread discussion in the media due to the stark contrast. Even *beautiful* or *hot* woman in everyday life generally have tons of enhancements like hair extensions, dyes, eyebrow threading, facial treatments and even urgeries are ever common today: breasts, tummies, bootys - you name it.

Now I don't blame women for any of this, societal beauty standards have been harsh for them. My only point in this being, only men are really ""natural 10s"" where it's just the traits their genetics gave them and nothing else and they can still be seen as the best looking in the room or max on a rating scaled. Every time a woman is a ""10"" (Victorias Secret model, singer, movie star, or woman at the bar) she is guaranteed to have at least several artificial beauty enhancements.

I want to clarify that I'm not saying woman can't be beautiful naturally, but the top reserved spots of beautiful woman have a lot involved in their beauty."

Before you accuse me of being a Trump shill, in 2020 I voted split ticket (yes we exist). But for president voted for Biden. 

My question is for those who think Trump incited an insurrection on Jan 6. What makes you think that? Because I just watched Trumps speech right before the capitol was broken into and I just don’t see it.

Below are some quotes I collected from the speech.

“I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the capitol building, to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard”

“We’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we’re going to the capitol. And we’re going to try and  give… the Democrats are hopefulness they’re never voting for anything, not even one vote. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans… the weak ones because the strong ones don’t need any of our help, we’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I want to thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.”"

https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2021/10/05/rising-share-of-u-s-adults-are-living-without-a-spouse-or-partner/

Divorce rates are through the roof. Do I need to provide a citation for that? I think we all know that. Anyway, I believe this is because the government incentivizes single parenthood via divorce/alimony laws and the welfare state. If you are telling woman that if you divorce your husband or leave the father of your children the government will pay you, than what other outcome do you expect? This is evident because most woman initiate divorce. Here is one citation for that and you can google it yourself.

“Nearly 70 percent of divorces are initiated by the wife. In addition, over 50% of divorced wives never want to remarry while only about 30% of men express that same sentiment.”

https://www.thejimenezlawfirm.com/what-percentage-of-divorces-are-initiated-by-the-wife-2022/

Now I think most woman reading this most likely object to this because why wouldn’t you? You’re the ones benefitting. However, In life there are no solutions only trade offs. You may be happy you get to benefit from divorce laws benefitting you but the trade off is now men don’t want to get married! Kids are growing up in broken homes which statistically leads to mental health issues. This is destroying our society. I believe an adjustment to divorce laws must happen. Off the top of my head I think a solution could be: 

1. If you initiate divorce you do not receive alimony. Unless instances of abuse or unfaithfulness can be proven in court.

2. If a man is unfaithful you pay alimony guarantee. If a woman is unfaithful you don’t get alimony.

3. More government benefits to stay in marriage. Maybe milestone benefits idk im just thinking off the top of my head.

Anyway if you guys disagree then change my view."

I am only stating the facts I am aware of, as best I know them -- I would love to learn more that makes me rationalize the US/NATO's position.   
  
For starters -- a large majority of individuals in Crimea (almost 75%) want to be part of Russia. A majority of those in the Donbas want to be Russian as well. This is not true of Western Ukraine -- who pretty much unilaterally wants to remain a sovereign nation (about 95% i think). Russia taking claim to these areas, which largely would prefer to be under Russian control, doesn't seem like an issue we should be involved in.  
  
After the dissolve of the USSR, there was largely an expectation that Russia and the west could productively exist, and that the west would be more proactive in opening their arms to Russia. The West hasn't been particularly interested in this thus far, and far as I can tell, hasn't operated in particularly good faith.  
  
NATO always agreed they would not move further East towards Russia. Nato has reneged on that promise several times. In 1999 Nato added Czechia, Poland and Hungary. In 2004, NATO added Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. In 2009, NATO added Albania and Croatia. In 2017 they added Montenegro, in 2020 NATO added Macedonia, and in 2023 NATO added Finland and Norway.  
  
Russia has a legitimate reason to be weary of the democracies of the West. After all -- Hitler came to power legally under a Democratic Constitution. The cold war also went on for 44 years, and didn't end until 1991. Russia has a reason to be skeptical of the west.  
  
NATO has developed and deployed a massive missile arsenal surrounding the western and southwestern border of Russia. Though the proposed reasoning for developing said missile system was to defend against Iran, a basic map of the locations of said missiles makes this statement questionable. Furthermore, Russia initially requested to be part of the development of said missile defense system, and NATO rejected them.  
  
The US is already facing an absolutely insurmountable national debt. We have many crises we are facing at home. The debt we accrued fighting wars that weren't ours to fight in the middle east still hasn't been paid. We have had 20 years to see how the ""war on terror,"" turned out. The resulting loss of life, the expense, and the absolutely abysmal withdrawal. Why are we getting involved in another conflict?  
  
The current regime in Ukraine was largely influenced by the west. The US sunk nearly $5 billion into democracy education in Ukraine between 1991 and 2014. When the Ukrainian government was overthrown there in 2014, it was a move that was largely supported, and even funded, by the West. This new government was far less Russia friendly than the government of the past. Russia, somewhat rightfully, saw this as further action by the west to alienate them.  
  
Why have we spent $75 billion protecting another countries borders when we fail to protect our own? A wall at the southern border would cost +/- $20 billion. We have spent almost 4 times that in Ukraine already. FWIW, I am firmly pro immigration. But I am pro legal immigration. Far too many criminals are being let in unvetted, and the southern border is allowing massive amounts of fentanyl into the country.  
  
I'm sure there is situation is far more nuanced that what I've outlined above. And furthermore, I am well aware that Putin is a terrible human. From murdering his political opponents, to his treatment of marginalized groups, Putin is nobody I am trying to shower with praise in any way shape or form. That being said, I do think Russia has been somewhat provoked to take the steps they have. Furthermore, I am not in favor of sending American dollars, and certainly not in favor of sending american boys/men, to die on the front lines of Ukraine. And finally -- Putin's approval rating in Russia is nearly 80% -- meaning his people must generally support the direction he's taken their country.   
  
Once again -- I am no supporter of the regime in Russia -- it is essentially a dictatorship at this point. Politically, I am about as libertarian as it gets. But as far as I can tell -- the US and Nato have in may ways been throwing shit at Russia since the USSR dissolved. "
0,2024-02-13,"CMV: If you believe that Loli hentai should be banned, then you should also support all other forms of Porn being banned.",u/MrScandanavia,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqa8d8/cmv_if_you_believe_that_loli_hentai_should_be/,changemyview,"On reddit, and online especially I often see people make the claim that 'Loli hentai' (Drawn porn featuring child characters) ought to be banned online. To many this seems like an attractive position, after all child porn is disgusting, is it not? Yet most of the time someone points out that Loli Hentai is not actually real porn, no person or child was harmed in its making, and thus it isn't the same as supporting child porn, which causes actual harm to children. Typically, after this point a opponent of Loli argues that even if no child is harmed in loli it is still bad because it contributes to the sexualizing of children, which can lead to further harm.

That last argument leads me to this post, in a generalized form it states that even if consuming something doesn't create harm in and of itself (i.e. directly supporting child rape) it can still be immoral or deserving of being banned if it promotes things that actually cause harm. If this is the argument then this equally applies to almost all porn.  Take for example consensual non-consent. No one is harmed in the making of it, yet according to the logic of this argument it ought to be banned because it normalizes and promotes rape. Additionally this argument should support banning porn entirely, as many many many studies have shown how porn consumption contributes to the development of negative views regarding women. Even if the porn was produced ethically, according to this logic the narratives it creates about women still make it immoral. So if someone opposes Loli content on these grounds they should admit to opposing all porn entirely.   


And just a disclaimer. I do not enjoy or watch Loli content. I don't believe it is morally wrong, but it isn't up my alley. So don't come at me claiming I am a pedophile or something, I am just making this post because I like philosophical and logical argument.

Well, the USA is the last one and I can prove it easily by using the North American Sports leagues as a template. And you can believe me that the same template applies for the banking system, for the medical system, for the legal system, for the political class, and for big business. Those are all just ""more complex"", and they hide it better. 

The sports leagues however are totally out in the open as overtly socialist for the super-wealthy but applying unrestricted and shameless capitalism on the poor. 

Firstly, the North American professional sports leagues are a 100% CLOSED membership club. You cannot enter in any way shape or form, except in extremely unusual exceptions which are called ""expansion"". They literally prohibit free entry, the complete antithesis of a free market.  This complete suppression of competition is also how the medical system, university system, legal system and many big business niches keep their grip on power.

Second, near complete discouraging of merit, and promotion of mediocrity and laziness.  Sports leagues in virtually all other countries are at least partially more meritocracy oriented, with the exceedingly poor teams relegated to a lower league due to poor performance, and  the rewarding of clubs with good management and results to promotion to the top league. North American leagues have an egregiously regressive system, in which not only is mediocrity subsidized, but actual professional ineptitude is ENCOURAGED. The worst you perform, the more money you will get to offset poor ticket sales (revenue sharing), and on top of that if you perform WORST of all, you get to pick the best young players entering the league. WHAT??? Imagine any of us individuals getting rewarded with more welfare the less we work, and even getting a nice apartment if we do the least amount of effort. It is shocking so many Americans who would oppose subsidizing failure and laziness on individuals so blindly supported for extremely wealthy clubs. This same thing happens in banking and big business with BAILOUTS, trade barriers, etc. It happens in the educational system with unions and restrictive licensing, it happens in the legal and medical system with a perverse for-profit industrial complex that feeds everything from traffic tickets to a plethora of contrived legal squabbles to suck people into the system. Everything must have lawyers and lawsuits. In the medical system, the medical facilities feed costumers to the big pharma, and big pharma feeds customers to the medical facilities. 

Third, while on the top side these very wealthy organizations and individuals who own them keep the club completely closed, discourage any attempts at competition, and have the most generously socialist system rewarding failure and subsidizing mediocrity and lack of fans, on the other say they apply the most based forms of capitalism imaginable. $30 for basic parking, $20 for a cheap hot dog, anything that can remotely be extra is charged extra. They don't charge for air because they have yet to quantify it. Let's not even begin with ticket prices. Again, the fiercest capitalism is applied to the least wealthy participants, with lavish and obscene socialist policies apply for those at the top. 

The North American leagues are an overt, in the open microcosm of how the entire economic complex is actually run in the USA. It is a socialist country and not even recently, for several decades now. But socialist for the highest net worth individuals, which conversely apply the most capitalist policies on everyone else.

I’ve been assaulted more times than I can count by women but the numbers wouldn’t represent that. I’m constantly told by women that my experiences with sexual assault are not valid and that as a man I’ll never understand the fear a woman has to experience. I’ve been forced to penetrate in my sleep, I’ve also been inappropriately touched as a minor by older women. Lastly something that’s never happened to me, but has happened to a number of friends. They’ve been lied to about the nature of a pregnancy, they’ve been lied to about contraception. They’ve had holes poked in the condom. Those things should qualify as assault.

My main argument previously for abortion was that I don't believe anyone should be forced into parenthood. Especially young individuals who really have no concept of how to be a parent and are not mature enough to raise a child. I think it's morally wrong to set up a seventeen year old with a newborn and then expect them to be productive in society as if that isn't a huge anchor on their ability to be successful. However, the reality is that there are millions of parents in the United States alone who are unable to have children of their own and would adopt a newborn in a heartbeat. It takes years to get through the adoption program and get a baby of their own, and there are far more parents looking to adopt than there are abortions in the United States every year. In fact, the market for babies is so great that there is a thriving criminal element where impoverished women across the globe are taken advantage of by criminal organizations to 'sell' their babies to desperate parents who simply are unable to have one of their own. I still am fully of the belief that it's wrong to force someone to be a parent, however there are more than enough people willing to take those children in and give them a happy life, and it would undermine the criminal element.

The most common argument is always the 'My body, my choice' discussion. The fact of the matter is that the baby has its own DNA and is fully an independent biological organism. They exhibit behavior and thoughts well before birth and are physically active and respond to external stimuli. But let's set that aside for the moment. In order for me to accept the 'my body, my choice' argument, I would need to see a compelling reason why nine months of inconvenience is more important than saving a life. And I have not seen an argument that satisfies that requirement. Every pro-life organization in the United States that I'm aware of has exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape, incest, or that threaten the life of the mother. So in situations where the woman had no choice in the intercourse, I agree with abortion exceptions. These types of pregnancies are an extraordinarily small percent of the abortions that take place, and I already agree that there should be these exceptions, like every pro-choice group, as I said.

Finally, we get to the main point, which is that abortion should be illegal. Roe v Wade used the fourteenth amendment's right to privacy as a legal basis. This seems exceedingly silly to me, as the fourteenth amendment also very clearly guarantees that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The key word, of course, being life. So, at the very least, it would seem to me that if you are going to use the fourteenth amendment as a legal basis for abortion, you must also give the baby due process of law in each case before they can be terminated.

All of this comes down to the question of 'what is life?' Because if we can't come to an agreement on when life begins, then we can't even begin to start writing legislation about it. That seems extremely imprudent to me. Does life begin at birth? What about cesarian sections? Millions of people are born through this method. Because they weren't ""birthed"" does this mean that they aren't alive and shouldn't have such rights? What about premature births? Is a seven-month-old premature baby more 'alive' than an unborn eight-month-old? Or perhaps the fetal viability standard, which I used to be a proponent of. However, if the standard for life is whether or not you're able to live without assistance, then there are obviously a lot of people who are adults and fall under this definition. Do they not have a right to life? I've agonized over this question and the more you try to justify when a life begins outside of the simple 'life begins at conception' stance, you open up a chaotic mess of legality that can have some serious ramifications.

I would also like to push back on the conservative idea that this should be a state's rights issue. It seems to me like there are some fundamental things that should not be just left up to the states to choose for themselves. That's how we ended up with slavery in southern states and not in others. Should states be allowed to decide which gender gets to vote? Of course not. For a question as important as this, I feel we need to come to a consensus as a nation and apply that standard across the board.

To wrap things up, I am not making these arguments from a religious stance. It seems like all of the pro-life supporters get lumped into the weeds with the religious kooks, and that simply isn't true. I also am in favor of offering more social programs to financially help new mothers, and I want society to start calling fathers who bail out on their child exactly what they are. Losers and bums who should be legally compelled to financially support that child. So it's not a women's rights thing for me, either, and I want contraceptive options made as easy to obtain as possible to avoid situations like this in the first place.

 If you've read this far, please remember to be courteous in the comments, regardless of your view on this issue. I think too many times, we ascribe evil intentions to the people we don't agree with, and that simply is not true. If anyone can offer a new perspective on this that might change the way I think, I am looking forward to hearing it. Thanks!"

117,2024-02-13,"CMV: The 2005 film “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” is NOT any closer to Roald Dahl’s book than the 1971 film “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory”, and is a worse film that Dahl probably would’ve hated",u/Christmas2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqdzhv/cmv_the_2005_film_charlie_and_the_chocolate/,changemyview,"Any time discussion of any kind, particularly criticism, about the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp 2005 film adaptation “Charlie & the Chocolate Factory” is brought up, one of the first things fans of that movie tend to say is that “it was closer to the book” and “Roald Dahl hated the 1971 movie”. I’m going to argue the points that no it was not closer to the book, and that Roald Dahl would’ve hated the 2005 movie as much, or perhaps more, than the 1971 original.

Some of the main arguments I’ve heard for why the 1971 film is not as close to the book are that it is essentially a musical unlike the book, it didn’t contain as many references to the book, Johnny Depp’s Wonka is closer to the book than Gene Wilder’s, and that it added a non-book subplot about a Wonka operative posing as Slugworth who tested all the winning ticket holders to ensure they wouldn’t give away Wonka’s secret Everlasting Gobstopper formula. Here are my points countering those arguments:

- The original book (and the 2005 film) are no less “musicals” than the 1971 film, as they feature four musical numbers sung by Oompa Loompas. The 1971 film does add additional songs, but this is no different than the 2005 film which *also* adds an additional musical piece to the narrative (that isn’t in the book), “Wonka’s Welcome Song”. Burton’s film also removes Book Wonka’s terrifying poetic narrative sing-song “*There’s no earthly way of knowing, which direction they are going. There’s no knowing where they’re rowing, or which way the river’s flowing*”… which IS in the 1971 film.

- In terms of references to the book, two examples often used are Prince Pondicherry’s chocolate mansion and the squirrel nut room where Veruca Salt meets her demise. I’d argue that these are unfair points because the prospect of filming those two things in a low-budget 1971 movie were almost impossible. Creating a real practical melting chocolate mansion is virtually impossible, and it was of course all CGI in the 2005 film. They changed the squirrel nut room to a golden goose room in 1971 because CGI didn’t exist to create squirrels, and real trained squirrels wouldn’t have been able to interact safety with Veruca’s actress. In the 2005 film they did use real trained squirrels for some scenes, but NOT for the scenes where the squirrels interact with Veruca. That was all CGI, for obvious reasons. Two counterexamples are (1) the book’s Boat Ride poem Wonka recites, which was removed from the 2005 film but remained in the 1971 film, and (2) the book’s Wonka coming out to greet the guests at the gate with a cane and speaking to each of them asking for the Golden Tickets, which was nerfed in the 2005 film in favor of the “Wonka Welcome Song” puppet show. The 2005 film also did many more things which subtracted from the book, such as Charlie wanting to sell his Golden Ticket for cash (something a kid, especially one as excited for the Ticket as Charlie, would NEVER do), and Wonka initially telling Charlie he couldn’t bring his family to the factory. None of these things “couldn’t feasibly be done in 2005” like can be said about 1971.

- Johnny Depp’s Wonka. Jesus, where to begin. If people really believe his performance was closer to Book Wonka than Gene Wilder, I don’t know where to begin to address how wrong I think that is. Depp’s performance with its social ineptness and Michael Jackson vibes is NOTHING like the Book Wonka, who definitely has a way with words and isn’t at all awkward in speaking with the guests like Depp’s Wonka is. Gene Wilder’s Wonka has the same characteristics as Book Wonka, where he speaks in a socially competent way and always has lots to say, none of which is ridiculously impossible to understand like Depp’s Wonka. The sinister undertones of Book Wonka is seen in spades with Wilder’s performance, such as the boat poem scene (itself in the book), but is pretty much nonexistent in Depp’s Wonka who is nothing more than a vacuous manchild with Daddy Issues who no one in their right mind could imagine as running an entire factory by himself. I can believe the Book Wonka & Gene Wilder’s Wonka own and run a factory and make chocolate, I can NOT believe Depp’s Wonka does. Wilder’s Wonka uses many more quotes direct from the book than Depp’s Wonka, and pulls them off perfectly.

- Regarding the Slugworth subplot, the 2005 film also added a significant subplot that wasn’t in the book at all, regarding Wonka’s Dentist Father. Both of these added subplots change the course of the story, and I would argue that the 2005 subplot shifts the entire focus of the narrative onto Wonka and his issues instead of Charlie, whereas the 1971 subplot ENHANCES the story’s focus on Charlie’s character. We don’t see Wonka at all until halfway through the 1971 movie, so the entire first half of the film focuses exclusively on Charlie. One of the main reasons Roald Dahl said he disliked the 1971 film is because it “focused too much on Wonka instead of Charlie”, which the 2005 film did in a FAR GREATER capacity. So logically, Dahl would’ve *disliked the 2005 movie more* for this point alone. 

In terms of why I think the 1971 movie is a better overall movie as well… many have said that the 1971 Fizzy Lifting Drinks scene “compromises” Charlie’s character, but it was actually Grandpa Joe’s idea to drink, and Wonka’s rant at the end is aimed almost entirely at Joe instead of Charlie who essentially was peer-pressured into doing something any kid would jump at the chance to do. This allows Charlie’s character to really shine through at the end when he returns the Everlasting Gobstopper despite all temptation not to, instead of having him just be a goody-two-shoes the whole time, and making him feel more like a real kid and a fully rounded character. The music is also timeless and classic, including “The Candy Man” and “Pure Imagination” which have been covered dozens of times by many artists and the latter of which is so solidly associated with the brand that it was reprised in the 2023 prequel film “Wonka”. Wilder’s performance is also not only excellent, but does as I argued more closely resemble the Wonka of the book when compared to Depp’s performance. This is not to say Wilder’s Wonka is identical to the Book Wonka, but it’s a lot closer than Depp’s.

I know there are many more intricacies involved in these two films and the book, so it’s nearly impossible to include every argument and counterargument here without writing ANOTHER book, and I’m not out here to compete with Roald Dahl. But I know others may have many more arguments and counterarguments which I would love to entertain, and I am certainly open to Changing My View!"

11,2024-02-13,CMV: Fair Chance (Ban The Box) Laws Won't Do Much To Help Formerly Incarcerated Individuals,u/leewilliam236,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqeins/cmv_fair_chance_ban_the_box_laws_wont_do_much_to/,changemyview,"For those who don't know, the idea of ""Fair Chance"" refers to employers, landlords, or both giving formerly incarcerated individuals an equal chance in an interview and if they like them they will give them a conditional offer and then run a background check. If the employer/landlord is thinking about rescinding the conditional offer, they give the applicant a limited time to respond to either show that the background check is inaccurate or show mitigating evidence to show let them know that they're making efforts to become a productive member of society.

While these laws are a step in the right direction to make it easier for formerly incarcerated individuals to get a job and/or house. I think that it's going to take more than just a law and an idea for the formerly incarcerated individual to reintegrate back into society because of the following points:

1. Laws don't really change the behavior of the Employers/Landlords. They will always find some way to use the criminal record against the applicant and often cite liability and risk to the public which, from what I've seen, is virtually nonexistent.

2. Employers/Landlords don't seem to have a laid-out criteria of which type of crimes to weed out. Without this, the formerly incarcerated individual is left with uncertainty on whether or not people would be willing to give a chance and which kind of careers to invest time in.

3. There's little to no punitive measures (i.e. fines, criminal charges) against this type of discrimination. Sure they may be sentenced to training, but will the offending landlord/employer comply with the laws to ensure no violations happen again? This type of deterrence without any punitive consequence seems like a slap on the wrist quite frankly.

4. There's little to no statistics or research that shows that these laws are working. This also goes hand-in-hand with the point number 2. Often times they aren't transparent of whether or not employers/landlords are willing to follow through with their promises.

It's still a relatively new idea, and it's going to take decades for other counties, cities, and states to follow. While society seems open to the idea of reintegration, there's a lot more barriers that is being placed onto formerly incarcerated individuals than may be commonly believed. I don't have a particularly positive outlook on these type of laws having a significantly positive effect overall, but maybe I'm being too negative here.

I do hope to hear encouragement here.

17,2024-02-13,"CMV: dating services should allow users to exclude groups freely, even in cases where it reflects bigotry",u/Alive_Importance2506,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqen9x/cmv_dating_services_should_allow_users_to_exclude/,changemyview,"this is a pretty straightforward one that intuitively sounds wrong, but having gone over it for a while in my head i can't really think of much reason against it.

&#x200B;

based on both personal experiences and anecdotes from others, i've come to the conclusion that users on dating services should be provided the option to freely exclude members of any category, as they can currently do so for race/gender/distance etc. the reason for this is pretty simple- it improves the experience for both parties, as it saves the time of people belonging to the excluded group (and also likely avoids them getting hate crimed by a stranger, which is always fun). 

&#x200B;

nominally one could argue that this is 'enabling' bigotry, but i'm not sure i really agree- the odds seem infintisemal that a dating site encounter against a group that someone would filter given the choice is going to change any hateful minds, and without the filter the service remains available to them.

&#x200B;

a stronger counter might be that it reflects uncomfortably on the service, and signals to minority groups that the service does not support them unconditionally. the services, of course, do not actually care- it's just cynical posturing either way to maximise profits. as a member of a minority group that i can't mention here, i'd rather just avoid being called slurs than feel 'satisfied' a dating service doesn't support bigots despite being happy to take their money"
1,2024-02-14,CMV: Virginity at 30 is unforgivable,u/Enbie-or-Trans,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqexzm/cmv_virginity_at_30_is_unforgivable/,changemyview,"I think virginity at 30 is unforgivable. No matter what else you have done in your life if you're a virgin at 30 it pulls it into the negative, and no subsequent activities can redeem you. Cure cancer, sorry but you're a virgin at 30, it would have been better if millions of people died than you delayed sex from the day after your 29th birthday to the day after your 30th birthday. Win a nobel peace prize with a revognition of having prevented a horrific genocide lmao go fuck yourself. Become a billionaire by age 30 in exchange for not having sex until age 30 you're such a loser. Becoming the pope does not coun because Catholicism is an evil religion (for banning priests from having sex). And no paying for sex before does not count.

I think all that really matters is having sex before age 30. Doesn't matter how common virginity is at age 30, if 50% of the population are virgins at age 30 doesn't change the calculus. You should kill yourself before becoming a virgin at age 30. The shame is not worth it and the shame will persist no matter what you do in your life. Most people have been sexually active for a decade before you started. 

And no being good at sex does not make up for it. Pride in being good at sex is juvenile. Losing your virginity is a substantial life event. Making girls cum is kinda trivial. The former marks you as someone substantially competent, and the latter marks you as someone good at listening to people and with high levels of manual dexterity. I don't care if you're the best person at sex in the entire world, if you lost your virginty at 30 or older then you're a total irredeemable loser."

1,2024-02-14,CMV: A United States national divorce makes sense,u/ImperialClassic,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqfqa7/cmv_a_united_states_national_divorce_makes_sense/,changemyview,"A United States national divorce makes sense considering various factors. National divorce in other words means forming new countries based on new ideas and preexisting ones, the partition. I think this probably make sense considering the complexity of running modern day countries, especially complex ones like the United States. My logic can apply to many countries. 

I’m going to start by praising the United States and its government for its longevity of having one constitution, and being a very stable country. Almost 250 years, one government, one civil war, a few land expansions, a few failed rebellions, lots of immigration, big population, huge country, etc. 

During that time, let’s look at France, like 3 failed empires, 5 republics, like 3 foreign occupations, lots of instability, lots of lost wars, etc. I’ll bring up another country, which I joke is a failed United States, the Russian Federation. Moscow can barely run countries, unlike Washington DC. I’m bringing this up to in a way normalize it’s okay for your government to be shit at running countries. The US government has a very good track record, but there’s nothing to be ashamed of being a divided country now, and therefore wanting a national divorce. Soviet Republics needed to move on. 

In my view, the United States is hardly a nation anymore and has more in common with the UK, Belgium, Spain, Italy, etc than France or Japan. I’m keeping this to the developed democratic world. Since the US was founded on ideas, the US constitution, it’s best to talk about that and why that failing leads to a national divorce.

To get into the ideas, it’s politics and culture that is leading to imagined communities being formed within the fading American idea. For the sake of simplicity, these imagined communities I’ll be calling “Democratic” and “Republican”. The modern way to see it now, this symbolizes nationalities, like Slovak or Czech, Flanders or Walloon, Chinese or Taiwanese. Belgium is hardly a nation, it’s mostly two nations. They don’t speak the same language, they don’t share a national TV station, a national newspaper, they don’t share political parties, they don’t share political views, and they don’t have the same culture. Same can apply to Spain or the UK. People in these countries don’t want to be under the same flag. These countries do have political systems that favor this, because the divides are more established and embraced, but I see these countries breaking up before the United States. US will eventually lead to this sentiment too.

Everything I said about Belgium I can apply to the United States, some metaphorical and some actually the case. Republicans have their own TV and newspaper, Democrats have their own. It gets to a point where they don’t speak the same language anymore. A very segregated nation, based on culture and civilization, leading to distinct nationalities. 

A Republican nationality imagines a country that saves babies from the murder that is abortion. A Democratic nationality imagines a country that saves children from gun violence murder. This can sound like politics, but it’s really culture, because not all societies see abortion the same way, not all see guns the same way. Parts of American culture is gun culture, so taking away gun rights is like taking away language rights for Flanders. Giving abortion rights is letting murder happen. This is how it’s seen, and will be seen. These are just some examples. 

These divisions were always there for decades, but not even a federal system can save it. When the nationalities start to embrace their state government over the federal government, their new imagined community over the old one (the one created in 1770s)… a national divorce makes sense. 

Even if I used political terms, it’s more civilization and culture, like saying the divides in Northern Ireland were sectarian, “Catholic” and “Protestant”. It’s more than this. 

I’ll say it makes sense to see these new imagined communities, but i understand the idea of a national divorce is a radical one, but it’s one I hold the view of."

- Responsibility: you do not get to operate a business and be free from consequences of how your business behaves. 
  
- Ownership: as a stakeholder, you are accountable for the decisions your company makes - an incredibly strict regulatory environment which holds real people accountable ensures that stakeholders have a vested interest in maintaining a dedicated role in their companies.

CMV.

I think the way to base intellect is to observe how a person can receive information and if they can process it in a way that exceeds the average person’s cognitive capacity or even react in ways in which the majority of people don’t think to. I don’t believe that basing intellect off grades is a viable way to measure intelligence. All grades simply are is an objective guideline to tell a student that they worked within the rules an exam board set. It’s not saying you’re smart, in fact, it’s saying “well done. You remember how we’ve told you to think”. 

With the exception of verifiable subjects like maths and science of course, but even then, how a person perceives numbers and factual information isn’t an objective measure of intellect but rather, a measure of ability that differs between people. Some people excel in different areas, that’s all. Someone may be good at maths but good with words, someone may be bad with math but good with words. CMV"

1,2024-02-14,"CMV: DNA is akin to a ""soul"", and therefore, having kids is the only way for that soul to survive for the majority of people",u/original_og_gangster,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqkrw3/cmv_dna_is_akin_to_a_soul_and_therefore_having/,changemyview," My CMV is as follows- 

* DNA is akin to common religious interpretations of a ""soul"".
* Having biological children is the only way for your ""soul"" to continue to exist, for the vast majority of the population. 

The definition of a ""soul"", according to most religions, is some ethereal entity outside of your physical body, which is a part of your body, **continues to exist after your death**, and encapsulates your **identity**, **personality**, and **memories**.

We have no scientific evidence for the existence of spiritual entities in general, let alone human souls. However, DNA in many ways represents most of the same attributes we would assign to human souls.

**Continues to exist after death**\-

Unless your ancestors were famous or influential in some disproportionate way, its likely that whoever your ancestors were thousands of years ago has been completely forgotten. The only remnant of them today is their descendants (you), and the small amount of their DNA that you now carry as part of your own DNA. 

**Personality**\-

33% of human DNA governs brain development and function, the highest proportion of gene expression in any part of the body. This is a contributing factor to 30-60% of human personality being attributable to genetics-

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0263-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0263-6)

In this way, a small amount of the personality of your ancestors continues to propagate in your conscious and subconscious minds.   

**Identity**\-

Obviously, you physical appearance is predominantly governed by your genetics, and you will carry at least some small part of your ancestors physical appearance i.e. eye color, hair color, race, etc. 

**Memories-** 

You don't need to train a border collie to herd, it is an instinct encoded in their DNA. Likewise, humans have many instincts, i.e. infants instinctively hold their breath underwater, some humans have a natural fear of spiders and snakes, etc. Important aspects of our personalities i.e. our desire to congregate, collaborate, and invent, are likewise traits given to us by our DNA. 

So DNA encapsulates many of the concepts we would normally attribute to a human ""soul"", and is perhaps the only equivalent we have (assuming there is no God, or that there is a God, but one that does not care about our continued ethereal existence after death). 

However, this ""soul"" is biological, and can die with us. If you do not propagate your DNA through having children, and you do not have some major impact on the world in other ways, then **any evidence of your existence will wash away over time, and it'll be as if you never existed in this universe.** 

Counter arguments I can foresee- 

1. It is possible to leave a lasting impact on humanity outside of having kids- Yes, but this is unachievable for the majority of the population. Most people will not make scientific discoveries like Einstein, invent the wheel, found fortune 500 companies, etc. 99% of the population is destined to be born, eat, maintain the status quo via some 9 to 5, procreate, and then die. Their contribution to whatever corporation they worked for does not imbue a lasting aspect of their personality or essence on the universe. 10,000 years from now, will anyone remember all the accountants at some random company? Unlikely. 
2. Humanity is doomed in the long term anyway, and we will all collectively be forgotten after we die out, so its not really impossible to transcend death long term- Probably, but the existential problems humans face in the long run (interstellar travel, the heat death of the universe, etc.) are problems that our descendants will be the ones tackling, not us. This is a slippery slope argument that could likewise be used to argue against all human progress i.e. not addressing climate change. "

5,2024-02-14,cmv:The Indian Certificate of Secondary Education is better than the Central Board of Secondary Education.,u/AdTrick7283,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqma6x/cmvthe_indian_certificate_of_secondary_education/,changemyview,"The Indian Certificate of Secondary Education is a better board than the Central Board of Secondary Education.

The 1st reason is that the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education has a denser and more stressful syllabus than the Central Board of Secondary Education. This makes students of the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education more knowledgable than students in the Central Board of Secondary Education. Students who study in the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education learn how to handle pressure and to elucubrate, due to studying for long hours. This is a life skill important in real life. Additionally, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education splits up into 11 subjects in Class 7 rather than Class 11 for the Central Board of Secondary Education, students who study in the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education know how to focus on multiple priorities easily.

My 2nd reason is the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education leaves its students with impressive elocution skills, comprehension skills, and writing skills in English, their mother-tongue, and a 3rd-language! Being fluent in one's mother-tongue is useful, since mother-tongues connect a person to their roots! Moreso, English is the lingua-franca of the world, which results in being well-versed in English pivotal for surviving currently! Additionally, learning a 3rd-language of one's choice is also important if they want to move outside of India, and go to a country that is located outside of the Anglosphere, such as Deustchland or France! Meanwhile, students studying in the Central Board of Secondary Education are only well-versed in their mother-tongue, and have limited capabilities in English!

My 3rd reason is the a graduate of the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education had more opportunities than a graduate of the Central Board of Secondary Education. While a graduate of the Central Board of Secondary Education can only study in India via participating in the Joint Entrance Examinations, the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, etc, and then finally going to the Indian Institute of Technology, Indian Institutes of Management, etc. Meanwhile, a graduate of the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education can not only do all of the above, but also go to prestigious colleges in other countries, such as Oxford, Harvard, Yales, etc. This means that they have a greater chance of success, since going to a college like Oxford is easier than going to a college like the Indian Institute of Technology or the Indian Institute of Management."

They're two sides of the same coin.

But the vast majority of the rhetoric coming out of the Democratic camp is much more about opposing Trump and stopping Republicans from taking power again, than it is about the positives of Biden or the Democratic Party. Sure, you'll hear D's occasionally touting the economy or whatever else Biden has done, but it is generally quite feeble or half-hearted in comparison with the much more intense message of ""Stop Trump and his fascism at all costs.""

The enthusiasm of Democrats for Biden is also fairly low, as well. Indeed, a significant number of Democratic rank-and-file voters have been disgruntled about Biden's age and want some other candidate as the nominee. This isn't like Clinton in 1996 or Obama in 2012 - there was zero question back then among Democratic voters that they should be the nominee for reelection - as in, almost nobody would have even *thought* of the thought of someone else being the candidate.

In fact, the Democrats are usually not arguing, ""You need to vote for Biden because he's the best man for the job"" so much as it is, ""You need to vote for Biden because he's the best man to stop Trump."" In other words, it's still all about Trump.

I will give out deltas to anyone who can CMV on this - namely, that the Democrats' 2024 campaign is much more about ""stop Trump"" than it is about ""reelect Biden."""
1,2024-02-14,CMV: Dating apps with the “swipe” feature are more effective at match-making than traditional dating,u/Th3Unidentified,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqnuuq/cmv_dating_apps_with_the_swipe_feature_are_more/,changemyview,"Physical attraction is a big deal in relationships. It's important to feel that spark and connection, right? Well, dating swipe apps make it super easy to check out someone's looks and see if you're into them. No more wasting time on dates only to find out there's no physical chemistry.

Think about it. In the old days, you had to meet someone in person to know if you found them attractive. But with swipe apps, you can quickly browse through profiles and decide if someone catches your eye. It's like window shopping for potential partners.

Swipe apps also give you a much larger pool of people to choose from. You're not limited to the folks you happen to run into in your daily life. You can swipe through hundreds of profiles and find someone who's not only cute but may also share your interests and values.

Of course, physical attraction isn't everything. It's just one piece of the puzzle. But with swipe apps, you can focus on people you're genuinely attracted to from the GET-GO. It saves you time and energy, especially if you're a busy bee. And you can avoid awkward situations that arise from connecting with someone you’re not into physically. 

Many folks believe these apps are all about being shallow, but that's not entirely true. It's up to you how you approach it. You can still look for deeper connections and shared interests. Swipe apps just give you the chance to start off with that initial physical attraction, which can make things more exciting.

If you're into finding someone you're attracted to (and who’s also attracted to you) and want a convenient way to do it, swipe apps are the strongest option to date. Just remember to keep an open mind and look for more than just looks. It's about finding that where physical attraction meets real compatibility."

So I'll be 25 in 2 months, and sufficed to say, even without my generalized anxiety disorder, I feel like this anxiety of what the future holds has been creeping up on me because I was never able to collect the ""pieces of the puzzle"" needed to build a good life before I cross the point of no return, that being the age of 25. To elaborate on why I believe the ""good life"" ends after 25, here's some reasons listed in no particular order. Although this seems to be a very ""American"" view of things, I would once again like to clarify that I live in Toronto, Canada (which tbh is the most American city you can get in Canada)

&#x200B;

1. Dating/finding love/getting married becomes practically impossible (though in my case, it was probably impossible from the very beginning due to my ASD) outside of dating apps, which are pretty much useless for most people seeking true love anyways
2. People become truly solidified in their cliques/""busyness"" (though again, in my case, it seems to be that way even when I entered university)
3. No real chances for ""repeated, unplanned proximity"" that ""experts"" preach about, even with organizations/clubs/hobby groups given that people show up sporadically 
4. You become a slave to work/responsibilities unless you own a business/are a CEO that makes others lives miserable
5. Your body starts to break down

It seems like the only people who won't suffer this fate are those who were able to find their people (both platonic and romantic) and their niche well before turning 25, though the body breaking down is admittedly more of a unanimous thing. 

Still, doesn't change the underlying feeling of being a total disgrace that has been suffocating me mentally for the past 8 years of my life, even after 9.5 years of therapy with 12 different therapists. 

Regardless, I am interested to hear some perspectives. Who knows, maybe I'll actually start looking forward to the future rather than dreading it. "

I don't wish to harm people with the harshest images they will ever see but if they are going to keep voting no on doing ANYTHING about it, they should be forced to witness what every classroom looks like immediately after every shooting. 

The should be forced to witness the consequences of their beliefs. 

Ideally, every news station would broadcast the raw footage and hundreds of uncensored images of any mass shooting after it happens. 

But since that's not how the US operates, it would need to be forced. Getting sleeper agents in the superbowl command center and pulling this off while preventing the 30 seconds from being interrupted would be a massive challenge but it would be totally worth it.

It’s one thing to say in passing “I’d vote for a sack of potatoes before I would vote for Trump.” but it’s another thing entirely to let your fear of Trump drive you to vote for someone on death’s doorstep plus Kamala Harris.

Why is Kamala Harris so bad? Let’s talk about it.

“Harris's record on wrongful conviction cases as attorney general has engendered criticism from academics and activists.[150] Law professor Lara Bazelon contends Harris ""weaponized technicalities to keep wrongfully convicted people behind bars rather than allow them new trials"".[150] After the 2011 United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Plata declared California's prisons so overcrowded they inflicted cruel and unusual punishment, Harris fought federal supervision, explaining ""I have a client, and I don't get to choose my client.""[151]”

Harris criticized Biden for his opposition to bus students to enforce desegregation during the 2020 primary debates and was criticized during the debate for blocking DNA testing for a death row inmate, her defense of California’s death penalty in 2014 as attorney general.

But then Biden took Harris on as his VP because his campaign wanted a diversity hire 

“During her time in office, Harris has had one of the lowest approval ratings of any vice president in recorded history.”

“Harris's term in office has seen high staff turnovers that included the departures of her chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, press secretary, deputy press secretary, communications director, and chief speechwriter. An anonymous source said that they resigned because they and other staffers ""often feel mistreated"" by senior staffers.[340] ""Symone Sanders, senior advisor and chief spokesperson for Harris, pushed back against the complaints"" and defended their management style, especially for giving opportunities to black women.[340][341][342] Sanders herself resigned from her position in December 2021.[343]”

When you listen to her speeches, she gives off a dumb blonde vibe and arguably has just as many if not more gaffes than Biden.

I’ve had the theory that one of the reasons Harris was hired was a protection against impeachment for Biden. Because, if Biden is convicted by the Senate, then Harris will be president.

I hear a lot of people talking about late stage capitalism, that the end of capitalism is inevitable, etc. That may be true on an extremely long timeline, but I think its pretty obvious that we will see a reformation of capitalist systems that could breathe a century or more of life into them.

We've seen this before. In the late 19th/early 20th century, when John Rockefeller's net worth had an adjusted value of $410 billion, industrialism was running rampant with very few protections for workers, etc. Of course, wealth disparities and income inequality became untenable, and so the powers that be made concessions that benefited the average citizen while still allowing themselves to obtain and protect abhorrent amounts of wealth. In response we had anti-trust legislation, labor reform, Teddy Roosevelt's Square Deal, etc. My position is not that these laws solved income inequality, the exploitation of labor, etc. - its that they went far enough in addressing those problems that it bought the fat cats enough time to continue hoarding their wealth. Why wouldn't they do this again in the 21st century, when it becomes necessary for them to protect their profits?

1)  Occam's Razor.  It multiplies entities beyond explanatory necessity.  It doesn't solve the problem of the difficulty of abiogenesis; it just moves it somewhere else.  Now you need abiogenesis AND hardy microbes capable of surviving in space WHICH ALSO were able to survive on Earth.

2)  It's borderline unfalsifiable.  How would it be falsified?

3)  As far as I know, we have no positive evidence that this is how life reached Earth.

From what I can gather, the appeal of the idea has to do more with vibes than science.  People really like the idea that ""maybe we're ALIENS man!"" or they're attracted to the perceived edginess of the idea.

The idea of directed panspermia sounds even less plausible to me.  Evolution of life on Earth was such a complex and contingent phenomenon.  What result would a civilization about four billion years ago be hoping to get?  Nothing about the biosphere Earth got was inevitable.

Is there any actual scientific evidence supporting the idea that panspermia is more likely than not how life reached Earth of which I am not aware that might change my mind?

Two caveats.  One, I am NOT claiming that panspermia is impossible.  Two, I am not talking about some softer version of it by which chemicals from outside of Earth, hit Earth and aided in abiogenesis here.  I am talking about abiogenesis happening elsewhere INSTEAD OF on Earth and being the origin of life on this planet."

I absolutely support trans adults & trans kids, but i don’t think kids should take hormones or have surgeries. I’ve heard a lot of detrans stories where people only had short consultations for their surgeries and hormones and just given a prescription. I understand there are also plenty of doctors who don’t do that, but it seems like there’s a decent amount of malpractice in the medical field when it comes to trans people (or honestly anything). There are so many long term affects that i don’t think minors can truly understand. I think maybe we need better care for trans kids, including more therapy and help rather than some doctors/therapists just giving the hormone/performing surgery after such a short time of a kid coming out as trans. I thought i was trans/non binary from like 13-16 but i realized i’m not. I get that everyone’s experience is different, but i think kids should have the time to develop and grow before making a life altering decision. I could be wrong but i hear hormones affect fertility, which obviously i think it’s weird anti-trans people are so obsessed with, but it’s important to think about. What if they want kids in the future but can’t? i know some can have kids and do, but it’s still possible they couldn’t. 

I also heard a trans man say that he basically went through menopause as a teenager from the hormones. That’s truly heartbreaking because most women don’t go through menopause until their 50s. I also know minors in my life who had top surgery at like 15-16 and i just don’t see how that’s okay. I understand adults do it to reduce gender dysphoria, but 15-16 is literally a kid. I mean minors can’t consent to a lot of stuff, you can’t even drive til 16 or consent to sex until 16 in the US. I’m 18 and i can’t even rent a hotel room, rent a car, legally drink beer or smoke, i can’t go to a casino. I think those are bullshit and i should be able to, but that’s not what the post is about. I hope i didn’t come off as disrespectful, i just genuinely do not understand and would appreciate if maybe people could help me see the other side. Thank you!"

Back to my favourite characters becoming gay, they were always straight but now they changed them to be gay OUT OF NOTHING why would you do that? Why cant you just make new characters there is no problem with that but changing existing characters just because you wanna be ""inclusive""   
Its the same thing with characters being changed to black people, it just doesnt make sense and im not being racist or homophobic, example ariel and snow white, ariel was ALWAYS a red hair white girl but they changed her to be black WHY? why not make a NEW character make them cousins make them sisters make them daughter and mom WHY CHANGE AN ALREADY FOR DECADES EXISTING CHARACTER and Snow white was ALWAYS SINCE 100 YEARS a girl with WHITE SKIN LIKE THE SNOW, it says in the name WHITE AS SNOW not caramel like a caffee latte (that was a joke) but i hope you guys know what im talking about?? Why not make NEW characters, imagine changing a black character to a white one and making gay characters straight i dont wanna know how much hate the company and people would get

This is not my first account. I spended some years on Reddit and I should to say this website gived to me more negative experience and stress. I don't like the whole karma system where people could mass downvote any unpopupar opinion. It's like China's social credit system. Reddit has a very strict censorship. And users are helping censorship via karma system. Also I noticed how many subs now have karma restrictions. This means you're forced to say any popupar opinion on comments. Also, after API drama I hward mamy mods where replaced with more strict ones. 

Let's take an example of gaming communities. I love indie games, but people here are worshipping them. They are getting pissed from everybody who buys any AAA game even on cheap price. Because, according to reddit hive mind, all AAA games (except Nintendo games) sucks. I even remember how I chatted with redditor who believes that Baldur's Gate 3 is an indie game (created by a big studio with 300 employers and 100 million budget). His opinion is upvoted. I tried to say that it's not like this. So, I got downvoted. I spended some time on piracy subs and they becomed copium echochambers. Since nobody cracks Denuvo, they are starting to cope with ""All Denuvo protected games are worthless to crack"". Like... did they heard about offline accounts? They are cheap and costs 5 dollars. They are popular in Russia and post-soviet countries. But mods will ban for such advice. Because it's better to cope and trying to find a solution of problem. 

Also Reddit becomed a radical left echochamber. Okay, I'm more left guy in political views. But on Reddit it goes in extreme. And also I remember how redditors started to hate all russians when ukrainian conflict began. All russians, be they are against Putin or not. To be honest, this affected on my psyche so hardly and I started to do a self-loathing, praising NATO and USA as a coping mechanism. I even started to read Tom Clancy novels and... they are just boring. I'm just deceiving myself and everyone with ""America fuck yeah"" statement. It's obvious how much NATO did many atrocities in the past. And why some fandom subs logos like Breath of the Wild and Undertale where colored as ukrainian flag? Redditors are too obsessed with ""I support the current thing"". 

Guess I should hang out on other subs. Maybe art subs, other hobbies subs like DnD and whatever. But at least Twitter (X) and Threads, despite of toxicity, has much more freedom. I also would prfer to hang out in Discord."

For people that say ignoring is an answer. I GET IT...

I know she felt something but because of her situation in life she couldn't tell me or didn't want to upset me (at least what I think happened). I ALWAYS showed through my actions that I cared for her, I did a ton of things over several months to make her feel special.

1,2024-02-14,"CMV: Depression isn't ""real"" (in the way people think it is)",u/Salad-Snack,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqxv9n/cmv_depression_isnt_real_in_the_way_people_think/,changemyview,"Okay, so there are a couple of common arguments that I hear when this topic is brought up, and for the sake of presenting the other side fairly, I'm going to try and steel-man them. 

1. Depression is a biologically real illness: There's a subset of people who, by virtue of some combination of genetics and environment, are unable to properly regulate their mood. We know that these people exist for a couple of reasons: we're able to scan their brains and find that there are significant differences in their brains, both in chemicals like neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) and stress hormones, as well as changes in the structure itself, like grey matter and the like. We also can infer that these people are unique because, in more severe kinds of depression, they exhibit remarkable symptoms that go beyond a normal bout of sadness, like psychosis and psychomotor retardation (that's the name of the symptom, don't kill me). These symptoms imply that there's some kind of dysregulation going on with the chemicals in the brain because you typically wouldn't see those things in a normal person who's sad, even if they've experienced horrible a tragedy.  Furthermore, we can logically figure out that these people exist because they seem to come to therapists presenting with similar symptoms and respond to the same treatment --- so, even if we don't know the exact cause, and by extension, exactly why the treatment works, we can still identify that there's an illness. 
2. If depression isn't real, and it's some kind of choice that you're making, why does it provide no benefits? People generally don't like being depressed, so obviously it's something they can't control, because if they could control it, wouldn't they stop just stop? Since they can't ""just stop"", it doesn't take a genius to realize they probably can't control it. Furthermore, you don't get to just choose your mindset, your subconscious does, and your subconscious is ruled by the chemicals in your brain, so someone who exhibits such abnormal symptoms as a disease is probably experiencing some kind of syndrome or disease related to those chemicals.  


Hopefully, I've argued these points satisfactorily - if not, take the post down or destroy me in the comments. I prefer the ladder, because I get to be proven wrong, and being wrong is generally bad so I'd like to eliminate the wrong ideas I have.  

Now here's my argument 

1. I don't think there's any compelling evidence that depression is biologically real in the sense that it is a disease acting on you, like diabetes or cancer, that can only be controlled or cured externally. The only thing that the brain scans tell us is that depressed people have different brains from non-depressed people --- we don't know why. As it turns out, Criminals tend to have higher levels of dopamine and smaller behavior-regulating parts of the brain. Does that mean criminality is a disease, and their actions aren't a choice? Now, I'm no doctor. I don't know to what level criminal minds differ from average, and I don't know if depression differs more. I also don't know if there's a level of difference from the average brain that would qualify you as ""having a disease"" However, it does seem to be the case that, because of neuroplasticity, your actions, thoughts, and experiences can cause chemical and structural differences in the brain. Now, the question is: can patterns of behavior change your brain to such an extent that depression does? We know a couple of things that can point to an answer, I think. 
2.  Cognitive behavioral therapy has been associated with changes in brain structure and chemicals, including neurotransmitter receptors for dopamine and serotonin. Furthermore, and this is really important: chronic stress and negative experiences can lower serotonin levels. This raises the question: do low serotonin levels create negative thought patterns, or do negative thought patterns lower serotonin levels? I don't think there's an answer to that question in the current research, though I bet the answer is that they compound each other. So, is it possible that negative thought and behavioral patterns could cause symptoms as serious as severe depression? maybe.  But the beauty is, even if they can't cause depression, correcting negative thought and behavior patterns will definitively help, and we know that. (we haven't even gotten into vitamin deficiencies ex: a severe vitamin b12 deficiency can present exactly like schizophrenia)
3. The real point is is that I doubt any of you know the answers to these questions unless I've missed something serious. Assuming I haven't, you can't make the argument that depression is definitively biologically real because we don't know that and we can't know that. 

The rest is assuming everything I said above is true, and before I get into it, this has to be said:  If you're thinking of killing yourself, you should take antidepressants --- nobody can help you if you're dead  


1.  Okay, so why would someone be depressed, assuming that it isn't just biological? Well, maybe you have a horrible life (no relationship, no job, don't care about college, etc. No friends.) If that's the case, and that's often the case, the solution shouldn't be just to diagnose you with depression and put you on antidepressants. That might help, but it's just allowing you to put off the real problem: your life is horrible and you should probably fix it. Furthermore, if there are obvious actionable solutions that will make your life better, and you're not taking them because they are hard (and believe me, they can be hard: I know that from experience. Obvious does not mean easy), then I don't think you ought to believe that you're depressed, because the only possible result of labeling yourself that way would be pathologizing the behavior (it's not my fault I don't have a girlfriend, it's that I'm depressed and I can't go out in public, and I'm a piece of shit and nobody loves me (but all that's just the depression and anxiety)). Maybe just accept that life is hard, and everyone's figuring out a way to deal with it. Find a goal --- something you know you can do (If you can't move you're so depressed, maybe the goal is as easy is wiggling a pinkie), and get the reward systems activated. You can only benefit from believing you aren't depressed in this situation. 
2.  Now, if you're depressed and you have a good life, and you're still suffering, you can choose to believe that you're suffering from an illness. Maybe that helps you in the short term. But, now what? Well, you can take antidepressants for the rest of your life and hope they keep working. However, maybe, just maybe, depression isn't a real illness. Consider the possibility --- if depression isn't real, then there's something you're doing that's wrong, and you don't know what it is. It could be as simple as diet, but maybe not. Maybe you have some deep need that you haven't fulfilled. If you simply view depression as an illness that you have to manage, you'll never seek out that root cause, because the cause is just Biological. 
3. This is just an afterthought, but oftentimes, depressed thinking comes across as very self-centered. If you're always thinking about yourself, how you're worthless, etc. and you're always judging yourself for things nobody else cares about --- maybe ego problems could be one of the sources of depression. It's just a thought, but the only way to know for sure would be to stop believing depression is something intrinsic about yourself, and a symptom --- your subconscious telling you something's not right.   


This goes without saying, but none of this is easy. Change isn't easy, and if your baseline is low, you're gonna have to change more than other people. Getting addicted to drugs is a result of choices, but that doesn't make it any easier to get out of it once you're there. "

Ignoring the fact that the US government would never in a million years even attempt this in the first place, even if they did, there are millions of unregistered guns that would just stay in the owner's possession and we'd never know.

Then you end up in a situation where all the registered gun owners have now given up their guns, but also know that most of the people they wanted to protect themselves from are still in possession of their unregistered guns, so the now gunless people will just find a gun via illegal means, and just keep it hidden at home. Millions of people will wanna do this, and now there is just a much larger black market for guns, and anyone can get one if they really want one (which they will) and we will be back where we started, where everyone still has a gun that wanted one in the first place.

I also think ""fixing the mental health crisis"" is maybe even a more impossible task. That relies on these people willingly getting help for their problems, which completely flies in the face of the macho ""suck it up or i'll give you something to cry about"" culture that every male has instilled in them growing up, and many have not grown out of as an adult. 

I really see no solution to this, and even if there was one, I think we have too many lunatics that would rather let the problem continue than give up their guns, which is absolutely insane to me."

Grew up in a house of independents—my parents voted for every president prior to trump. I’ve generally preferred democrats because I’m not a fan of social conservatism (which is often a thinly veiled guise for religious fundamentalism), but I’ve occasionally voted for republicans in certain local elections.

I don’t see the point. Biden is clearly not mentally fit for the office at this stage in his life. Trump is an admittedly entertaining, blatantly immoral clown who lies prolifically even by political standards. 

The democrats, more and more, are on the wrong side of so many issues. They used to be anti war, now they are guilty of the same jingoism animating the neoconservative wing of the Republican Party. Funding massive NDAAs and gleefully supporting the slaughter of poor people across the globe. 

They used to be against racism, but now they are consumed by largely irrelevant social signaling while simultaneously making close to zero effort to solve actual examples of racism (ongoing de facto segregation in primary education, for example, or failing to challenge the validity of race as a social heuristic to begin with—a concept that is clearly arbitrary and contrived if you think about it for 15 seconds).

The feminist wing of the party went from challenging legitimate examples of misogyny in Hollywood or business to crucifying relatively harmless men for their insecurities or missteps (Jonah hill sending extremely cringe, insecure texts to his surfer girlfriend; Al Franken, that Indian comedian who was sort of a dick to his date, etc).

I understand how this can be fallacious in many examples, eg:

“Well, this person is a doctor so they must be right about this miracle cure!”

The main reason this is a logical fallacy is that humans can be liars.

In contrast, propose, for example, a person claims that the periodic table, which is highly researched and substantiated, for reasons they elucidate is highly invalid. 

The responder does not know enough about chemistry to understand or refute what they’re saying, but trusts the consensus and replies by referencing the International Consensus Statement of all the world’s leading experts on the overall subject which explicitly contradicts what they claim. 

They can then say “that’s an argument from/appeal to authority! You are not addressing my reasoning, just referencing statements from experts. Therefore your argument for believing in the period table is invalid”.

This should not be a fallacious argument. If every single chemist alive agrees on something about molecules, it’s very indicative of the fact that that’s how molecules work. Yet, by the criteria of this apparent fallacy, it qualifies.

In my opinion, I should be able to trust and believe in the scientific consensus of a topic I may not know sufficiently about to verify their empirical reasoning, without that being invalid because it’s an appeal to authority."

64,2024-02-14,CMV: the incidence of people’s drinks being spiked is greatly exaggerated online,u/NUMBERS2357,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqzy6o/cmv_the_incidence_of_peoples_drinks_being_spiked/,changemyview,"In particular, if someone on the Internet claims that they were roofied, my assumption is that they are mistaken, unless their story has evidence external to their own feeling, e.g. the following:

* an actual positive drug test

* somebody seeing someone put something in their drink, or seeing something in their drink

* someone getting caught in the vicinity with a drink-spiking drug on their person

Oftentimes, the story amounts to “I felt way more drunk/out of it than I normally do based on how many drinks I remember having”, which I don’t find very convincing.

As for why:

**First**, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug-facilitated_sexual_assault) cites various studies all of which show a huge rate of negatives when suspected cases are actually tested:

> One study of 1,179 urine specimens from victims of suspected DFSAs in 49 American states found six (0.5%) positive for Rohypnol, 97 (8%) positive for other benzodiazepines, 451 (38%) positive for alcohol and 468 (40%) negative for any of the drugs tested for. A similar study of 2,003 urine samples of victims of suspected DFSAs found less than 2% tested positive for Rohypnol or GHB. A three-year study in the UK found two percent of 1,014 rape victims had sedatives detected in their urine 12 hours after the assault. A 2009 Australian study found that of 97 instances of patients admitted to hospital believing their drinks might have been spiked, tests were unable to identify a single case where a sedative drug was likely to have been illegally placed in a drink in a pub or nightclub, with 9 plausible cases from within the study. In contrast, the mean blood ethanol concentration (BAC) of patients at the time of presentation was 0.096%. One study (Ham & Burton, 2005), found out of 1014 cases of claimed drug-facilitated sexual assault over a three-year period in the UK, only 2% (21 cases) showed evidence of possible deliberate spiking.

> A UK study concluded that there was ""no evidence to suggest widespread date rape drug use"" in the UK and that no cases in 120 examined involved rohypnol and just two involved GHB.

And more broadly the lack of other evidence.  Do you ever hear about people caught bringing roofies into bars or clubs?  Are there ever roofie drug busts?  I’ve heard several times about people inventing date rape drug detecting straws - how often do they produce a positive?  These drugs seem like the sort of thing that could easily lead to an overdose, if being maliciously drugged by a random person, especially when mixed with alcohol and/or other drugs - do you ever hear about deaths from roofies?  I bet if one girl died from roofie OD at a frat party it would be national news!

**Second**, the main evidence that being roofied is common, is that a lot of people think it happened to them - but most of the stories I see are “I felt way drunker than I should have been”, and people only assume that it was a drink spiking because of the perception that it’s common.

It’s circular!

And most habitual drinkers will admit to having gotten drunker than they intended, in situations where being roofied wasn’t a possibility.

**Third**, people are famously bad at assessing risk, and overestimate the danger from exotic, unusual risks relative to more mundane ones.  So e.g. overestimate the danger from a plane crash, relative to a car crash.  Given this bias, people will fear being roofied more than they fear drinking too much alcohol. 

This wouldn’t be the first time a fear like that was overblown due to media coverage and word of mouth - razor blades in Halloween candy, satanic ritual abuse in daycare centers, kids becoming murderers due to backwards messages in rock songs. And, I suspect, the recent epidemic of claimed ""[needle spiking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_spiking)"", including the case of a concert [security guard](https://nypost.com/2021/11/06/astroworld-security-guard-pricked-in-neck-with-needle-houston-police-say/) whose [case](https://www.wfla.com/news/national/needle-spiking-astroworld-attendees-may-have-been-injected-with-drugs-during-crowd-surge-police-say/) was [widely](https://www.newsweek.com/what-needle-spiking-astroworld-drugging-reports-investigated-after-tragic-event-1646944) [reported](https://allnurses.com/confirmed-needle-spiking-astroworld-festival-t739290/) in the [US](https://www.the-sun.com/news/4040629/astroworld-what-is-needle-spiking/), the [retraction](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/astroworld-security-guard-needle-police-corrected-9658070/), not so much.

**Final point** - to be clear I am **not** talking about the following:

* spiking drinks with alcohol

* pressuring people into taking drugs or alcohol

* taking advantage of someone who is un- or semi-conscious from drugs or alcohol

* Countries other than the US, I would guess similar countries are similar but don’t really know enough about them"
1,2024-02-14,cmv: democracy has failed the united states,u/IronSmithFE,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ar12fc/cmv_democracy_has_failed_the_united_states/,changemyview,"a long time ago, voting rights in the u.s. were very limited, often restricted to male landowners. this remained true until the jacksonian era when white males began to gain suffrage regardless of land ownership. coincidentally, this is also when most explicitly racial laws prohibiting blacks from voting originated. with limited exceptions, before then, anyone who wasn't a slave could have voted regardless of race, provided they met the same standards as other men. with almost no exceptions, women were always excluded until 1920.

so, what do i want? well, i'm not sure. i appreciate some aspects of democracy, but i believe that universal suffrage has led to a lack of accountability for voters. when their chosen policies or politicians fail, individual voters who made poor choices suffer the same consequences as everyone else. they rarely change their political beliefs to compensate for their errors; instead, they often double down on their choices, displaying false confidence. i abhor racial laws, and while i am more tolerant of sexist laws, i generally think they are a bad idea too. i strongly believe that those who vote should have a stake in the outcome. voting should be limited to individual land ownership, which would exclude anyone who isn't the sole owner of a piece of land. this would include women and men of any genetic or cultural heritage.

this brings me to democracy in general. while i think that some level of democracy is beneficial, i believe that strict democracy has proven itself insufficient. our politicians, whom we elect, have no sense of ownership of our cities, states, or nation, which has led them to abuse the system, the land, and the people. like walmart stockboys, they couldn't care less about the customer or the long-term health of the company; they simply collect their paycheck and move on. this is in stark contrast to an entrepreneur of a sole proprietorship, who has everything invested. unlike the stockboy, the entrepreneur needs the business to succeed and will work long, hard hours to prevent failure. they persist into old age so they can pass it on to their children and prepare them for the responsibility, passing on their wisdom to ensure they are prepared to take over when the time comes.

the benefits of this model should be clear from that analogy, but there are downsides as well. choosing a successor based on heritage is foolish, even if it has its advantages. this is evident in how often businesses passed down to children fail miserably. perhaps there is a way to prevent this from happening, which is, i think, where voting plays a crucial role. what if we had a royal family where the next monarch wasn't appointed but elected from among that extended family and among the governors of the various states? i believe this could give landowners some input and still imbue leaders with a sense of ownership over the nation's well-being.

finally, the rulers need to be checked, regardless of how they are appointed to office, and the people need to be checked, regardless of how well they agree. no supermajority should be allowed to impose slavery, and no dictator should be allowed to limit speech. this brings us to the rule of law. there should be a constitution that legally grants people basic rights that no laws or regulations can contradict. such a constitution can be violated in practice but should at least provide people with some protection and might even develop into a moral standard.

the system i have described admittedly resembles pre-colonial british government, though with crucial differences.

the only things i am certain of are these:

1. universal suffrage has failed us. 
2. the people we elect are never our best and brightest 
3. our politicians are, in a manner of speaking, lawless rapists—they gain power by deceit or force, abuse their power, and then move on with little to no consequence."

Whether it's because of personal or parental failure, 18 year old ""adults"" who don't know how to take care of themselves don't belong in a career field where they need to know how to take care of each-other in turn. Someone who doesn't know how or has no real experience governing their own wellbeing or behavior is not only a hindrance to themselves, but to every other soldier in their unit. Maybe instead of throwing together a bunch of people who've barely set foot out their parents' doorstep into situations where people may die, maybe the military will be far better off drawing from a recruiting pool of actual adults who are more likely to at least know SOMETHING of stability and self control. 

Obviously, this doesn't apply to every single young person in that age range, there are always going to be exceptions. But at 18, you should absolutely know how to wash your own clothes and track your own finances, in other words how to do the absolute bare minimum to be functional. From the web - I served with entirely too many ""adults"" who apparently needed their hands held through even the most basic functions of otherwise normal adult life, and I'm supposed to trust them with a loaded firearm in a combat situation? These kids couldn't be trusted with so much as a butter-knife! Also, no one wants to share a bunker or barracks with someone who doesn't know how to clean up after themselves, or clean THEMSELVES. Poor hygiene is a pest & disease hazard, which can devastate an otherwise functional unit. And guess which age range tends to not understand this very basic life skill? 

Also, I'm sure there are A LOT of NCO's out there who'd love nothing more than not having to deal with disciplining a soldier getting busted for underage drinking: If you lack the discipline to not break the law out of personal selfishness, be it with alcohol or (especially) sexual assault, then you straight-up lack the discipline to be a soldier.

People have long criticized the US military for ""recruiting kids,"" and after having been a part of that system myself I'm inclined to agree that these criticisms are absolutely valid. The military can be a fulfilling career with unique opportunities for anyone willing and able to work hard and push themselves, but it is first and foremost a job for adults who can do adult things to an adult capacity. 

To add onto this, as mentioned, the drinking age is 21, you have to be 21 to smoke cigarettes, and 21 to even get into a nightclub, and they say that adolescence can still be occurring up to the age of 25, so I don’t think an 18-year-old really has the wherewithal to make such a decision to enter into a career that could end their lives."

Recently there was a shooting in Kansas city at the super bowl parade. 9 teens and kids were shot and 1 person so far has died. I think this it is absurd that the moral and just thing to do in this situation is to lock the criminals up. People were killed and traumatized for life and they will get to sit in prison , make new friends, laugh, enjoy those wild prison snacks, change their lives around possibly. While the dead guy or girl is completely non-existent now. Family lost someone forever, senselessly. How does the punishment meat the crime in that situation. 

How is it morally right for one person to end another person’s existence and get to possibly love again , laugh again, learn new perspectives, grow etc. I can’t rectify that idea in my head. 

The only possible argument i see against the death penalty for murder is the one that the government doesn’t have the right to kill. In my eyes though, the government has the right to kill in many different circumstances. Why can this not be extended to this? Would it not eventually deter at least some people from committing murder ? Many criminals are not afraid of jail but death is another thing entirely. 
For school shooters and serial killers etc they may not care about either but no solution can solve every issue. 

Tldr: the death penalty is the more ethical and sensible penalty to murder and this idea that murderers should be rehabilitated or given a second chance is nonsense."

However, in online discussions of the album, I hear a lot of talk about separating the art from the artist. It's kind of impossible for me given how tied this thing is to Kanye's persona, but I don't see why it's necessary for enjoying the album?... I don't see why it has to be so black and white, either you separate the art or you don't engage with it at all. I enjoy plenty of art that I refuse to separate the artist's shitty beliefs and/or actions from, art that's deeply tied to the bad stuff they've done that I can criticise whilst still enjoying it. I feel that critical consumption & enjoyment is totally not off the board, and indulging in good art by bad people that talks about the bad things is fine.

I don't judge people for liking Vultures, as long as it's not because they agree with the toxicity Kanye spews- hell, I did like a couple of songs off the record myself, even if it was (as a whole) not my style. I just can't see why separation of art from artist is a requirement for engagement."

However this is Reddit- a place full of anonymous users who talk smack on trump with abject disdain, who loathe Sam Harris, Elon Musk and Joe Rogan for being “right-adjacent”, who somehow always seem to find way to bash Israel, who reliably argue in favor of universal healthcare, who deride anyone who has qualms about late term abortion, and who love simplistically denounce religious people and Republicans.

 I try to be moderate and centric and Redditors will even mock that orientation as a goal. . . Usually that type of attack comes from the left.

In fact, unless you go to a conservative subreddit, you can predict the general response of most redditors on any single issue because it’s all the same…

Except for one issue - guns. Go on any discussion in any subreddit where they are discussing gun policy and watch the shills come out of the woodwork. You can tell they’re shills because they obfuscate arguments or ignore your point to make another one that clearly is on their list of “beats” that have been handed down by their masters.

This does not happen with other issues. Only guns. 

As a result, there are two explanations. Either Reddit is full of left wing people who hate republicans but happen to be second amendment absolutists. Or, more likely, the f*g gun industry is paying hundreds of people to post pro gun arguments on this site.

TLDR- Reddit is infiltrated with gun industry appointed shills. Change my view"

My view is that for certain minimally dangerous people in terms of physical violence (i.e. someone who commits online fraud, someone who was negligent and accidentally causes an injury, someone who steals because they're poor, someone who blackmails someone) there shouldn't be prison sentences but instead house arrest and/or community service. It should be noted that in some countries such as France this is already largely the case and people who have no prior record usually don't get prison sentences for such crimes. In countries such as the UK or the US this isn't always the case and people can spend years in prison for non-violent and non-intentional crimes.

Clearly there's issues of radicalization in prison and becoming even worse due to the environment, overcrowding there as well as the taxpayer spending money on prisons. So why should we insist on prison being the only appropriate punishment in cases where people can be effectively monitored as to not be a threat. What I propose is that unless the person has committed a violent crime or an intentional crime house arrest and community service could be appropriate. I don't want to go into details but for example it could be things like a restricted amount of time using the internet, agreeing to have your internet use monitored, doing 8 hours of community service on Saturdays and Sundays, etc. If someone prefers prison over that, they should of course be offered the opportunity to go there.

For example, if someone committed online credit card fraud they would be on house arrest and would have their internet use monitored and would also have to go to community service. They could have a job and go there and back but all their movements would be monitored with an ankle bracelet. For particularly bad offenders, there could be additional restrictions such as a maximum time of entertainment/internet so that there's still an element of punishment.

Prison isn't the only way to punish people for their wrongdoing and alternative (strict) house arrests and community service could serve the same purpose and even do a way better job than the prison environment would. "

Firstly, Bollywood is notorious for type-casting actors. I will now make an example out of the only worldwide known Bollywood celebrities right now. They are Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Aamir Khan. In the late 90s and 2000s, with Swades released in 2004, Shahrukh Khan has been typecast as the romantic hero such as Devdas, Mohabattein, etc. From late 2000s, Salman Khan has been typecast as the action hero in movies such as Radhe, Wanted, etc. Aamir Khan has been typecast as the person that goes against the grain in movies such as Lagaan, 3 Idiots, etc. Therefore, he is the perfect person to play Mohan; he goes against the will of the people of Charanpur to improve it.

Secondly, Aamir Khan is already experienced in these roles! In 2004, Shahrukh Khan did not have that much experience with roles other than the anti-hero in movies such as Anjaam, Baazigar, etc, which he had already abandoned by the late 90s, or the romantic hero, which he has been playing in movies such as Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge or Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham! Meanwhile, Aamir Khan had been playing roles like this after abandoning the romantic roles he had played in movies like Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Andaz Apna Apna, e tc, and instead going onto roles where he went against the grain, such as Lagaan and Manga, Pandey:The Uprising. Swades is a perfect movie similar to the above.

In conclusion, Aamir Khan was known as 'Mr.Perfectionist'. Due to starring in amazing movies such as Rangeela, Ghulam, etc, he would know exactly what it would take to make Swades better. He made mpvies like Dangal and 3 Idiots better, and prevented them from going the same way as Swades; a flop. Instead, 3 Idiots and Dangal are international hits, becoming famous in countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. Bhutan, China, South Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, the United States of America, etc. Aamir Khan could have easily made Swades have the same fate as the above. Even Taare Zameen Par and 3 Idiots criticised India; India's education system, and its lack of inclusivity. Similarly, Swades criticisedIndia; India's obsession with authority, which blinds them from making India better. 

This is why Aamir Khan should have been in Swades."

This concept evolved from the Catholic doctrine of ""natural rights"", which proposes that some rights are given to people by God and then cannot be revoked. this is stupid if you do not believe god exists

This is incredibly western centric. Proposing that an incredibly narrow set of ""Christianity with the numbers filed off"" morals is what should define the behavior of the entire human race, when every single culture (and even individual cultures that change over time) has had varying and contradictory morals. A modern Westerner would seem morally abhorrent to a 1700s Victorian and vice versa, much less an ancient Mesopotamian or ancient Aztec. ""Human rights"" as a model are effectively cultural supremacy, with the west assuming that their values are the best and final ones, and enforcing them on various nations 

Of course they 'exist', but they exist for the reason that all laws exist, which is that there is a monopoly on violence by governments who wish to enforce it. If the monopoly on violence fails the rules fail to matter. They are not meaningful in and of themself unless you are religious (which I am not and many people nowadays are not). Outside of the context of societal lines and religion, morals become relative to the individual and in group and are hard to affix outside of that. Therefore in any appreciable sense ""human rights"" do not matter. I think it's stupid to attach our entire international policy to a barely evolved antiquated Christian doctrine "
1,2024-02-15,"CMV: The critique of niceguy/nicegirls (or more generally a ""nice X™"") is ironically a validation of niceX™ and also an ignorance of human nature.
",u/ValuableBreakfast527,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ardjoy/cmv_the_critique_of_niceguynicegirls_or_more/,changemyview,"Over recent months, I've seen some wave of critiques against people who claim to be ""nice "", especially the whole r/niceguys thing, which I believe is nothing more than moral soapboxing — both the critiqued and the critics (this'll be important later on).

But from:

1. The complaints that niceX make, and, 2. The very definition of niceX™, the complaints of niceX are valid; that society generally favors bad people and actively harms nice people.

**Here's how.**

From WIKI, the definition of ""nice guy"" is:

""in the context of dating, to describe someone who believes himself to possess genuine ""nice guy"" characteristics, even though he actually does not, and who uses acts of friendship and basic social etiquette with the ulterior aim of progressing to a romantic or sexual relationship.""

It goes further on:

 ""This is sometimes referred to as ""nice guy syndrome"", which is used to describe a sense of entitlement to sexual or romantic attention from women simply for being ""nice"", and irrational anger when that attention is not reciprocated.""

Now from what I get from these definition, a Nice guy is someone that's manipulative, not true to their intentions, entitled, misogynist, has ulterior motives, liars.

The glaring incoherence with this is that there are many brands of manipulators, entitled people, liars, people with ulterior motives, and even outright misogynists, who don't get nearly the same amount of push back niceguys get, if anything, they are rewarded for such behaviors i.e ""assholes"".        
So it seems the only possible problem with when this particular brand i.e niceguys, make such observations and are met with such pushback is  is this simple fact..e.g

Nice guys are misogynistic liars,

because they don't know how to lie and hate as good as or better than the pros!

Which confirms the whole ""society favors bad people thing"" in the first place — it's a counter argument rhat instead of countering the argument, supports the argument.     
But why this tho? .. why don't people just admit straight up that society favors evil people? It almost seems like an infinitum double wink of avoiding uncomfortable, or should I say “problematic“ truths.      
I argue it's cause of two reasons:

1. **The assumption that human nature is good:** Because if you thought that human nature is evil, you'd straight up admit the argument that humans favor evil.
This assumption is so ubiquitous, everywhere from the constitution, neo-christian attitudes, social justice movements, conservatives, manosphereans, gender discourse, self help books ..etc such that people unconsciously appeal to it in so many contexts.

2.**The assumption of freewill:** to change your course of life and struggle against evil.. usually to divert the blame of choosing evil from whoever chooses the evil.       

(Now I deny both 1 and 2, but I'll only critique 1 given I want to maintain the scope of this post, but I critiqued 2 elsewhere, which I'll link if anyone's interested.)

You can only *naively* assume humans are good by essence if you ignore little glories like high school bullying (an already confirmation of the niceguys thing) to greater beauties like FunkyTown™ and Miss Pacman™.
    
I believe the only way to know if human nature is good, a way that's not some kumbayaly fantastical assumption of the noble savage, is to actually look at humans for what they are, rather than what you wish them to be.    
To extract the essence of things, you scatter them across different **environments**, then any characteristics which prevail across all environments i.e characteristics environments (nurture)cannot explain, are the characteristic that are essential to such species.

If you look across cultures from modern to ancient times, even isolated ones that had no way to influence each other, we always see the brutal nature of humanity at full display; murders, rapes, war, abuse, ..pure savagery.   
Human nature isn't good, nor neutral to allow for potential values, it's inherently ""evil"".     
It's all a will to power.

From the foregoing, niceX™ and niceX critics™ are two sides of the same coin; people who naively assume that humans are good at their core, whilst the evidence says otherwise.

I'm just saying we are in a time and age where most people aren't like the traditional men and women from the 50s. 

I believe that men should not be forced to be masculine because society says they must, I believe it should be a choice to the individual if they want to be masculine .

I also am against the idea men must be emotionless and women must be constantly happy. People should be allowed to feel what they want to.

Men and women are different, that makes it so beautiful when we are together. However we should never force anyone into a box because ""society says so"".

A discord server is so fragmented and unwelcoming to new people and always ends up being absolutely dominated by superfans/no-lifers who overpower the chat in terms of message volume and who use it as an open-air group chat with in-jokes and memes. It rewards cliquisvh behaviour with social responses / emojis / memes given just as much priority as a proper response to a comment / question, and the utility to the average user scales absolutely appallingly as the number of people on a server grows. 

Discussion in the large general channels is lowest common denominator or has to fight against a flood of low quality spam, and discussion in the (usually far too fragmented) topic-focused channels gets almost no traffic in comparison, so you don't leverage the large user base anyway. On a forum or Reddit, at least all the topics have a chance at being seen by all of the active user base on the forum. Perhaps I have something useful / helpful to add when a new player asks for advice. On Reddit or a forum I'll probably see the topic posted if I'm even semi-active and be able to contribute. On Discord you better hope I am actively watching the chat when it gets asked in #general and flies off the page whilst 2 randomers continue their unrelated conversation, or you better hope I bother to trawl the #buildadvice+palladins+previousexpansion channel regularly.

Useful or valuable discussion/advice is lost easily vs. what forums or even reddit manage to do. I can still go to dedicated (even archived) game forums for games released decades ago and find great discussion and tips/solutions. Good luck to us all in a few years if we want to dive into the records for a game which adopted Discord as the repository for advice, discussion and developer input. 

Even if the content is miraculously still hosted, the searching is poor and having channels instead of threads compounds that, so it spurs the vicious cycle of repeated questions with no responses = more poor search results. If you are lucky to have some good discussion then it's probably also punctuated with irrelevant or spam messages anyway due to the stream-of-consciousness chatroom model. 

I also think it's genuinely been detrimental to game development for indies and acts like an opt-in trap for the innovators dilemma. You end up pandering and adjusting based on the vocal views of a small number of early adopters / obsessive keenos who have disproportionate access to you as a developer, all in the name of ""community engagement"" and trying to avoid lazy Kotaku article titles like ""**DEVELOPER A responds to Discord discontent during alpha**"".

Firstly, the youth of India is not as dependent on dating apps as the youth of western countries are. However, India's population is 1,44,17,19,852, while the population of the United States of America is just 34,11,34,052. The population of the United States of America is 23.6616046819% of India's population. This means that more people participate in sexual intercourse in India than in the United States of America, which means that in India, more people are in relationships than in the United States of America. Moreso, the divorce rate of India is just 1%, while the United States of America's divorce rate is a whopping 30%; which is as much as 30 times the divorce rate of India.

My 2nd reason is the love in real-life is so beautiful! It takes time to fall in love with the one you love! You have to take risks, such as expressing your love, instead of suppressing it! One can only fall in love with 1 person at a time, instead of falling in love with multiple people at the same time! Moreso, one are not compelled to fall in love unlike in online-dating, since during the latter, the only reason both the partners meet is to fall in love, whereas in the former, there could be a multitude of reasons why their paths cross! Instead, love is done involuntarily, and not controlled by the partner. The only thing that guised you in real life is your heart, and not your brain!

My 3rd reason is that there is a wide pool of competitors that one has to compete with to get picked by somebody. Having such a wide pool of competitors means that in order to get a partner, one has to change themselves drastically, into something that might even be a shell of their own self. This is artificial, and a facade that cannot be kept up for long. This means that love will only be temporary, if it does happen. On the other hand, one is presented with si many choices that it might be difficult for them to choose. However, if they are able to pick a person, this is just pushing them from the frying-pan into the fire. They will get so picky that ot will be impossible for them to get a partner they want."

I'll provide the questions with a possible answer.

Who will pay?
All of us, we are Americans and we dont get to pick and choose which taxes we do pay and which we do not. You cant opt out of Social security, federal, or state taxes. Yes most of this money in a sense ""goes back to you"" in the form of better systems and roads for your community.  This is the issue, people dont see helping a specific demographic as helping their community. Why are Black people a community to not be helped?

How can we know who descends from slavery?
When the civil war was won, America had to pay reparations to the slave owners in the form of 300 dollars per slave. With that payment came a freedom certificate for newly freed slaves. Meaning there are records for us so that we can find out who is owed. The notion that many African people moved here in droves during segregation and slavery is one of the dumbest arguments I have heard. I understand that America was ""great back then"" but I do not believe a majority of the Black populations ancestors took it upon themselves to move to America when the water fountains were seperate. Rather than the obvious slavery that took place.

What will reparations look like?
Now im not saying send everyone a check in the mail to go to Vegas. That will just put the money back into the governments hands. Instead we should have better education reforms and in my honest opinion something similar to the post 9/11 bill that most veterans have. It gives 36 months of fully paid tuition on top of a housing allowance to give students the best opportunity at succeeding in thier education. The whole idea is to fix the wealth disparity between the generations. Education should be the priority. My opinion.

Do we include Britain?
Weird question I saw on a similar post. Since America became its own nation with its own autonomy, they had the ability to stop slavery when the nation was born, and yet chose not to. No, we are not British, we are Americans and if they had stopped it then we wouldnt even be talking about this now. The whole idea is how the AMERICAN GOVERNMENT continued to be systemically rascist even though ""all men are created equal"".

Now my question for the nay sayers.
Do you disagree because you feel Black Americans are in a great spot at the moment or is it because you feel it would be too hard and cost too much money?

If its the latter then how is that not greed and sloth and should we also take back Native/Japanese reparations since it costs too much? (Crazy Japanese people got it before Black people)"

It's almost like Neil expected an ""obviously no I wouldn't"" and was surprise that that wasn't the answer.

Honestly it's a bit ridiculous that not only was he expecting the answer to be no but also was surprised by the possibility of the answer being yes.

Like yes Neil, some people don't like the idea of being dead. That's surprising to you?

If anything it should be the more expected position for the average person until they say otherwise.

Anyways, I'm full on board with Larry here. Rip to him he died a while ago btw. I, like him, can't stand the idea of not being alive.

But I want to adress Neil's argument more here.

He says that the absence of death means a lack of urgency and why would you even get out of bed because there's always tomorrow.

I believe this is a dumb argument. If I lived forever I would maybe stay for longer in bed. But that means because I have more time I can relax more which is not a bad thing at all.

I don't think Neil would say this is a bad thing which means it's more likely he meant you would have people stay in bed for... ever?

Like never get out of bed? Spend all day eating popcorn and watching TV?

Ummm no Neil, people would still want to improve their lives today rather than tomorrow.

But perhaps it would be this year rather than next.

Like sure it would he easier to put things off but that doesn't mean I still wouldn't want to get things done. 

Besides if I do more per day with a finite life, that doesn't mean a finite life is going to make you do more.

An infinite life you could still do more if you work only 10% as hard, which again I'm not suggesting people will do.

So why the hell is a finite life better?

Infacy with a finite life your appreciation of your accomplishments will come to an end when your life is over.

With an infinite you can appreciate your life achievements for longer and you'll have more to appreciate.

It should be on them to convince their employees to stay with incentives. They shouldn't get to have the ask the good parts it capitalism while not having to deal with the bad parts 

For example, say you have a master's degree in a specialized field, and starting salary for that field is somewhere around $70k, and with nearly a decade in the industry, you make nearly twice that.

Noncompete, means that if you were to leave your current job while maintaining the lifestyle you worked hard to achieve, you would have to work in an entirely different industry, one that likely would also require comparable levels of specialized skills & education. That, or accept a 60% pay cut. More, if you consider that no longer being an employee of yourcurrent job, I would lose all the various benefits I get, and would instead have to pay for health insurance out of that $52k.

Second, some industries are fast moving. In some industries, if you're not paying attention to the constantly improving ""best practices,"" you're going to become almost unhireable over the course of a few years.

At the end of the day as a gay man my only real wants are to be able to marry and have sex with other men. This is the same for all homosexuals. Yet constantly I see laws and movements that have nothing to do with me or my community with LGB in the name. I feel like in a lot of ways the homosexuals that came before me worked extremely hard to get to the point we’re at, and that effort is now being used to further a movement that they had nothing to do with. I know many people who are trans are also homosexuals, however I would say Their gender identity has a much bigger impact on their lives and views.  I have far more in common with heterosexual males than I do with the trans and queer community. The only thing that unifies us is what divides us: the fact that we aren’t cis heterosexuals. I don’t think that’s a good thing to group people up for. I’m not trying to make any Grand statement here, I just think the acronym is dumb and misleading. I understand both groups have been and still are discriminated against but that doesn’t mean we are the same people. We might as well add a J for the Jews, and M for the Muslims, and so on.

Most statements will be _EXTREMELY_ reductive to get my general point across quickly. This CMV is important to me, because as of right now, if the republicans and dems switches positions on foreign policy related to the ongoing wars, I would vote Trump, full stop. Instead I am in complete support of Biden. I believe that the next American presidents foreign policy will have serious consequences for generations. Since I’m a single-policy voter for the upcoming election, I’d like to make sure I’m not missing anything here - and my mind is very open to being changed.

I’m American, so my viewpoints are extremely US-Centric. 

Here is the logic. 

Important definition:
When I say doing something is “economically sound” or good, etc. I mean to say that there is no better use of those funds spent domestically, to benefit as many Americans as it does, as much as it does - given current/projected spending on the topic. Because almost everything discussed has economic impacts that are exceptionally difficult if not impossible to quantify, please do not ask if I would still hold this view if we spent $X. I don’t think that’s helpful.

0. Peace is a good thing morally and economically. Especially given the historically recent push towards economic globalism, the largest economies of the world are incentivized to keep wars to an absolute minimum.
  0a. This is to say that I, despite making money almost exclusively from the production and sale of domestically produced goods to domestic customers, benefit transitively by the increased demand and surplus created by increased trade in a global economy. 

Israel
1. I believe that Israel needs to remove Hamas permanently for the Palestinians and Israelis to have any chance of peace. 
  1a. I will add a footnote here before I get downvoted to oblivion. I am highly critical of the tactics and disregard for civilians displayed by the Israelis during their campaign. Netanyahu is a piece of shit.
  1b. With that being said, if you have not seen the videos of the terrorist attack on October 7th and seen the “civilian hunting” of Hamas, and cannot comprehend how that is different than the Israelis not being surgical enough killing Hamas, who is using civilians as shields, please do not comment.
  1c. My support for the Israelis is contingent on them helping the Palestinians rebuild their land immediately after the campaign is completed. I believe the Israeli people will vote out Netanyahu, and we _may_ see a US/Japan like situation. This would be the ideal outcome IMO. 
  1d. 1(c) is a fair contingency, because it is the best chance for long term peace and stability that the Israelis have, so they should be incentivized to act this way.

2. Countries in the Middle East are watching how the US continues to support Israel and are taking note. Notable countries that come to mind are the UAE. If we want to help foster stability in the Middle East, we must become better friends with countries in the Middle East who feel as though we will help them if their neighbors (er, Iran) decide to act up and be pieces of shit. 
  2a. Another footnote before someone tells me about the human rights violations of some of these countries. I’m aware. You can become friends with someone, and explicitly not condone their behavior. Stabilization comes first, and then maybe soft influence and diplomacy can be used 

3. Even though the US’ support does not guarantee anything or solely influence the outcome, there is an insurmountably high price tag on allowing the Middle East to become destabilized. Namely, a lack of free trade (Suez canal go brrr), and the opportunity cost of economic cooperation with half a billion people. 
  3a. This doesn’t even factor in diplomatic good will. Which again, is a whole different CMV. But is still an absolutely massive factor.

4. Given these conditions, it is both morally right, and economically sound decision making to continue to support Israel for the duration of the war. (I also believe our normal economic aid, though a bit large, is also worth it for different reasons, but that’s a different CMV).


Russia/Ukraine
A. Russias invasion of Ukraine is a war of conquest, despite what Putins revisionist history ramblings may lead you to believe (lol).

B. Conquest is bad for 0. In a matter of economics, it’s important that invading other countries to obtain X amount of resources, or control X percent of Y commodity production which you believe will provide X amount of economic value when used as a diplomatic tool against other countries, is ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS NOT worth it. Because instead, the world (or NATO) is ALWAYS willing to spend 5X or 10x or 100x the amount of resources or economic value in order to prevent you from doing so. 
  b1. This is a really long and confusing way of saying, all other countries should work together to ensure that invasion and war will NEVER yield positive economic results for you. Regardless of the cost to them.

C. Therefore, it is morally and economically sound decision making to continue to support Ukraine.

Of course, the details of the economics really do matter. And my pre-req brushes over them a little too hard. But I believe that the US government is decently incentivized to spend the least amount of money (even in the most pessimistic and libertarian views of government, I don’t think anyone believes that the govt love spending taxpayer money on foreign aid) while maximizing results. In this case, we’ve done a pretty exceptional job of sending mostly old, soon to be decommissioned, etc. gear that has been used to unbelievable effect against the Russian conquest of Ukraine. 

Beyond this, the devil is mostly in the details. And we can hee and haw over details and opportunity costs. And maybe you can change my mind over opportunity costs. But in order to do so, please try to make sure that the alternative spending has a good plan. For example, I am a huge proponent for good public education. And believe more funding should be put towards it. But also, recent studies have shown that more funding isn’t fixing the fundamental issues with our schools. So more money isn’t going to help.

My knowledge of the matter is little, so let me apologize in advance if I assert something which is false or otherwise make a mistake. I'm hoping that by working together we can get closer to the truth of this matter.

First, some clarifying remarks:

The title of my post says ""university"", but actually I'm only interested in discussing what I will refer to as ""elite American research universities (EARUs)"", and by that I mean the American universities with the brightest students and the most accomplished researchers, so for example, MIT, University of Chicago and Harvard all clearly belong to this category while Albany State University (very low average SAT scores), Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (very limited research) and Indian Institute of Technology (not American) all do not belong to this category.

By ""disrupt"", I roughly mean, to do something that either prevents or makes it difficult for the audience and speaker to observe and hear each other, this includes:
* throwing objects at the speaker,
* shouting or chanting in the lecture area,
* standing between: the speaker and the audience, or presented materials and the audience,
* unplugging the sound amplification system or the projector,
* pulling the fire alarm when one does not believe there is a fire.

**My Argument**

The following argument roughly encapsulates why I believe the proposition to be true. I am interested in rebuttals of its premises, explications of bad inferences and any other reasons as to why this argument does not really show its conclusion to be true.

* Premise 1. The top two priorities of EARUs should be (A) training students to think well, and (B) advancing collective human knowledge.
* Premise 2. The orderly exchange of ideas at EARUs is necessary for both (A) and (B).
* Premise 3. Scheduled lectures (by both visiting and local scholars) at EARUs are a critical form of orderly idea exchange at EARUs.
* Conclusion 1. If someone disrupts scheduled lectures at an EARU, then they are interfering with the orderly exchange of ideas at that EARU. (from Premise 3)
* Conclusion 2. If someone disrupts scheduled lectures at an EARU, then they are interfering with (A) and (B). (from Premise 2 and Conclusion 1)
* Conclusion 3. EARU administrators should (if necessary, forcibly) remove disruptive people from scheduled lectures. (from Premise 1 and Conclusion 2)

**Counterargument**

I also have some interest in high quality arguments that just directly show Conclusion 1 or 2 to be false. For example, I believe this to be an interesting counterargument:

* Premise 4. There should be no EARUs.
* Premise 5. If EARUs are improved, then it is more likely that EARUs will continue to exist.
* Premise 6. If EARU administrators remove disruptive people from scheduled lectures, then EARUs will be improved.
* Conclusion 4. If EARU administrators remove disruptive people from scheduled lectures, then it is more likely that EARUs will continue to exist. (from Premise 5 and Premise 6)
* Conclusion 5. EARU administrators should not remove disruptive people from scheduled lectures. (from Premise 4 and Conclusion 4)"

Whilst it *may* take many years to see a fully functioning humanoid that can replicate humans (up to a certain degree, with the exception knowing they are robots) I do believe technology should prioritise developing AI humanoids for dating. 

There is a division about whether there is a ‘gender war’ in society, but I frankly do believe that whilst there isn’t a “war”, I believe that there is a lot of resentment towards the opposite sex from both sexes. 

Whilst I want to be general, I’ll try to be a bit more specific. I’d say the “war” is from *single* people from opposite sexes, especially young people. 

For example: Some young men believe that it’s extremely hard to date because young women’s standards are “too high”, and there are stereotypes of how women only want to date the top (whatever) percent of men due to the things they have, like more acquired wealth or really good physical looks. 

Another example: Some young women believe that young men don’t do the “bare minimum” when it comes to dating, or that too many men are interested in hooking up for their bodies rather than focusing on building long term relationships. 

Then you have the smaller subsets where there ARE extremes on both ends, like *actual* incels, BUT because of social media, any person who tries to voice out their issues with dating (mostly men) are already labelled as incels for voicing them out in the first place. 

It’s argued that the term “incels” is not inherently bad, because it quite literally means any person who desires a sexual or romantic partner but are unable to do so. 

However the term incel today (in online or popular culture) has an extremely negative connotation, because it’s used more as a derogatory term and insult. 

The ‘gender war’ IS happening due to various number of things, which I would personally say is heavily exacerbated due to the toxicity of social media. 

So what is the solution? Developing and creating humanoids. In this context, for dating. 

Why do I think it would help society? Firstly it would help a LOT of men with the current male loneliness epidemic. Men who desire girlfriends but struggle to date, can finally get a girlfriend, though it’s a humanoid. 

If said humanoid can provide companionship or sex (assuming technology is extremely advanced and it is actually possible) you’d see less people have that resentment against the opposite sex *because* of their struggles with dating. 

AI BF’s and AI GF’s is already a real thing. There are apps like Replika, and glow. 

Having humanoids could ease the tensions between the opposite sex regarding dating as expectations would have changed by then. 

Let’s say for 10 years more men and women shift to dating humanoids, and then realise humanoids simply aren’t as good as real humans, we’d see a culture shift where perhaps there wouldn’t be as much toxicity and resentment against the opposite sex.

The goal is NOT for humanoids to replace humans for companionship, (in my CMV), the humanoids are meant as an outlet for humans to seek companionship. And once the ‘online gender war’ has eased a bit, maybe people will finally be more open to dating each other. 

I know some people might say in the comments that people ARE dating each other, which is true, but this is geared towards younger generations and people who are “chronically single.” 

I also say younger generations because a lot of data has already shown that younger men today are still struggling to date (globally, as I’m not just talking about the US) 

Developing humanoids for dating will help society in the long run when eventually humans realise that we do need each other and not humanoids, and perhaps the current dating culture would shift and make it easier for people to date humans again."

[Recently, Idaho passed a bill that would give convicted child molesters the death penalty.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.kmvt.com/2024/02/14/controversial-idaho-house-bill-would-give-death-penalty-those-convicted-heinous-sexual-acts-against-children-under-12/%3foutputType=amp)

On paper, this might sound good. But in practice, I think it backfires.

My reasoning is rather simple: The death penalty only encourages further molestation/other crimes. Possibly even murder of the victim. Let me explain.

The child molester already committed the crime. They know if they get caught, they get killed. If they are sure they will eventually get caught, they most likely will continue the molestation as it doesn't matter, they are getting the death penatly anyway. 

Another possible outcome in some cases is the murder of the victim, to silence them and cover it up. Again, the death penalty in this case doesn't discourage this, as even with the murder, if they get caught, the outcome is the same.

Those are my thoughts on this. I am willing to change my mind.

1,2024-02-15,CMV: Ozempic should be unavailable to anyone in the USA unless you have Type 2 Diabetes.,u/shoshana4sure,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1arl771/cmv_ozempic_should_be_unavailable_to_anyone_in/,changemyview,"So I learned the other day, that the company who manufactures Ozempic is in Europe ( Novonordisk), and people in Europe do not use Ozempic as a weight loss drug primarily, rather, they use it for type two diabetes. This European country makes its profits off of stupid and overweight Americans and greedy doctors by selling it off label as a weight loss drug, therefore, harming, millions of people, yet making a profit.

I think it is irresponsible of doctors to promote this product to their patients, as the side effects can be deadly. Yes, I know people want to lose weight, but taking a dangerous drug, promoted by the doctors as being safe is irresponsible. 

Ozempic was not created as being a weight loss drug, but it slows down the motility in the gut, therefore making you feel fuller longer. I know there are some other hormonal implications, but I’m not 100% sure. 

So some of the side effects are so bad that people end up stopping it, like extreme gastrointestinal issues. But one of the possible side effects, from what I’ve heard, is suicidal ldeation. So 90% or more of your serotonin and other neurotransmitters are made in the gut, so when you take a drug that is designed to be for type two diabetes, and you take it for weight loss, you are messing with the ecosystem of the gut, therefore peoples serotonin and other Other hormones take a dip, causing them to have suicidal ideation.

And as usual, the FDA supposedly runs their own studies, and they always say the jury is still out on suicidal ideation, or that it just doesn’t show it yet, but we know how that works with the FDA, after millions of people die, they come out, saying oh, it’s very possible that it causes this. But nonetheless, I have listened to scientists and doctors on different podcasts discuss the dangers of Ozempic. Why is it that European doctors do not prescribe these things for their patients?

I think there should be something that you sign, saying hey, I know that I could lose my hair, commit suicide, or have severe gastrointestinal problems, and then get Ozempic face and Ozempic but, but I’m willing to do that, just to lose weight. 

Whatever happened to adjusting your hormones, dieting, or exercising? People are so lazy, and the FDA and doctors know it, and we have such an obesity and fat demographic now, that people are willing to take the simple way out, even if it is going to damage their health. 

So many drugs are used off label, and I don’t think people even realize that said, drug is not designed to treat their particular problem. For example, Seroquel wasn’t antipsychotic drugs that killed so many people, it is specifically designed for people who have psychosis or schizophrenia. But doctors were giving it to people for sleep, but they got in huge trouble and had to pay millions of dollars for that. 

There are so many drugs that are off label, like puberty blockers. People are using them for purposes that they were not originally designed for. So why will the drug company not put down all the other diseases or conditions that the drug could help? Who is saying that a certain drug can be used for something totally different than its intended purpose? Nonetheless, Ozempic is one of those things, and I think it needs to be illegal."

\- BLM.  First of all black lives do matter. I get the history, I get that black people definitely have had, and continue to have, an EXTREMELY shitty time in the US.  The problem is, you have white/brown kids and ignorant adults who don't understand the history saying ""why doesn't mine matter?"" ... the biggest problem is that it's so hard to defend when ""all lives matter"" became a dog whistle for conservatives.  This fed into their propaganda that all liberals want to do is keep the country divided up by race.  This leads to such idiotic phrases like ""hey, didn't you know that the democrats created the KKK, jim crow, and loved segregation in pre-1960s south?""... yeah, and then you have to go deep into the history of the US and the civil rights era and how both parties switched sides.  Most people don't want to hear more than one sentence of something that doesn't affect them, so they tune out after they hear KKK.

\- ""Fight For 15"" a slogan made to try to get $15 as the new min. wage.  What happens when inflation rises (as it did, for other reasons) to where $15 isn't enough to live on? What about when people who have college degrees are making $14/hour and wondering why the stereotype of ""a teenager flipping burgers"" is making more than they currently do.  What they SHOULD have done was say something to effect of that min. wage should be tied to inflation, unfortunately, that's really freaking difficult to put in a slogan, let alone get most people to understand, or too complicated for most people who work min. wage out of necessity.

I'm sure there are others, but those are the ones that piss me off every time I hear them.

Examples of GOP being GOOD at advertising is are MAGA and climate change.

\- MAGA - ""Oh, you don't want America to be great?!?!"", end of conversation.  it doesn't allow for the rational thought of ""When Was America Great to begin with?"" which for white cis-het people (mostly males) was the 1950s, but for everyone else it hasn't really declined.

\- Climate change - ""hey the weather changes constantly, and has been forever, how is that our issue?"", then you have to go into the diff between weather and climate and you lost people.   Then you have to explain how we know the climate of the earth for the last 200+ years when most people think we didn't have good thermometers or records from back then, to explain the science of how we can say, ""well, when we dig deep enough into the ground, or look at the rings of really old trees, we can extrapolate the values""

&#x200B;

UPDATE: After about an hour, I have to get back to work, but I think y'all are hitting the wrong point to change my view. I'm not saying the policies are good/bad, or that we lose a lot of the time, but when we lose, I can see advertising being a big factor to a lot of people. I'm getting the following categories:

* ""the policies are complicated, so we can't make a good one"" (that explains my point, doesn't change it)
* ""Republicans are running on nothing so it's easy"" (again, proving my point),
* ""no, you're wrong (no explanation)"" (doesn't change my mind)

We Canadians are already the ""younger sister"" to the US, and generally we get a lot of ""hand-me-downs"", be it military, tech, entertainment, and even societal/social inclinations. The US already ""owns"" Alaska, of which I think is purely for military purpose to keep Russia from ass fucking us by breaching that land bridge.  
And so since we indeed share an extreme border, and social influence of the US maybe it's better that we just become a super continent?  
But we Canadians have sub-par health-care, and decent enough gun laws to be able to right up own firearms, but they aren't lenient enough that we regularly have home made terrorist attacks every week or so.  
Canada also has it's own economy, government, treaties, and as such a lot of issues present itself in having to legitimately integrate both.  
I'm not educated enough, nor am I a person to advocate on ideas without properly discussing them prior to practice or belief. I discussed with some bots on the idea, but I'm still unsure the full scale of the idea, how it would be done so that both countries would be like ""Yea, ya know, maybe?""  
Pros:  
  
Enhanced Economic Cooperation:  
Deeper integration could benefit trade, investment, and job markets, especially given the existing USMCA free trade agreement. Potential boost in specific industries benefitting from cross-border collaboration.  
  
Unified Global Influence:  
Increased geopolitical power on the world stage, particularly amidst rising influences from the East (e.g., China, Russia). May create a stronger position for negotiation and security purposes.  
  
Shared Resources & Expertise:  
Greater access to natural resources, technological innovation, and research infrastructure across a unified country could benefit both sides.  
  
Cons  
Diminished Sovereignty:  
Canada would lose a significant degree of independent control over its laws, foreign policy, and economic decision-making.  
  
Strain on Systems:  
Harmonizing different healthcare, welfare, and legal systems would be extremely complex and could lead to short-term (and potentially lasting) disruption.  
  
Identity Concerns:  
Canada's unique culture, bilingualism, and political tradition risk being subsumed within the larger US landscape. This could spark social and political tension.

Be it just revenge like the parents taking it into their own hands or the person just rots in jail… it should still be on them. It’s easy to be a judge for something that didn’t really impact you, that’s why I have my own opinion on this. Always had this really unpopular view and I’m open to having it changed of course. 

I saw a video a few years ago of a father who lunged at the murderer of his daughter and that frustrated me so damn much. They shouldn’t have stopped him.

Now my opinion is that the judge doesn’t do the sentencing here, just the victims. I believe it could be extremely therapeutic and be a form of an outlet for the victims/families to get closure and justice for the pain they experienced."

If you don't do what we want, you're worthless to us."" 

Students who did poorly were often singled out and mentioned by name as examples of what not to be. Students who obviously came from neglectful homes were given no extra help or leniency, they were just treated as failures when they were clearly suffering and not allowed basic hygiene at home. How can you expect someone to get their work done when they don't even have a clean table at home? The students who were treated fairly were the ones who lived in the same subdivisions as the teachers, the ones who live in the neighborhood and who's parents hang out with the teachers as friends. 

There was a clear rift, if you could afford to live in the middle class subdivisions you were worth something and the teachers treated you like a person, if you couldn't afford to live there you were treated with disrespect. Poor kids were seen as a bad influence on the middle class subdivisioners, and so didn't deserve respect. They were always bad right from the start to the teachers. 

There were times I walked up to the teacher to ask for help, and they would stop and make me go away when one of their preferred students would come ask for help, or sometimes refuse to help at all. 

When I see teachers talk about problem students online they don't talk about the factors that cause them, and chock it up to ""lack of discipline."" (By discipline they mean that the poor kids will magically overcome all of their life problems by being beaten a little harder next time, as if they aren't already being beaten for everything they do or don't do.)"

And I'm convinced it can be done in a way where nobody is harmed. Just put them in containers areas with proper housing and everything they need and want and just let them live their lives without having a vote and the people that can think will manage the rest. The stupid ones are happy with their little lives of perfection and without a worry in the world and other people can finally bring humankind forward. But as I know humans, this won't ever happen.

* Latinos and Arabs both have different historical backgrounds and culture but share similar things

Latinos are what we refer to as Latino Americans coming from Latin America. They’re Iberian and French (Hello Haiti and French Guinea). Anyone can be Latino of any color like Arabs, their features are usually of Iberian, Indigenous American or African ancestry, they can be a mix of either two, one group or a mix of the three. They’re the New World people like Americans and Canadians only they are the group of people from Mexico to Argentina including the Carribbean (Cuba, PR and DR). Religion predominantly Roman Catholic and either Spanish or Portugese. Customs influenced by Iberia

* “Arabs” as we refer to them are not really ethnically Arabs sometimes, just linguistically and culturally Arabs. They became Arabs through conquest by the Arabs and their languages and customs changed to be more Arabized. Their religion became Islam, their language became Arabic. Just like Latinos became of the Spanish language and of Roman Catholicism.I don’t think this means they both share common cultures or anything and of course this doesn’t mean that they both should team up because they had similar backgrounds or anything but I noticed this from the two groups. I would like to see my view changed as I do think they’re some key differences.

P.S: I don’t know if the term “Hispanic” is used elsewhere around the world so I stuck with “Latino” as the terminology. Hispanic is something certain Latin Americans will identify as and there is nothing wrong with it, their language and customs came from Spain, Cuba was Spanish colony until 1898 so their claim to Hispanic and being of predominantly Spanish culture isn’t far off from its history."

It seems that MAGA conservatives and left-wing radicals alike are open to isolating the US from our NATO allies, which I think would be a generationally awful foreign policy blunder, ultimately resulting in bloody war in Europe. 

While this may have been a different discussion in early 2020, Putin has now made his imperial ambitions and willingness to wage war clear. His invasion of the sovereign state of Ukraine was an unprecedented violation of all the laws and norms of war Europe established after World War 2. Putin has made his ambition to recapture other former Soviet Republics clear, and it seems self-evident that the only thing stopping Putin from eventually invading NATO allies is his fear of triggering NATO's Article 5 and falling into a war with the United States.

While other NATO members have their own armies, they suck. [All other NATO allies combined have a smaller fighting force than Russia or the US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/584286/number-of-military-personnel-in-nato-countries/), and their technology and training are generally regarded as woefully inadequate. Turkey is the only other NATO ally with a decent army, but they're also the most unreliable in the alliance (along with Hungary). Without the guarantee of US mutual defense, I don't think that the threat of European NATO allies alone would be enough to deter further Russian expansion once they finish the war in Ukraine, and have the time to rebuild their army.

As always, I'm open to genuine folks trying to change my mind on this assessment. "

My issue with this is that I believe people are mistaking racism with systematic oppression.

Racism as a word, to me at least  simply means prejudice based on race. Any prejudice that is based on someones race or ethnic background is an example of racism.

Systematic racism is a form of oppression based on racial characteristics, and it’s true that white people have rarely been held under these systems.

So the mistake people make is claiming that POC can’t be racist full stop, which is untrue, and actually a racist claim in itself. 

If somebody dislikes white people based on the colour of their skin or the acts of their ancestors that is racism in its rawest form, just like any other."

It was the english teacher, the writer, the scientist, or the the aristocrats who lived down the street, or in their own communities. When they gathered, conversation was often contentious, full of debate. However, ordinary people look up to these individuals as encyclopaedias, or scoffed at them for their pedantry or unholiness.

The communities were largely separate, with much of the intellectual production organised in these smaller circles and those who broke out did so with novel ideas/experiments or because they were in some way or another on top of some intellectual hierarchy. In the age of digitalisation the distinction between intellectuals and ordinary citizens has become far less clear. Everybody has become inundated with information, no longer just the aristocrats and a subset of dedicated individuals. Moreover, the information people take in is far more passive, ordinary people often are not the commanders of their content, even less so than a bourgeois academic at a bookstore (who also did not have full command, but at least their information was more carefully curated). 

The entire world has now in many ways become the room of intellectuals debating, only the information delivery is far more disjointed and thus are the debates themselves. Intellectuals still have some distinction, they tend to be more fleshed out fountains of knowledge whereas most others are a walking list of spread out bullet points and just enough info on each point to substantiate a short conversation. 

Unfortunately popular media does not respect this distinction, it favours the bullet point style of dissemination instead of steering into holistic understanding. This dialectic between media which replicates the experience of ordinary individuals for resonance and profit, and the individuals themselves who feed into it, creates a totally polemic and disjointed atmosphere. We will climb deeper and deeper into it under each person with inclinations is their own pseudo-philosopher and media algorithms narrow down to echo and perpetuate the philosopher of every particular individual rather than group ideology.

1,2024-02-15,CMV: Pregnant women are not being murdered constantly & Femicide is not a widespread issue in the US. Making up problems like this is HARMFUL to society. ,u/Scary-Ad-1345,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1arrj0n/cmv_pregnant_women_are_not_being_murdered/,changemyview,"For context, there are a number of people who will lead you to believe that the murder of women or pregnant women is a growing concern. My argument is not simply that we shouldn’t be concerned about this, I think that it’s actually harmful to society to talk about manufactured problems when real problems already exist.

Just to make my argument simple let’s say this. 

Let’s say every group has a rank

•	Rank 1: 10 points

•	Rank 2: 9.1 points

•	Rank 3: 8.9 points

•	Rank 4: 8 points

•	Rank 5: 6 points

•	Rank 6: 5 points

•	Rank 7: 2 points

•	Rank 8: 1.9 points

In this hypothetical society, being odd or even carries certain advantages, but these benefits are marginal at best. The focus on evenness particularly helps Rank 2 and Rank 4, leaving Ranks 6 and 8 without significant progress. The real goal should be to uplift the lower ranks to ensure everyone meets basic living standards: 3 points for safety, 6 for comfort, and 8 for a nice life. Addressing the even vs. odd issue should come only after ensuring that the fundamental needs of the lower ranks are met, promoting a more equitable society.

https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/erase-mm/data-mmrc.html

There were 17 pregnancy related murders between 2017-2019

The only demographics with a significant murder issue would be Hispanic men black men & Native American men

Black men have the highest chance to be murdered in their lifetime @ 1/20 or about 5% taking away from the actual issues to talk about femicide are harmful to society. We’re trying to fix a problem that doesn’t exist. 

https://www.cdc.gov/women/lcod/2018/all-races-origins/index.htm

https://www.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/lcod/men/2018/all-races-origins/index.htm

My issue with most articles about femicide is that it takes statics from very specific situations. It says “this age group after this happens and this is a part of it and blah blah blah” like we don’t need all these qualifiers. Is it happening at significant rate or is it not? If the answer is no then why are we not taking about the 5% murder rate or the 2.5% murder rate? Income disparity between minorities and white/asian people? 

These are all quantifiable issues.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/1186184/us-median-annual-worker-earnings-ethnicity-gender/

Basically if the biggest determining factor for living a good life is race, focusing on gender is only beneficial to the people at the top.

Talking about how women are dying while pregnant when 300 pregnant women were murdered while pregnant & 17 were determined to be directly related to then pregnancy is counterproductive. You’re making these into hate crimes when they’re not.

https://www.justice.gov/crs/highlights/2022-hate-crime-statistics

https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2019/topic-pages/victims

Cherry picking stats to fit your narrative is counterproductive. 

All encompassing stats that’s don’t have arbitrary qualifiers tell the story. Gender inequality exists, but can we focus on the bigger issue we have as a country.

I know people are gonna start bringing up sexual assault, it’s not really relevant to the conversation but before you do this understand that black men experience sexual assault at a rate similar to white women. It further increases when you account for the prison population or if you think about under reporting especially due to culture & education. A lot of black men are proud of their own molestation. Ask any black guy about when he lost his virginity and you’ll understand.

I’m not saying that they are not old enough to make a decision, or that they do not have the wherewithal, but what I’m saying is, this is a very financially dangerous, and potentially exploitative relationship. I think it would be wise for women to understand the financial and social implications of what they’re about to embark upon.

Obviously, this does not apply to a relationship where the woman has a child and she wants to be a stay at home mother, that is perfectly fine, and whatever arrangement she and her husband make is fine. But if there are no children involved and the woman is just simply staying at home, or a gentleman has a woman stay at home and do nothing and he pays for everything, this is a very dangerous decision, that could leave the woman to be completely broke.

I mean half of marriages end, can you imagine if a woman stayed in a marriage or one of these situations for 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 years and she had absolutely no savings, yet he was building a nest egg in the background, while she was staying at home and working and raising a child, or just keeping the house, clean and cooking? She would be out with absolutely nothing. And while it may seem appealing to just stay at home, and really not do much, she must realize it when she is 40 or 50 and she gets left for someone younger, she will end up with her suitcase and no money. I really don’t see why a woman whatever choose this.

I have a feeling this is going to be an extremely toxic change my view with a bunch of red pilled man, but I’m hoping that I get some good feedback, especially from women. I’m not really sure if I want to hear from a lot of men. Because I already know what they’re going to say.

The is essentially a repost because I messed up by getting off subject and angered a bunch of people because I mentioned how statistics are misused to distract from racial issues to focus on gender issues. My wording wasn’t great so people missed the point. 

Essentially what I’m saying here is that for the United States fighting off gender equality doesn’t help black or Hispanic women almost at all. 

These are estimates but it will get my point across

If we look at average income

Asian male 90k

Asian female 80k

White male 80k

White female 70k

Hispanic Male 55k

Hispanic female 45k

Black male 45k

Black female 40k

These are not 100% accurate and it varies year to year. They’re supposed to just be a representation for my views on these things. 

If we equalized income between the genders then black women and Hispanic women would just be equal to their racial counterparts. Realistically if you’re looking for gender equality in terms of finances and you’re black or Hispanic then you’re fighting for nothing? If the primary goal is RACIAL equality and we all made as much as white men and women or Asian men and women then everyone’s happy. We can worry about gender after that. 

I think the only reason we talk about gender inequality so much is because if you’re getting 2 incomes as a white couple it’s in your best interest for your wife to make as much as you. I also think it makes sense because white women are such a large percentage of this country so they would do something that only benefits them. The men at the top get no benefit so they would want to support the people closest to them. But the most confusing part is when black and Hispanic women focus on the gendered aspect over the racial aspect. You would benefit so much from racial equality gender should be secondary.

Also looking at maternal mortality rates it’s pretty much a black issue. Talking about healthcare and that kind of stuff it’s black people who suffer. If you get as much “attention” by medical professionals as your male counterpart congratulations you’re now even MORE likely to die than you were before. Black women are dying during childbirth because they’re BLACK not because they’re women.

For example, let’s say there’s somebody named Jol (made-up, of course). Jol doesn’t see the need to worry about climate change, because the real problems most likely won’t, “hit us for quite a while.” 

I cannot agree with Jol, whatsoever. I mean, how could I? People who have this stance, and there are many, couldn’t be bothered to give a damn, and that leads to those who do often thinking that they don’t have as much help as they need to take a stand, thus causing them to also stop even trying. 

I want my view to be changed because I despise knowing that people just don’t care. Is there a deeper meaning to this POV that I’m just missing?

1,2024-02-15,CMV: News outlets should avoid disclosing political motives of an individual who commits mass homicide,u/nailswithoutanymilk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1arwunk/cmv_news_outlets_should_avoid_disclosing/,changemyview,"For example, if someone leaves a bunch of politics in a note or post before committing mass homicide, the news will almost always share those views they had, which is EXACTLY what that person wanted. Why are we enabling it? We are giving these murders what they want, attention and a platform to have their views shared.

In the US, many news outlets have stopped sharing the faces and names of people who commit mass shootings because it’s theorized that the attention they get is one (of many) reasons they do the shootings. That’s great that news outlets have started/stopped doing this, but I think we should also be hiding their political motives too for the exact same reason.

I know this isn’t the single reason or even the main reason people commit mass homicide, but if leaving their names and faces out of the reporting was important enough, I think this is at least worth considering."

Here are a few incidents that have contributed to my view:

-Teachers telling kids that physical aggression is a way to express attraction

-Teachers giving punishments to all based on the actions of a few (""If you two don't stop talking, no one gets recess"")

-Many incidents of a clear inability to manage 20 children (kids left outside after recess, injuries in the classroom)

-Very short tempers with children who vary from basic neurotypical thinking (sit still in this desk for 3 hours, no you may not mess with silly putty while you're here)

-Straight-up bullying kids (I guarantee y'all can think of examples)

-Teaching kids outright falsehoods, showing a lack of ability to think critically and fact-check before spreading lies to children

The fact that all these things seem to be mainstream (based on people nationwide that I talk to) leads me to the conclusion that most schoolteachers are not mentally well enough to be influencing children in such a way. I don't want to think that most of the people educating our youth are not fit to do so, but that's my opinion right now. I look forward to productive discussion!"

Sorry to say, on more than a few occasions, we got pretty drunk. It was not uncommon that someone who was totally inebriated would drive home.

Now that I am older, I appreciate the danger involved. Not only can you get injured in an accident, but you could severely injure or even kill another person, triggering all sorts of legal peril. You could end up time for manslaughter for what would otherwise be a somewhat routine accident. But it makes no sense to allow bars to serve people drinks, all the while knowing that more than 90% of their patrons will be driving home when the bar closes.

In California, the 4 or 5 drinks within two hours is enough to trigger a blood alcohol level of .08%, the legal limit for drunk driving.

I appreciate people's concern about the potential harm drunk driving can cause, but it makes no sense unless we willing to ban establishments that serve alcohol. Change my view!"

I think that is myopic, as often things that don't directly harm someone can have an indirect overall negative impact on society. An example would be drinking and drug use. Individuals who use will have more health problems, which places a greater burden on the medical system, decreased productivity, worse emotional states that negativity effect how they treat others, etc. Addiction and overdose also negativity effect the people in a drug user's life. Not to mention drunk driving, violent and criminal behavior etc. One might argue that's not relevant, since some people can use responsibly, and it's the drunk driving or violence that is the problem, not the alcohol or drugs, but either a majority or plurality of people use irresponsibly, and I see no reason to think that's going to change. We need to recognize that individual behaviors have cumulative effect, in the same way we recognize that something like climate change is the cumulative effect of many, many people's actions, where each individual action is not necessarily wrong, but becomes so when millions of people engage in it.

If their pace continues they won't have their 2021 borders back until 2030, and there simply is no way that they fight for that long. Russia's choice to annex the four Oblasts and pull out of northern Ukraine shows that they did demonstrates that those will be enough for them in Ukraine (for now) so I think Ukraine should negotiate with the USA to let them into NATO and in return they will sign peace with Russia. 

I should mention that I don't think that all the military support was useless. It has demonstrated to Russia that war will not be easy for it and I think that had the west not helped, Ukraine could be entirely subject to Russia right now.

I would like this view changed since I don't want to believe that in the modern world a powerful, tyrannical nation can simply walk into a peaceful democratic nation and take what it wants. "

1,2024-02-16,CMV: Affirmative action only exacerbated nationwide racism instead of resolving it,u/Top_Row_5116,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1as3f2o/cmv_affirmative_action_only_exacerbated/,changemyview,"First off, I'm not using any sources for this, I'm just going off of the ""logically this happens"" standpoint so if I am wrong about anything I say, do prove me wrong with sources and anecdotal evidence. I'm primarily discussing affirmative action in college education, including admittance rates and scholarships granted to POC.  
  
In my view, implementing affirmative action, such as through scholarships and grants exclusively awarded to POC (People of Color), has only worsened racism in the USA rather than alleviating it.  
  
One of the main issues with affirmative action is its insincere focus on checking boxes. Colleges often pride themselves on boasting a diverse student population, leading them to implement policies that prioritize racial diversity without considering the broader implications.  
  
These policies undermine the principle of meritocracy by prioritizing race or ethnicity over individual merit and qualifications. This can foster a perception among both minority and majority groups that individuals are not being judged based on their abilities and achievements, but rather on their race or ethnicity.  
  
Moreover, affirmative action may inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes about the academic abilities of certain racial or ethnic groups. By suggesting that certain groups require preferential treatment to succeed academically, it can reinforce harmful stereotypes and stigmatize individuals from those groups.  
  
Beyond perpetuating stereotypes, affirmative action can also create resentment and division among different racial and ethnic groups. Some individuals may feel unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged by these policies, leading to tensions and conflicts within educational institutions and broader society.  
  
Additionally, affirmative action often overlooks the intersectionality of race and socioeconomic status. Many disadvantaged individuals, regardless of race, face barriers to accessing quality education and opportunities. By focusing solely on race, affirmative action may fail to address the underlying socioeconomic inequalities that contribute to educational disparities.  
  
Moreover, these policies have faced legal challenges on the grounds of reverse discrimination and violation of equal protection rights. The legal and ethical implications raise questions about fairness, justice, and the appropriate role of race in decision-making processes.  
  
I don't understand why these financial decision makers don't just take out the race, name, and gender boxes on scholarship and admittance forms so that individuals can be judged on merit alone and not things like race. "

If these aspects are genuinely normalized, why the hesitation and concealment?

We’ve gone through an entire body positivity movement, and people saying how you shouldn’t feel shamed to be fat.

But they still refuse to say their weight when you ask them.

We’ve gone through an entire sexual revolution where people claim they’re taking back their sexuality, and it’s okay to act on your desires!

People will sit on social media and make posts defending this, but they’re still ashamed and won’t tell you what their own bodycount is. They might even insult you for asking about it.

We’ve gone through an entire “my body, my choice” movement.

But they’re still ashamed and wouldn’t tell you if they’ve gotten an abortion before.

If these things are truly normal, why do you feel shame about them? If you truly believe that everyone else is wrong and old fashioned, why do you run from the truth of the situation?

People are okay with being openly gay (when it’s safe), and that was frowned upon not very long ago. So we can assume that they actually believe being gay is normal.

They’re not open about these other things, so one can assume they don’t really believe in what they’re saying. They just wanted to feel better for their bad decisions."
1,2024-02-16,cmv:Russia can very well take over the entirety of Europe if it wants to.  ,u/AdTrick7283,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1as5rye/cmvrussia_can_very_well_take_over_the_entirety_of/,changemyview,"Firstly, Russia has China as its ally. China is right now, the 2nd most powerful country in the world, second to only the United States of America. This means that Russia had a big advantage; trading with China. Moreso, China also supports Russia's actions. Moreso, China is even doing something similar, with countries such as India, Taiwan, Tibet, Mongolia, etc. Meanwhile, western support of Ukraine is waning day by day, with countries instead focusing on wars like the Israel-Palestine war, Armenia-Azerbaijan war, etc. Vladimir Putin even said that Joe Biden is a better president for the United States of America than Donald Trump, since Joe Biden is softer on Russia than Donald Trump. Moreso, India is supporting Russia as well, and it has the 5th-largest economy in the world right now. With these many allies, Russia can easily take over the rest of the European countries after conquering Ukraine. 

Secondly, it has historical parallels. Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were amazing when they decided to take over Europe and the Pacific. Nazi Germany took on France, which was the 2nd-largest empire in the world! It even took over Poland; the 4th most powerful Ally country, after the United States of America, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union! It forced Great Britain Meanwhile, Imperial Japan was on another brilliant streak of conquering! It had conquered China, a natuon that was industrialising and had amazing potential! It  conquered Phillipines, who were part of the United States of America, and therefore, conquered a part of the United States of America, which was nearly impossible to do at the tine, and nearly impossible to do now! They are akin to Russia right now!

Finally, Russia has no competitors right now. The United States of America has only given sanctions to Russia and Belarus, and not gone in the war yet. All Russia needs to do is to not conduct another Pearl Harbor or another Operation Barbossa and disturb a major world power that can oppose it and conquer all its territory and leave it in a worse place than it was prior to the war, like what happened with East Germany and West Germany. Russia does not have competitors akin to the Soviet Union, Great Britain, or the United States of America right now, like the Axis powers did during World War II.

These reasons are why I believe that Russia can conquer Europe."

And I get that a lot of you are also shaking your heads cause this may be the most incel type post I could write, but I'm gonna write it anyway because I'm not going to keep this to myself any longer.

The next of these is my ""height complex"". To preface, I am almost 25, a virgin, never been in a relationship, and am a measly 5'6.5"". Now it wouldn't be fair for me to exclude other parts as well, such as me being on the spectrum, having GAD and dysthymia (and potentially BPD), and also trauma from basically being seen as a worthless wretch for most of my life, so take what you will with that.

And I also ain't afraid to say this: 5 years ago when I got measured for an anthropometrics class and realized that I was shorter than I thought I was, I went to the ER for thoughts self-h\*rm, only to be greeted by some of the biggest hospital worker scum I have ever met, who preached about BS like ""most US presidents being average height"" and how my ""anger and irritability would turn women off"" even though most cases I never outright showed such emotions when trying to find a partner/connections. The fact that the psychiatrist who was saying this stuff was like 6'4/6'5"" makes him even more of a pretentious jerk IMO. The fact that the woman who measured my height in the class (5'8.5"") just said my height so nonchalantly is also... jarring tbh.

Regardless, here's why ever since that day I have always had a lingering complex around my height and why I feel like short guys might as well give up on trying to live a good life: in no particular order.

&#x200B;

* Dating/getting married: Do I need to say anything more? Look at any dating sub (online or off) and you'll see
* Finding a high-paying occupation that doesn't involve becoming some kind of doctor/career that actually values innate abilities rather than superficial stuff
* Actually being respected without having to prove something other than physical attributes
* Getting mocked either implicitly or explicitly and being reminded of our inferiority, even sometimes by family members. My mother actually said to me when I told her I liked one of our family friends' daughters that ""oh idk she's 5'11, I'm not sure"", and my young cousin who's 10 (and will inevitably become at least 6'1"" like my uncle) doesn't hesitate to take jabs at my height when he can
* At least fat girls can lose weight, whilst short guys can't change their height, yet judging the former is seen as ""worse"" than the latter?

It seems like the only short men who wouldn't want to give up on life were those who came from money, cultures that don't have obsessions with height, or those who have supernaturally interesting personalities/intelligence/humour to ""compensate"". Otherwise, we might as well just give up on living happy lives in western, capitalist societies that only seem to value money and looks.

Lastly, I'm not afraid also to say either than as a Torontonian, that I absolutely despise going downtown and having to see all these attractive tall guys who probably know nothing about true struggles like I do and wouldn't know anything about earning jack squat in their lives, but perhaps that's a flawed thought too and you're welcome to challenge that.

 In my opinion when I think about the Big Bang theory... that definitely feels like a miracle in itself. Cosmic energy influenced by some sort of higher power to even make this bang. 

It is very possible that atheists are right and that there is nothing after we die. 

But it is also very possible that they are wrong!

I am personally more of a believer of an afterlife rather than God but again....I don't think that makes me an atheist. 

So to conclude: please offer me a perspective as to why being ""atheist"" is NOT close minded"

It really does make me feel better.

So I wanted to do some research, and I found that not only is it a sign of possible verbal intelligence, but that it also has pain relief capabilities. I never knew any of this.

But it does say that you shouldn’t overdo it and everything is nuanced and you should be fully aware of your environment. For example, you wouldn’t say a lot of these things in front of your grandmother or in front of your Pastor.

I was brought up with a family who cost quite a bit, and my father was in the medical field, and my mother, while she was just my mother. But they cost so much, which is why I probably do as well, but I’ve never looked at it as a bad thing. But now learning that it’s a good thing, maybe I won’t feel so guilty about doing it.

1,2024-02-16,CMV: Nationalism isn't a bad Ideology,u/Hungry-Vast7528,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1asbx1u/cmv_nationalism_isnt_a_bad_ideology/,changemyview,"Before you start typing ""You think Nazi's are good?"", read what I've got to say. I see nationalist thrown as a insult similar to facist and nazis, when it really doesn't make sense.  


Nationalism is a ideology where you put your nation's and your citizens interests above all else. If it means triggering war, or sanctions, so be it. The problem starts when people in power weaponize nationalism in pursuit of expansionist goals.   


The perfect example of how nationalism can work is India. India has like, twice the population of Europe, Probably more diverse than europe too, No complete majority in religion (yes, Hindus make up like 75%, but they don't hold all the political power, appeasing the minorities is important) and Very few instances of being united by a national power. (The Mughals were Persian-mongols, the Delhi sultanate were Turkic). The only thing that united them was their fight against the British (And even then, they separated into two, though the reasons for it was less about nationalism and more about a certain guy being moronic).   


When you really think about it, the diversity, the landmass and the population of India, it's bonkers how they haven't split into many states. Yes, they have had issues, yes they aren't necessarily the most prosperous country, but this is a country that has managed to survive through 4 wars, for 75 years, despite being as diverse as the entirety of Europe, with all of its resources taken away before it's creation. The reason for this? A mix of decentralization and nationalism, Decentralization to make the local culture feel respected, nationalism to unite the cultures under one flag, And their proud history of fighting against the British. There are occasional incidents, like someone Hindu riots killing Muslims, Or Muslim riots killing hindus, and some sikhs massacring and getting massacred too, but it has stayed as a nation, it hasn't devolved into Anarchy while other, less united and more prosperous nations have. Shows that Nationalism needn't always be a ideology of division, and can be one of unison.   


TLDR: Nationalism is not a bad ideology, nor is it a good one. It purely depends on how it is used. The Nazis used it to dominate, The Indians (And Americans too imo) used it to unite. It depends on the core principle of the nations, and not the ideology itself."
1,2024-02-16,CMV: brake light action should be tied into both deceleration and the brake pedal,u/Finch20,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ascti6/cmv_brake_light_action_should_be_tied_into_both/,changemyview,"*My view:*

The activation of brake lights on cars (and other motor vehicles, but I'm focusing on vehicles that have 3 brake lights) should be tied into both the deceleration of the vehicle and the depression of the brake pedal.  Specifically I believe that once the brake pedal is depressed the 2 main brake lights should illuminate (or become more luminescent if the lights are on).  When a car is decelerating at a certain rate all 3 brake lights should be activate, independent of the depression of the brake pedal.  

And when the brake pedal is rapidly depressed all the way, all 3 brake lights should start flashing until the brake pedal is released past a certain point or the rate of deceleration has reduced past a certain point.  If any kinds of emergency braking (like the brake pedal is rapidly depressed all the way and the car is decelerating rapidly, ABS activation, very high rate of deceleration, ...) is detected, all 3 brake lights should start flashing and the hazard lights should activate (I'm assuming we're in a country where hazards are amber/yellow and different lights than the brake lights).  The hazards should remain on until the car either departs again or they are manually turned off (which should not be possible until the rate of deceleration is small).  The brake lights should keep flashing until the car has come to a stop or the rate of deceleration is small.  

And finally, when a car is accelerating, no brake lights should activate even if the brake pedal is depressed.

Obviously whenever I say things like 'high rate of', 'rapidly', ... these should be clearly defined values if this is every written into law.  These values should be determined by running experiments in several countries.  

*How this differs from today:*

Today most vehicles will illuminate the brake light only based on the movement of the brake pedal (although some electric vehicles do take deceleration into account).  And all the brake lights will be illuminated if the brake pedal is depressed (a certain amount), even if the vehicle is maintaining its speed or accelerating.  

It is also already in the law (here in the EU) that in case of emergency braking the brake lights should start flashing and hazards should come on, however the hazards are only required to come on when the vehicle has decelerated to below a certain speed. (Examples of flashing break lights in this video at timestamps 0:40 and 1:06: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7900ORx2lM)

*Why I hold this view:*

I often notice people who have their brake pedal depressed just enough to activate the brake lights while not slowing down at all.  After a while you become used to this and don't immediately react when you see brake lights.  If the 3rd brake light only comes on when the car is decelerating you know that if you see that 3rd brake light, you should be braking yourself.  While if only 2 brake lights are active you can just coast.  

Additionally, there are times where a car can be decelerating at a high enough rate to require a reaction from the vehicle behind while no brake lights are active at all.  This can happen in case of heavy engine braking, with hybrid and electric vehicles when regenerative braking is on (some cars do activate the brake lights in this case), ...

And there's the absolute absurd situation (at least in my opinion) where you see a car that is stopped drive off and come to a stop again a few car lengths ahead (in a traffic jam) with the brake lights active the entire time.

For the emergency braking I believe more granularity is needed, currently they only have to activate at a rapid rate of deceleration (https://www.vda.de/en/topics/innovations/sicherheit/notbremslicht).  I believe that if the person in front of you presses their brake pedal all the way down, even if no deceleration has been detected yet, you should know as the person driving behind.  But you should still be able to tell the difference between that and the car in front clearly performing emergency braking.  Hence why I think the hazards should come on in these situations.

*Why this post:*

I want to know if there are any situations in which what I propose can be more dangerous or confusing for drivers.  Or if this won't improve safety in any meaningful way.  Or if there is anything I haven't considered that would impact my view."
346,2024-02-16,CMV: George Orwell was right about socialists and the left in general.,u/iDontSow,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1asd1rn/cmv_george_orwell_was_right_about_socialists_and/,changemyview,"George Orwell had a bit of a complicated relationship with socialism, but he was right about socialists when he said this:

>The typical socialist is not a ferocious working man in greasy overalls and a raucous voice. He is either a useful snob or a prim little man with a white-collar job—usually a secret teetotaler and often with vegetarian leanings, with a history of non-conformity behind him and a social position he has no intention of forfeiting.

I went to a very diverse, very left leaning American University in a major city. (Bonus points to anyone who can guess the name of the school.) The VAST majority (99%+) of left leaning people I knew or befriended were only interested in debating who knew more theory or who was the most ideologically pure. There was very little organizing beyond getting together and listening to Childish Gambino or whatever while getting drunk/stoned and discussing theory. Decent, well intentioned people would be alienated, shamed, or ostracized for relatively minor ideological differences. We would occasionally attend protests in which people would just put memes on signs before romping around a bit downtown and then going home to party or whatever. It was totally unserious and I’m embarrassed looking back it. We were **mostly** (but not entirely) middle class or wealthy suburban kids cosplaying as activists. We believed that the largely impoverished community surrounding our university did not know what was best for them when they lobbied the mayor and district attorney to be tougher on crime (I am especially ashamed of this behavior). All the while, we were actively engaging in the displacement of those same people through gentrification. Looking back on this experience, I can honestly say that we achieved absolutely nothing. 

After college, I joined a number of prison abolitionist groups where we mostly engaged in the same activities, without the drinking and drugs (for the most part). More theory. More infighting. A couple people I sort of knew started a cafe that promoted paying a livable wage to its employees and prided itself on being inclusive and higher LGBTQIA+ people and POC, and also ran a community fridge to help feed hungry community members. It fell apart because of infighting when some of the employees demanded ownership of the cafe be handed over to them and the woman who owned the building evicted them because the workers were harassing her. I had become fully disillusioned with the entire movement. I read George Orwell's *Road to Wigan Pier* and decided I was tired of being around useful idiots. I told my friends I was going to law school, was immediately shamed and ostracized, and said goodbye to that part of my life for good because they would not have me back even if I tried to explain why I was doing what I was doing.

I was one of the people Orwell was talking about, and so was everyone else I knew. George Orwell was right about socialists. Change my view by giving me hope that my anecdotal experience is not illustrative of the American Left generally.

If they were wrong on things that can be proven wrong, why do we believe them to be right (or important enough to study) on things we *can't* prove are right like ethics and societal structure? These beliefs can't be unpaired with their other stances. Aristotle infamously thought women to be lesser beings than men, largely due to the pseudoscientific beliefs that he held.

If a modern philosopher held such equally wrong beliefs, we would discard everything they had to say, even if their other works weren't related to science or empirically-backed fields. A large part of why I think we don't have many modern philosophers we treat on the level of Plato or Aristotle is that we put much more emphasis on data sciences to inform us about how society works."

As a young 24 y/o I worry that gambling will be the opiate crisis of my generation. 

I think video games will greatly contribute to this. My generation was the first to really experience the rise of loot crates in games like tf2, CSGO etc, and now it seems like every other game is adopting a similar marketing strategy. I have watched friends blow through hundreds of dollars, spending hours just unboxing crates. I didn't view it as a big deal at the time, but now one of my friends has developed a gambling problem. He has been losing thousands of dollars a week, and I worry it will only get worse. 

It's especially bad because these games appeal to kids. I work at an elementary school, and every day I hear about a different kid who took their mom's credit card to spend hundreds of dollars on loot crates in games like fifa or fortnite. I worry we are raising a generation of kids to enjoy gambling from a young age. 

Sports betting is especially problematic. It seems like every sports channel on youtube is partnered with or sponsored by a gambling website. I understand that income on youtube is unstable, and sponsorships are a necessity, but many of these channels have young audiences. Hell the NBA is straight up partnered with a gambling website. 

I find my feelings about gambling don't align with my feelings on other things. For example I completely support the decriminalization of drug use and ending the war on drugs. I believe that decriminalizing drug use will make it easier for drug addicts to get treatment, prevent overdose deaths, and reduce the influence of the prison industrial complex. 

Am I a hypocrite? Will the expansion of gambling lead to an expansion in programs to help gambling addicts? Or will it just create more addicts? 

Sorry if this is kinda a ramble haha."

Knights are noble strong men who look after their own. When you think ""knight"" you think a straight up, honest guy with excellent morals. This thematically fits the rook since it moves in straight lines rather than crooked lines, and traditionally protects the king in the backline. The rook is also one of the most mobile pieces, which matches with a cavalry theme

The knights are area denial pieces that operate at short range. In this sense they are similar to a fortress or a castle. They are the most immobile of the non king major pieces, which thematically separates them from cavalry. They should be named castles


In this post we will ignore the visual appearance of the pieces and will only focus on their movement. Don't tell me a knight should be a knight because it's a horse"

I personally believe that all art derives it’s “value” or quality from how it expresses human creativity. I also believe that the more creative freedom an artist has, the more potential their art has to express this creativity.

And that any work of art, as an expression of human creativity, lies somewhere on a spectrum of least abstract to most abstract.

The value of abstraction is twofold. It has the ability to provide freedom for human creativity. The more abstract a medium, the more expressive it can be of themes, emotions, stories, etc… And abstraction also allows the audience greater opportunity to translate and interpret art in their own way, which adds additional joy and personal appreciation to the overall experience.

The artistic medium at the beginning of this spectrum is architecture. Limited freedom and possibilities due mostly to the laws of physics. You can’t float shit in the air, you can’t make ceilings out of jam, etc. From there the spectrum is *roughly:* sculpture > photography > theater/performance art > design > fine art (painting/drawing) > film/animation/cinematography > literature > music. Music is at the end of the spectrum because music has the most potential to convey emotion, stories, themes, ideas, etc… in a completely abstract way. Using both songwriting & instrumentation as well as lyrical content.

My views being established on how I “value” art, and why music sits at the end of the spectrum, I would now like to explain why I view Robert Allen Zimmerman as the greatest artist of all time.

There are multiple facets to music. As previously mentioned, themes can be conveyed with songwriting (I’ve got the “blues”), and with lyrical content.

Before Dylan began his career, lyrical content was often overlooked as a vehicle to convey an artists’ creative concepts. Generally shallow, vapid themes permeated the musical landscape. There were exceptions to this of course. Both singular examples (*What a Wonderful World* — Louis Armstrong) as well as artists who began to evolve the role lyrical content played in their art (Woody Guthrie).

Then along comes Dylan, and the true potential of lyricism is finally untapped. Inspired by modern and classical poets and great works of literature, Dylan transformed and inspired contemporary music in a way few other artist can claim (Robert Johnson, Les Paul). The original “Voice of a Generation”, he wrote about complex and deeply emotional subjects like racism, inequality, civil rights, war, and religion, giving voice to themes that did not touch his person directly. Lyrically there are only a handful of artists, from any era, that can hold a candle to his body of work (Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, TVZ, Josh Ritter), all of who owe some aspect of their art to Dylan.

And in addition to his ability as a lyricist, was his musical prowess and ability as a songwriter. Though difficult to accurately represent, Dylan is thought to have the most remade songs of any musician. 

Old Zimmy’s undeniably got some bangers.

His work spans a massive range of genres. Folk, rock, country & Americana, blues, gospel, R&B… A claim very few artists can make. While still respecting and paying homage to music’s rich history, striking a balance between innovation and tradition that is relatively unique to him as a musician. 

Dylan is a shapeshifter. He had no fixed self. As soon as you fell in love with Dylan the protest singer, he turned around and told The Band to “Play if fucking loud” and became an electric punk. He was a cynic, a joker, an everyman, an icon… In the Dylan biopic *I’m Not There* he is famously portrayed by five different actors, each representing a distinctly different phase in his life. By the time David Bowie first sprinkled us with his stardust, Dylan was onto his umpteenth personality. I won’t claim he was the first to do so, or the best at it, but Dylan brilliantly used different personas to reinforce his art, and he understood the power of his legend in a way few artists can claim.

As soon as everyone thought he had been wrung dry, he’d strip away the chutzpah and release *Blood on the Tracks.* His only Billboard No. 1 hit, “Murder Most Foul,” was released in 2020.

Dylan is prolific as an artist. Perhaps again, unmatched by his peers. For over 60 years Dylan has created classic songs. Certainly the quantity has slowed over the years, and the quality has perhaps declined to some extent, but for an artist to create amazing art from 1962 until present day, and hopefully years into the future, is a heroic feat in itself. 

His cultural impact is undeniable. To illustrate this, I’d like share an excerpt from a Pete Hamill essay on Dylan. Hamill’s words have always stuck with me, and I think they represent aspects of Dylan’s cultural influence in a way that I know I won’t articulate.

[Written in back in 1974, it still finds a home in 2024.](https://www.bobsboots.com/CDs/cd-b28_Hamilltext.html)

Certainly in the context of why I view music as the most “valuable” form of art mankind can create, Dylan benefits from his chosen medium. But even compared to masters of other artistic mediums, (Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Shakespeare) or other master musicians (Kottke, Ellington, DOOM) Dylan’s body of work and creative expression define him, in my eyes, as the greatest artist of all time."

1,2024-02-17,CMV: Heterogeneous property markets should be reformed to use Common Ownership Self-Assessed Taxes,u/sxaez,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1asvds2/cmv_heterogeneous_property_markets_should_be/,changemyview,"Heterogeneous property can be defined by property which contains some unique and non-nontransferable properties. For instance, land is heterogeneous because even if two plots are worth exactly the same amount of money, they cannot offer exactly the same thing (location, view, closeness to amenities, soil quality, historical value, etc). There are many examples of heterogeneous property markets - land, the radio spectrum, website domains, fishing rights, the list goes on. These are distinct from commodities markets (e.g. the market upon which the fish caught with those fishing rights are sold), which are not the thing I am talking about.

Our existing markets of heterogeneous property almost exclusively use a private mode of ownership. This has advantages in that it provides a very strong improvement incentive because the owner receives the full payout of sale at their time of choosing. However, it is clear to me that the current structure of these markets is inherently quite bad at serving society's needs. The housing crisis is probably the most clear example of this. Private property is really bad for the Holdout problem, where people can monopolize property rights to force a far-above market value price from a compelled buyer.

The other radical solution people generally propose to fix these markets is common property, like social housing. I'm not saying these initiatives should be abandoned to provide housing to everyone who needs it, but implementing society-wide central planning has very bad improvement incentives and can fall to tragedies of the commons.

In 2017, an alternative model for heterogeneous property markets was proposed: [Harberger Taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harberger_Tax). This proposes a new model of property that falls somewhere in between the private to common dichotomy. Harberger Tax markets have several cool advantages:

* People are incentivized to accurately value their property, and can't profit from holdouts
* The market is transparent - everyone knows the price everyone else puts on that property
* Property is efficiently allocated to the owners who value it the most
* It becomes impossible to hoard large amounts of unproductive property
* You can abolish eminent domain
* It raises an enormous amount of tax revenue, to the point where it could conceivably replace most existing taxes

Basically, every financial year everyone self-assesses the value of their relevant property, and then pays a tax based on a percentage of that property. So, for instance if I own a piece of land I think is worth a million dollars, I might declare that valuation in my tax return and pay a 5% tax on that value. The critical difference is if anyone offers to buy that property for that declared price, I have to sell it.

The push-pull dynamic of the self assessment means that everyone is incentivized to value their property at the real market price. People who undervalue their property to minimize their tax risk losing that property to someone who recognizes its higher value. People who overvalue their property to protect themselves from buyout have to pay a cost for doing so. It also provides a mechanism for adjusting the liquidity of different market segments in that percentage tax rate. For instance, you don't want people being forced out of their primary residences by this, so you set the rate very low at say 4%. This means people pay a relatively low cost for overvaluing their homes if they don't want to sell, and that any buyer would have to overpay to force someone out of a home they didn't want to sell. For other segments where you want high liquidity, like resource exploitation rights, manufacturing, commercial real estate, you set the interest rate higher so people have to make that property productive or sell it.

Some stories/examples I can cite: 

Healthcare is very expensive in China. There are stories of hospitals threatening to cut patients off life support if they couldn't afford the medical fees. Healthcare is supposed to be free of charge in a communist society (but whether the quality is good or bad is an entirely different story). 

Housing. In a communist society, housing is supposed to be provided free of charge (same thing, whether or not the quality is decent is an entirely different story). Yet in China, housing prices before the pandemic shot up to the sky, and people were speculating and taking up massive loans to buy houses that they eventually don't live in. This shouldn't even exist in a communist society.

Also, its the same rich gets richer, poor gets poorer phenomenon in China.  

So, my view is that the rulling classes in China is using the communist structure of governance to stay in power and retain their wealth. All the ""common prosperity"" slogan is just an excuse for them to go after any persons deemed as a threat to their power."

There are vague philosophical arguments to be made for the existence of a soul or a creator/god in some form, but this CMV is specifically about following large religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and similar. I am more familiar with Christianity, although not fully and I plan to educate myself more, but I have very vague understandings of the others.

Currently I find myself extremely anti-religion and I want my view changed if possible to be more tolerant of those around me. I just do not understand how someone can follow a religion. Theres 0 evidence, all based on ""faith"" in a book written thousands of years ago and then rewritten and translated constantly over time. I dont see how believing in Christianity is any different to believing in magic. People I have talked to just sound brainwashed into believing it and it becoming a core part of themselves to the point where its too uncomfortable to change.

I do not see how in the modern day, belief in religion is logical. People will point to smart people believing in religion, but again, that just seems like brainwashing to me and is just trying to appeal to authority. I dont want arguments based in ""smart person did it so it must be true"", but rather why belief is logical. 

I find the argument of ""belief isnt logical, you just feel it"" or similar things also very weak. They just fall under ""ive been brainwashed and/or emotions make this belief comfortable so ill follow it"", rather than actual coherent thoughts and reasoning.

This is also not a CMV on judging religious people or not allowing people to be religious, those I do not advocate for due to freedom of thought and just basic decency so long as they arent hurting anyone. Just that religion is no different to magic."

So, I think this happened to a lot of people. You go to dinner/have some drinks and people decide at the end to share the bill. 

Let me be clear, if we order the same amount, that makes perfect sense for me to share the bill. I am not going to fight for a few euros. 

When the difference is huge, even more in your favor, that's just so selfish. I can't understand how people can find this acceptable. 

My main issue is people having zero awareness about this and this is what I find selfish. 

If I go to a restaurant, I order a nice bottle of wine and the person I am with doesn't drink, WHY would I ask the other person to pay half of that expensive bottle? 

What is the reason for that?

When someone order the great deal menu, what would they pay for my expensive fish? 

It happened once when I was a student, going to dinner with people working. I had the 8 euros menu. 

You could obviously see the difference between their dish and my kid menu. It should ring a bell. 

I was livid when they said we should share the bill. Thanks god ONE person said no! ""Hit the bar"" ate for 1/3 of what we had. 

Another example, you should be aware of the difference of salaries when you travel. After an event in Spain, our new Yorker client wanted to hang out. It was not business related as it was after the event, we couldn't invoice our company for that. 

She harassed us. At one point, we were going to work with her again so we just went and had a few drinks.

If a 12 euros cocktail is not expensive for her, it is for us Europeans. 

We had sangria at 4 euros. 

She then asked to share the bills. 

In what world you don't consider the locals you are hanging out might earn 1200 euros a month and you don't see they have ordered a 4 euros drink when you had multiple cocktails and do the math? 

Now, I have a very confortable salary. I am in the 6% of Europeans who earn more than the others. 

This would NEVER cross my mind to go in a restaurant with someone, order unlimited food and drink and ask to share the bill. 

Cause I am aware enough to understand the people I am with might not be financially confortable. I am also aware of what people order and drink. 

I don't focalized but I am aware. In the worse case, I quickly check the bill and can easily see a menu at 10 euros among menus at 70 euros.

Here's my perspective:  
The Thrill of Speed and Agility: Hockey's lightning-fast pace on ice adds an electrifying element of unpredictability. As a coach, I'm constantly on my toes, strategizing to anticipate and respond to the rapid movements of both the players and the puck.  
Adapting on the Fly: With fewer stoppages compared to other sports, hockey demands quick thinking and decisive action. I relish the challenge of making split-second adjustments during brief breaks, ensuring my team stays ahead of the game.  
Endurance and Grit: Hockey is a grueling test of physical stamina and mental toughness. Managing players' energy levels and ice time is a delicate balancing act, but seeing them rise to the challenge is immensely rewarding.  
Mastering the Rink's Confines: The compact space of the rink presents a tactical puzzle to solve. I enjoy crafting strategies that optimize our use of space while outmaneuvering opponents in close quarters.  
Strategic Special Teams: Special teams situations like power plays and penalty kills are high-stakes moments that demand precision and adaptability. Planning for these scenarios is like orchestrating a symphony, with each player performing their part to perfection.  
The Goalie's Influence: Goalies hold the keys to victory in hockey, capable of swinging the momentum with a single save. Understanding their strengths and weaknesses is crucial in crafting a winning game plan.  
In sum, hockey's dynamic nature and strategic depth make it a sport that continually challenges and inspires me. Success isn't just about planning—it's about the thrill of watching those plans come to life on the ice, moment by moment."

Breaking up the Asian continent to ""East Asian"" and ""Middle Eastern"" sectors makes too much sense. We shouldn't refer to people as Asians or Asian-Americans but more so as Middle Easterners or East Asians.

The other day I heard one of my teachers say to a female student “you are more likely to get a job in [the subject she was teaching] than the boys in the class”. I asked my classmates if they thought that was morally wrong and they all said no (they are the sort of people to oppose any “wokeness” due to the school being in a countryside location which made me even more surprised).

If you don’t see the problem with this already, here is my point: I believe that all people should have an equal chance of getting a job no matter who they are (unless there is a disability which at all disrupts their ability to carry out the job) as long as they have worked for the qualifications and achieved them. Let’s say for an engineering job you have 10 women and 40 men interested in the job. Even if you say “I will hire as many men as I do women” a man applying for the job has a significantly less chance of getting the job. For stem jobs for example, the ratio of men to women applying is even more drastic compared to my example and you have got to include other diversity factors such as race, disability and sexuality (I’m not to sure about sexuality tbh). I have family friends (men) who are extremely qualified in their field with years of experience whom still can’t get a job (I admit this could be and is most likely to be a disconnected issue)."

With that being said - shit’s hard out there, man. The pandemic, stagflation, political corruption etc have made living even in first world nations drastically harder and less luxurious than it was even just 10 years ago. In basically every first world nation, adults are struggling to find housing, living expenses are through the roof, etc. The France or Australia of 2024 isn’t the France or Australia of 2014, or 2004.

I understand the driving force of migration is economic opportunity, but there has to come a time when even people from poorer nations have to take a look at the conditions around the world and realise moving to a first world nation, with all their current social ills, just isn’t worth it. Plus, with just how digital the world has become and how much investment is happening in poorer countries, I wonder if it wouldn’t make more sense to stay home and get wealthy with the opportunities there.

It's a very simple process so let's break it down.

* Check that the insurance is valid and lookup what the customer's out of pocket cost is. Customer must press OK to agree to this cost. If not then provide them with contact information for the insurance provider and doctor. Provide a printed receipt on how the cost was calculated. If insurance has changed then allow user to update at the kiosk. 
* Check that prescription received from doctor electronically is still valid and has at least one refill left
* Check for drug interactions with existing prescriptions.
* Check that person on the prescription is the person at the kiosk receiving the pills. Fingerprint, pin code or credit card id.
* Dispense correct  number of pills into a bottle. Double/triple check pill, weight and quantity is correct.
* Display any warnings about medicine and have customer click OK to agree that they understand this
* Take credit card or cash for payment

Instead CVS/Walgreens/Walmart have this overhead of hiring people to do everything a machine could do and faster. You could get your pills at 3 am if you wanted to. No longer have to wait in line or have to spell out your name so they can try and find your bag in among the hundreds on the rack. The whole experience just seems so inefficient, antiquated and pointless. They have college degrees for pharmacy, what exactly do they teach other than drug interactions? It seems to me that this industry is ripe for disruption. "

I think recording the ball was the right choice.

My understanding is that's you are essentially trading advantages, the receiving team has the advantage of first chance to win if both teams are even after each team has had a possession(scoring advantage), while the kicking team has the advantage of knowing the outcome of the first teams possession, allowing them to play all 4 downs until they are in a winning position(down advantage). The kicking team is also very heavily incent

The thing is the receiving team can elect to play all 4 downs and go for 2 even though they are going first completely negating the down advantage while maintaining the scoring advantage. There is where the 49ers failed, they should have been playing for 4 downs the whole way and not settled for a field goal with 4th and 4.

TLDR: The ideal playoff O/T strategy is taking the ball first and then planning on using all 4 downs until you score a touchdown and then going for 2.

1,2024-02-17,CMV: I don't think that death is a bad thing (Warning: discussion of suicide),u/ThisOctopus1111,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1at6dmi/cmv_i_dont_think_that_death_is_a_bad_thing/,changemyview,"Here are the common reasons why death is a bad thing, and my opinions on them:

• When someone you know dies, you never see them again.
This makes sense, but it seems a bit selfish.

 • After someone dies, they never have any more good experiences nor do any more good things.
They also never have any more bad experiences nor do any more harmful things, which if anything means that death is a neutral thing.

• Death is physically painful.
A lot of things in life are physically painful.

It seems like the only real reason we fear death is because we evolved to want to live. Our natural fear of death is only natural, and not always logical.


This especially applies to suicide.
If a suicidal person is completely miserable with their life, shouldn't we just let them end their own life? People think that suicide is ""selfish"" because it causes pain for others, but isn't it just as selfish to force a suicidal person to stay alive when they're always suffering?

I used to think of suicide as a bad and morally wrong act, but after having my own suicidal thoughts, I adopted my current mentality.


There's also the idea of humans going extinct because of an ""apocalypse."" I don't think that every human suddenly dying would be bad. (I'm almost looking forward to it.) Wouldn't it be a net positive if every human died?


Combine all that with the fact that it seems like everyone is miserable all the time, and I wonder why death (and especially suicide) is ever a bad thing.

1,2024-02-17,CMV: Commission based sales should be illegal. ,u/Affectionate-Ad6239,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1at6lsn/cmv_commission_based_sales_should_be_illegal/,changemyview,"Let's start with just general opinions. 

I've never heard someone say they've had a good experience with a commission based salesman. They've all got the same training and bullshit, read the same 3 or 4 books, say the same phrases etc. They don't take no for an answer and are largely successful because of people who are uncomfortable saying no, or are scared to be impolite. Car dealerships are the most common but far from the worst. Car salesman make more money if they set their customers up with a worse deal. There are scumbag credit unions that partner with them and give a kickback for their service. The commission that they receive is costing their customers thousands of dollars over the course of six years. 

Let's move on to anecdotal. When I was in college I thought this is what I wanted to do. I've heard of insurance, car, service salesman making 100k+ in there first year. I read the books, understood the concept, and have naturally always been well spoken and approachable, what a great fit! I decided against it because I decided that when I look back at my accomplishments it would basically just be a long list of people I've fucked over and taken advantage of. 

I've personally been taken advantage of by one high pressure sales pitch, when I was 20 I tried to buy a car. I went to the dealer and asked if I could get an 8000 Toyota Camry. They said they ran their my credit with every lender out there and none of them approved me, and the only car I could be approved for was an 05 cobalt for 3k. I reluctantly drove it, it was fine so I sat down the the finance guy. They again said the only place I could get a loan was this one place, and that would be the same at every dealer that I went to. I ended up getting the car for like 5500 out the door on a 22% interest rate. They also said if anything went wrong with the car ""they got me"" but couldn't put it in writing because of the value of the car. I believed them, obviously they only ran my credit with one lender, the one they were partnered with for young kids and financially irresponsible adults. 

That was a valuable lesson though, as it could've been much worse. I almost joined the Marines because the recruiter made it sound like it was a vacation with some bros and I'd come back with abs. Told my mom I was thinking about signing up and she brought up the fact that I wouldn't hunt because I'd feel bad for the animal, so how was I going to shoot a person. I'd completely forgotten what the military actually does. I almost took a job soliciting door to door and harassing people at malls, because they made it sound like a dream job. 

I know the counter argument is that people should be financially responsible and shouldn't fall for these tricks but that's simply not realistic. They should also have a backbone and tell these people no. Those are borderline bootstrap arguments and there are such obvious flaws with those arguments. 

Basically I just believe that products and services should be offered, and if it's good and reasonably priced people will pay you, if not you go work for someone who is doing well. High pressured sales should never be a part of any business model. I genuinely can't think of anyone who benefits from this other than the salesman who sold granny a car at 30% interest or the recruiter who just got little Timmy to sign up for an assault rifle and PTSD.

I should clarify 
that if they’re dming these women, and reaching out that 100% is a problem but just following them shouldn’t be a means for an argument or tension. 

i’ve been seeing stuff on tiktok, and on some sub reddits of women complaining about their bf’s following other women/friends on insta and stuff. For me, everytime i’ve dated guys I follow their friends, and i wouldn’t have an issue with them following my friends because imo it’s good for them to be interested in my life and friends and show they like who i’m hanging out with. Liking their posts, following them and if i’m in the post then commenting on it is ok. If they’re reaching out and speaking without me knowing i would have an issue but honestly I don’t see any problem with just a follow.

same with influencers. I follow guys and actors I find attractive and I obviously don’t do anything abt that, so there should be no reason why a guy i’m dating shouldn’t be able to do the same (again if he’s trying to dm her then it becomes a problem). I just think looking through a guys following and getting mad that there’s girl friends and pretty influencers is a bit obsessive and weird. I’d feel iffy if somebody was looking through my following and thinking “wow she follows guys that’s a bit weird” because it’s like, you can be friends with people of the opposite gender no problem?? 

Or maybe i’m stupid and people are joking when they say this cuz i’m really bad at social queues 😭😭 i’m open to all opinions obv, so cmv :)"
1,2024-02-17,CMV: It's better to have sex with animals than support factory farming,u/solarsalmon777,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1at7dw4/cmv_its_better_to_have_sex_with_animals_than/,changemyview,"It is inconsistent to support/abide the horror show that is factory farming while simultaneously denouncing and preventing the raping of animals.  The moralistic revulsion the average person has for beastiality is just that, moralistic.  If you think that the hormone pumping, forced breeding, claustrophobic, conveyer belt killing conditions of factory farms are tolerable, then your hangups around having sex with animals amount to the hangups homophobes have around gay sex.  You just want to portray your personal preferences as moral laws so you can police a behavior you find distasteful.  I.e. you're not aspiring to be good, you're aspiring to marginalize people you find ""icky"".

Someone who saves an animal from such a fate to live a basically free life, aside from the occasional diddling, is a comparative saint.  Would it be better if they not have sex with animals? Sure, but no one's perfect, and it's miles better than leaving them to suffer the high-tech suffering-maximizers society is spending billions to optimize.

Yes, animals provide calories that we need to live, but it is perfectly viable to not eat them and be healthy.  People still tend to eat them despite the suffering it causes because doing do is very pleasurable.  Beastiality is a less harmful way of deriving pleasure from animals than factory farming them.

CMV: if I start a ""horny farm"" non-profit that provides healthy habitats for animals saved from factory farms that grants donors the occasional ""free ride"" for sufficiently high doantions, I am doing more good than had I not done anything.  If you oppose such efforts such that those animals instead suffer the factory farm fate, you are bad. (Presume only non-harmful sex acts are allowed.  Like, sticking your finger in a cloaca is fine, but you can't make a chicken deep throat you or anything)

Put another way: raping animals is bad, but its prevention is of lower priority than preventing factory farming.  It's like closing down a women's abuse shelter because sometimes the soup they serve is too hot and slightly burns your mouth.  The title of this post ""it is better to have sex with animals than subject them to factory farming"" is analogous to ""it is better to slightly scald the mouths of abused women with free soup than to return them to their abusers"".  Yes, it would be better if the shelter organizers were less negligent of their meal temperature, and the fact that they aren't willing to improve this at all might be strange. Nonetheless, if you think women suffering something as minor as slight mouth scalding is as severe an offense as the average person's evaluation of beastiality, then you certainly should not support the return of the women to their abuser's arms or the streets by shutting down said shelter."
1,2024-02-17,CMV: Sex work as it exists today is a reflection of male loneliness & is proof that men are experiencing loneliness in a way that isn’t really comparable to female loneliness,u/Scary-Ad-1345,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1at7i3a/cmv_sex_work_as_it_exists_today_is_a_reflection/,changemyview,"I’ve been seeing a lot of posts from women claiming that women experience loneliness the same as men. This doesn’t make sense to me… I’m honestly just looking for someone to show me that it’s the same but the number one thing I keep coming back to is the existence of sex work only fans & prostitution.

Whenever people talk about this, they kind of just talk about self reported claims of loneliness, basically just self identifying yourself as lonely. I wonder if maybe the way you evaluate your loneliness is based on your comparison to other women? Or if it is just a FEELING but that is also different than the reality of your situation. Are your standards just higher?  

To the prostitution thing. 

Why isn’t there a market for male escorts?

I have my own opinion, which is that sex is easy to get for women regardless of whether she’s attractive overweight or unhygienic. You’ll never reach the level of desperation that some men reach. 

People will say a few things that don’t really add up and sometimes contradict one another if said by the same person.

Women are just as lonely as men. 

It’s just as hard for unattractive women to find sex as unattractive men. 

Sex doesn’t help AT ALL with loneliness. 

There are no advantages to sex or dating as a woman regardless of how attractive you are. Basically, men hold all the power OR it’s an equal playing field but women have no advantages. 

Those are the perceptions that I keep coming across

How can these things be true, but then prostitution exists & yet there’s no market for male prostitution at all. How can these things still be true?

I also don’t understand the onlyfans thing. Only guys are paying for cam girls and onlyfans. The appeal is that you get to talk to someone. They’re doing it because they’re lonely, you’re paying for companionship. They also say it’s almost impossible to be even a little bit successful as a man in this industry unless you’re gay for pay. 

Like women can be lonely, I’m not disputing it, but I just don’t see how you could look at a number that says 60% of women & 55% of men are reporting themselves as lonely and then say the numbers make sense. 

If I were to sum up my opinion simply.

Men are lonely because they are lacking. For me personally I have a partner but I have no friends and no family. I think a lot of men are completely lacking of a support system they also might not have the ability to find a partner or a distraction, some kind of illusion of companionship. 

Women often have friends or family to both. And if they don’t they at the very least can’t distract themselves from their loneliness. If they were as desperate as a man that’s willing to pay for companionship they can date someone they don’t like very much. This is not proper companionship but it’s better than nothing. If they were even slightly less desperate they could just lead some asshole on for attention or whatever. Like… they can distract themselves. It’s doesn’t change that they’re lonely but it’s just a distraction. 

I’m not saying that women can’t be lonely I’m not saying sex is a replacement for proper companionship I’m not saying that dating someone that doesn’t meet your standards is a replacement for proper companionship. All I’m saying is that those are options & I don’t think that having those options on the table makes it THE SAME. It’s different. It’s manageable I guess. Like someone out there wants what you have. Someone is jealous of you. "
1,2024-02-17,CMV: first time experiencing a male in a women’s bathroom,u/_lunacakes,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1at7tw0/cmv_first_time_experiencing_a_male_in_a_womens/,changemyview,"As title states, I had my first experience last night with a man using the women’s bathroom.

As an open minded individual, I have no qualms on the matter of cross dressing & the lgtb community- for me it’s whatever makes you happy bc it’s really none of my business at the end of the day. But this experience did not leave me with positive feeling on the matter, and I don’t want to succumb to falling into having a negative stigma around this. 

So he was cross dressing, and he shared that this was one of the first couple of times he has dressed as a woman. He was nervous and also disheartened bc people kept staring at him in the club where we were. 

This was in a club bathroom so I was giving him peptalk & compliments as women usually give each in the bathroom. I told him it doesnt matter if ppl are staring, it’s only a small city that really doesn’t matter for shit. I started talking to him about NYC, (bc we’re only an hour away) that he should try going to clubs out there where he wouldn’t be subjected to ppl gawking at him. He then started asking for advice on how to appear more feminine. So I gave him pointers, like next time where a nude bra under a white shirt and I told him to wear his skirt higher up on his waist, to define it better. As he was fixing his skirt I looked down & he had a BONER!!!!! 😭😭😭😭

I IMMEDIATELY grabbed my friend and her younger cousin and b lined out of the bathroom. I was DISGUSTED. This left the me with the most uneasy feeling. And I just don’t know how to feel tbh. As I said at the beginning of this post, I don’t want to adopt a negative stigma around this, but this was a very disturbing experience for me. 

If there’s people in this subreddit that do cross dress or use the opposite gender’s restroom, can you please vouch that this is not a typical experience. I’m just very uneasy about this experience.

And please be kind in the comments, I’m not here to offend anyone. And there is no intention of offending anyone with me writing this. I just don’t want this experience to change my views & open mindedness on this matter."

I get that point of view. I know that I do not necessarily lose the ability/chance to do a certain thing when I reach a certain age, and there's always ""time"" if I put my mind to it and put in the effort. However, I deeply resent cliché phrases such as the one mentioned, the reason being they're almost always facile and rarely do people use them while conscious of how appropriately the phrase applies to the given situation.

Age is just a number, you say. But in real life, unless we're in a math class, numbers rarely are ""just numbers"". They have to mean something. Hypothetically, if you're 35 years old, this can mean many different things depending on how you look at it. It can represent a higher risk of birth complications, it can mean it's about time to retire if you're a professional athelete, it can make an employer choose someone younger over you, it means 17 years have passed since you became an adult (this in itself can be translated into how much prime time you spent/wasted/lived/invested on something or the other, based on which you might have prides/regrets/memories).

It can also mean, now that you're 35, your circumstances are much different than when you were 21. I.e, you might be in a long term committed relationship and have a kid or 2 therefore have more responsibilities, you might be established in a career hence less flexibility and more hesitation to try a different/better one, you'll likely generally be unable to afford certain adventures, and it might be too late to get seriously good at a musical instrument or any sophisticated skill/language you always wanted to learn.

I'll take myself as an example. When I was in my early 20s, it was an entirely different time with an entirely different philosophy. I was still ""starting"", making mistakes was much more acceptable, failing at something wasn't as big of a deal because I knew I had plenty of chance to get better and succeed later. Seeing people in their late 20s achieve the things I was wanting to achieve was not as heartbreaking as it is now that I'm 30, because I always told myself: I'm still not 28, I'll get there in time. The philosophy of my age now is quite different, I get much less patience from others with mistakes, much less time and brain power to learn, much higher expectations to perform as an adult with financial and caring responsibilities, so it's not exactly a matter of imagining that age is just a number and I can expect myself to just as easily keep attempting that degree or pick up that unpaid internship or retrain as a web developer.. etc

Now, for me, age is a number that carries heavy connotations. 15 = kid, not responsible. 20 = early adulthood/ just starting/too early to judge. 30 = had a decade of chances/must be already good at something. I'm aware that in reality, it's not that clear cut. There's huge variability. But surely, 21 is not exactly the same as 36, which the phrase ""age is just a number"" seems to portray.

Of course, age does not dictate or determine everything. I've seen countless examples of people ""defying"" their age and achieving great things, but that still doesn't make age a totally meaningless number."

I think this shows that there's no room for critical, analytical people like me and instead you're supposed to simply accept the collective view on the topic that the group you're currently in has.  It enforces ""religious"" and tribalistic attitudes where both sides of the debate tell the other side to shut up which ends up angering the other side causing them to villanify and mock the other side, feeding the ethical and intellectual egos of each groups members pulling them further away from looking at the topic from the other side's perspective.

And then there's people like me who are trying to understand the deeper causalities and science behind it all, to hopefully find solutions and procedures that would make our coexistence easier even when we have differing opinions and goals. 

I know where to go if I want to get validation for opinions that align with far right views. I know where to go if I want to get validation for opinions that align with ""woke"" views. But the avenues for actual critical discussion are being closed.

I understand that the opinions and goals that people have sometimes require them to silence people who have different opinions than they do - sadly not all world views and cultures can live together in a complete harmony even when we admit that our differences are only about subjective opinions and goals. But I believe that if we want to make our coexistence easier, then we should be able to talk about any topic and question each other's views to notice our own biases, and gain a better understanding of how the world works, and acknowledge the difference between scientific world view and personal goals, and hopefully find ways to align our goals.

1,2024-02-17,CMV: If society viewed sex crimes against men as “heinous” then the sexual assault rates would be similar.,u/Scary-Ad-1345,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1atbino/cmv_if_society_viewed_sex_crimes_against_men_as/,changemyview,"Essentially what I’m saying is that I think men are assaulted a lot BUT we just don’t view those crimes negatively. I’m going to speak from personal experience here & assume that a lot of men have had similar experiences considering how often these things have happened to me. After I explain my experience I’ll explain how I think television influences this as well.

My experience is that in 2nd grade I was kissed by a girl against my will. I was at a birthday party & she kissed me. I then tried to leave the party and walk home, her friend (a bigger girl) stopped me and beat me up. Forced me to go back in. The girl kissed me the rest of the day unbuttoned my shirt rubbed on my chest whatever she wanted.

Next as I got a little bit older my mom’s friends would talk about how hot I’d be when I was older. They would tell me to call them when I got to high school. Basically once I started puberty and stuff that they wanted to hook up.

Lastly I’ve woken up to women having sex with me, they’ve done things like get me drunk (older women 25+ while I was 19 years old) and touch me without consent. In my mind it’s stupid to deny a woman at this age. Why would I ever say no? That’s not what a man is supposed to do. You take sex when it’s on the table. I remember the first time I said no I thought about man when I was younger I couldn’t imagine saying no to a woman. I thought this was a testament to how much sex I was getting “I’m having so much sex they I’m turning down sex I’m so cool” but the reality is that I was just not consenting because I didn’t want to have sex and they were in some cases not respecting my words. 

Few women that I told about my experiences said “you were assaulted” and I denied that claim. “I didn’t get assaulted I’m fine with what happened.” The reality is that they were correct. Most men wouldn’t take me seriously if I said this today. The same is true for most women. 

I think this is a result of television and media, the way they portray assault against men is often comedic. I think of Friday after next, shameless, Johnny bravo. Men get kidnapped or used as sex slave and the sentiment is “that guy is so lucky.” Imagine if a woman got tied up to a bed drugged and used as sexual paraphernalia nobody would think it’s hilarious and it for sure wouldn’t make it on television outside of an after school special. 

I don’t think that women are held to an acceptable standard as far as ensuring their partner is consenting. I also don’t think that most men are aware of potential sexual trauma and molestation that occurred in their younger years. Female teacher that molest children are often viewed as heroes. "

This may sound like it goes against the fundamental democratic ideal of equality, but I would argue its more fair than ""pure democracy"".

For the sake of argument, let's assume an ideal world where no one tries to take advantage of the system.

People should be sorted into groups based on expertise, need, and contribution with tailored representation the can be calculated via some algorithm. 

For example, only teachers, parents of students, people with expertise in education, and the government body that allocates fund to education should decide how schools operate. It doesn't make sense for a random person to just get a say in how this goes. 

The same goes for every single political and social issue I can think of. 

Men should not get to decide what women can do with their bodies and vice versa. 

This voting system would also render the concept of a president obsolete. People only vote for topics they are involved with, perhaps through a congress that is elected by these individuals.

They should be free for things like deliveries, trucking, mass transit, while personal vehicles should be charged.  
  
Funneling tens of thousands of personal vehicles onto interstates for daily commutes, especially into CBDs, is quite literally the most inefficient way to transport people. And it doesn't even matter how many lanes you have if most people still need to lane change to get to the freeway exit for the CBD. There will literally ALWAYS be a bottleneck no matter what unless your cities are just paved roads (COUGH Texas).  
  
Of course, most people don't have the option to live affordably close to work, or along some sort of efficient mass transit these days so I'm not trying to blame anyone for living where they need to drive on the interstate. Cities should take the blame for continuing to allow companies/employers to crowd into downtown office buildings when existing infrastructure can't support it, or not building adequate mass transit to accommodate population growth.  
  
Having tolled interstates/freeways for personal vehicles would discourage bad development patterns. I have nothing against small suburban towns where most people drive local roads to a nearby business park for work, or big megacities with proper mass transit. They each have charms. But most of the big cities in the US are a hodegpodge mess trying to combine both into one where everyone depends on interstates/freeways to get everywhere. If cities want to have proper suburbs they should build walkable suburbs around rail stations and if car-dependent suburban towns want to grow into a bigge city they should build proper transit before allowing large employers in.

1,2024-02-17,"CMV: It's not that mental health and substance abuse treatment is not adequately funded, rather it's not clear that these treatments are effective. The root cause of our mental health crisis is existential.",u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1atd9k3/cmv_its_not_that_mental_health_and_substance/,changemyview,"It seems to me that whenever there's an issue which is a major problem, the first thing people say is that it's not adequately funded. But in my view this usually seems like a bit of an unprovable supposition. It's a popular assertion because no matter how much money you throw at a problem, you can always simply say it isn't enough, and there's no way to prove that another 10 million would have better outcomes. Or even [10 billion](https://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/press-announcements/20230313/seeking-funding-fy-2024-bolster-mental-health-substance-use-services).  
  
The President’s Budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 includes $10.8 billion for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), $3.3 billion over the agency’s FY 2023 enacted budget. The FY 2024 budget proposal continues to support the President’s Unity Agenda to address the national mental health crisis and overdose epidemic.  
  
One of the quotes a bit down is:  
  
“This funding will further facilitate SAMHSA’s daily work to connect more people to proven prevention, treatment, and recovery services and supports.”  
  
But is it accurate to say these prevention, treatment, and recovery services are ""proven""? I don't think so at all.  
  
There are many articles with bleak reporting on the issue:  
  
[America Has Reached Peak Therapy. Why Is Our Mental Health Getting Worse?](https://time.com/6308096/therapy-mental-health-worse-us/)  
  
All this mainstream awareness is reflected in the data too: by the latest federal estimates, about one in eight U.S. adults now takes an antidepressant and one in five has recently received some kind of mental-health care, an increase of almost 15 million people in treatment since 2002. Even in the recent past—from 2019 to 2022—use of mental-health services jumped by almost 40% among millions of U.S. adults with commercial insurance, according to a recent study in JAMA Health Forum.  
  
But something isn’t adding up. Even as more people flock to therapy, U.S. mental health is getting worse by multiple metrics. Suicide rates have risen by about 30% since 2000. Almost a third of U.S. adults now report symptoms of either depression or anxiety, roughly three times as many as in 2019, and about one in 25 adults has a serious mental illness like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. As of late 2022, just 31% of U.S. adults considered their mental health “excellent,” down from 43% two decades earlier.  
  
[Effectiveness of Talk Therapy Is Overstated, a Study Says](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/health/study-finds-psychotherapys-effectiveness-for-depression-overstated.html)  
  
Treatments like cognitive behavior therapy and interpersonal therapy are indeed effective, the analysis found, but about 25 percent less so than previously thought.  
  
Doctors have long known that journal articles exaggerate the benefits of antidepressant drugs by about the same amount, and partly for the same reason — a publication bias in favor of encouraging findings. The new review, in the journal PLOS One, should give doctors and patients a better sense of what to expect from various forms of talk therapy, experts said, if not settle long-running debates in psychiatry about the relative merits of one treatment over another.  
  
The trouble with this kind of thing too is that since mental health conditions are qualitative, there's really no empirical method of assessing if someone's mental health is actually improving aside from them reporting how they feel. And people might not be entirely forthcoming about how they actually feel, for whatever reason.  
  
They've even classified a new form of depression, called ""[Treatment-resistant depression](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/treatment-resistant-depression/art-20044324)"". As if the condition itself is some kind of unique variant of depression which is resistant to the ""proven"" treatment, when in fact it's just that the treatment is incredibly precarious and often ineffective.  
  
There seems to be an overwhelming amount of data showing that mental health and substance abuse treatments are not effective. Is the problem really just the amount of money we're spending? I strongly doubt it.  
  
[Drugs aren't solving mental illness — here's what might](https://www.businessinsider.com/nimh-new-psychotherapy-initiative-2015-7)  
  
Jerald Kay, a long-practicing psychiatrist and professor emeritus at Wright State University, says that while ""you have to be careful about faulting clinicians,"" there is indeed ""a quality problem.""  
  
In a 2014 paper, Kay and his co-author Michael F. Myers expressed concern that ""the quality of teaching and learning psychotherapy is variable in our training programs,"" with a real risk that new doctors will be left to sort out for themselves what kind of psychotherapy they want to include — or not — in their practices.  
  
The result? ""There's a lot of stuff that goes on that should not go on,"" Kay says. ""A lot of the things we do have unknown effectiveness.""  
  
So you can see how ""mental health treatment"" is already a very loose form of ""medicine"", if it could even be called that. It really seems to be more of an art than a science.  
  
Personally I think the therapist and their level of charisma and personality probably has the biggest impact on whether the treatment is ""effective"" or not.  
  
Regardless of how you feel about him personally, you look at someone like Jordan B. Peterson who has a massive following in the culture. It's clear that he has a very strong level of charisma and personality and manner of communicating which is extremely impactful to people - I argue that these factors have a much greater impact on an individual than following the guidelines for something like CBT. You consider that JBP was a clinical psychologist for many years and I imagine many of his patients at least felt that he was helping them in a significant way (even if they were only being charmed or ""dazzled"" into feeling that way).  
  
In the same sense that having a very close friend whom you trust probably has a huge impact on mental health. It seems to me that therapists are really just professional friends - people that you pay to listen closely to your most intimate problems and provide feedback.  
  
[A Crisis of Meaning](https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/10/22/mental-illness-crisis-of-meaning/)  
  
Ultimately, it seems to me that the problem with our mental health crisis is a ""crisis of meaning"". I think the root cause of our mental health crisis is, in short, modernity.  
  
Technology, isolation, mass media manipulation, and political polarization. I think these are the four horsemen of the mental health apocalypse.  
  
How do you treat the psychological damage done by these? I don't think you really can. I think people have to find their own personal path out of the mental illness brought on by these things. Maybe mental health treatment can help some people to find their own paths out of this deep dark wood some of the time, but I think it's far from a ""proven"" method as originally stated by the SAMHSA.  
  
So yeah, I don't think more money will help the mental health crisis we have going on. Do you believe otherwise? If so...change my view."

So far as I can tell the United States fits the definition of a Backsliding Democracy or ""Hybrid Authoritarian-Democratic"" regime.     

It has a two-party system, as opposed to any sort of plurality of political thought supported by the regime. ""Gerrymandering"" and their inverted result ""Competitive districts"" can only exist as part of a fundamentally flawed democratic system. Lawmakers dictate the rules for their own reelection and its been getting worse for the last 20 years. At this point, state and national races have a 90%+ reelection rate and its been like that for a while. 

When this happens in other countries we can point to it and say that their democracy broke, it is where the criteria that Ive based my understanding on so far came from. You're not allowed to do that here, though. 

&#x200B;

P.S. its related but I don't want to bog the discussion down... for me the belief underlying this can be summed up by the question, ""authoritarian means a lot of things but one of the big ones is a way of organizing society with separate sets of rights for different groups of people ==>  the republic of the United States was authoritarian up until the 1960s, No?""

obviously not a political scientist, im coming at this from a historians view. ive no doubt theres answers to this line of thought, but i havent been hearing them yet. So far it seems like different flavors of American Exceptionalism is the most popular answer. Where its just not an issue that other countries are held to one standard and the US is held to a different, more complementary, scale. 

i look forward to hearing from everyone =D

Some of the best days of my life have started with a trip to the dollar store to get a bunch of nicknacks, putting those nicknacks on a berm and making said nicknacks into many smaller nicknacks through the liberal (no pun intended) application of freedom pellets. 

However, I would give that up tomorrow if I never had to read about a school shooting ever again.

I get that “a well regulated militia” meant something else when the bill of rights was written and that the Supreme Court already ruled that the right to bare arms is an individual right. However, this isn’t the 18th century anymore and our founders gave us the opportunity to amend the constitution. Why can’t we make state militias a thing and require gun owners to join the militia with requirements to train on gun use and safety? Gun ownership is a responsibility. I can think of several people I know who don’t practice the absolute basics of gun safety, but use their firearms regularly.

At the very least, this would allow a regular check in with gun owners and an opportunity for people to raise red flags if someone seems “off” or doesn’t practice good safety practices.

We can’t agree to anything related to the second amendment but we can all agree that gun violence sucks. Would it really be such a bad thing to have a practice that ensured that everyone that owned a gun knew how to use it properly and safely?"
2,2024-02-17,CMV: Objectification isn't inherently bad,u/Brilliant-Guest-4155,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1atgcji/cmv_objectification_isnt_inherently_bad/,changemyview,"I've seen many arguments against sexual objectification, and as someone who used to be more fervently feministic, I can kind of understand those arguments. ""Objectification reduces the woman to a discardable sex object."" ""Objectification assumes there's nothing more to a woman than her looks."" ""Objectification implies you treat women as inferior to yourself.""

I think I see where these arguments come from. And if some creepy asshole *does* think of women as JUST objects that can be disrespected and played with, then I think he deserves to be slapped one time by every single girl and woman on the planet, one after another. I do not stand for such behavior as groping women, stalking women, harassing women, cat-calling women, etc. And I lose respect for men who complain about ""women"" or treat women like an exotic species.

But I'm not so sure about sexual obtjectification itself. I don't see how having sexual fantasies of men and women—**especially** fictional men and women—can hurt anyone. Even fantasies that only consider their bodies. As far as I can tell, if a guy masturbates to a fictional female character because of her looks, the only harm he can possibly cause is wasting his own time—if he does it too often. And maybe increasing his chances of ED if he can only be turned on by unrealistic porn or unrealistically sexy fictional characters. But otherwise, fictional women aren't harmed by it, and no real women are harmed by it as long as he keeps it to himself.

I've seen arguments that if you have sexual fantasies about women, then it means you will inevitably treat real women as objects of your fancy. I'm sorry but I've never experienced that myself. I have HARD crushes on a few fictional characters and real-life celebrities. But not only am I happily married to a progressive woman, but I also have a few close female friends. I admire my female friends (some of whom are indeed sexy) for their minds and personalities, and not once have I ever groped them, harassed them, or talked down to them. All of them consider me a gentleman, and I consider them far better friends than any of my male friends. Sometimes I can even look *up* to them, they can be quite inspiring.

Actually, one of these female friends is *far more* into sexual objectification than me. I've never met a hornier person. She talks more openly about the sexy bodies of women and female characters than any guy I've known. Yet she is a fierce and fervent enemy against patriarchy, because she comes from an indigenous Taiwanese tribe that values sexual freedom.

Perhaps you could argue that I'm unusual. Maybe most guys who enjoy objectification or have objectifying fantasies ARE terrible people on average. If so, that would make me disappointed in men. And I think those guys deserve a rude wake-up call. But are such lousy people the *average*? Is it common for men who are turned on by, say, car ads with swimsuit models, to also be gropers or cat-callers, or at least extremely arrogant toward women?

Surely if I have sexually objectifying fantasies but *also* have a variety of close female friends who I treat with respect and equality, then that means objectification isn't *inherently* bad, right? Well, I want to see your arguments, because maybe you can turn my mind around.

As for my own female friends, well, I don't feel comfortable talking to them—and my guy friends—about private sexual fantasies. I've only discussed this subject with my wife and the Taiwanese friend, both of whom mostly agree with me."

Each one inhabiting their own media bubble, with its own local newspaper, at least one national newspaper, and then a newspaper that was an extension of a political party’s public relations apparatus.

It feels like we’re heading towards that. Complete with nu-yellow journalism (aka fake news you see on facebook.)

Crops like wheat and corn are modified to be resistant to Glyphosate, then sprayed with it so that only they grow and no other weeds or plants can live.

I mention “US population” because much of the world has banned its use due to increased risk of cancer. In the US, it is legal and widely used in common items like Cheerios, Nature Valley granola, and most mass produced wheat or corn products. It’s also used in many (if not all) non-organic bread you buy at the store. According to studies, 80% of Americans have Glyphosate in their bloodstream. 

Glyphosate is known and banned by many countries for its links to cancer. However, the FDA and EPA still claim that it is “likely” not carcinogenic and is ok if used “in accordance with its current label”. 

I don’t understand how the FDA can “conclude” that a man-made chemical used to kill plants can be safe inside the human body. More likely is the fact that it’s very, very difficult to scientifically prove that something is undoubtedly cancerous, as isolating a variable like that at a mass scale is nearly impossible, so they can’t conclude 100% that is *is* cancerous and keep it legal.

While the FDA claims it’s “not a carcinogen”, there is a growing body of [evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/20/glyphosate-weedkiller-cancer-biomarkers-urine-study) that disagrees with that claim. Wouldn’t leaning on the side of caution with a population-wide food supply chemical be wise?

33 countries have banned its use, with many more states and countries looking at similar measures now. what does the FDA know that the 33 countries where it is currently banned not know? 

I don’t want to get all conspiracy theorist about the money in politics and if that plays a factor, I just think objectively it’s wild that we are all eating trace amounts of Round Up and don’t even really know it. I feel that in decades we will look back on this like we do now with lead-based paint and be baffled by how common it’s use was for our food supply. 

Countries where it is banned:

Argentina; Australia (in some states); Belgium; Bermuda; Bahrain; Barbados; Brazil; Canada (8 out of 10 provinces); Colombia; Costa Rica; Czech Republic; Denmark; El Salvador; Fiji; France; Germany; India; Italy; Luxembourg; Malta; Netherlands; Oman; Qatar; St. Vincent and the Grenadines; Saudi Arabia; Portugal; Scotland; Slovenia; Spain; Sri Lanka; Thailand; Vietnam; Austria."

And it gets nasty, **real** nasty real quick. You’d think it was white women that ran the Taliban or forced FGM on teenage girls with amount of vitriol and rage coming towards them. Go on Google Scholar. Type in white feminism, see the results and maybe read a few paragraphs. You can feel the anger radiating from the text. I can practically see the spittle flying from their lips as they tell white women what their fucking place really is /s

And listen, white women and white people in general do need to be talked to. Because they get mad overfamiliar with their black/brown/Asian friends and think they’re part of the crew just because they got invited to a the cookout a couple of times. But there is a difference between that and this in my opinion. It’s a cottage industry, as I said in my title. DEI programs can hire speakers like Robin Diangelo, author of the infamous “White Fragility”, to come to their respective colleges/corporations and lecture white women on their various sins and then white women, the ones who aren’t “karens” at least, once enlightened to the error of their ways and their place in the oppression Olympics, can kneel at the altar of minority victimhood and make amends.

Liberal white women who confuse self flagellation with moral virtue get to feel they’re “one of the good ones.” And that they’ve been baptized and cleansed of their sins.

Minorities get to take out their anger on their oppressor.

Robin Diangelo gets paid.

But the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of this trend is that the same women railing against white feminism will turn into church mice when it comes to criticism of patriarchy in islam. After a healthy dose of criticism towards the west and Christianity, followed by numerous qualifications, they lightly touch on things like the banning of interfaith marriage for muslim women while allowing it for muslim men. The patriarchal structures throughout Islamic republics in MENA region and the deplorable treatment of women in places like West Africa. All that fire and brimstone talk goes out the window because these feminists are more concerned about being called racist, imperialist, or islamophobic then it is to be true to their purported principles. Contrast how many American/foreign feminists railed against the fundamentalist, patriarchal Christian character of the United States during the Bush Administration fought tooth and nail to make sure the same wasn’t said about a country that stones women for showing an ankle in public because “that’s just their culture”."

Alright, I get this is a strange, probably stupid, CMV. But I was having a debate recently with someone about the song that best encapsulates the 1990s, and I immediately went to this one.

Here's why:

* Came out in 1997, smack dab during the alternative rock scene that dominated most of the decade. Most of the other popular genres of the 90s, such as grunge, Eurodance, Latin revival, swing revival, etc, were all short lived. But alternative rock stuck around and remained popular into the next decade.
* Has ironic lyrics, about a man falling into crystal meth addiction. This is contrasted by the upbeat melody. Irony was huge in the 90s, and even acts like U2 got into it. Many songs that have stood the test of time from the decade often had lyrical dissonance.
* The song itself has stood the test of time. Still played to this day on most radio stations. Has been featured in many commercials and movies. And it's not a song that is remembered for being cheese or novelty (i.e. something like Vanilla Ice).

CMV on this. What other song from the 90s best encapsulated the decade? For what it's worth, the person I was debating said ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" but I disagree. Nirvana got the ball rolling, as grunge killed off the glam metal scene of the 80s, but grunge was relatively short lived and I don't think Nirvana is really indicative of where the 90s ended up going."

What kind of job were you thinking about getting with that?""

...Why are degrees seen as ""useless"" in the first place? Why are higher education universities allowing people to get degrees and shill out thousands of dollars in things there are no jobs for? Why can't the government intercept that? If you sign up for a degree programme, pay the thousands of dollars that goes into that, ***I don't understand how it's even legal*** that there is nothing in the job market for that.

There is something fundamentally wrong with limiting people down to the value in labor they bring to society. There is nothing better about an engineer than a poet except for how much money the engineer makes his boss and gets taxed by the government. Writers and Poets are essentially disappearing from modern culture because the world sees them as not ""useful"" enough, and a ""useless degree"". 

The argument seems to be ""If we let people sit on their ass all day then nothing will get done in society"" but I don't see any reason why that would ever happen. I have absolutely zero interest in being a poet. If I could, I would ***love*** to be a neuroscientist, but the cost of education is way too high for that for me to even see that as an option. I see no reason to think why I am an outlier. I've met people who want to be lawyers, or firefighters, or researchers, things that directly help their communities and the world. 

The only people who seem to benefit from perpetuating the idea of ""useless degrees"" are the elites who are a part of mega-corps. I can't think of any other reason.

If the degrees are useless... ***maybe stop selling them?!*** Or at least universities should be mandated to be better equipped in helping alumni find employment in their respective fields?

It seems so weird to blame the student instead of the university. The student is signing up to follow a passion. They aren't the ones peddling a false lie to doe-eyed ***children*** trying to grow into adults."

8,2024-02-18,CMV: Flaming is a bad part of the streamer culture,u/Little-Highway-8149,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1atuwui/cmv_flaming_is_a_bad_part_of_the_streamer_culture/,changemyview,"For the purpose of this discussion, flaming is defined as any of the followings:

* posting personal insults at streamers or other viewers
* encouraging other viewers to leave, unsubscribe, or otherwise stop supporting the streamer (I'll call this ""boycotting"" to disambiguate)

It might be surprising to treat boycotting in the same way as personal insults. Indeed, there are practical reasons to boycott a streamer, such as stopping them from spreading misinformation. Despite this, I think we, as the viewer community, should discourage this type of behaviour, for two reasons:

&#x200B;

\## Reason 1: Boycotting causes people to be more aggressive

When there is a large group of people boycotting against a streamer, it creates an environment that invites abusive behaviors, such as threats or doxxing. Thanks to the anomyous nature of Internet, people become more aggressive when they believe they are part of the ""crowd"", even though most boycotters don't support abusive behaviors.

Moreover, if someone tries to call out these abusive behaviors, they risks being called ""defending the bad guy"". Thus, there is much less incentive to protect the streamer from abusive behaviors.

&#x200B;

\## Reason 2: Boycotting creates undue pressure on the streamer

As the streamer, getting boycotted is very costly, regardless of whether there's a good reason for it. This gives too much power to the viewers and creates a lot of pressure for the streamer (Imagine your income depends on the whim of random people on the Internet!) As a result, streamers have learnt to be very careful about potentially sensitive topics and go out of their way to avoid boycott. I've seen streamers apologize to their viewers for very silly reasons, such as getting in a romatic relationship.

Being a streamer is not exactly the healthiest job, and having to watch out for boycotts makes things so much harder for them.

&#x200B;

Thus I conclude that boycotting causes more trouble than it solves, and we, as a community, should discourage it."

The humanitarian situation is already more than dire, with hundreds of thousands short of food, water and other basic supplies. The only aid coming into Gaza is through the Rafah crossing, which will be hampered if an invasion does take place. The result of such an invasion will be catastrophic for the Gazans as thousands will likely die from the operation itself, and likely manyfold more dying from starvation and disease.

This is why the international community is so worried about such an invasion, even Biden himself has shown immense concern for such an operation. Israel is already losing the goodwill of the international community and I think that given the magnitude of such a catastrophe, it will be a tipping point for many countries expressing solidarity with Israel. 

Furthermore, it will embolden Palestinians' belief that a genocide is taking place, that wherever the refugees go, Israel will come after them. If Israel wishes for some kind of meaningful peace in the region, such an invasion will make the prospect of a peace deal even harder to achieve than it already is.

I have no doubt that such an invasion will save many hostages and kill off many of the Hamas leadership, but the cost to the Palestinians will be too great for other countries to accept, leaving Israel isolated in any prospect for long-term solution."

That's the foundation of this.

Hamas did an evil thing. And deserve to be taken out. The people they hurt didn't earn any of this.

The problem Israel has is the same is true of the civilians on the other side. And Israel has the luxury of high tech power and superior training and numbers for the fighting.

Dropping flyers isn't doing your best to minimize civilian casualties. Bombing cities to dust will have far reaching ramifications for the people trying to survive in that area. It doesn't matter if your suspects are 100% confirmed hiding in the area or not. Israel has the luxury of going all special forces on this problem. Of not using big explosions to get a job done. They just... aren't.

Hamas is evil. But when you fight evil you have to make sure you don't become evil yourself. And they just... haven't made sure.

Would it risk their own people a little more? Yes. But nobody said being good is the easy path.

The biggest problem though is that Israel really wasn't at risk of being conquered by Hamas. Or even struck a second time. They went into hiding. And the only reason the attack succeeded in the first place is that they had for some strange reason basically abandoned border security that day and took hours to respond. They had the luxury of time to think, the luxury of power to tailor a response, the luxury of technology to gain way better intel than the hiding enemy, and the luxury of what could've been a unified West behind them if they'd just used different weapons and tactics.

The only defenses I really hear to this idea are bad ones. People trying to pretend civilians in an area are the same as Hamas. Or have to rise up and fight against them to have basic human rights. But that's not true. Just like the North Koreans are all human hostages and victims so are any Palestinians who haven't been violent to innocent people. And they do exist. In large numbers. And many of them have gotten blown up by Israel without the faintest attempt at selecting only the justified targets in strikes.

Just to name some of the key industries I have worked in: aerospace, semiconductor, steel production, oil refining, chemical refining, and telecommunications. The thought that any of these key industries, that are the building blocks for modern society, can just be replaced by AI is not a commonly-held belief from anyone I have worked with.

Let's look at just one of these industries as an example: semiconductors (more commonly known as microchips, something that AI relies heavily on). The microchip manufacturing process relies on dozens of metals and hundreds of chemicals. Each metal and chemical that it relies on can be traced back to separate companies that work on refining said metals and chemicals. So that's already hundreds of companies that we rely on to just provide the raw material used to make microchips. Now add on the trades, contractors, builders, and the vendors that supple the machines that we use ([see here for an example of what just one machine looks like](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1an9dy5/asmls_latest_chipmaking_machine_weighs_as_much_as/). We need hundreds of these.) You can easily see that not only does the process of creating microchips require tons of people, it relies on thousands of other companies that also employee tons of people.

If your response is ""well robots are going to be able to replace many of those jobs soon"", I just simply would have to see proof of that. like at all. The microchip manufacturing process actually is already fully automated (meaning from start to finish not one human has to touch the microchip; it moves from one station to the next through the use of robots) and yet it still relies on thousands of engineers and technicians to maintain, improve, innovate, and troubleshoot the process.

But let's play with the idea that robots eventually do replace nearly every modern day job in, say, a century or two. What would that look like? This is where I believe that people who think that AI is going to replace most jobs lose sight of macroeconomics, or perhaps better said, human nature. If we ever got to the point that robots could do every manufacturing job, every service job, every tech job, every legal job, etc., then it would still require people to design, build, and improve said robots. Companies will compete to create the newest, fastest, most innovative robot. Technicians will service the robots. Engineers would design the robots. Marketing teams would advertise the newest, greatest robot. Business owners would run the business associated with creating robots. Not to mention, in this utopian (dystopian?) world, there would still be demand for chef-made meals (I mean this already exists... would you rather eat ultra processed foods or a freshly made meal?), entertainment, and many other services provided by humans.

Now, if you want to make the argument that AI will speed up inequality, I can understand that position. Those that own the AI companies have a lot to gain and I am open to that argument. But the argument that as AI progresses, more and more people are just gonna go home and twiddle their thumbs all day cause they got nothing to do is simply not based on any historical precedent. Millions of jobs have gone obsolete in the past, and millions of jobs will continue to be replaced. There will be hiccups, but as long as the human race has the drive to innovate and progress, there will always be jobs."

0,2024-02-18,"CMV: ""Of the dead, speak only good"" is a good philosophy for the average person to follow",u/Novel-Ad4955,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1au0jz4/cmv_of_the_dead_speak_only_good_is_a_good/,changemyview,"When an influential person dies, there is generally a small but substantial number of people who use the opportunity to speak ill of the person. The latest iteration of this with Navalny, with people accusing him of being a racist and a nationalist. I remember seeing it when Queen Elizabeth died as well and also when Shinzo Abe was assassinated. These are just some examples I could think of the top of my head.

Now I personally follow the philosophy attributed to Chilon of Sparta. I interpret it as, if you have nothing good to say of the dead man, better to stay silent. I believe this is a good philosphy for the average person to follow for three reasons.

First, there is the moral case. Unless the person is straight up Hitler, it is very likely that they are not ""evil"". Most controversial figures usually just have mixed legacies, and so I think we should have some perspective while evaluating their lives. Are they really such a bad person that their existence was an overall negative, to the extent that killing them would have been an honourable thing to do? If not, that should give us reason for pause. Then there is the matter of giving their loved ones space to mourn. Finally, the person is no longer there to defend themselves, so it is considered cowardly.

Second, there is the practical case. It is an exercise in futility - given that the person has departed, they can no longer do harm and hence this is true by definition. Further, if an action doesn't achieve anything positive, but creates divisiveness and frustration, how can it be considered good? There is nothing that you achieve by spamming a hundred online communities with the same talking point about how person X is actually bad. It is very hard to have a real conversation on the internet about such a topic as divisive as ""Is person X a hero or a monster?"". So why waste time on it? Basically I consider this equivalent to trolling.

Finally, there is the matter of self respect. 99% of your conversations in life are going to be with your spouse, children or co-workers. So when you speak ill of the dead, it's really in front of them that you do so. Do you really want to be that person? Would you rather be remembered as the mild-mannered, empathetic guy or the hot-headed, passionate one. I think it is better from a purely selfish reason to just shrug your shoulder and move on.

People are free to say what they want. However, I believe following this philosophy will allow you to be calmer, happier and able to enjoy life more. At best, such people achieve nothing and at worse make the world (slightly) less pleasant.

To CMV, you don't have to convince me to drop my philosophy, just that the moral and practical case is weaker than I thought.

I believe that the perceived importance or difficulty of your job should solely dictate how much the job pays. Or could absolutely play a roll in it but it’s not the determining factor. 

I also hear about people complaining about how much the owner of the company makes versus their employees. They started a company to benefit themselves. The opportunity of employment their endeavor created is a blessing for others but is ultimately not there for the community to reap the same benefits as the owner.

Some people may complain about some “talentless” fool who becomes a millionaire because of reality tv or social media. The money didn’t pop into their pockets just because. Lots of people made that happen. The market more so decides what you get paid. 


It should be noted that I am referring to legally sanctioned work within the confines of the US.


Side note: The only individuals who I would say are overpaid are would be certain elected representatives.  Primarily people like your congressional members who have the ability to vote for their own raises. They do not need to concern themselves with money because they’ll have it as long as the American citizens keep making it."
0,2024-02-18,CMV:Much of the US firebombing of Japan wasn’t necessary,u/FerdinandTheGiant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1au1t6o/cmvmuch_of_the_us_firebombing_of_japan_wasnt/,changemyview,"Been reading about it more and more so figured I’d just see some alternative views to the conclusions I’ve reached. To clarify a few things: “Much” in the title doesn’t necessarily mean most, I am not saying with the title that most of the US firebombing was unnecessary, I don’t have enough data to make that claim. 

It is my view that the total extent of the firebombing campaign was unnecessary from a practical standpoint as there were a lot of raids that struck targets of no value to the war effort in any meaningful way. A good example is the bombing of Oita in July of 1945. 142 planes dropped 790 tons of firebombs onto the city of Oita and the city hosted no major industry and the noted industry that was struck was a confectionery manufacturing and storage as well as a sauce factory. If that raid never happened, I very much doubt it would have changed the outcome of the war. And the status of Oita as not having any major targets was known to the people who ordered the raid based on previously produced air objective folders.

There are many other examples like Oita that didn’t serve a purpose from a military standpoint. That said, one could argue this kind of bombing served to strain the populace and worsen the domestic situation, which I do have to agree is true, but other bombing practices we were already doing and our blockade did a lot more than the later firebombing raids. 

Again, I am not saying none were effective. Tokyo was very effective and it was one of the 6 large urban areas that was initially and solely recommended for firebombing by (I recall) the COA. In the end though, 67 cities, many of very small size and low value, were fire bombed. Which widely feels unnecessary.

The amount of movement that’s possible on pc is insane. Console players can only wall jump. 

They’ll usually be like “oh it takes hours of practice and skill to be able to do this movement. You don’t need practice for aim assist.” Well duh. I could spend years or decades in the practice range trying to do these movement techs and never be able to do them. It doesn’t matter if it takes practice if I’ll never be able to do it with centuries of practice. 

I coul have my aim assist and sense turned to max and I still won’t be able to preform 360s in a second. 

Aiming on controller is much much harder than using a mouse and keyboard. I don’t think I even need to explain this anymore. If you know how controllers and mouse + keyboards work,  you’ll understand. 

Movement and freedom on keyboard and mouse is equalized by aim assist on controller. But I personally don’t think it’s truly equal. Pc players still have an advantage with aiming. They can do a 360 in less than a second. Much more precise movements, like how wattson is much less impactful on console because of how her kit works. Much much more advantages. It’s just easier to spin in a circle on controller. 

Plus, aim assist doesn’t make you a god. You still need practice. I have aim assist and still am shit. 

Prove to me that aiming on controller is just as easy as on a mouse and keyboard to change my view. Or enlighten me to something I’m not considering. "
21,2024-02-18,CMV: Raising the Minimum Wage Is Ineffective Without Systemic Changes,u/GapingAssTroll,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1au29qy/cmv_raising_the_minimum_wage_is_ineffective/,changemyview,"I believe that raising the minimum wage would be ultimately ineffective unless accompanied by systemic changes, as it opens loopholes for companies to exploit, resulting in potential negative consequences for the country. Here are three key reasons why:

**Price Inflation**: If companies are mandated to pay higher wages, they may compensate by increasing the prices of their products or services. This can lead to inflation, eroding the purchasing power of consumers, particularly those on fixed incomes or earning slightly above the minimum wage. Inflation could negate the intended benefits of a higher minimum wage, creating a cycle of wage increases and price hikes.

**Outsourcing and Offshoring**: In a globalized economy, companies have the option to move their operations to countries with lower labor costs, such as China or other developing nations. By relocating production facilities or outsourcing tasks to cheaper overseas suppliers, companies can bypass the need to raise wages domestically. This not only negates the effectiveness of minimum wage laws but also contributes to job losses and economic instability in the home country.

**Labor Consolidation**: Alternatively, companies may opt to cut their workforce, forcing more responsibilities and labor onto each individual worker, which undermines the minimum wage increase, and increases unemployment.

In conclusion, simply raising the minimum wage without addressing underlying structural issues in the economy is unlikely to yield the desired outcomes. To ensure that workers are adequately compensated and protected, policymakers must consider comprehensive solutions that address these loopholes. If not, more people will suffer, and small business, who can't keep up, will be trampled by the powerful companies that are capable for taking advantage of these loopholes. No one except big businesses would benefit in the long run."

Children tend to outgrow this, though as an adult there is still a time and space for fart and booger humour, as I think there is for dark humour, but like fart and booger humour, I view relying heavily on it to be generally infantile, and based off of simple subversion and shock value.

I don’t imagine my mind will be changed by pointing out the times when it is appropriate, I think it would be better for me to comment on people who use dark humour heavily or centrally, or who identify as a person who is generally into dark humour. 

I’m hoping to change my view here because I do think it’s fairly judgemental, and I’d like to develop more empathy for people who are into this humour, more respect for this humour, and maybe even the ability to enjoy it.

There is nothing in science that can disprove religion, and there isn’t anything in modern religion that disproves science. People tend to think in binary, only one thing or the other. But life is much more complex than that.

 Science is a very important part of our life, so ignoring it is only going to hurt you and possibly others in the long run. Having a healthy understanding of the world around you is important.

 Religion is also very important (for lots of people) it gives meaning to things that would otherwise not be super impressive, and can be very good for mental health and dealing with hard times. It doesn’t actively hurt you to not have a religion, but what does is when you stop seeing the wonder in small things, which is something that religion brings to a lot of people. Having a healthy amount of wonder and magic in your life is very important. 

Understanding how the world works and functions, and believing in the wonder and spirit it could possess do not defy each other. In fact I would say they support each other.

This is quote I often hear played on radio stations like NPR, as evidence that Donald Trump was trying to steal the election.  I mean, he’s saying he wants to find extra votes, how is that not criminal?

But look at the full conversation between President Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, regarding the results from Georgia in the 2020 Presidential election. 

Earlier in the phone call, Trump had listed all the votes for Biden which he believed were fraudulent.   For example, Trump said he believed there were over 200,000 votes with forged signatures, over 18,000 votes cast from a vacant address, almost 5,000 votes cast from out of state, 5,000 votes cast by deceased persons, etc. 

When Trump said, “I want to find 11,780 votes,” all he was saying was, out of the many thousands he believed to be fraudulent, they only needed to prove it for 11,780 to win the state. 

Whether Trump was correct that there were many thousands of fraudulent votes, that is a different discussion.  But in this conversation with Brad Raffensperger, Trump was only talking about proving votes cast for Biden were fraudulent, not actually “finding” new votes for Trump.

Edit-  I am going to wait a bit for the influx of responses to die down before replying to anyone else.  I will make sure to award deltas for anyone who makes good points, even if they don’t necessarily fully change my mind.
Please only reply to this post’s specific claim, which is that the statement is inaccurately portrayed.  I’m not wanting to argue against Donald Trump lying about voter fraud, only talking about how this statement has been misrepresented in the context of the conversation.

Edit 2- I see now that my original claim “Donald Trump was not asking to fake votes for him,” carries the implication that what he did was not wrong.  Thus, most of the replies have been arguing against this implication rather than my literal claim, which is very fair.

So my original claim might better be worded as, “Donald Trump was not literally asking for fake votes, he was genuinely calling out believed voter fraud.”  

I have had this view changed based on the following points made:

1.) if Trump genuinely believed in election fraud, it should have been his priority as president to investigate it, not to only overturn the exact number of votes he needed to win the state.

2.) Even if all the fraudulent votes were thrown out, it may have given Biden a win.  

3.) Trump making the call at all and possibly implying legal consequences was improper procedure."

But what often gets overlooked is a potentially seismic shift: the very real possibility of AI systems achieving general intelligence (AGI) matching human intellect, or even surpassing us entirely (ASI).
It's easy to dismiss this as sci-fi. Common objections include uncertainties about what true intelligence means, doubts about our current computing power, or beliefs that AI is merely advanced pattern recognition.

Here's why those concerns might need careful reconsidering:

 * Intelligence isn't magic: We don't need to perfectly replicate the human brain. General Intelligence emerges in natural systems; with the right environment and learning models, it could arise in AI as well. Today's complex neural networks already operate in ways we don't fully grasp, yet exhibit powerful capabilities.
 * Progress won't be linear: Hardware improvements play a role, but AI's biggest jumps come from how it handles scale. More compute, smarter algorithms can drive unpredictable leaps in what these systems can do. The term ""effective compute"" is important for understanding that is not just about raw flops. And we can see that these systems scale, we have seen that time and time again - a great example is with Sora and in the research they share they show how much better scaling those models makes them.
 * Beyond prediction, into planning: Systems like AlphaZero revolutionized game-playing not by merely guessing the next move, but demonstrating creative strategy and problem-solving via “search”. As similar techniques find their way into language models, we already have some really incredible advances - one notable example is “FunSearch” out of Google. Rumours are abound that behind the scenes, OpenAI also has an architecture that does something similar (referred to as Q*) that significantly outperforms other architectures at key tasks. 

Even the leading minds driving AI research are increasingly revising their timelines for potential human-level machine intellect. While it's impossible to predict exactly when, even a small likelihood of AGI within the next decade deserves attention.

Recent milestones:
 * The scaling race: Models consistently show better capabilities the more data they consume. Tech giants are pushing towards ever-larger, trillion-parameter AI systems, leading to unpredictable performance surges.
 * Multimodal mastery: We are moving away from strictly text only inputs in the bleeding edge models, and are training them with visual data, audio, and even looking into things like “touch” - a key aspect of versatile, AGI-like intelligence that we eventually want navigating the real physical world.
 * AI-enabled discovery: 2023 saw AI assisting in protein structure prediction or mathematical theorem proving. This level of scientific problem-solving has profound implications for how quickly technology might be shaped by AI systems themselves.

This is less about specific technological worries and more about a fundamental transformation looming ahead. AGI/ASI forces us to rethink how the world works. This isn't a topic best left to fiction – it requires real, engaged discourse and awareness right now. I think If people are at all taking this seriously, it's incredibly valuable to actively engage with podcasts, research, and informed opinions, to better shape our understanding of what might be the literal most important creation in human history. 

I don't think I'm even saying we need to ""do"" anything about it, I am just trying to move the overton window. Instead of out of hand dismissals of this as being nonsense, I think we need to engage with this as a thing that is potentially very very real."

However I only think of this one: Probability Manipulation.

When I think of probability manipulation as being the ""Best Power"" I don't mean that it is the most overpowered or destructive power that would allow you to destroy the world etc. I see it as the most useful for the real world.

I feel like 'probability manipulation' is a bit ambiguous and leaves a lot to interpretation, so I'll just give the version that I'm thinking of:

The wielder of probability manipulation is able to change the probability of the outcome of any event, given that the probability of those outcomes is not 100% or 0%. So as long as there is a chance for the desired outcome, the wielder can change the probability to favor that outcome. Likewise, they would not be able to edit the probability to be either 100% or 0% but as close to that as possible. For example, the wielder would not be able to change the probability that they gain *x* ability, as the probability of that is 0% nor would they be able to manipulate the probability that time passes as that is 100% chance. However they could change their odds in gambling, in the chance that a test they didn't study for only contains questions that they know the answers to. etc. It is a level of reality manipulation as it were but It has restrictions. (which is how I think all powers should work)

That's essentially my idea behind the ""best"" power that I feel would be the only power that I would need in life. "
1,2024-02-18,CMV: The mass shootings in the United States of America aren’t a gun problem and in theory it’s a simple fix. ,u/BadmonTG23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1au7wdm/cmv_the_mass_shootings_in_the_united_states_of/,changemyview,"I’m posting this in response to someone else’s CMV that the mass shootings in America can’t be stopped because there’s too many guns in circulation. 


For starters it’s not a gun issue. It’s a people issue. It doesn’t matter how many guns there are. The problem is ensuring that only those who are trained can have a gun and that only those who are mentally fit have guns. I hear so many people say look at the UK and Australia they got rid of guns and the issue stopped.

What people don’t understand is every single country thats land locked with the USA except for Canada is pretty much ran by the cartel. Right now the cartel controls all of our illegal drug and human trafficking trade, and even our borders. Getting rid of the guns will just give them another thing to trade illegally and even more power over America than they already have. Getting rid of the guns will just give the cartels another thing to trade illegally and take guns out of the hands of rightful or trained owners and put them in the hands of more idiots. 

Also, the UK still has loads of violent crime and so does Australia. They just turn to alternative weapons like acid or zombie knives or they just get illegal guns. Or in Australia they firebomb your house. All of this is still as deadly as a gun. Not to mention the USA isn’t an island so just outlawing the guns isn’t an answer for us. The cartels as stated will just smuggle them in.  

Now a gun by itself simply can’t kill someone, a human is needed to carry out the action and I’ve heard many ignorant people say it’s intention is to kill and no that’s not true people use rifles for sport but fundamentally protection is the main priority as well as hunting and shooting competitions. 

Not to mention guns save millions per year. 

http://www.gunfacts.info/gun-policy-info/guns-and-crime-prevention/#:~:text=Fact%3A%20%E2%80%9CVictims%20who%20have%20and,or%20once%20every%2013%20seconds.

https://www.nssf.org/articles/cdc-isnt-following-science-its-manipulating-it-for-gun-control/#:~:text=Kleck's%20study%20estimated%20defensive%20gun,year%20in%20the%20United%20States.

Now that doesn’t mean as Americans we need to settle for mass shootings so here’s my solutions: 

1) required yearly training for all gun owners similar to Switzerland. Training will be mandatory for every gun owner every year to keep their license. 

2) required mental health check ups just like physical health check ups twice a year. Realistically this isn’t just about guns but it will definitely help. Our country just like the world is facing a mental health crisis so required mental health check ups will help weed out unsuitable owners from background checks when you’re of age to purchase.  The goal here is to weed out those with homicidal tendencies, schizophrenia, bipolar or other mental illnesses that induce hallucinations, mania or psychosis. Many mass shooters have a combinations of mental health issues but we need a guaranteed way at having a chance to ge for them before they get there. 

The two videos below highlight the many mental health illnesses both the Aurora shooter and the Sandy Hook shooter had. 

https://youtu.be/A-J5yNtwo7A?si=306fcpS6ZEQWlWwa

https://youtu.be/M4YpnKBn8ok?si=Q3s9YfNT5pUGrGIy

For people to actually go to these mental health check ups América will need to address Big Pharma to ensure they don’t over medicate us Americans like they already are. Just one simple stat on this, “Americans consume approximately 80% of the world's opioid supply, yet only account for 4.6% of the world's population”.

https://dhhr.wv.gov/bms/BMS%20Pharmacy/Documents/DUR/Dur%20Newsletters/NewsletterChronicPain.pdf

Big Pharma needs to stop being able to advertise on television and we need all harmful drugs to be taken off the market.  We need to take a wholistic approach here where talk therapy as well as support groups are a first line of treatment followed by supplements and then medications as the third and final line if needed. 

We just need to be able to trust the health care system so we can use it. 

Simultaneously this will also address the suicide epidemic which is the leading cause of death for men under 50. 

https://headsupguys.org/suicide-stats-men/




3) Reopen our psych wards to treat those who need help. As we build out our mental health care we should have mental health hospitals to support those in need. 

No state should be closing any facilities.  In the past 18 years, 22 states have closed 62 state psychiatric units which is a 24% reduction in overall units, yet our population has grown exponentially. 


https://www.nri-inc.org/media/1111/2015-tracking-the-history-of-state-psychiatric-hospital-closures-lutterman.pdf

This is simply backwards.

I know in the past there’s been lots of human rights violations in psych wards but times are different now and we do have cameras.  

4)American has a serious gang issue and that is responsible for a lot of the masa shootings. To stop this we need to stop people from entering our country illegally. This will also take power away from the cartel. 

When I say the gang problem is bad I mean it’s really bad we even have a Native American gang.

5)We need to invest in poorer neighborhoods by building community centers and investing in low cost sports like soccer, baseball, tennis, etc.  Also created support groups for young boys in single mother homes and support groups for practically anything from porn addiction to schizophrenia at the state level will be a great resource for young people who need emotional support as well as guidance. 

For a young boy suffering with a mental health illness like bipolar i’m sure seeing a grown man with the same diagnosis once in his position would give him hope and actually help him in life. 


6)Gun free zones need to be guarded! For god sakes the reason why people choose schools, malls, theaters, etc. is because they aren’t guarded. 

Federal law should be passed requiring the architecture of these buildings to include multiple barriers to entry (meaning you have two doors to enter - many places already have these but it’s pointless without metal detectors and the ability to lock them) as well as metal detectors.  In addition, every gun free zone should be guarded. 

7)no one and I mean no one should be issued a gun until a background check comes back. Private sales need to go through a background check as much as we can including at gun shows and a federal law needs to be passed that even if you’re over that 3 day threshold you still have to wait for the background check to come back.  Some states already have laws on this but not all.

8) social media platforms need to change the algorithm to stop radicalizing people.  By prioritizing  platform usage you create some radical folks like the guy in the Charleston Church shooting. Those with untreated mental illnesses are especially susceptible to this.

Conclusion: 

The mass shootings as well as suicide are just symptoms of deeper problems. They are indicators of gaps in our society and systems.  

We just need our public servants to step up and be proactive.  At this point it’s just crisis after crisis.  We haven’t even managed social media and now AI is here. Bring in the term limits for congress and house of reps, stop lobbying, and stop then all from being able to invest. Every public servant should have to have to take a cognitive test to run for any position.  
At this point I think RFK Jr. is the right person for the job.

I’m probably a slightly below average, mid 20’s male. And I’ve had relationships and hookups before, although my success has massively decreased the last 2-3 years or so.

And in the last couple years, I’ve been very close with a girl who lives in another country. We speak/call everyday (and have done for 2 years), get on really well, same sense of humour, care for each other when we’re not well, and have even done sexual things on the phone multiple times.  

But the only thing stopping us from being together in my opinion, is she doesn’t consider me a “high value man”. Because we’ve been so close, I’ve always been too open and honest with her, and there’s been times where I’ve admitted to her that girls around where I live don’t really fancy me or find me attractive, and I told her that I’m not speaking to any other girls apart from her, because I didn’t feel like I have any options around here.   

And I believe me revealing that information to her was the worst thing I could have ever done. Why?  

Because I feel like women want a man that can attract the interest of other women. Obviously they don’t want you to cheat on them, but they want the feeling of other girls staring at your man when you walk past them, and they know that THEY’VE got you, and the others can’t have that. If she’s dating a man that no one else wants, or finds attractive, I don’t think that interests her at all, and I feel like she might even question if she even finds him attractive, given that nobody else seems too.  

So yeah, I revealed to her a while ago that I struggle with girls locally, and since then (at the start of our speaking she seemed a lot more into me than now) she’s never really given me the impression that she wants to be with me AT ALL. And she’s even met other guys during the 2 years who she considered hot and interesting (probably the high value guys I’m speaking about in this post). And I’m not bothered about her seeing other people btw if anyone was confused about that, since we aren’t in a relationship, and I have seen a couple people in the 2 years we’ve been speaking, but not many as I don’t have many options tbh.  

But regardless, do you guys agree with what I’m saying? I feel like a women wants a man who she feels like she needs to work for, like she needs to put in effort to keep him, otherwise he could leave for someone else. If she’s with a man that she KNOWS couldn’t cheat, and would never leave her, she’s not excited as she’s already won the battle."

We have all sorts of eligibility requirements for candidacy, and I believe one that is lacking at the moment is that one must be able to pass the screening process for Top Secret security clearance.  POTUS is granted access to virtually all intelligence and information that we possess as a nation, so to me it stands to reason that they should only be allowed to hold that office if they meet the screening requirements that any non-elected worker would have to clear in order to hold a job that includes similar access.  

Otherwise, what we're essentially saying is ""as long as this person is charismatic and politically savvy enough to get voters to give them the thumbs-up, it doesn't matter if they're otherwise grossly unqualified to be trust with access to our most highly guarded secrets"".  That strikes me as dangerous.

I am aware that the process for obtaining this clearance is usually a bit of a long one, but given that elections are only once every four years, I don't think this is an undue burden.

1,2024-02-18,"CMV: All the advice commonly given to incels and lonely men do not work, but doing the opposite does.",u/Specialist_Mess4044,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1auahjq/cmv_all_the_advice_commonly_given_to_incels_and/,changemyview,"Now first off, I am not an incel.  But I am a lonely guy who can't get a girlfriend, but don't assume I hate women or whatever.  Take that somewhere else.  And no, this post is not to shit on women or something.  I love women a lot.  And this is not to prove that looks beat personality, but rather a shitty personality beats a ""good"" one.  


When incels and lonely guys go online and vent their frustrations about not being able to find a girlfriend, they are typically spammed with the same generic dating advice.  It can be summed up to the following points: Be yourself, work on yourself, join clubs, work on your hobbies, be nice to women, be funny, be kind, have a positive outlook on life, be happy with yourself, listen to girls, go to therapy, and most importantly: fix your personality.  Essentially, most people believe the main reason why these people can't get girlfriends is because of their personality.  If you don't believe me, go google ""reddit i am sad because i can't get a girlfriend"" and read the comments.

I used to fall for this advice.  I took every bit, and tried to ""fix"" my personality.  Guess what?  I am still alone!  So I wanted to put to the test if that shitty advice would ever work, so I joined a discord server revolving around making friends with two accounts.  One account was of a guy who took all the typical dating advice.  He has so many hobbies, is very funny, is cheerful, listens, is a member of clubs, is interesting in general, and the second account is of this guy with a dark past, he speaks in an edgy hostile way, is aggressive, mean, and offensive.  The good personality guy had a fun looking profile picture of a cute cat, while the bad personality guy had an edgy eboy anime pic.

In this server, there is a channel dedicated to new members introducing themselves, so I allowed my two little babies to introduce themselves to the world.  The guy with the perfect personality had his intro as being cheerful, upbeat, descriptive, with lots of jokes, while the second guys one was short, hostile, and mainly just rambling about all the ""dark things"" he has done in the past, and how he hates everyone.  

Within literally 15 minutes of me posting them, I as the bad personality guy got THREE dms from girls trying to comfort me, trying to find out about my past, trying to tell me its okay, and offering to my friend because I ""need one"".  Did the good personality guy get any DMs?  NO.

In the main chat channel of the server, I had both of them talking.  As a good personality guy asking questions, trying to get to know people, and making jokes, I was constantly insulted and rejected by both genders.  People would not include me with their conversations, or straight up tell me to leave them alone.  I asked why, and one literally told me ""because you don't have game"".  As the dark past guy?  I went in there being extremely hostile and edgy, and no one told me to shut up and let me join in on their conversations, and everyone listened while i was talking about my made up dark past, all while telling all of them that I hate humanity and how no one will be able to fix me.

So with those girls who DM'd me?  I talked to them in a fucking boring way, while being off putting to them.  Despite this, they would basically lead the conversation.  Within a day of talking to me, they ""felt comfortable venting to me"", and would tell me all about their problems.  They would also compliment me, and promise me that they would always be here for me, and that I could forgive myself for my past.  They even called me ""funny"".  One literally told me they were starting to feel ""attached"" to me.

I DM'd all three as the good personality guy, making jokes and being cool, and guess what?  They didn't put any effort into the conversation, would ghost me, and one blocked me.  Also all of these girls were in their 20s, so you can't say ""oh they are just teens"".  They are adults, just like you and me.

This proves right here that personality is not the problem that incels and lonely guys have.  If anything, trying to ""fix"" their personality will actually lower their chances if anything  And let's examine the structure of telling these people to ""fix their personality"".  First off, it's basically an insult.  You can't fix a personality because its shaped by you, your experiences, and your upbringing.  Telling someone to fix that is like saying ""youre just an asshole and thats clearly the reason why you cant get a gf"".  Even then, when these people tell these guys to fix their personality, they are under the quite stupid assumption that these guys walk up to these girls spouting off incel and asshole rhetoric, when most of these people are just shy and nice.  While they may be vocal on the internet, you must realize that how people act on the internet is not how they act irl.  

Personality is not the answer.  And I actually agree with the girls who did find the good personality loathesome.  Who wants to be with someone who ""has it all together"" and has no spice to them?  They find the bad personality guy more interesting because they want to fix him.  He seems like forbidden fruit.  Yeah he's an asshole, but these girls will justifiy ""oh its just his trauma"".  The good personality guy may be funny, but he's boring and tbh gives off the impression of a weak man.  I think that's why so many girls talk about how they want a kind, funny, and gentle man, but still end up dating assholes.  It's true, girls like bad boys, and there's nothing wrong with that.  If I was a girl, I'd date a bad boy.

I want someone to prove me wrong despite all of the evidence I have presented.  Please be civil.  Any insulting comments towards me will be ignored.  I will listen to all arguments.

1. He was strongly opposed to a national bank which contributed to the financial Panic of 1837.
2. He nominated personal acquiatences to cabinet positions they were unqualified for.
3. I can look past his ownership of slaves due to historical relativism, but he banned the sharing of anti-slavery literature in Southern states which violates the 1st Amendment and tried, unsuccessfully, to ban it nationwide.
4. The elephant in the room is the Trail of Tears. Jackson ignored the Supreme Court's decision which claimed the Indian Removal act was Unconstitutional and forced Natives off of their land and into reservations. Many of them were subjected to harsh conditions from weather and disease which led to over 13,000 deaths.

His biggest accomplishments that I will give him credit for will be eliminating property/wealth requirements to be allowed to vote and paying off the national debt, but I don't think that saves his reputation overall. 

I have no issues at all with him being removed from the $20 bill in the near-future."
1,2024-02-18,CMV: Christian Salvation depends upon the unknown content within the mind of Jesus Christ,u/brian_heriot,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aucozh/cmv_christian_salvation_depends_upon_the_unknown/,changemyview,"According to **Pantheopsychic Christianity,** the saved are externally-existing doppelgangers of dream-characters in the mind of Jesus Christ as He was in the process of being crucified, in an eons-long non-lucid dream in which He suffered, in the form of these characters (believing He was these characters) every negative experience the external doppelgangers of the characters will have from birth to death plus those negative experiences the external doppelgangers are spared due to the edited version of the Christ's crucified dream, called alternately and interchangeably the Sacrificial Dream and The Hell of Crucifixion--wrought by the Lucid Dreamer in His effort to lessen, ameliorate, and even prevent events in the Sacrificial Dream the God-Substance allows in the Revised Hell of Crucifixion---the plane of existence in which we dwell and now experience until biological death.

  
As Paul states in the New Testament:

  
""It does not depend, therefore, upon your desire or effort, but upon God's mercy.""  
\-Romans 9:16

  
Pretty cut and dried, isn't it?

  
A Pantheopsychic amendment to the statement would be:

  
""It does not depend, therefore, upon your desire or effort...but upon whether or not Christ dreamed He was you and suffered all your future negative experiences and committed all your ""sins"" in His mind while dying on the Cross, eons before you were born and forced by the God-Substance to replicate part of the content of that Dream.""

  
That is, if Pantheopsychic Theism and Christianity is true and all.

  
The true test, one may surmise, is the existence of your belief in the objective truth of Pantheopsychic theism, as this indicates that one is indeed a doppelganger of a dream-character Christ was in the Crucifixion, and that Christ experienced being you before you were born, which according to Pantheopsychic Christianity is the way one is ""written into the Book of Life"", the ""Book of Life"" being not a supernatural book in Heaven opened in the Final Judgment, but the mind of Christ Himself.  
Being ""written"" in the ""Book of Life"" means, if Pantheopsychic theology is true, appearing in the mind of Christ such your identity was made known to Him prior to your birth, in the sense that He experienced being you in the non-lucid dream.  Idealism means only persons exist; Theistic Idealism means that everything occurs in the mind of God; Pantheopsychic Idealism means that everything that occurs in the mind of God in one of three personalities or incarnations is infallibly replicated in His unconscious mind, wherein we dwell and are and can only be re-enactors of the content in the mind of our ""Stephen King"", the Judeo-Christian God.

  
Your salvation, therefore, depends not on you, but on whatever was going on in Christ's mind.

Also not small towns that are within like an hour of the city.

I rarely pass through small towns so I will admit I have limited exposure to them, and I see how someone can view me as prejudiced or biased. If I am wrong please correct me. I am also aching to hear different perspectives.

I don’t think small towns are good to raise children at all. Especially when they become teens. 

**REASONS**: 

- Less cultured people: Many people in small towns have never left their town and gone to places with different people. I would not be surprised if that was a majority.

- No opportunity: Less jobs, if there is there is a good chance that it is a factory or job that caps at a certain point.

- Lack of a good culture: mid food, dying town because small towns are dying, racism, culture of excellence lacking, all contribute.

- Teens hate it: Majority of teens I talk to (online and in person) wanna get out. Also they sometimes have no idea how to socialize, but that varies from household to household. Just less than other kids.

- Drugs: Rampant in lots of small towns, people start early.

- Crime: People always say small towns have less crime, but that’s not even always true. There’s lazy police who don’t report it. 

- Bad schools: Small towns cost less and people don’t need to make as much in small towns. Less taxpayer money leads to bad school options.

- Less smart people: Not even born that way, just dulled by other people to be not curious and not intellectual.

- No one wants to stay: Young people hate it.

- Nothing to do: Hobbies and other things only mean so much with an unstimulating  environment 

- Racism and lack of diversity

- Move to cities and get so shocked by the culture

- People are nosy

- If you’re in poverty you have no public benefits or way to dig yourself out.

Yeah that’s basically it. If you need to ask me to clarify something I will. 

Please give me new perspectives!

Imagine the US with free universal healthcare and you need to see, for example, an ophthalmologist because you’re seeing floaters in one eyeball. Now if we all have the same health coverage and at no premium costs or copays, how quick do you think you’ll be able to get an appointment with this specialist (hoping it’s within a timely matter as to ensure you’re not gonna totally lose vision in the one eye shortly)? Let’s say you finally get an appointment booked…..but it’s months out due to the lack of practicing doctors anymore. Because why would doctors go through all that education and med school and pay off all these loans to get to MD…if they’re only gonna make a significant amount of profit less than they would have if people’s private insurance companies were agreeing to pay doctors higher in their fees for service? It won’t make financial sense or ethical sense considering they’d also be seeing double or triple more patients in a day than they would before due to lack of practitioners. 
Imagine you’re running a daycare and you’re the only place in 50 mile radius that’s still running, so you’ve got to watch way more kids than you can possibly handle. The effect? The more kids you’re responsible for, the less necessary attention you’re able to provide each child. Some kids will have poop in the pants for hours before you can get to them, others will be hiding in a corner eating something that isn’t food, and the rest of the kids will be screaming or fighting and you can’t tackle all these problems at once!! Same with doctors. The more patients they’re overwhelmed with, the poorer the quality of each of those patients’ care. 

People will downvote me for this comment but….healthcare/insurance is a PRIVILEGE not a human right. You want an appointment in a timely manner, with a top rated physician that’ll be giving you all the time you need to assess your health concerns and provide you the best treatment possible? Then invest in a decent enough health insurance. Better care is more money. Docs gotta pay bills too! Yea it’s expensive as shit, but this is your fricken life we’re talking about and if you know you need a lot of medical care, get a good plan. Preferably not an HMO. Treat yourself and your doctors to a lovely PPO or similar. 

To sum it up and make it simpler, ask yourself this:
“Would you like to do way more work, make much less money, and accept your services as lower quality than what they’re actually capable of?”

**Edited to say this is coming from a 30 year old female in the US and has been working in healthcare for 10 years, as well as health insurance billing and enrolling many eligible Americans in health plans offered by the state’s marketplace (aka Medicaid). 

ALSO, I happen to be one of those in the working class who do NOT qualify for state assisted Medicaid and so I choose to pay for the HIGHEST cost for the best PPO health plan offered to me through my employer and with the insurance provider they’re contracted with. So I’ve been on both sides of the insurance spectrum both personally and when helping patients. **

Prepared to hear a lot of bull poop from people who believe we should all be responsible to pay more taxes  to achieve the same healthcare for all….and while being totally fine with screwing over the medical professionals who we are TRUSTING WITH OUR LIVES!! Cmon now people, grow a brain or try making an appt with a psych in a country where everyone has same coverage. Good luck. 🍀"

Justin Trudeau really strikes a chord with a lot of folks because he's out there fighting for what feels right – equality, taking care of our planet, and making sure everyone's got a fair shot, for better or worse. It's like he genuinely cares about making Canada a place where everyone feels at home, and you can see that passion in his actions. I don't see any other leader re-writing decades of grief and embracing ostracized cultures in a multinational world.

  
Then there's Pierre Poilievre, who seems to be all about calling out Trudeau, trying to stir up emotions without really putting his own heart on the line. It's like, where's the passion for making things better, you know? Just feels like he's playing the blame game rather than getting down to business. Awesome strategy, keep saying how the other guy is bad without ever mentioning realistic approaches to fix issues in any sensible time frame.

  
It's the vibe Trudeau brings – hope and a sense of moving forward together – thats really important. Sure, he's not perfect, nobody is, but you can feel he's trying to do something good and that he is not comprising on his values.

1,2024-02-18,CMV: The apparent shift towards entitlement and anti-work attitudes in Western societies is a valid concern for the sustainability of social welfare policies.,u/AteloAristotle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aueio4/cmv_the_apparent_shift_towards_entitlement_and/,changemyview,"As someone who typically supports liberal social, and economic policies, I find myself increasingly concerned about a perceived shift in attitudes within Western populations. A [2011 paper](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/362/you-owe-me-examining-a-generation-of-entitlement) from the Inquiries Journal encapsulates this idea very well.

>""Once upon a time, in a land called America, people truly believed in a capitalist system. Citizens worked hard their entire lives to feed into their 401-K plans and expected that depending on how the economy went, they may profit from their work. They did not depend on the American government to take care of everything for them; in fact, they had a great sense of personal responsibility. Other countries, such as France and Britain, have experienced a high burden being placed upon their governments over these decades due to their citizens believing in a cradle-to-grave system in which from the time they are born to their death they can rely on the government to fund their welfare, and upon retirement age, they will have everything they are “entitled” to handed to them on a silver platter.  
>  
>It appears now, that our country may be leaning more and more toward this mentality. With each generation, we begin to see a growing entitlement mindset. If this trend continues, America too will soon feel the same weight as those European countries have for generations, and our country may go bankrupt. Why is the country turning to this mentality? How can it be prevented?""

I believe that since 2011, Western society, especially the U.S., has made considerable strides toward this ""new"" attitude.

It appears that many individuals are becoming more entitled, even in the face of limited resources and personal struggles. In the last few years, as far as I can see, there seems to be a decline in motivation and work ethic among a significant portion of the population. Moreover, there's a noticeable emphasis on individualism over collectivism, even within families. Anti-work sentiments seem to be gaining traction, which raises questions about the long-term sustainability of social welfare policies. This entitlement has always existed in some ways which has led to the very establishment of the idea of ""broken families"" in the West, which includes, but is not limited to, single-parent households (either due to divorce or preference for adoption over biological children), rising childhood adversities (such as due to parents being involved in drug use, parents prioritizing their retirement life over their children's future, parents kicking their children out of their homes at 18, and psychological stressors on children and young adults due to parents being involved in infidelity or having multiple partners). However, now it seems that this entitlement is rising at even larger levels and is sometimes captured by the expression of ""generational entitlement"".

Given these observations, I'm compelled to question whether advocating for the harder-working and successful segment of the population to shoulder a disproportionate burden through increased taxes and contributions to support those who may not share the same level of motivation or work ethic is justifiable. I believe this approach would exacerbate class tensions and demotivate the more productive members of society.

I'm open to considering alternative perspectives, but I'm struggling to reconcile these concerns with my usual support for progressive policies. Can someone change my view or offer insights into addressing these societal shifts?"

First thing, I guess it's islamphobic to assume that a Muslim dude with a huge beard, with questionable beliefs and etc is more likely to be a terrorist. But for some reason it's kinda fine and okay to assume if a person doesn't ""look gay"" (whatever it means). Like, how does that work? I heard a lot about those social workers or whatever just literally look at how you look to tell if you're gay or not.

Secondly, I wasn't researching about it a lot, but I bet that there are more literal terrorists among those Muslims who are seeking for an asylum, than there are ""fake gays"" among those gays who are seeking for an asylum. I believe there was this recent shit in Belgium or something where they admitted that there are some terrorists in their country, but ""legally they can't do anything"" that is already stupid and redicilous.

Like, can we not have this double standards and just fucking treat every type of refugee similarly? Either let everyone in or not let anyone in. It just frustrates me a lot as a gay guy who lives in Russia and has never had a proper relationships, not being able to live a normal and fulfilling life as a human being and etc. I contacted rainbow railways like almost 2 months ago and well, they don't really care I guess, no response whatsoever."

1.) Divorce

2.) Roomate Situation: Romance dies, sex dies, people stop being lovers.

3.) Lovers: The spark is kept alive until old age.

&#x200B;

Most marriages fall into #1 and #2. Around 50% of people get divorced (in some countries it's even higher). If 50% of people get divorced and 50% stay together. Out of those 50% who stay together I would say 40% stay together because they HAVE to. They stay together for financial reasons (divorce is expensive) or they stay together for religious reasons (divorce is a sin). Or they stay together for the kids. But there is no romance and no sex, usually both the romance dies and the sexlife dies, so they live as roomates. They either resent each other or become platonic friends and no longer lovers.

From what I have observed, half of people get divorced, 30% to 40% who stay together become roomates and stop being lovers, and less than 20% keep the spark alive, less than 20% remain lovers until death.

If you had to jump off a bridge and there was a 50% change of dying, a 30% to 40% chance of breaking all your ribs, and a less than 20% chance of winning $1,000 would you jump? Would you do it? I wouldn't, nobody would.

I am in a 3 year relationship and sure I'm happy but marriage scares me to death. I want to be proven wrong, I really do. Marriage is a scam."

When they couldn’t make the same time I always gave them great benefit. But for the past year or so, I have become extremely busy to the point I have almost no time to just sit and decompress and i think it’s made me come to the realization that there are many people in my life who don’t deserve anything from me. The excuses about why they don’t have the time to speak, hang out, or assist me with things, but have no problem contacting me when they need something is clear. Now most of these people I don’t have to deal with and can easily distance myself from by blocking their numbers. But there’s one that I do see sometimes. 

This was someone I thought I related with and enjoyed talking to. Now it’s one thing not to want to connect with someone for any reason at all, but another to lead on the interaction and make someone look stupid. There were a few things over this time but the final straw was when they flaked on me on an important date, never apologized or even acknowledged it, and then when I brought it up later blamed it on me.

Now this person works at a gym I go/went to so I have to see them. They do the fake friend thing, and I’ve tried to be cordial but it just annoys me. Why not go to a different gym or a different time? This is the one closest to me and the time that works with my schedule is one they often work. I previously stopped going but it’s the only socialization I get. I’ve also tried to address the situation and come to an understanding but they just refuse to address their issue.

So in my mind, I don’t think I should be required to further inconvenience my life or time for the comfort of this person who brought the situation on themselves. 

I would like others to give their perspective and possibly cmv because maybe this is just stress"

If you check out Muhammed's history, you can see that he is not only a prophet, but also a politician. He is possibly did many war crimes against other beduinic tribes. Islam is an ideology about obeying to people who run religion. And obeying to Allah. I started to read Quran and Arabian Nights. And I see these books are like written by religious fanatics. Look at afghan women. How they could fight for their freedom if they are raised in Taliban ideology? They think it's their fate to be talibs's toys. Islam itself is fatalistic religion.

I believe the world could becime a better place without islam. Maybe we shouldn't eliminate Islam by force since it's wrong thing. After all, forcing to converse into atheism or another religion will make opposite results. I believe more in soft force."
191,2024-02-19,CMV: (high-speed) Train is generally the best method of travel for distances more than 200 kilometres/120 miles and less than 1000 kilometres/600 miles. ,u/Soyuz_1848,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aun2ok/cmv_highspeed_train_is_generally_the_best_method/,changemyview,"Part 1: Time

To ride a HST, you need 20 minutes to go to the train station, 20 minutes wait, and 20 minutes to get to destination after getting off. The ""extra"" time is 1 hour. Assume that the train has a top speed of 310 km/h and an average travel speed of 250 km/h. 

Travel time t=1+0.004x (x is distance)

To ride a plane with drop-off luggages, you need 0.75 hour to go to the faraway airport, arrive 1 hour in advance to drop off the luggage, and 0.5 hour to get off the plane and collect the luggage, and 0.75 hour after getting off the plane to go to the city center. Assume that the plane has a top speed of 900 km/h and an average travel speed of 670 km/h (the number is 670 because we're mainly talking about *short, domestic* flights and we need to account for taxi and landing. For long, international flights it should be 800~850) 

Travel time t=3+0.0015x. 

For car, assume an average travel speed of 80 km/h, t=0.0125x. 

For distances less than 800 kilometres, the train is actually faster than the plane. 

For distances more than 120 kilometres, the train is faster than the car. 

Part 2: Cost. 

G-class HST in China (my home country) costs ¥0.42/kilometer on average for a standard seat and the price is generally fixed.

For planes, the full fare is about ¥1.4/kilometer when tax is included, and the actual price is typically about ¥0.5~0.7/kilometer including taxes, but can be all the way up to full fare during peak season.

For cars, if you need 8 litres of gas per 100 km and the gas price is ¥8 per liter, the fuel cost is ¥0.56/kilometer. When we account for taking non-straight-line routes and highway fees, the travel cost is ¥1.1/km/car. 

The train is almost always cheaper than flights, and cheaper than cars if you're travelling alone or with only one partner, and comparable with cars when you have 3 people in your car. 

Part 3: Flexibility. 

Trains have generally fixed prices and you don't need to track prices and plan early on. Date and train changes are free. Flexibility is almost comparable to car travel. 

Planes are nightmarish. Fluctuations in prices, frequent delays, low flexibility. 

Part 4: Comfort. 

In a train you just chill and do whatever you want. Plenty of legroom. Free wifi provided. 

Im a plane... No internet, no legroom, cramped place, sometimes smelly. 

In a car it's technically comfortable but you have to drive for yourself. You can't do anything else while driving. 

Even if you don't need to drive the car you may still get motion sickness, but you won't get sick in a smooth train. 

Train hands-down beats the other two in this aspect. 

In summary, rail travel beats air travel in all four aspects, and beats car travel in time, cost and comfort while only losing to car in flexibility, by a small margin. 

Thus, train travel is the best method of travel for distances between 200 and 1000 km, except for a few cases where flexibility is absolutely needed, or you need to consider factors other than the ride itself (like fetching an important guest), when the car is a better alternative. When it's really off-peak and plane tickets are dirt cheap, planes might be better. But generally trains are the best options. "

1,2024-02-19,"CMV: The concept of ""non-binary"" is regressive and reinforces sexism and homophobia.",u/Dyl4nDil4udid,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1auo0u0/cmv_the_concept_of_nonbinary_is_regressive_and/,changemyview,"Why I want to change my view: the concept of ""non-binary"" is not going anywhere any time soon and rather than be perpetually annoyed by it, I'd rather make peace with it and understand it.

Yet, this is very difficult for me to do for the following reasons: I believe it reinforces sexism and homophobia. 

The premise behind being non-binary is that due to not adhering to male or female gender roles or believing that they are personally represented by the societal constructs of masculinity and femininity, some people identify as a completely different gender altogether from man/woman. 

Why I believe this is sexist: we fought long and hard to get to a place in society where men can express themselves in a more feminine way and women in a more masculine way without stigma or judgment, and now the mantra is ""if you do not adhere to society's expectations of what a man is or what a woman is, you're not a man or a woman."" This means that, once again, to be a woman one must be dainty, feminine, paint her nails, wear pink and men must play sports, be rough and rugged, and be aggressive. While gender ideology has not yet infected all of society, in progressive/liberal/university settings, this view is commonplace. Now, I admit no one is STOPPING men from being feminine or women from being masculine, they are simply told that doing so makes them not a man or a woman, which again ties one's manhood or womanhood to societal constructs that no one adheres to perfectly, so not only is it sexist but impractical. It feels like we are in the 1950s again, except this time we have an ""other"" category for people who are insufficiently masculine or feminine. 

Instead, we should embrace that men and women can behave, dress, and express themselves any way they desire and are still men and women. Why isn't this the goal instead?

Why I believe this is homophobic: as a gay man who has mostly gay male friends, gay men and lesbian women are known for gender-nonconformity. While not everyone decides to buck society's expectations of what a man or a woman does, many of us do. If a ""man"" is someone who adheres to the expectations of a man set by society and identifies strongly with this and a ""woman"" does the opposite, are gay men and lesbians not men and women? The very oppression we faced for many years was grounded at least in part by this notion, that gay men are inferior men and lesbian women inferior women, because we reject many of society's premises set for us and chose our own path. For me, I have zero intention of marrying a woman, having children, and being what society says a ""man"" is. Yet I AM a man. A gay man. The ideology behind ""non-binary"" would tell me I am not a man, and indeed, many gender ideologues I personally know have pressured me to identify as non-binary since the term became popular. 

And then there are other people who do not change anything about their presentation and continue to dress and present as their sex, but with different pronouns.. at this point, why, if not making a political statement?

One song lyric I like by one of my favourite MC's that i think sums up cancel culture is as follows: ""whole lot of right, add a little bit of wrong and everything you worked for, gone""

I think cancel culture does more harm than good as it doesn't give the person who got cancelled to learn from their mistakes. It also limits conversations and discourse. It makes other people afraid to speak in case they get cancelled

Cancelled people get treated like lepers by others. Depending on the severity of the situation I think this is more to do with the fact that people are afraid of their own image and being affiliated by them in any way. 

There are better ways to punish a person by cancelling them "
1,2024-02-19,CMV: Consciousness is not just the by product of the brain.,u/always_and_for_never,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1auqfcs/cmv_consciousness_is_not_just_the_by_product_of/,changemyview,"I am dismayed by the many ""cop out"" explanations that I've seen people use to explain consciousness and so I will offer my own view on the subject with hopes of sincere and meaningful rebuttal. 

When asked by a typical materialist what constitutes consciousness, they immediately like to jump to easy answers. Even if there's no proof for the materialist view they March along singing the same verses over and over without much thought at all.

Yes, yes you are the result of a complex process of blah blah blah blah blah.... but does that feel like a satisfying answer to you? It doesn't to me. I may be wrong but this is my own belief.

The you that you identify with, the thing that you cannot describe in any detail yet have such an intimate and inseparable relationship with is like a particle with its many strange properties. The particular property of the particle I'm referring to is wave function collapse, popularized by the famous ""Double Slit"" experiment. Wave function collapse is the behavior that a photon exhibits when it is not being ""measured"" or ""observed"" by an ""observer"". I put these words into quotes because depending on which quantum physicist you ask, you will get a different answer as to what these words mean. 

The jest of the experiment is this; If you shoot a photon and it is observed or measured, it behaves like a bullet aka ""particle"". However, if the photon is not measured, it behaves like a wave. The significance here is that in particle form, the state of the photon is determined and has measurable properties such as spin, momentum, etc. However, when the photon behaves like a wave, it is in what is called a ""superposition"" of states. Meaning that the photon exists in every possible state it could ever be measured in all at once, infinitely so. 

It is my belief that life and death are very much like the collapse and determined states of the photon. Before we are ""born"" we exist in a state of superposition. We are in every state of consciousness all at once, infinitely so. When we are born, we get a chance to express and condense our consciousness down into a singular form. This form is only one of an infinite number of states of consciousness that you could have wound up being. You are in this state throughout your life, until you collapse back into the infinite consciousness at the time of death.

It is important to note, that while in this state of infinite consciousness, the subject would have no fixed frame of reference from which to determine what their situation would be while in this state. The closest you could come to experiencing such a state would be to violently shake your head in all directions, while trying to observe what's going on around you with sound proof ear plugs in. If your were watching a play while performing this act, you wouldn't be able to recall what the play was about whatsoever if you were asked describe it. 

This is why when people ask silly questions like ""If I existed before I was born, why can't I remember any of it?"". Aside from the obvious fact that you don't have a brain to even attempt to store some of this information before you are born, you simply wouldn't be able to process so much information with such a limited brain in the first place. 

CMV

NOTE: An interesting question to ask here would be, ""If we're like a particle behaving in its determined / condensed form, who is observing and measuring us?"""

Hi I'm not here looking for advice or insight about relationships but to actually get some perspective on a question my nephew asked me

So yesterday my nephew asked me, ""what if my girlfriend and I got into a bad argument and she left the house in the middle of the night, heads over to a bar,gets blackout drunk,is taken by four guys to a motel and gets rapped and wakes up the next day alone in the motel,how would I react""

Now I gave him my honest and answer and told him I would break up with her not because she was rapped, but because everything that happened was avoidable

To begin with if her and I got into a bad argument,I wouldn't let her leave the house,I would offer her to stay and for me to leave if she really doesn't want to be around me just so I can have a peace of mind knowing she's safe at home

Secondly right after the argument she made the conscious decision to go to the bar,a place she knows has a high risk of danger 

To add on she also decided to drink to the point she blacked out and there were many different ways she could have responded that would be far more reasonable and less of a danger to her

And I get it,she was clouded by emotion but honestly my take on the matter is you can't make important decisions based of emotions and yes many thoughts and decisions do require emotional imput but I think it's important to weigh the logical aspect of your decision making process with your emotional aspect to find some common ground 

And thirdly she decided to go alone and didn't even let anyone know where she was going, if she would have brought someone with her atleast the person could have watched over her and if she would atleast let her friends know where she is they would well atleast know about her whereabouts

But my nephew just called me a demonic insensitive monster

And the second question he asked me was(this is in a different scenario) ""what if she and her friends were out,they were all sober and everything was fine and on her way home she was rapped and latter on we find out she's pregnant but due to her religious beliefs she doesn't want to get an abortion and even if she wanted to,how would I respond to that""

And I honestly didn't have a answer for that question it was a little more complicated than the first one

Would my response to the first question really be a bad thing and does it make me a bad person and how would you respond to the second question ⁉️"

There are some pictures and situations where Israeli troops are shown coordinating evacuations and people movement. But as far as I can tell - they are relying on Hamas to still manage medical care and often just telling people broad areas to flee to. 

It makes no sense for Israel to be offloading this care to an organization that they repeatedly emphasize (accurately) is horrible and using civilians for cover. First of all, a terrorist organization isn't going to be the best for caring for Gazans. Keep in mind the IDF is accusing Hamas of shooting at civilians. Secondly, the more Hamas is involved - the greater opportunity they have to use hospitals and civilian camps to hide. Managing care will help lead to better outcomes for civilians and allow the IDF to collect intelligence/ truly ensure that it's only Hamas being bombed.

I can't help but think that the reason the IDF doesn't do this is that they:

1. Don't care enough about civilians to provide the urgent care and services needed 

2. Don't really mind a degree of collective punishment and know that if they are coordinating civilians there's less excuse for accidents"

Navalny however, didn't have the same level of ""patriotism"" that Epstein did.

Navalny's death may have a greater impact, as do many martyrs deaths, but Epstein could have overhauled the corruption in mere hours. Navalny's death may even do more to change Russian politics than if he had lived. This is why Epstein's death was a greater crime against people. His death was celebrated, and swept under the rug... so the crimes against humanity will not come to light, but carry on."

I don't mean ""men are evil creatures should be forced into camps and deprived of porn and exercise so they have to kill each other to get satisfaction"" vs. ""Women are evil creatures and it's up to men to punish them."" There's a big difference there- one belief was acted on the other has only ever been a disgusting fantasy. 

I'm talking about other things. A woman talking about beating up her partner vs a man talking about beating up his partner. Women and men are both victims of domestic violence, and the gap based on what I've seen is not large. But a joke where the man is a victim might get a ""yeah that's not really funny"" while a joke where the woman is a victim might get a ""disgusting misogynist."" Both reactions are disapproving, but one is a lot more intense than the other. It seems feminists almost view misandry as understandable but misplaced anger and misogyny as a horrible entity that needs to be eradicated.

Most jobs I see are based on businesses selling software services to other businesses in a never ending loop. I'm pretty sure that if we followed a trail of the customers of many businesses and their customers, you'd end up in a loop where businesses feed themselves, with very few actually producing value. The few that produce value being the only ones that actually are providing anything to the loop.

I think the only companies producing anything of real worth are the ones making software directly used by people or companies not of the software industry. So, for example, professional music making software might used mostly by professional musicians and music companies provide value. Those providing services only to other software businesses do not.

Also, I think that some parts of companies can be a mix of bloat and value. Microsoft provides a lot of consumer software, but a large part of its Azure offering is part of the loop that doesn't create any real value.

The systemic racism and segregation enforced by Jim Crow laws demonstrated a model of institutionalized oppression based on race, which, I argue, provided a framework that the Nazi Party adapted and intensified into their own racial policies and ultimately, the Holocaust.

The Nazis didn't just stumble upon the idea of racial purity and segregation; they were inspired by the American example. Hitler himself is noted to have expressed admiration for the way the United States had managed its racial issues, viewing it as a precursor to his own plans for racial cleansing. The Nuremberg Laws, which laid the groundwork for the systemic persecution of Jews, can be seen as an iteration of Jim Crow laws, taken to a horrifying extreme.

Moreover, the Ku Klux Klan's reign of terror and its ideology of white supremacy did not go unnoticed by the Nazis. The Klan's methods of instilling fear and their use of propaganda to justify racial purity bear a disturbing resemblance to the tactics employed by the Nazis. This isn't to say that the Nazis directly copied the KKK's methods, but rather, they were inspired by the glimpse into what was possible when racism and bigotry were allowed to flourish unchecked by the state.

I acknowledge that this perspective is controversial and simplifies the complex factors that led to the rise of the Nazi Party, including post-World War I conditions in Germany, economic instability, and unique cultural factors. However, the parallels between America's racial policies of the early 20th century and the ideological underpinnings of the Nazi regime are too striking to dismiss outright."

Apple TV has killed it so far with SciFi.

Why do we continue to sensationalise this tormented woman's desperate life?

A voyeuristic body of work has grown up around her tragic tale. Wournos’s story has been used in a dozen documentaries and films, the most famous of which is 2003’s Monster, starring Charlize Theron. There are books, academic studies, umpteen podcasts, 10 songs and even an opera about Wuornos’s life and crimes. In fact, Broomfield’s first documentary about her, The Selling of a Serial Killer highlights the exploitation of Wuornos by those around her.

She’s a killer, but not a serial killer. It’s good for Hollywood to say she was the first. 

The latest addition to this sorry library is a book by US feminist academic and psychologist Phyllis Chesler entitled Requiem for a Female Serial Killer. Chesler was interested in Wuornos right from the get go: after hearing that Wuornos was planning on pleading self-defence, she called her up, thinking she could help.

As Chesler puts it: “I wanted a jury to hear the truth about how dangerous the ‘working life’ really is; how prostitutes are routinely infected with diseases, gang-raped, tortured, and murdered; and that Wuornos had been raped and beaten so many times that, by now, if she was at all human, she’d have to be permanently drunk and out of her mind.”

There are, though, some invaluable insights from Wuornos in Requiem, such as this extract from a letter she wrote to Chesler in February 1992 from her prison cell, following her conviction:

“I am a female who has been raped and the male dominant world is laughing. They’ve succeeded to putting me in the chair to prove that men can and will do as they want to us women of America.”

By reporting to a regulatory body first, users bypass a platform’s inherently flawed moderation system and helps ensure that the issue is addressed by authorities equipped to handle it.

I deleted the account, took the opportunity to process the rest of the remaining reports, notified Hetzner of the resolution and got on with my day.
  

Across all (3) listed examples, the underlying problem remained static: the social platform failed to effectively action or address illegal content in a tangible capacity. 
  
  
Reporting illegal content directly to regulatory bodies puts increased pressure on both the agencies to act and the platform itself by creating a situation where an agency investigator will work directly with the platform to address and handle the complaint. This also allows the agencies to track incident data that can either add credibility to the self-disclosure publications that are internally made or could be used to discredit or show discrepancies in self-reported data.

So many people are saying ""don't worry, our jobs aren't threatened by AI because companies will need artists"". Ok then explain why so many companies are laying off their employees after announcing their dependence on AI. 

How are we not supposed to be worried about this? 

And have you guys seen Instagram, DeviantArt, Artstation, and other websites where artists upload their work? They're full of ""AI artists"" and ""AI art"" who genuinely, wholeheartedly believe they actually put effort into creating art pieces. 

""AI art is flawed and can mistakes can easily be spotted"", ok but have you seen AI's evolution in the last few years? AI is evolving to the point where it can replicate reality. It's only a matter of time before AI movies and TV become a thing. 

So someone please change my view and tell me why I shouldn't be worried about AI taking over jobs requiring artists? "

1,2024-02-19,"CMV: The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is Unconstitutional, Violates Basic Freedoms, and Should Be Repealed",u/Training-Item-2741,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1av282j/cmv_the_civil_rights_act_of_1964_is/,changemyview,"**Primary Argument:**

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 (CRA of 1964) prohibits discrimination based on religion, sex, sexuality, and race in hiring and other business endeavors for both public and private companies. It's also made clear that discrimination is absolutely allowed where it matters, like when it concerns IQ for high level jobs, or sex for jobs like strippers etc. Nothing wrong with the government regulating public companies, but doing this for private companies violates the basic freedom of association and violates private property rights.

Consider this: If I own a trampoline, and I share that trampoline with all my male neighbors, and we all have a great time, but I absolutely refuse to share that trampoline with my female neighbors (in this hypothetical I would be a raging misogynist i suppose lol), should I be forced to share MY trampoline by the government and fined for discrimination? Most people, and also the law, would agree that I should not be forced to do anything concerning my private property. This is because of two principles that:

1) I have the freedom of association to associate with and also NOT associate with whomever I please for whatever reason. and

2) This freedom extends to my usage of private property, which I am allowed to use in any way that does not infringe on others' freedoms. 

As a matter of fact, ALL freedoms and rights are absolute, and apply to everyone in every case and situation with the ONLY exception being that it infringes on others' freedoms and/or rights. If anything, this only further evidences the absolutism of freedoms and rights, as they are only justified to be taken away in protection of other freedoms and rights. 

Now, as private companies are also private property, and thus are granted the same freedoms as individuals, prohibiting some forms of discrimination in the hiring of is a violation of both freedom of association and private property rights. Blatant infringement of basic freedoms.

The constitution limits the power of the government, and provides rules for the government. Freedom of speech, for example, means that the GOVERNMENT may not suppress free speech, but private companies totally can. That's what freedom of association means. This doubly invalidates the CRA of 1964, as:

1) While the government may not have the authority to discriminate amongst ""men who are made equal"" according to the constitution, private companies totally do have that right.

2) The freedom of association itself and alone renders the CRA of 1964 unconstitutional.

So, sure, it's not legally consistent, and violates the constitution, but why should it be repealed? Well, right off the bat, the fact that it violates the constitution and isn't legally consistent is reason enough. We cannot afford to have sham laws that don't abide by our own rules in a country that respects rule of law. Not only that, but it tramples all over the values that we stand for as a people, as previously explained in this post.

Even in a practical sense, however, the CRA of 1964 is prosecuted horribly. The prosecution in related cases ""proves"" that a certain company is unlawfully discriminatory by simply showing that the proportion of hires belonging to an identity group in the company don't match up with the proportion seen in the population. This should set off loud alarm bells in any reasonable persons head, as there is absolutely no causal link. Of course, in such cases, the defense will argue this, and will also say that there is no way to attribute inequality of outcome to unequal treatment, as ideological/circumstantial/biological differences exist between different groups of people. And this is absolutely true. So, it all comes down to what a judge or jury decides. Don't get me wrong, subjective decisions by judge and jury are often the best way to determine things like originality when it comes to copyright and intellectual property cases and such, but doing so in discrimination law suits where there are so many confounding variables that have been shown time and time again to be largely significant is short sighted and unfair.

**FAQ:** 

I organized this section by two parts, the first being about the constitutionality and legal consistency of CRA of 1964 and the second being whether or not it should be repealed. In both sections, I ordered them from worst questions to best questions, meaning that I got all the stupid stuff out of the way first, that midwits would say, and left the more substantive questions at the bottom. I know most of you guys wouldn't make any of the dumb arguments, but I put them there anyway as to not deal with annoying people. Keep in mind, I tried my level best to steel-man any opposing position, but if I missed anything, please comment/lmk.

&#x200B;

**Section 1:**

*""You're a racist/sexist/religious extremist/ (insert group) supremacist etc.!""*

\>>> This is a non argument. I'm a staunch supporter of judging people individually based on the content of their characters. Even if I was some evil monster bigot, this statement doesn't refute any of my points. It's just ad hominem.

*""But it's a law! You're not a lawyer, what do you know?""*

\>>> Again, non argument and appeal to authority fallacy. People who say this aren't willing to engage with the argument, either that, or they're unable to.

*""Racism/sexism/etc etc. should be illegal.""*

\> Nope. Those things are abhorrent and irrational, but violating freedom of association to criminalize them is also abhorrent and irrational. HATE CRIMES that directly hurt others are another topic, but just being racist/sexist/whatever else and not associating with any group of people is perfectly within our rights.

*""Freedoms only apply in certain situations.""*

\>>> I addressed this earlier, but the only situations where freedoms wouldn't apply are situations where they infringe on other rights/freedoms. Seeing as people have no rights or entitlements to other people's private property, it is unconstitutional to infringe on the freedom of association in this situation.

*""Companies are not private property""*

\>>> Just plain wrong. Maybe public companies are not private property, but private companies are, and the CRA of 1964 unconstitutionally also applies to private companies. Not only is it legally recognized as a normative truth, but even the Supreme Court ruled that companies have the freedom of association in NAACP vs. Alabama 1958. In this specific court case, it concerned the NAACP (national association for advancement of colored persons) freedom with whom TO associate, and I already know some idiots are gonna say that that doesn't extend to with whom NOT to associate, and sorry to break it to you but freedoms go both ways. Freedom of association includes both to associate with and choose not to associate with. Refer back to the trampoline example. Most damningly, the court case I mentioned itself also includes a boycott, which is the freedom to NOT associate. And boycotts are protected under constitutional law. Another potential way to undermine the aforementioned court case would be to say ""it only covers expressive freedoms of association."" Again, horrible misrepresentation. The court case was about the way that Alabama was in violation of the constitution in the way that a government infringed on a private company's freedom of association, and while the intent of the NAACP boycotts were, in fact expressive, the Supreme Court makes no distinction about freedom of association only applying in expressive scenarios. Again, you are allowed to not associate with anybody for any reason.

*""Government upholds private companies as institutions and thus should be allowed to play a role in how they conduct business.""*

\>>> The government doesn't ""uphold"" private companies any more than they uphold private property. The fact that a government exists and acts doesn't undermine the authority of freedoms and private property rights. Does the fact that the government protects your body in the case of a potential assault or rape or something else, thus protecting your bodily autonomy give them authority to infringe on your bodily autonomy? NO. Does the fact that they protect your private property from theft, and uphold the private property allow to them to infringe it? Again, NO. Also, again, Alabama vs NAACP 1958, like I mentioned in the last answer.

*""What about the Heart of Atlanta Motel vs. United States Supreme Court case where the Supreme Court ruled that the United States had authority to exercise their Civil Rights Law to prohibit racist discrimination in the private Heart of Atlanta Motel?""*

\>>> This is probably the best rebuttal and it was borne from my own research. Although I haven't heard it from anybody, I still wanted to include it as yet again falls short of justifying CRA of 1964. The reasoning the Supreme Court gave in this case to allow the United States to regulate the discriminatory business endeavors due to the commerce clause which reads, *""\[The Congress shall have Power . . . \] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; . . .""* By the Supreme Court's reasoning, motels not allowing black residents would discourage tourism and therefore impact interstate commerce. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled that the United States had authority to regulate the Heart of Atlanta Motel. This ruling does not uphold the CRA of 1964 because firstly, it's a dubious interpretation of the law, secondly and more importantly, it does not interrogate all businesses but rather only companies that affect interstate commerce, and thirdly and most importantly, it concerns the extent and jurisdiction of the Commerce Clause, but not the constitutionality of the CRA of 1964. First, it's very commonly acknowledged that the government has long been abusing the commerce clause to exercise overbearing control. When the commerce clause was written, it was written as a limitation on power, as was the rest of the Constitution, and as many early court cases regarding it show where it meant that the federal government could only regulate interstate commerce and not commerce directly within the states, as well as that states themselves could not jeopardize interstate commerce. Saying that the Heart of Atlanta Motel is included within interstate commerce is a drastic reach. Even granting that it's a valid reach, the fact remains that this Supreme Court decision says nothing about every other business that does not impact interstate commerce. And of course, the argument that ALL companies and businesses impact interstate commerce as it is referred to in the Commerce Clause is ridiculous, as it wouldn't have been specified if all commerce was within the scope, especially since the Constitution is a document limiting government power. Finally, while the court case mentioned here is tangentially related to the CRA of 1964, it doesn't interrogate it's constitutionality, but rather interrogates the scope of the Commerce Clause. Thus, this court case cannot be used to argue for or against the validity of CRA of 1964.

&#x200B;

**Section 2**

*""Just because it's not legally consistent doesn't mean it shouldn't be law. It helps a lot of people.""*

\>>> It's not just ""not legally consistent,"" it infringes on basic freedoms. We have no tolerance for that in our law. And we shouldn't. The fact that it helps  a lot of people matters not, as it does so by disenfranchising the basic freedom of association of most/all others.

*""It should still be law because it helps the economy.""*

\>>> Again, we cannot infringe on basic freedoms for ""the greater good."" That violates rule of law, which our entire country and most western civilization is built upon. Also, it doesn't help the economy as much as you think. First off, most people aren't racist nor would they discriminate in hiring or business today. Secondly, those who did discriminate would be at a huge disadvantage because they would be foregoing a huge proportion of smart and hard working employers and/or customers, and thus, would be marginalized or forced out of the market.

*""Black Americans wouldn't died and stayed in horrible poverty if not for CRA of 1964.""*

Yeah. That's true. That's horrible. But CRA of 1964 wasn't the only solution. In fact, it was the worse solution. The right thing to do would have been to grant reparation to the former slaves. The people whose labor was taken advantage of should've been given land and money so that they could establish their own sustainable economy, especially if any of the then land owners didn't want to associate with them. In fact, this was actually the plan. But after Lincoln got assassinated and the horribly racist Democratic candidate got elected into the presidency, the plans for reparations were cancelled and a whole lot of one of the most abundant peoples in America were thrown to the curb. This whole problem then required CRA of 1964, as there was no way to accommodate those people and grant reparations by 1964 as lineages were difficult to trace back. So, while CRA of 1964 could've been justified as maybe an executive order back then, for the very existence of our country, all it is now is a huge infringement of freedom now that shows no existential benefit. In fact, it was just the 3rd wrong in a series of mistakes.

Especially with the older 4.6 2V motors, they don’t make much power stock and even when modified they don’t make much power either.

The LT1 5.7 V8 in the mid 90’s Camaros and Corvettes was a fairly respectable 270ish horsepower at the crank with even more torque. On the other hand, a comparable 4.6 2V motor in a 1996 Mustang GT produced just 215 horsepower and 285 lb ft of torque. I understand that even this has a better horsepower per liter number than the 5.0 pushrod motor it replaced, but when compared with the Camaro Z28 and Corvette of its day, the 1996 Mustang GT looks anemic. The 99-04 New Edge GT was better with 260 horsepower and 300 lb ft of torque, but by this time, the Camaro SS is sporting the legendary LS1 motor, which easily trumps the 260 horsepower Mustang GT any day of the week.

When it comes to modifying the 4.6 2V motor, it can be more expensive and complicated to modify because of the overhead cam design, so a cam kit for a 4.6 2V can cost about 1K but a comparable cam kit for an LS motor on the high end is $500. Not to mention the fact that

So if you have a 1996 Mustang GT and you want to get more power, your money is probably going to be better spent LS swapping it than modifying the 4.6 2V motor that’s already in there.

At least the 3V and 4V 4.6 mod motors make decent power stock and modified."

I think this one will be somewhat different/fresh though.

I was recently having a discussion with an acquaintance. We are both conservative Republicans. He and his wife brought up the ""abortion bans"" (because of course they did...). Anyway, they made their case that it was immoral, and that they were Christians and it was their duty to see it banned in this country. And I took severe issue with this as I always do.

My issue is that it is pretending to be a moral objection when really it's just a power-trip people can play. The fact is that many of these people are regularly drunk, many have committed adultery, some have even been thieves and compulsive liars. But most of them haven't gotten an abortion (and at least half the nation can't). I find it to be disingenuous - cherry picking if you will - to declare that abortion should be made illegal and given a draconian punishment but drunkenness, adultery, theft, etc., is just petty. Not worth punishing. Those things destroy or kill more people (and families) every year than abortions. And they always have. But abortion is something so many people can demonize because it's one of the few sins they themselves haven't committed.

My point is that I have no desire to govern society, as a whole, with the Old Testament. And really, that's the angle. I see it that there are only two ways in that realm - there's the Old Testament way and there's the way of Christ (who washed feet). The ""middle way"" or ""third way"" people seem to invent with their cherry-picking strikes me as extremely offensive."

But I hate utilitarianism.  
  
If the law was fully tailored to utilitarianism then that means there should be a law that forces random people to sometimes be killed and have their organs harvested so that multiple other people in need of them can survive. One death for multiple lives. Typical utilitarianism. This is why I despise it.  
  
Humans are beings who inherently value themselves and their loved ones above strangers. That's not evil. That's human.  
  
But conscription turns that on its head and forces random people to go fight for the sake of those they don't know or care about as much as they care about themselves.  
  
Conscription takes away a person's self-ownership and potentially life for the sake of the collective society. This is similar to the principle of communism that the collective takes precedence over the individual.  
  
But such an ideology is inhuman.  
  
Conscription also violates multiple human rights. That is confirmed by the fact that in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations there is a special clause making an exception for military conscription when it comes to the right not to be held in slavery and involuntary servitude. The fact that they need to specify that conscription is an exception to the human right proves that conscription violates the human right.  
  
Some might say that a person owes military service to the state such as when the US Supreme Court made that argument when the draft was challenged.  
  
But this makes no sense because there is nothing more important to a person than their life (with the potential exception of the lives of their kids and other loved ones). There is no benefit provided to the individual citizen by the state which warrants the person owing the state military service which puts the citizen's life at risk. The bodily autonomy of a person is more important to them than any benefits provided by the state. So why should the person be morally obligated to answer conscription?"

The logical conclusion from this is to then force impregnate enough women to make up for the drop in population/birth rate if women don't happen to reach it that your male conscription caused or else why not just conscript both genders. I've never met anyone who seriously has that opinion so I don't think that it's very widespread and seems kind of abhorrent to force people to be baby machines, but so does sending only men to be blown to pieces. A convincing argument in favour of male conscription over female that doesn't insolve ""population rebuilding"" that people don't really believe imo would be enough to CMV.

But then I realised that some people would gladly welcome such a scenario, especially if they have first-hand experience of suffering through war or civil unrest.

Call me privileged, as this post is inspired by my experiences from my last 2 holidays:

1. December 2022 - January 2023 trip to Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, UK and Germany
2. December 2023 - January 2024 trip to Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines

During the first trip, when my family went to St Paul's Cathedral in London, the Anglican prayer service was so similar to Catholic Mass that my parents were saying ""Amen"" out of habit. My brother was hesitant on us going in there in the first place, but they had posters saying ""*all are welcome*"", and my parents and I went in thinking that we ought to reciprocate the respect the Anglicans showed us. So when my parents were going Amen, my brother was trying to stop them from doing that, so we just left the cathedral to prevent further strife within the family. My brother tried to explain to us that what we did was wrong, as saying ""[Amen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen)"" is to accept the veracity of such a religion, and that to do so in an Anglican prayer service is to accept and give credence to a religion that has murdered and forcibly converted millions of Catholics (and if you try to tell him about Catholic atrocities, he'll tell you something like ""*they started it*"" or ""*it was justified because the other side was committing even worse atrocities*""). As a side note, I am not religious at all, and I've failed to see any veracity in any of the religions I've encountered on my travels. **But to get to the point of this post, religion is a major (but not the only) driver of conflict throughout history. World peace can be achieved if everyone followed a Catholicism (or any other single religion) and purge all others were purge**.

During the second trip, I went to multiple museums in Laos and Vietnam which featured their anti-colonial struggles as well as the wars it took for their present-day communist governments to win power. Regardless on where you stand on the colonialism vs. anti-colonialism, or the capitalism vs. communism debates, the people of Laos and Vietnam were those who suffered in these showdowns. Likewise, the Philippines also spilt a lot of blood in multiple attempts to win its independence and is still chafing under active military conflicts to this day due to multiple insurgencies. Even today, Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines are still facing precarious situations regarding territorial disputes which can spiral into outright war between hegemonic nations. **To get to the point of this post, the Cold War and its associated conflicts wouldn't happen if everyone were capitalist (or alternatively if everyone were communist) and people with alternative opinions were purged. Additionally, wars like the Indochina Wars, Philippine-American War or the Pacific War (plus many more) wouldn't happen if everyone accepted the American yoke (or alternatively if everyone were to accept the Russian yoke, the French yoke, the Japanese yoke or the Chinese yoke) and didn't resist even if their overlord isn't treating them well.**

Aside from these 2 trips, I also want to cover some Australian politics. Last year, Australia had a referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. The Vote No side won, as they have successfully convinced the majority of Australians that the Indigenous Voice to Parliament would divide Australians. But regardless of which side won, the mere existence of this referendum only served to further inflame political polarisation in Australia. In fact, [we are now so divided that there is no longer hope for reconciliation](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/indigenous-affairs/2023/10/14/marcia-langton-whatever-the-outcome-reconciliation-dead). **This political polarisation can only be solved by abandoning democracy, purging alternative political viewpoints and forcing the Indigenous community to shut up. That is not a path I want Australia to take.** Additionally, monarchism vs. republicanism is a political issue in Australia. So on our aforementioned trip to Berlin, when we went to museums that covered the Nazi period, my brother was constantly reminding me ""*see this is what happens when you abandon monarchy*"" in the hopes that I admit that my political stances are wrong. **While I disagree that abandoning monarchy is to blame for Nazism, to get to the point of this post, liberal democracies always have some level of risk that ideologies like Nazism and Communism can arise, and the only full solution to this is to purge people for their political beliefs.**

Now I know some people will reply ""*or we could just learn to get along*"", and for most of us, we kind of do. But there are always some people out there who do not want to get along, due to conviction in their stances so strong that they'd be willing to die, and send plenty of others to die, for their cause. Then there are those who know that it can be politically or economically expedient at times to cause conflict. In my experience, some of these people who do not want to get along with others are also frighteningly intelligent, blessed with the ability to draw people into their cause and have arguments up their sleeve to undermine their critics.

World peace sounds nice, but in reality, peace is bound to be short-lived, as there is no shortage of religion, ideology or territorial disputes to divide people. In practice, long-term world peace would require ""*Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer*"", which is why I personally consider it a dystopia.

I will conclude with the following quote from Frederick Douglass: ""*The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle. If there is no struggle, there is no progress*"". I bring it up to show that without the clash of different ideas, we can have world peace. But such a scenario can only be achieved by purging all dissent and alternative opinions, and it will be a less progressive world to boot."

This was the absolute pinnacle of superhero storytelling and acting.  People pay money to watch these forgettable marketing shit shows featuring some obscure comic book hero that nobody really cares about in the hope that one of these movies will recapture that magic. But who in their right mind really gives a flying fuck about the eternals? Or any of the other lame characters they dig up. Sure a few might be entertaining,  But the acting is usually shit, the plot is predictable, the characters un-relatable ect. Basically they are for kids. Like most anime. 

In reality, talented filmmakers have given up on superhero movies as a genre, and there will likely never be another iron man.

case A : Abortion is illegal
=====================
Then abortion is illegal in cases of rape, incest, and risk to the life of the mother. This is immoral because it gives sexual predators an obscene amount of power over their victims' lives, and because it forces death upon women.

case B: Abortion is illegal, with certain exceptions
========================================
Then the burden of proof is on the woman to prove they fall under one of the exceptions. This is also immoral for the same reasons as case A, except with less severity due to the potential to prove oneself as being among the exceptions. Note that rape is notoriously hard to prove.

case C: Abortion is not illegal
========================
Then a woman can choose to get an abortion and not be punished for it under the law.

case C1: Abortion is not illegal, but it is considered immoral
=================================================
Then a woman can choose to not have an abortion, either by avoiding pregnancy or by giving birth.

case C2: Abortion is not illegal, and it is not considered immoral
====================================================
Trivial explanation






Given the above reasoning, case C is the only one in which immoral outcomes can be avoided.

In cases A and B, immoral outcomes are guaranteed."

1,2024-02-20,CMV: RFK Jr. is the best choice for President,u/JoshGordonsDealer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1avitgd/cmv_rfk_jr_is_the_best_choice_for_president/,changemyview,"I’ve been a lifelong liberal. I campaigned for Obama in 2008. Voted for him 3 times. Voted for Sanders twice. Voted for both Hillary and Biden. I was a part of Occupy Wall St. Something has changed.  RFK Jr. is the only candidate running on economic liberalism, which I believe in. 

This is going to talk about the actual policies. As I hope that everyone reads, I do have a theory that politics for many has replaced spirituality in our culture. This is due to the rise in identity politics and the loss of spirituality in our culture. Whether it be Trumpism or the DNC, there are a group of people who align their belief systems by politics. I’m not sure I can reach these people. They tend to respond in a similar fashion as if you questioned someone’s belief system. At the end of the day, these are my political beliefs, nothing more. People are tired of being talked to like crap. 

- the price of housing has risen from a median of 250k in 2019 to 400k since Biden has taken office 

- Take home pay, due to inflation, has fell for Americans by 9%

RFK Jr. is running on establishing mortgage bonds at 3% interest that will make the government a lender. 

As well, he is advocating for 0% interest on student loans. Biden ran on 10k student loan forgiveness. The only forgiveness that has happened under Biden, is if you work 10 years in the public sector and make payments for those 10 years, or if you’re 100% disabled. He did come out with SAVE that makes lower payments but adds interest over time, which benefits the lenders 

Regardless on how you feel about immigration, a country cannot be a country without effective border control. There needs to be some. While I didn’t like his rhetoric, Trump was right in this regard. We need more effective border controls, which RFK Jr. advocates with more compassion than Trump.

On the environment, RFK Jr. is beyond reproach. He spent his life fighting corporate interests (Monsanto) to benefit our environment. He advocates protecting land and water sources.

We are experiencing a mental health crisis in our country. He fights big pharma and is running on making SSRIs and therapy more available. 

 Now, on to vaccines. He isn’t anti vax, as the DNC, GOP, and corporate interests would have you believe. He supports vaccination against measles, smallpox, and the more traditional vaccines. He questions the vaccines that have came out since 1989. Including the Covid vaccine. Now, we were all around for that. As many of my friends said, “they had to do something.” I’ve been vaccinated. But it’s also ok to question the efficacy of said vaccines and know if they were helpful. Even if you don’t agree with him on this point, which is reasonable, his other policies are sound. I personally think it’s very healthy to question big pharma and their interests. 

At this point, the two main parties are delivering weak candidates. Anyone can see that Biden is declining. Check out his 2012 VP debate against Paul Ryan for contrast. I don’t think he’s a bad man. I think he isn’t right for the job. At this point, we’re either voting for DNC party rule, which has increasingly became more authoritarian, or the Cult of Personality, which is Trump and Republican policies. I refuse to vote for either.

But you say, “what about the danger of Trump?” The DNC wouldn’t run an 81 yo candidate in mental decline with an approval rate of 38% if this threat were taken seriously. The Dems don’t take this seriously. And with recent DNC behavior, both parties are becoming increasingly authoritarian 

Once we sift through the media propaganda, and if we are open minded and don’t make politics an identity, I feel RFK Jr. is by far the right choice"

I mean death itself surely can't be bad, it's just what happens to all of us. We'll just be gone. Sure, some people would be sad but who cares? You don't, once your dead. Your entire world ended the moment you killed yourself. It's nothing good, since you won't feel good doing it but it also isn't something bad, since it's just an ending a bad feeling. And isn't it logical to just end it, if you're feeling bad? Sure, you could feel better and maybe even really good, if you don't kill yourself but that's the future. The pain you are currently feeling is still there and will always have infinitely more worth, than the happiness in the future, since it's the present.
And speaking of worth, looking at Nietzsche it's pretty clear that life only has worth, if we give worth to it and you obviously don't do that, when you're considering suicide. Additionally morality is made up by humanity, therefore we can't say that suicide is universally bad or unethical.
So I believe that suicide is always a rational option to escape your life.

A simple mattress is usually provided. It typically costs about twice the price of an economy class seat. 

(1) The Sleeper's Row can allow people to lie down flat, Premium Economy doesn't. 

(2) The prices are either comparable or the Sleeper's Row is cheaper. 

(3) The only advantage of Premium Economy is priority boarding and better service, but airlines can just allow people in economy class to access these features by paying a small extra fee. 

Therefore, I see no reason to buy a Premium Economy ticket when you can just lie fully flat and sleep comfortably by choosing the Sleeper's Row by paying either the same or even cheaper price. 

If companies can reimburse Premium Economy but not Sleeper's Row, the problem can just be solved by slightly changing the reimbursement rules, it's an entirely artificial problem. 

I'd be EXTREMELY willing to pay the small extra price to lie down flat during a long international flight. Business class is just too expensive. Economy class is just too uncomfortable. Premium Economy is to me just economy with extra steps, I'd rather buy an extra legroom Economy seat (emergency exit seat) instead of Premium Economy where you pay a lot more for just a little bit wider seats and a slightly better meal. 

If you really want comfort, buy Business. If you really need economy, buy Economy. If you're in the middle, buy the Sleeper's Row. Premium Economy Class has no reason for existing on international long-haul flights. "

We can all see how these cartels are terrorising the country and hurting countless innocents in the process. Butchering the families of anyone they oppose. Since when did the US become ok with letting evil of this level transpire on their doorstep?

Most of the shootings aren't carried out with a ""fully semi automatic AR15 weapon of war"", they're carried out with handguns and shotguns at higher rates. If you really want to complain about gun violence in the US, don't blame the NRA or GOP. Look at who is committing gun homicide at rates stupidly higher than the average person.

344,2024-02-20,CMV: Europeans give the United States too much flak for how late they were in abolishing slavery.,u/schapi1991,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1avmntb/cmv_europeans_give_the_united_states_too_much/,changemyview,"First I have to say is that I'm neither American nor European, second is that while it's obvious to me that slavery no matter the time period we talk about is wrong. 

My criticism here is based mostly on my belief that: 

1) Most European countries passed laws abolishing slavery around the first half of the 1800s, which isn't that much earlier than the USA did. For example France ultimately only banned slavery as a hole in 1851, and Britain in 1833, but the enforcement of the ban is carried out gradually, so arguably it is much later that the ban actually is totally valid. 

>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL15614649/](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL15614649/) 

2) Passing laws abolishing slavery just to continue to use free labor in your colonial empires using another name for it doesn't make it less slavery IMO. It is well documented that forced labor was used in the French, British, Dutch and Belgian colonies until the 20th century.

Ultimately, this isn't a bash of Europeans since it is actually a very hard task to find countries which doesn't have some dark episodes in their histories, but making it seem that the USA was alone in it use of slave labor is a hypocritical outlook of the actual labor policies of many other societies of the time.

Nowadays, it is common for children to use the internet at a young age, and there is no doubt that accessing pornographic content is more easier than it was in the past because it is available everywhere on the internet. According to a poll, 15% of children watched pornography for the first time before turning 11. We could argue that neglect only affects a tiny fraction of children, but 54% reported seeing it by the age of 13.  


  
It is wonderful that parents have normalized masturbation and taught their children that it is not a bad thing, but none of the parents have ever discussed unhealthy masturbation with their children. Unhealthy masturbation happens when a person masturbates many times per day, typically on pornographic content.  


  
Children are educated about safe sex at a very young age, even before they enter adolescence, but they are not yet educated about the dangers of pornography and unhealthy masturbation, which cause an array of problems in their personal lives, relationships, academics, and other areas.  


  
You have every right to disagree with me and downvote me, but take a minute to read online about how pornographic stuff and unhealthy masturbation have damaged so many people's lives. It can also have an impact on the lives of others around them, leading to rape, pedophilia, and other serious issues."

In fact, I'd go so far to even say that everyone in the United States should follow this and encourage others to do the same.

Before I go on, I'd like to mention that I am not a lawyer, however I am interested in Law and do keep a reasonable close eye on law and how law enforcement do tend to get extordinarily leeway on matters that shouldn't be in any civilized society.

1. **Qualified immunity** \- I understand the concept behind this, under ""split second decision"" cops shouldn't be help accountable such as shootings and they accidently get a victim. However it's another when a person is not a threat and they beat them senselessly. However this becomes a problem because there have been so many cases that cops, should've had been hung ( metaphorically speaking ) but got away because of Qualified immunity and if they can do it, they'll do it again without worry of prosecution [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcyUEU6Qw1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcyUEU6Qw1U)

In this video they broke into a wrong house, destroyed it, and was granted qualified immunity. This, in my opinion, is gross negligence, to let them off the hook is nothing short of ""nothing will happen if you do it again"", in fact I'd even say it sets a bad presentence for other cops around the country to do the same.

So I ask the question, why should I or the rest of the country trust the police if they can be a ( pardon my French ) bunch of fuckups and not suffer negative repercussions for their screw up, and the victim ( I imagine ) has to suffer the financial and mental hardship of because up their screw ups? 

2. **They are legally allowed to Lie** \- This is I think the biggest problem people have with police, their words are worthless. Take for example the women Melissa Lucio who was on death row and police HEAVILY coerced her to confess to a murder that she more than likely didn't commit. One police officer said he'll give her leeway if she confesses to it, she was set to death row because of it, thankfully she had a stay. But if they can lie to anyone, and make up such ridiculous nonsense why should we trust them?

They can lie about evidence, they can lie about you finding evidence on your person, they can lie about anything and I'd even argue this does more harm than good and even putting innocent people behind bars. Because if they are looking for the guilty person and cocering anyone they can instead of doing any form of investigating than that is another reason to not trust them. I quote the words of John Oliver ""instead of lying to catch criminals, if they are investigators and their job is to investigate, maybe they can do, some of that"".

8,2024-02-20,CMV: Identity politics and extremist attitudes hurt the credibility of otherwise noble social movements,u/Mountain-Captain-396,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1avqga1/cmv_identity_politics_and_extremist_attitudes/,changemyview,"Let me start off by explaining a bit about myself so you can see where some of my bias may be coming from. I (20M) am mixed race and grew up in a predominantly white middle class suburb of a major city. I consider myself liberal today, but I was hardcore conservative growing up. Finally, I grew up in and currently live in the United States, so the views expressed in this post primarily apply to the United States.

When I am talking about identity politics, I am specifically referring to the practice filtering every interaction through the lens of your racial, sexual, or gender identity.

I started thinking about this a few days ago while I was scrolling through r/AskFeminists and reading through posts and comments. One post in particular that caught my eye was where a woman was talking about how it was sexist for her boss to ask her to perform a traditionally feminine task when there were men available who could have also done it. The majority of the replies agreed and seemed to assume that the boss must have had malicious/misogynist intent when assigning that task to her. Nobody even considered the possibility that it was simply a random assignment, or that there could be other reasons BESIDES the employee's gender that resulted in that task being assigned to them. 

What bothered me the most is that these assumptions were made and nobody even bothered to ask for clarification from the original poster. Is it possible that the boss was a misogynist who only assigned that task to her because she was a woman? Yes. However, there was no context provided, and it is entirely possible that the task was assigned in good faith.

The issue here is the assumption that every person views life through the lens of identity. The people in that particular feminist community just assumed that the boss goes about assigning tasks based on gender, when that is most likely not the case.

I have noticed something similar happening in other communities both online and in real life. In my anecdotal experience, I notice it happening most often within communities of people who have historically been discriminated against (black people, women, LGBTQ, etc.).

The problem comes when people who are outside these groups see how they advocate for change. Two prime examples would be the MeToo movement and the Black Lives Matter movement. On the surface, both movements have noble goals and seek to improve the condition of people who have faced centuries of marginalization. However, there is rising opposition to these movements based on the way they so heavily encourage the filtering of life through the lens of identity.

While some of the opposition comes from people who genuine oppose the premise of the group, many people are afraid to associate themselves closely with these activists groups due to the way they present and represent their ideals. 

For example, Black Lives Matter is an organization founded to eradicate white supremacy, specifically within police and government entities. While their mission is noble, one of the ways they have chosen to go about their mission is by attacking police as a whole. They have pushed bills to de-fund law enforcement, called for politicians resignation for not supporting climate reform, and have rejected solutions that don't fit their left-wing narrative.

None of these things are inherently bad, but they are extreme from the perspective of someone who may otherwise have no idea what the organization stands for. This only serves to alienate moderates who would otherwise support the primary cause. This also results in even more extreme ideologies such as ACAB being associated with the group, which pushes them further from the center and alienates more people who would otherwise support them.

One of the reasons MLK was so successful as a civil rights leader is because he was able to appeal to the masses while still advocating against genuine problems within our society. His dedication to non-violence set him apart both from his opposition who used violence to quell social unrest, AND his contemporaries like Malcom X who advocated for violence the other way.

If these movements want to succeed at their primary goals of combating TRUE systemic injustice in the modern era, they need to focus on appealing to the largest number of people they can. Progress is made in inches, not miles."

I believe blocking is useful on Twitter like sites where algorithms force you to interact with strangers, but on discord like sites and platforms it’s bad because it tends to lead to more friction in community conversations.

It’s good to block Twitter nazi reply guys or whatever, but someone on a discord server who you don’t like will just cause problems since they are still present in the community. Dms are a legitimate reason but nothing else really.

When a conversation is happening and one person has blocked another person it causes more conflict between the people. The blocker needs to conspicuously ignore the blocked person who they might not really notice otherwise, and sometimes they will announce blocked messages. The blocked person likewise will have someone in the conversation who will not interact with them or be actively hostile.

I don’t know the solution I’m not telling discord to make changes but I’m telling people not to block fellow community members on discord particularly in smaller communities."

The most basic fact of existence is suffering, so to build a moral framework, that's a foundation.

For example, suffering should only be administered if and only if to prevent equal or greater suffering.   
For example the syringe tip, causes the boy to bleed and cry, but prevents him from the greater suffering of measles.
But the Uncle's tip, causes the boy to bleed and cry, and causes greater suffering; both physical injuries and mental issues.

Based on this, Hitler did everything wrong cause the suffering he caused suffering to people, with every intent to bring about greater suffering.

1,2024-02-20,Cmv: Egypt is one of the most countries helping Palestine ,u/Selfdefenseguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1avskic/cmv_egypt_is_one_of_the_most_countries_helping/,changemyview,"I'm here hoping to engage in a thoughtful and respectful discussion about this matter, wishing for a conversation that steers clear of insults and impractical emotional statements. I am open to changing my viewpoint and hope others are equally willing to reconsider theirs.

There's a narrative I encounter often, suggesting Egypt's approach towards Palestine is lackluster and embarrassing. On a personal, emotional level, I deeply wish for Egypt to declare war on Israel to stand with our Palestinian siblings in Gaza. This sentiment is fueled by both religious convictions and a sense of humanitarian duty, and I feel ready to join such a fight.

Yet, when I consider this matter from a pragmatic standpoint, especially from the perspective of governance, the idea of declaring war on a nation backed by powerful Western allies poses a significant risk to my country's stability. It puzzles me why Egypt, in particular, is frequently singled out for criticism over its stance on Palestine, unlike other Islamic or Arab states. Perhaps this scrutiny stems from Egypt having the most formidable military in the Arab world. However, this force is primarily intended for Egypt's defense. History has shown us, particularly during Gamal Abdel Nasser's era, that diverging from this focus leads to unnecessary conflicts that have drained our resources, harmed our economy, and cost many Egyptian lives.

The concept of a united Arab front defending Palestine could potentially shift my stance, advocating for joint action rather than Egypt acting alone.

Facing accusations of doing nothing, I highlight that Egypt is the largest contributor to Palestinian aid, delivering about 60% of the assistance received by Palestine, even amidst our own economic struggles. This is a significant effort compared to wealthier nations. Additionally, Egypt, alongside Qatar, is actively involved in peace negotiations aiming for the establishment of a Palestinian state, an effort often overlooked by our critics.

So, what is the appropriate course of action? Waging war against a global coalition is unrealistic. Criticisms abound whether it concerns the sufficiency of aid, the effectiveness of negotiations, or the challenges of delivering aid through Israeli-controlled checkpoints. Such endeavors require careful coordination to avoid endangering lives or provoking further conflict.

Some advocate for a more assertive stance from Egypt, but it's challenging to see how this could be more impactful than our current contributions, except for Yemen's bold approach, which led to direct conflict with American forces.

Suggestions like closing the Suez Canal or severing diplomatic relations are drastic and would likely bring more harm to both Egypt and Palestine, with minimal impact on Israel. Maintaining diplomatic engagement seems more conducive to negotiation efforts.

I welcome your thoughts on this complex issue, aiming for a discussion grounded in realism rather than emotion. If you were responsible for a nation of 100 million, how would you act? And if you believe my perspective is misguided, why? Thank you."

Israel could have been a Christian state rather than a Jewish state and everything would remain the same. And if you think this has to do with the Palestinian issue, think again. Arab countries don't show solidatry towards each other. 600,000 people died in the ongoing Syrian civil war, 350,000 in Yemen, that's more than 10 times the number of casualties in the Israel-Palestine conflict.

The average amount to keep a state above replacement level is 2.1 children per woman, very few countries in the world currently fulfill this, especially in western states where fertility rates have been on a static decline since the 70’s.

This lack of fertility has been shored up with immigration from the rest of the world in order to make up for the lack of new workers entering the market, which makes sense. However an unforeseen effect of this is that the primary ethnic group of these states are going down and in some of places are beginning to become minorities in their own cities and communities. In Brampton, Ontario for example the primary ethnic group went from being 69% caucasian in 1996 to just under 19% in 2021, that’s over a 25 year span and yet the number of demographic change is staggering. Even in Toronto, Ontario the predicted demographics in 2040 will only by 24% caucasian with South Asians making up the majority

Now make no mistake, I don’t have any problem with immigration or having people of other cultures and ethnic groups in my community. That being said, I don’t want to become a minority in a place where I grew up in and was in the overwhelming majority a little less than 20 years ago. I don’t want to see my culture or ethnic group fade into irrelevancy, especially since some groups have a statistically proven in-group preference that I’m afraid will eventually bleed over into politics as we see in states such as South Africa.

Am I in the wrong for believing this? I don’t believe this is deliberate like some people believe but I do think this is happening regardless."

",u/Selfdefenseguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1avtz03/cmv_egypt_is_one_of_the_most_countries_helping/,changemyview,"
I'm here hoping to engage in a thoughtful and respectful discussion about this matter, wishing for a conversation that steers clear of insults and impractical emotional statements. I am open to changing my viewpoint and hope others are equally willing to reconsider theirs.

There's a narrative I encounter often, suggesting Egypt's approach towards Palestine is lackluster and embarrassing. 

I consider this matter from a pragmatic standpoint, especially from the perspective of governance, the idea of declaring war on a nation backed by powerful Western allies poses a significant risk to my country's stability. It puzzles me why Egypt, in particular, is frequently singled out for criticism over its stance on Palestine, unlike other Islamic or Arab states. Perhaps this scrutiny stems from Egypt having the most formidable military in the Arab world. However, this force is primarily intended for Egypt's defense. History has shown us, particularly during Gamal Abdel Nasser's era, that diverging from this focus leads to unnecessary conflicts that have drained our resources, harmed our economy, and cost many Egyptian lives.

The concept of a united Arab front defending Palestine could potentially shift my stance, advocating for joint action rather than Egypt acting alone.

Facing accusations of doing nothing, I highlight that Egypt is the largest contributor to Palestinian aid, delivering about 60% of the assistance received by Palestine, even amidst our own economic struggles. This is a significant effort compared to wealthier nations. Additionally, Egypt, alongside Qatar, is actively involved in peace negotiations aiming for the establishment of a Palestinian state, an effort often overlooked by our critics.

So, what is the appropriate course of action? Waging war against a global coalition is unrealistic. Criticisms abound whether it concerns the sufficiency of aid, the effectiveness of negotiations, or the challenges of delivering aid through Israeli-controlled checkpoints. Such endeavors require careful coordination to avoid endangering lives or provoking further conflict.

Some advocate for a more assertive stance from Egypt, but it's challenging to see how this could be more impactful than our current contributions, except for Yemen's bold approach, which led to direct conflict with American forces.

Suggestions like closing the Suez Canal or severing diplomatic relations are drastic and would likely bring more harm to both Egypt and Palestine, with minimal impact on Israel. Maintaining diplomatic engagement seems more conducive to negotiation efforts.

I welcome your thoughts on this complex issue, aiming for a discussion grounded in realism rather than emotion. If you were responsible for a nation of 100 million, how would you act? And if you believe my perspective is misguided, why? Thank you."

You can also just listen to it as a podcast. ^(ADM, please don't delete this post just because i put a non-listed Youtube joke video on it.)

But If you plan to read, I tried to make the text more readable by using a lot of paragraphs and bold words.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Every. single. time. that someone talk something realistic about the future of AI on society they get downvoted or downplayed. Generic phrases like **""That's not gonna happen in my lifetime""** or **""This will only create more jobs""**. Most of them do not even see the entire post, they just see ""AI"" and immediately thinks they need to talk bad about it.

I'm tired of coping. We're fucking **doomed** and almost nobody seems to be aware about it. We starting to see a coming immense wave of people being depressive because of fear of not being **useful** anymore on the job market. Nobody is doing nothing, and the governments are made of 60+ year old people that still don't know exactly what a ""Internet"" is.

The medium lifetime of a human being is 70 years, so two decades is not that much. With that in mind, tell me, what **non-manual** jobs will still be available in the next two decades. Did you fucking saw [Sora?](https://openai.com/sora) and do you remember about AI video generation [being a shit just 1 year ago](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/will_smith_eating_spaghetti.mp4?_=1)?

Let's get a bit less futuristic. Imagine a 14-year-old teenager who is considering pursuing a certain profession. Considering that this person will follow the traditional path of finishing high school, attending college, and only getting a job after graduation, he/she will only enter the job market in about **8 years**, almost a **decade**. With generative AI's advancing exponentially, and considering that the first AGI may emerge in the next decade, which job will actually survive all that time without it's market becoming **saturated, precarious, or even extinct** due to competition with AI? And how will these people continue to study and live normally knowing that the future is so uncertain?

&#x200B;

***""But this has already happened before in the industrial revolutions, and in the end, everything turned out fine!""***

&#x200B;

All past industrial revolutions were about machines replacing humans in **manual labor jobs**. Now it's different, Generative Artificial Intelligences can replace humans even in **creative, intellectual, and complex areas**, replacing people who have studied for years and years in industries we never imagined that could have robots performing it, demolishing the concept of **""stable jobs""**. The potential for damage is much greater because humanity has never experienced this level of **mass automation of specialized jobs** before.

&#x200B;

***""It will only replace you if you are lazy and don't adapt to it!***

&#x200B;

Generative AI will not **(yet)** directly replace you, they will **multiply** your **productivity** and make your job easier to the point where the job of 10 people can now be done by only 1 person, allowing companies to lay off several people to **cut costs and increase profits.**

In the end, specialized individuals (even if they have ""adapted"" to AI tools) will be replaced by a **single person** with basic (but enough) knowledge of the field who **charges much less** to deliver the same result. When people say ""AI will create more jobs"" they're actually referring to this without knowing.

Except for the highly specific and technical jobs that envolves the programming itself of these technologies, the mass of these ""new jobs"" are all about **replacing people with less people,** and those who remain will **produce more** for the **same salary.**

This will lead to a social situation where it will be practically **impossible** to get into any job if you have never worked in that area before or already has any professional contact with someone (like parents), as the demand for workers is expected to be laughably low due to the **high productivity** that these new technology advancements provides, and there will exist a large number of individuals who are no longer useful in almost any area available, but still need a job to live.

Summing it up, you **will** be replaced, but with extra steps.

&#x200B;

***""AI doesn't have the ""human factor.""***

&#x200B;

In our system, **convenience** and **profit** outweighs quality.

Imagine the following situation: a company needs a artwork for a banner. They can pay the **full price** to hire a **specialized human artist** or literally pay **nothing** to have a slightly inferior result produced by Stable Diffusion open source AI. Which option do you think they will choose? ^((This situation ignores the fact that AI's can create thousands of different artworks in minutes for the best one to be chosen or modified).)

If AI competition made you charge 90% less to work the same hours, your job is already **dead**. It doesn't need to literally vanish, **and that's the point.**

Videos generated by AI were laughably bad, right? **Look at them now**. This is what also happened to photorealistic AI images, and can you really tell me that's not going to happen to... **literally any other profession?**... Realistic, depending on how far into the future you're willing to think, every job is endangered, some just need a few more decades. I'm only talking about the next two.

Basically, AI doesn't have to embody the perfection of a human to **fuck up an entire market area**, it simply needs to make everything **easier** and more **accessible**, to the point where people **no longer feel the need to hire a human to do it**. So, there is no such thing as the ""human factor"" as long as the AI does what needs to be done.

Random vent about some programmers views about this topic, skip it if you want:

>!And talking specifically about you, pretentious programmer (not all of them, calm down) that will tell me that I'm overreacting because ""You work in the field and know how this technology works"". People are already getting prejudicated by these exponential sudden evolutions, so why did you not warned them? Because you also didn't know, and you'll still don't know. Even the creators of these technologies themselves do not know exactly what's coming in the next centuries. !<

>!Sora was being made silently and was only exposed to the public to overshadow Google's Gemini AI, you obviously didn't know that, and you'll also don't know how Sora 2.0 will be. so don't act like you know everything because you supposedly know ""how it works"". !<

>!Programming AI's are already being used to streamline processes, like autopilot, but you have to be very optimistic and naive not to realize that junior programmers are already being laid off or rejected because of this; Also, those programmers who remain don't get a salary increase, they just work more for the same money. As i said, AI's don't literally ""replace"" humans, an that applies to programming. Experienced programmers are gonna get fucked up too.!<

>!Ohh nothing's gonna happen because you know AI is not gonna get that much smarter, right? !<

>!Did the ""experienced"" programmers foresee that the junior programmers would be replaced? No? So why should i believe you when you tell me that you will not be affected by the layoffs and the ""Produce 90% more to gain the same money"" logic?!<

>!Basically, don't listen to pretentious programmers that think they ""know"" the future, they're ""false negatives"". I just added this part in the text because i know they always appear, and they're actually taken seriously by most people. Don't think i hate programmers, i'm currently studying c++ right now.!<

>! !<

&#x200B;

***""This automation will only affect jobs exclusively done in computers.""***

&#x200B;

**GPT-4** can already understand **audio, images, and text** in an almost human-like manner. It's impossible not to see the enormous potential this has to affect various areas beyond the typical ""office work."" But even if we assume that only computer-based jobs are affected, that would already be enough to cause a **mass migration** of workers to **other areas**, which would heavily impact those areas since there wouldn't be enough jobs for everyone. Even medicine could be one of them, as it is a field that will not be negatively affected by AI for now. Or government jobs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yes, I am obviously quite pessimistic about the future. Automation would theoretically be exclusively positive **(especially in a system not driven by profit)**, and I think it will eventually be someday, but the problem lies in the **transition** to that. In the next **two decades**, many people will totally lose their value in the job market, and the government has no **plan** to **contain** this or provide any social **security** for the population that will become **unemployed**.

Currently, I'm trying to learn Unreal Engine so that I can engage in something valuable to earn some money while also getting benefited by the AI automations. However, this constant mental struggle and uncertainty about the future prevent me from maintaining consistency in my efforts. I'm extremely depressive but I'm making an effort to actually stay alive socially and professionally.

I hope to become a little more optimistic and overcome this lack of perspective i have so that I can accomplish tasks. However, the future seems doomed and artificial, and I'm not sure if i wanna live in it.

Thanks if you read it till the end. Have a nice day."

Economically, these immigrants overwhelm the high trust welfare states of Europe, which were built to support a population who puts back into the system. These immigrants do not give back what they take from the system.

They also bring a great level of crime to these countries which the natives should not have to deal with. Even if it is not all of them, Europeans should not have to suffer in the hopes that the majority of immigrants do not commit crimes.

It is sad to see the most beautiful societies in the world become overrun with foreign nationals from such a different culture. I believe we should stop immigration and begin deporting criminals from these places. "

1,2024-02-20,CMV: The rehabilitation of the Black Panther Party by some media outlets is absurd and revisionist,u/josephjp155,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1avxw2f/cmv_the_rehabilitation_of_the_black_panther_party/,changemyview,"I’ve had this thought for quite a while, but what really inspired me to want to get into a discussion on it was seeing an Instagram post a bit ago, from the PBS newshour account. The post was a promotion of their hidden history series, and the gist of this particular video was about how the BPP was ‘misunderstood and vilified by the white establishment’

A few things: 

1.) For what it’s worth, just for context, I consider myself left of liberal- probably a social democrat. 

2.) I’m by no means a true expert on the subject and history of the BPP and the civil rights movement in general, but I’ve read most of the writings of Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, Angela Davis, Eldridge Cleaver… you name it, really. Without sounding like I’m asking for a pat on the back, I feel like that does put ahead of the overwhelming majority of white folks in this country. I’m a curious person and have always enjoyed reading perspectives that I may viscerally be opposed to at first glance. I feel like this is an important point to make, because often in sociopolitical discussions, some people will try to ask if you’ve ever actually read or listened to the ideas of the peoples/groups you disagree with. I certainly have. 

3.)My POV here is less about specific ideology (even though it’s probably clear I’m not a fan) of the BPP, but more about the notion that they were simply about ‘self defense’ when numerous members, in my opinion, murdered others in cold blood. Even just focusing on Huey Newton specifically for a moment, based on my own research, I have zero to no doubts he was involved in the murder of Kathleen Smith and Betty Van Patter. I won’t even go down the rabbit hole of other members and similar circumstances. 

4.) I understand that by and large, the mainstream and establishment media has not fully ‘rehabilitated’ the BPP. In left of center/liberal spaces, they’re mostly considered a radical group to this day. However, I have seemed to notice that as we face a real racial reckoning in this country the last 10 years or so (specifically since 2020) there has been a renewed interest, in my opinion, of rehabilitating the BPP.

I'm not here to debate politics, obviously, I'm here to debate why or why not they're just stupid to debate at all. I also bring up the issue for America because I'm an American and I see this mostly on the American side of the internet.

There is too much of an ""us vs them"" sentiment across both the media and many comment sections (Across *all* of social media) of individuals who bring this dreadful topic up. Too many people refuse to accept or listen to ideas of the opposing side simply for the sake of whatever echo chamber they're a part of. Nobody is willing to listen at all because ""*All* libtards are sinful, gay, and trying to convert our children"" or ""*All* MAGA zealots are racist, misogynistic, boot-licking dullards."" 

I can't see anyone even attempting to find a common ground, and it's easy to see why people would come to the conclusion all is hopeless. But I don't think so. Simple Hegelian Dialectics. By logic, every thesis (Solution to a problem) has its antithesis (Opposing solution). There must also be a synthesis, a logical conclusion to the two opposing issues that all parties can agree on. I just think we, as a collective society, need to figure this out one way or another.

I don't expect this to be some profound debate or discussion of the century which will change the course of American history, but I do believe it's a fascinating and important topic that needs to be delved into. Maybe it can get people talking? That's all that matters.

Or convince me that American politics in their current form are perfectly fine, all is fine, drink the Kool-Aid, yadda yadda."
1,2024-02-20,CMV: There are no rights that men have that women don't (US),u/FormerBabyPerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1avzqq6/cmv_there_are_no_rights_that_men_have_that_women/,changemyview,"I've heard this argument about women not having the same rights as men and pretty often what ends up happening is they talk about social expectations and norms, talking about what happened in the past or in other countries, fail to see past their own nose, or compare the experience of the average woman to an anomaly of men rather than the norm.

So to get the most common ones out of the way:

1. Women make (insert amount of of cents here) less than men. This isn't really a right unless you're saying the reason women are getting paid less is because they're women. But the gender pay gap has been debunked numerous times and even in the studies that do attempt to prove it the gap isn't significant. If you did a statistical analysis comparing most things there would be some kind of imbalance, but that in itself doesn't mean it's a disparity due to lack of rights or discrimination
2. Women can't get abortions. This one is a bit cherry picked because it largely depends on the state. Without getting into the whole child support discussion, You're also not able to do a 1:1 comparison because men can't get pregnant so we will go with overall, the right to bodily autonomy. Men don't have complete bodily autonomy either. Some examples are that male genital mutilation and selective service is still legal. You can also be compelled to get DNA by the courts, and are restricted on what you're able to consume. The idea of complete bodily autonomy isn't a thing.
3. Women don't have the right to feel safe at night. This one is clearly not a right and is just a personal perception of safety. Doesn't really make sense.
4. The 'pink tax'. This is just free market economics and has nothing to do with rights.

I could go on with many examples, some that I may even agree are unfair or are beneficial to men. But I can also think of situations where women benefit and men don't. This is often based on social norms and it would be ridiculous to think at any point the comparison of any demographic to another would be equal unless you are specifically seeking that outcome. But as far as rights go I can't think of one that men have that women don't.

1) Cost - The pill is often covered by health insurance for free.  
2) Surgery - It is literally surgery which is substantially more invasive than a pill.

3) Reversibility - To reverse the effects of the pill, you stop taking a pill.  Attempting to reverse a Vasectomy is another surgery, and the efficacy of the surgery is limited.    


[https://www.plannedparenthood.org/blog/are-vasectomies-reversible](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/blog/are-vasectomies-reversible)  


""in general, vasectomy reversals work in about 85 out of 100 people. But just because the vasectomy worked and there’s sperm in your semen again, doesn’t mean your partner is guaranteed to get pregnant: after a vasectomy reversal, about 55 out of 100 partners get pregnant. The rate of success can also depend on how long it’s been since you had your vasectomy — pregnancy rates are higher when you get a reversal sooner after your vasectomy. It can take a few months to more than a year after your reversal for pregnancy to happen.""  


I feel like this line is often thrown out as a saying to minimize or deflect from the lack of reproductive rights of men and is almost exactly the same argument anti-abortion activists use.    


The people who most often use this argument are the ones who hate abortion activists the most."

1,2024-02-21,CMV: I believe hiccups are a choice.,u/Powerful-Drama556,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aw3wc6/cmv_i_believe_hiccups_are_a_choice/,changemyview,"Much like my favorable opinion of Allstar by Smashmouth, this belief started off as a joke and at some point became serious. As I will explain—I became convinced this was true because of personal experiences followed by subsequent research and reflection, though I remain lighthearted to this somewhat unexpectedly inflammatory topic. I am particularly interested in hearing other perspectives because whenever I say this people they usually laugh and/or get offended, and I’ve never gotten to have a substantial discussion. I would particularly welcome contradictory anecdotes.

A couple of clarifications:

First, I am aware that there are medical conditions which can cause hiccups and can lead to hospitalization in some cases. I am not making light of them. For the sake of this discussion, psychosomatic hiccups or hiccups tied to a specific health abnormality are out of scope, since obviously the corresponding health issues are not a choice.

Second, I accept that at least the first hiccup of a bout is involuntary and therefore not a choice. At some point after the first hiccup, failing to actively mitigate hiccups becomes a choice in my view, since resignation, even if driven by apathetic indifference, is obviously within your control and therefore a choice. Since the opportunity to expunge hiccups can vary by context, for simplicity let’s somewhat arbitrarily set the threshold at three hiccups, understanding that there is situational variance in your ability to mitigate them. So, by my reckoning, the fourth hiccup is probably a choice; the tenth hiccup is almost certainly a choice; and hiccuping for minutes on end…I think that’s a weird choice.

Third, I consider willful ignorance to be a choice. Since hiccups are ubiquitous, I consider ignorance of any with well-known hiccup mitigation techniques to be willful. This may be a slight over-reach, but I don’t really care. When someone gets the hiccups, everyone offers terrible advice. I don’t care that it’s bad. After all, they chose not to subsequently verify these wives tales their elementary school art teacher told them in the 1970s. Tough luck, bad choice. It’s my opinion and I don’t care. 

Now for my much anticipated thoughts on hiccups.

I understand hiccups are the only human reflex response which serves no physiological function. Burps, farts, shivers, yawns: all serve a purpose. Then there is the hiccup: a totally useless diaphragm contraction; purportedly “involuntary” according to the…well…actual definition. Good thing we already addressed that. Only 1-3 hiccups are involuntary. Anyway the diaphragm is a (hiccup) muscle, which regulates your breathing, which I believe you can choose directly or indirectly control at some point after the first (hiccup). I believe most people choose hiccups out of apathy and misknowledge. After all, hiccup lore is bequeathed by similarly misinformed breatheren, purposefully perpetuating the perception of perpetual perpetration as proper. Poppycock. 

I personally learned to stop the hiccups by relaxing my (hiccup) diaphragm. With proper focus, I can stop after letting a single hiccup of a bout out for about 90% of bouts, or thereabouts. I learned about this by practicing about the same (hiccup) focus that I place about diaphragmatic breathing. It’s pretty cool if you think about it. However, it turns out I am not alone in possessing this enviable superpower. 

You see, I used to get a kick out of explaining my (hiccup) method to people as they were holding their breath and hiccuping away. I would wait for a moment (hiccup), and then follow up with “just stop.” (See? It worked.) More recently, I decided to escalate and would frequently ejaculate “hiccups are a choice” whenever I got the chance. Mostly at parties. Admittedly there has been backlash. Poppycock. Surprisingly, a HILARIOUS number have returned to tell tales of transitioning from tacit torpidity to their temporary throes to today turn back the turpid tumult. My observations slowly lead me to reach a hasty conclusion: most people don’t actually try to make hiccups go away, they just blindly hope for remission. I think belief in hiccup agency makes a difference, and my large body of scant evidence suggests that, at least for some members of the hiccup community, it appears possible to learn to hiccup control. 

Armed with an anecdote, I thoroughly perused the internet in a lengthy two minute search for any tangential validation. And poppycock apparently there is a technique to get rid of hiccups which works for pretty much everyone, though I have chosen not to address it here because I think I’m not supposed to advocate for a particular remedy. That said, the fact that most people have never researched hiccups obviously supports my belief that they aren’t really trying to be rid of them in the first place. Poppycock.

Given that there is a purportedly well-established method which appears to work nearly universally and it appears that almost no one is aware of it, I believe the rest of you hiccupers are willfully ignorant, simply accepting this scourge as part of life. Poppycock. Be free, not a hiccupee! I think if you believe you can’t control them, then you’re choosing them. I believe we can … you know … Just stop."

When someone traffics a quantity of substance they know there is a chance that that substance might be directly responsible for the death of someone, and same goes for car manufacturers.

Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't the root of bohemianism just to find happiness in the smallest things in life, ignore negativity and rules society throws at you, find solace in your passions and interests without worrying about other's judgement, and embrace the world as it is?

  
Ever since I started the 'bohemian lifestyle', I've begun to find a joy in life I never felt before. I've picked up interests, willing to take certain risks to experience life, learnt how to enjoy the outdoors as an introvert, gained courage to travel alone, said no to things people asked me to do as it had caused mental health issues before. It helped me filter out the people who truly deserve to be a part of my life. As someone who is too emotional, following this unconventional lifestyle has made me embrace that part of me, while helping me navigate out of issues slowly instead of worrying. I've found myself fix what needed to be fixed, and let go of something which can no longer be fixed. I know where my boundaries are.

  
Here's the reality part. I still have a full time, fairly well paying job. I do things which needs to be done (i.e. pay taxes, meet colleagues, follow the law etc.). I am not someone who has many friends, but am comfortable with the few who I can talk to today (no one is permanent). I have experienced every 'negative' job/hobby which is negatively portrayed in a bohemian (barista, writer, photographer, blogger, harpist, poet etc.), still continue with some of them till today, alongside my realist side of life. I follow the dress code at work, but follow my heart any other time. Knowing my strengths and weaknesses better as a bohemian

  
So tell me, what exactly is so bad about being a bohemian? Why are people against this unconventional lifestyle? Why are we considered narcissists, idle and careless? Why are we considered as the outsiders? Isn't everyone different in their own way?"

Knowing what will happen to someone is not the same thing as having dream doppelgangers of them. Notably, this description of events clashes with your description above. You said that the dream doppelgangers have a bunch of experiences that the external people do not have. If these ""doppelgangers"" are simply God's premonitions about the future, then this is impossible. Anything that happens to the dream self will, by definition, happen to the real person.

Knowing what will happen to someone in the future can appear in the form of a dream: in your resistance to the idea you insist it must be in God's wakeful imagination.  
In Pantheopsychism there is ""virtual omniscience"" in which God in two personalities knows of everything saved the content of consciousness of the damned. Here, it is not necessary for God to be completely omniscient. My statements of omniscience outside Pantheopsychism are blanket logic regarding the necessary relationship between external reality and God's thoughts in order for God to be truthfully and logically omniscient, re: external reality must infallibly mimic His thoughts and belief of what the future shall be.

The dream-doppelgangerism works in the""physical"" for both the saved and the damned, thus there is a ""physical"" \_virtual-omniscience\_with the partial foreknowledge shared by two versions of God: the Crucified Man and Lucid Dreamer. Some foreknowledge in the dreaming mind of the Crucified Man is externally accurate. That which is not is not because it is superceded by the foreknowledge of the Lucid Dreamer, who alters or edits the external replication of the Sacrificial Dream to ensure there is not a one-to-one replication of its content by external ""physical"" doppelgangers of characters in the Sacrificial Dream.  
>  
>  
The mental life of the damned are unknown to both versions, with the mental life of the damned supplied by God the Substance.  
>  
>  
I only use omniscience as a logic tool to show the necessary relationship between the external world and foreknowledge. I never claimed God was completely omniscient in Pantheopsychism, as to claim such would contradict Pantheopsychic Annihilationism.  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
I would like to expound upon my response to u/eggynack to show there is no contradiction between my description of what Omniscience would logically entail and the ""Selective Quasi-Omniscience"" contained in Pantheopsychic Theology, the use of Omniscience in the Pantheopsychic Comic Series and how it sat as a ding an sich as presented, with no appendage to Pantheopsychic metaphysics.  
In Issue One of the Pantheopsychic Comic series, I used the idea of and belief in God's Omniscience to demonstrate how Omniscience clashes with non-Pantheopsychic forms of Christianity's logic in why God would allow damned persons to exist in the first place, knowing via Omniscience that each individual would fail to be saved.

The issue used classical belief in God's omniscience to show that God had no good reason to create the damned given His foreknowledge of their eventual fate.    
  
The issue also supplies logic math of what Omnsicence demands in its relation to external reality.  In order for a person to be Omniscient, what the person imagines to be the future and believes to be the future (let alone the foreknowledge/pre-perception/pre-experience of everything every other being besides oneself will ever experience from birth to death, birth to eternity, or eternity to eternity) must be infallibly replicated to the most minute, unmistakable detail by the external world via a force that forces external reality to replicate the Omniscient's thoughts.  In this observation, there was no tie between Omniscience and Pantheopsychic theism at any point.

  
u/eggynack took the logic math of Issue 1 and nailed it to the Pantheopsychic occurrence of the Sacrificial Dream, believing the logic math in Issue 1 applied to the Sacrificial Dream.  I understand, now, how and why (I think) that occurred given my first post above, with the Biblical verse implying God's omniscience.  My own view of the Bible is that it is Crucific in nature (it's arguable contradictions and errors, etc. part of the Sacrificial Dream).  

  
My use of Omniscience only applied to the logic math of Omniscience's relation to the external world if it existed and the lack of logic, respectfully speaking, of God's creation of external doppelgangers of the damned knowing they would fail to achieve (or keep!) salvation and end in Hell eons before they were created/born.  It was not applied to the Pantheopsychic God or His three personalities, as the Pantheopsychic God possesses Limited or Selective Foreknowledge, whose structure is described below.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**THE SELECTIVE-FOREKNOWLEDGE OF THE PANTHEOPSYCHIC GOD**

  
In Pantheopsychic Theology, God has three personalities that manifest at three different epochs in the history of all existence.  Each personality does not have full, complete Omniscience like the Christian Fundamentalist version of God but only Selective Foreknowledge over a certain number and type of non-God being that come into existence (formed by the God-Substance as opposed to the inanity of creation or origination ex nihilo).

  
**THE LUCID DREAMER AND CRUCIFIED MAN**  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
1. Both possess Limited/Selective Foreknowledge regarding the Saved and the Damned

  
2. They possess ""physical"" (apostraphes used for the terms ""physical"" given the asserted existence of Berkeleyian Idealism in lieu of the existence of materialism, or consciousness-independent matter and energy) and complete psychological foreknowlede/fore-experience of the Saved.

  
3. They possess ""physical"" foreknowledge of the Damned only at junctures when the Damned interact with the Saved (i.e. a Damned manager at a jobsite unjustly fires a Saved ex-worker).

  
4. They have no foreknowledge of the ""physical"" actions of the Damned when the Damned do not interact with the Saved.

  
5. They have no foreknowledge of the psychological experiences of the Damned.  They only have ""jurisdiction"" of the Damned's appearance in the presence of and interaction with the Damned in both the Sacrificial (the Crucified Man's) and Heroic (the Lucid Dreamer's) respective external-reality forming Dreams.

  
**THE SUPERNAL**  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
The Supernal, the first or ""birth"" personality of God is the closest God in Pantheopsychism comes to complete Omniscience, with this Omniscience existing only in terms of God's external reality-forming imagination regarding the experiences of the Supernal Angels, who exist only between voids between this version of God's intermittent Solipsisms.

  
As the Supernal has no ability to conceive of evil and pain for even a Planck-second, the first personality of God has no foreknowledge of nor knowledge of the existence of the Damned or even the Saved in Crucific form.

  
Hope this helps.  If there is any tie between classical Omniscience and Pantheopsychic theism and metaphysics observed in *Pantheopsychic Comics,* please let me know so that I may supply a corrective addendum.

19,2024-02-21,CMV: Minorities don't need a justification to be portrayed in media,u/MaeBorrowski,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aw7u9n/cmv_minorities_dont_need_a_justification_to_be/,changemyview,"Posted this on Unpopular opinions sub (one of the most ass backwards sub I have seen honestly)


A recent trend I have noticed in criticism of media is that they are getting 'too woke'. Now in, in certain very specific cases, I do agree, mostly to do with Disney, for instance say casting a black woman for Ariel was kind of uncalled for but honestly... That is about it, but from the internet discourse, you'd think this is a larger issue.


For example, take Velma, appalling show that's one of the worst things to happen to Scooby Doo in years that has no idea of how obnoxious it is, and it got what it deserves, but the argument which was at the heart of the discourse was about its 'wokism'... How? This is an alternate reality take on the classic and race swaps some people, so what? I hear you, I just shat on Little Mermaid, but in that case it was marketed as a full on remake of the original which stayed true to the original vision, which means they were essentially trying to force down Ariel as being black, unlike Velma which was openly an alternate reality take.


This issue is not limited to Velma, say about Star Wars having a female protagonist, or Ms Marvel having a Muslim actor, Prince of Persia The Lost Crown having a dark skinned protagonist, Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League having a pride flag, Fallout show's protagonist being a woman, ANYTHING with woman or LGBT people actually etc etc. 


To address a common argument, which is that this stuff is not good representation and only pandering... That's not how it works man. White men don't need justification to be in a bad movie, so why do minorities or woman? They can be in shit media if that's what they please, there's nothing 'woke' in that. Also, Disney CEO or someone apparently said he did have a political agenda, but who cares man, that political agenda is not harmful, and that's ignoring that these guys think that a single person is responsible for every desicion in a multi billion dollar corporation. You know the real reason as to why Disney panders -sometimes-? For money, that's it, their entire political ideology revolves around money, they don't intend to take your homeland and use it to home the immigrants, they couldn't give less of a shit.


Yeah so that basically, ik it sounds counterintuitive but it is what true equality means, if white men are allowed to star in bad movies without being shat on for being 'woke', so can minorities and woman. Worst part is I have argued with some of these guys and they genuinely believe they are on a mission and are really on a noble path, but eh, maybe it's because I have stayed too long on YouTube where there is an egregious amounts of young fascists... As fucking crazy as that sounds (I found a Mussoulini edit channel once where everyone was praising him for his strong leadership...), but then again, I have met people on reddit who actually hold this opinion."

White people are doing everything possible to combat racism, to the point where black people are even given priviledges over white people. An example of such a priviledge would be scolarships that only exist for the black community. Getting a scholarship simply because of your skin color is unfair, yet it's just supposed to be accepted by all the other races as fair.

Now imagine if racism disappeared. Black people would lose their trump card, and their societal advantage. If racism disappeared, they'd no longer have something to blame to get what they want.

And the black community are infiniteely more racist towards the white community than vice versa. Blacks are constantly using derogatory name calling towards whites, such as ""colonizers"" and ""YTs"". And we're just supposed to accept that? If you watch the latest Black Panther movie, they literally refer to whites in that movies as ""colonizers"", which is a gross generalization that I thought was a bad thing, since making generalizations about black people are met with backlash. I'm pretty fucking sure I never colonized anyone, yet I'm supposed to be cool with blacks calling me that because of my skin color? But then when the generalizations come back, and crime statistics are mentioned, all of a sudden generalizations are a bad thing? 

If you go on any social media, you can see how black people are constantly hating on other blacks that dare associate with white people. Any black woman in a relationship with a white man will be bombarded with ""race-traitor"" hate mail, saying they're betraying their race.

Black people also don't accept white people in their community, as made evident right here on reddit by the /r/blackpeopletwitter subreddit, that doesn't allow people to participate in their subreddit unless you can prove you have the ""correct"" skin color, or if you kneel to the moderators and dehumanise yourself to ""prove"" you're a black supporter.

Even if a white person is trying to combat racism, the black community will attack them to make sure that the idea of racism still exists, made evident by that time an influencer tried to show how beautiful blacks can be, but was met with hate from the black community for no reason.


All of this proves that black people want to maintain their status as a ""protected species"" that can't be questioned or criticized, and somehow deserves to recieve advantages in society because of shit that happened when they weren't even born.

What's the point of trying to be accepting of the black community when that's met with nothing but racism from their side?


They fear that racism will go away, because that means their trump card and priviledges will go away as well. They would no longer get special treatment, and they'll no longer be able to yell ""racist"" to get their way anymore.

And as such, ""racism"" will always exist, because black people wont ever let it."

Israel declared their objectives as eliminating the Hamas control of Gaza, and returning the hostages Hamas kidnapped.   
Their war actually advances them in both of those objectives (For the first: reportedly 10K Hamas members are dead, less than a quarter of their divisions are still able to operate, and they barely manage to fire rockets at Israel anymore, For the second: a few hostages were released by force and more than a 100 hostages were released during a temporary truce deal that was achieved by military pressure), nevertheless, they didn't fully achieve either of those goals yet.  
Asking them to unilaterally stop the war is asking them to surrender and die, as Hamas continue to declare they'd continue killing Israelis as soon as they can. Their supporters in the west echo this sentiment (""no peace on stolen land"", ""from the river to the sea"", ""intifada"", ""we don't want no two states"").   
Even worse than that, urging them to accept Hamas' delusional demands (to release convicted murderers for example) is equivalent to urging Israel to not only surrender but also surrender on the terms dictated by the terrorist side who is miserably losing. "

But a lot of people in the west I have seen have mocked Russia for their inordinate losses in the conflict. But while I do concede a lot of excess death on the Russian side has been due to poor handling of resources and corruption I think a lot of the losses are simply the nature of a large scale war between two powers of somewhat similar military capabilities.

I think the west is not prepared for the losses in human life and machinery that would occur if they come into conflict with a determined power with somewhat similar resources to them. For example russias tank losses have been laughed at, but western tanks are not invincible they will get destroyed in a conflict like Ukraine, and in fact have been. 

NATO for far too long has been engaged in conflicts that quite frankly posed no real threat to them, Afghanistan and Iraq for example, against foes that truly are incredibly weak in terms of arms and armour, and barely made so much as a scratch on nato forces. And NATO had complete control of the skies which proved vital.

I think the public will be appalled by the sheer losses if nato were in conflict with a determined power with the material to pose a serious threat to the life of NATO troops. 

My point is in a war with China or Russia while I have no doubt that NATO would win it would be with heavy losses that the western public haven’t been used to in 70 years.

Because every culture is a collection of ideas, or more correctly, memes. According to Richard Dokinz's ""Egoistical Gene"" book, people are developing memes, aka ideas, cultural genes. By memes I'm not meaning funny pictures of internet. For example, any literature work itself is a collection of memes. Humans are developing memes since of their experience. Memes is what makes our consciousness, our worldview. 

As we can see, each culture have a sifferent assets of memes. In traditional japanese culture, ritual suicides are honorable acts when you encounter with difficult situation. Meanwhile, in british culture, suicide is shameful. Same for religions. The whole world is nothing but an arena of cultures, ethnicities. The primary goal of each culture is to gain a dominance over others, so humanuty could fulfill their need to cooperate into one society. In the end, strongest cultures will get united into one, while weak cultures will dissapear. As we can see, western culture could be considered as superculture, a collection of european countries cultures. Many europeans are learning english language so they could communicate each other. Thanks to historical events, many european countries are now united under same ideas, or memes. And they are not fighting each other like in Middle Ages. 

I comes to these conclusions due to current geopolitical situation. As a russian guy myself, I'n dissapointed how what's Puting doing, and I decide to study more about my culture. I comed with a sad truth that my culture has many destructive memes. Same for islam, which explains why many islamic states are bad countries to live. Meanwhile Japan is booming because of american occupation, and japanese are smart enough to gain memes from western cultures and integrate them into their own culture. Even suicide is not considered as honorable act in Japan anymore. Russians who are against Putin don't care about preserving their own culture. They want to leave their shithole country and start a new life in better countries, assimilating with locals. And I see conquered by Russia ethnicities are starting to have separatistic mood. I bet Russia will soon be dissolved into independent states. Nobody wants to live in a big, but poor and problematic failed state.

This is natural selection of cultures. That's all."

Over the from the 2000s up to the arrest Chris Chan, trolls usually make up  very different categories. General harassers and people who tried to help. All of them are pretty shitty and with the exception of a few, they should all be in jail for this torture.  
  
The majority of it was harassment. This involves things like what most would call cyber bullying, which there was indeed a mass cyber bullying campaign Chris due to their art, but this didn’t extend further than just leaving mean comments and doing things to get a rise out Of her. Following that is when people began watching and tracking. This is when it gets to the illegal side of things as the extent to which people were tracking her was essentially stalking.  
  
After tricking Chris into to volunteering personal information, people in the area would drive by Chris's house and post pictures of Chris online. They would steal documents from Chris’s trash, and use the information on them to manipulate her even further. They would record her on the streets and feed into Chris's delusions that they were a famous artist and had a legion of fans. The stalking continued, however more trolls took a new approach manipulation.  
  
Many trolls masqueraded as celebrities and people important to Chris in order to manipulate them. This include getting Chris to do sexual things on camera, leak nude pictures and disperse them around the internet, and make videos humiliating themselves. Some trolls pretended to be women with interest in Chris. They would also convince Chris to do terrible things to herself, they would also get Chris to destroy his own property and send out money.  
  
This is a flat out a crime. Yes you can argue that lying over the internet shouldn’t be illegal but let’s think about what’s actually happening. A large group of people knowingly decided that they would harass a severely autistic person and essentially create a Truman Show for themselves. They just wanted to see how far they could push Chris.  
  
Chris never grew passed being a child. These trolls found a person with the mind of a child and gaslit Chris for years. This isn’t a normal case of freedom of speech and “you shouldn’t always believe what you see online”. This was a campaign to stalk, harass and drive a mentally ill person insane."

When decriminalization happened, all those cities started to have total lawlessness for petty crimes lik theft, burglary, car break-ins, etc. It is hand and hand. This is a vicious cycle that won't stop until you have police enforcing the law, but a lot of them feel abandoned by their people following the dedund the police movement and so on.

Decriminalize drugs like weed and shrooms, but for HARD drugs like meth, fentanyl, heroin, that should ALWAYS be criminalized or you will never see a change. Those are drugs that literally make people go crazy to where they cannot rationalize for themselves and can cause extreme harm to other people. 

Defication in the streets, people should be arrested for it. Doing fentanyl? You should be forced into treatment. I don't understand why people don't agree with that. You aren't going to be at this epidemic with compassion, but with laws and DA's who actually have a backbone, and don't release repeating offenders over an over again.

Show some strength. Prop 47 was a mistake. It may have looked good on paper, but now you have a bunch of criminals taking advantage of DA's who don't do shit, which is why the police don't care anymore. 

Maybe if people didn't call for the defending of police, we wouldn't be in this mess, and they could actually do their job which is to ENFORCE laws created by city and state governments.

We need to also stop the source of these drugs. It starts with having a boarder that is so open, that anyone could walk in or cross. Arrest the drug dealers, stop their drug operation. At least put a hole in it. Criminalize HARD drugs or this will never stop.

It doesn't start with housing because people will continue to use these drugs even if they have a place to live! I stayed with my friends mom in Oregon, she has an apartment and uses fentanyl and heroin! They need help! They need to be forced into rehab, go through detox for more than 3 weeks, and get into a program that can help them get a job. Then housing can be talked about.

Sorry for my rant, I hate extremism on both sides. I think we need some laws back in our states where it seems like they have completely vanished, and voters will rarely admit they were wrong."

And they know that their best shot at the deaths stopping is to make Israel unilaterally do an armistice. Therefore they need to convince Israel, the United States in the public debate that they should do it. In reality the argument they'd like to use is that stopping the invasion is the morally correct thing to do, but they know that Israel doesn't much about the Palestinians, so they try to say it's in Israel's own interest to stop the war.

The argument is something like this. This will be bad for Israel because the ongoing war will radicalize Palestinians, creating future terrorists that will com back to do bad things with Israel. Therefore, to not radicalize Palestinians, they should stop the war.

There's nothing structurally wrong with this argument, but you need to understand how much Palestinians will radicalize. 

1- This argument was used before the invasion. You'd suppose that since the invasion started and 30,000 died, a lot of people have radicalized. Can Palestinians radicalize indefinitely? Maybe! But most likely there are limits to how much they radicalize. If after seeing a certain level of rage towards Israel, some people joined the Hamas, does it really matter if the Hamas terrorists are getting even more radicalized? Are they going to cause more damage because of that?

2- Indeed, if the invasion creates terrorists and radicalizes people, more reason for Israel finish the job NOW! Before these radicalized teens grow up and join Hamas themselves. Better destroy hamas before they can regroup and train their newly radicalized fighters.

3- 97% of Palestinians already had a bad view of Israel prior to the invasion. Killing 30,000 or 60,000 Palestinians shouldn't change much of Palestinians views about Israel.

4- Let's say Israel were indeed to commit genocide and they could reduce Gaza's population substantially that way. Hard to imagine how having less Gazans would be bad for Israel security.

I ain't here defending genocide or whatever. You can say like South Africa if saying ""what Israel is doing is bad and they should stop"" and that's fine. My point here is that it isn't in the Israel's security interests to stop because Gazans would radicalize.

(Obviously you can spin security arguments elsewhere. You can say: Israel shouldn't do bad things because otherwise they'll shock the people of the U.S. And they'll lose their support. OR! They shouldn't do bad things because it'll make Lebanon or Iran to attack them. And these are compelling arguments. But for them, doesn't matter how radicalized Palestinians are)"

While there’s no getting that industry back, despite what Trump has promised, we can still hire folks on as federal contractors and government employees like some kind of massive expansion to public works, agriculture, construction and development crews, etc.

The term “Woke” is already a loaded term. It's typically weaponized against the Left. What does the definition actually mean? To me, it means to obsess and believe in the end result of the “issue,” but you get blind navigating to it.

Someone like a Matt Walsh seems to dedicate his life 24/7 to talking about gender issues. I suppose a chunk of the country might even agree with him on some level. Perhaps, a few of YOU might secretly agree with his answers ---- Yet, his “wokeness” is persistent with an annoying obsession. His answers might ping as correct, but his methodology and math seem pretty wrapped in bigotry.

My weakest part of my post is the definition of “Woke.” Wikipedia seems to think they have the official definition, but I feel it's a fluid thing in the culture on how it gets used.

I think this position is a straightforward intuitive position and to think otherwise requires evidence. It provides social status that will compound all throughout someone's life, giving them better jobs and careers and everything.

Unfortunately I do not believe this is the case for females, due to the fact that females do not really gain status from having sex, but often lose it. 

I believe that among both sexes it is associated with an increase in risky sexual behaviors that can spread STDs and cause pregnancy, but this does not translate into a long term increase in this either but just a short term one when people are still getting used to sex.

We are so advanced and intelligent that we’re capable of destroying our own planet. No other species is capable of that. Everywhere you go on this planet, humans come first and other species are secondary. 

Before you downvote me, no I’m not an anti-natalist or a radical environmentalist. I believe we won’t be the ones to shrink our population; nature will beat us to it. Nature has a way of dealing with every imbalance. Of course, humans have created such a massive imbalance that nature has never been faced with such a daunting task. But eventually, nature will aggressively collapse our modern society. Whether that will be through a disease outbreak, running out of food, or perhaps extreme weather, nature will deal with us. 

We will return to being in a state of harmony with nature. Humans will be few and far between, and will live something like the Sentinelese or Jarawas live right now. I believe this because humanity has been able to overcome nearly every obstacle besides winning a fight against Mother Nature. When Mother Nature fights us, she kicks our ass. I don’t think we should fight the process either. An agrarian harmonious existence would be a lot better than our current lives. "

I don't believe they are necessarily ""stupid,"" but I do believe they make decisions based on feelings of what the data is, rather than the data itself, and these decisions typically lead to negative outcomes for themselves. 

Part of the issue is that democrats as a whole do not hold the view that there is heavy bias and manipulation in the mainstream media. It is not my expectation that people devote their life to politics, thus I do not necessarily blame them for not digging deeper to realise how badly this is the case. 

An example of this is with the debate on the book ""Gender Queer"" in American schools. As a parent, your first instinct will be to Google ""Gender Queer PDF."" The first results will link you to a redacted version of the PDF which does not include the scenes of obvious child abuse, however the actualy book does include 3 specific scenes which involve full intercourse. This redacted version is enough for most tired parents to make a judgement and allow the book for their children, and even advocate for its reading. But their view has been manipulated and is not based on the objective version of the book distributed to kids.

My view on rich democrats is that it's easier to feel like you are being nice than to actually enact on real change. Sometimes real change requires scraped elbows and knees, and standing in the way this happening actually causes more long term harm. In addition, Democrat policies tend to favour asset holders. As dollars get printed without more supply being added, the price of houses, stocks, cars, and goods goes up. If you are a holder of land and stocks, or a producer of goods, inflation increases your net worth rather than just your spending needs.

In general, I don't view democrats as bad people. I instead view them as irrational and lacking in understanding of how the world really operates."

Say there was a town of 10,000 people. The ultra rich of the town would be considered the best and treated amazing and the people in poverty would be considered less. Instead of recieving the help they need they get worse treatment making it even more difficult to come out of the hole they are in. They don't have access to many things rich people have and often times get screwed over by justice systems and more wealthy people.

What I found interesting was seeing a wealthy person convince themselves that because they are wealthy that they have authoritative power over lesser poor people. They refer to themselves as ""someone"" and refer to poor people as ""nothing"". Someone who is poor can never speak the truth about a rich person and are often silenced. When a poor person tries to talk the person they speak too pretends not to understand what they are saying and it works like a form of gaslighting.

If you have ""nothing"" people will gaslight you and treat you poorly and because ""nothing"" is your status then you will also not see privileges rich people experience when it comes to things like law and order.


You know it's a problem when rich people get a free pass legally to abuse the poor. We should be giving a ladder to people in need and not stomp on their dreams. "

1.	⁠Almost half of Del Norte is stolen Mexican land and make a border on occupied land is no border at all. If Del Norte wants to make a border then it should be set to the 1845 border.

2.	⁠Del Norte is non contiguous in nature. Not every state or territory is set within the lower 48… making a strict or closed border for the lower 48 creates an inequality among the states and territories with some getting “protection” and others not getting the same level of protection.

3.	⁠It is based in a very racist idea that Del Norte is a white country or should remain a majority white country through enforcement of borders. Having a majority white country keeps it from being truly great. It could be stated that Del Norte was never great and the only way to make it great is with diversity and inclusion. Walls/borders are inherently anti both of those guiding principles.

Cause yes if the guy has a gun your pepper spray ain't going to do shit. But you also run into the issue where you get significantly more escalation by using a gun and potentially far more consequences. Those are very difficult to balance. So I'd rather just leave it alone.

Let's focus on a few other items

1) Knives. Actually not that great as defensive weapons. You have to be close to the attacker. 

2) Electric shock devices (Like tazers). Very unreliable. We've all seen the videos of police trying to taze a guy and he just refuses to go down because they can't get a good hit on him. Also either has too few shots or requires you to be in contact with the aggressor.

3) Batons and other sticks. Not bad for certain situations. But are you really going to walk around with a police baton at all times? 

4) Things like brass knuckles. Those are only good if you're a decent fighter already. Completely useless to someone who can't deliver a good punch. Will probably do more harm than good.

The framing here is. You are out in public. Someone is acting threatening. They are threatening enough where using physical force is perfectly acceptable. Perhaps they already swung on you or something.

A similar share (29%) also express concern that an increase in immigration is leading to native-born Americans losing economic, political, and cultural influence."" Hypothetically, they may have picked a bad sample of mostly MAGA guys, but I think it's hard to disagree that it is fairly pervasive. Tucker and others built up to this theory and a lot of people bought in. 

If this figure is close to correct in 2022, then republican leaders most likely found it was popular to start talking about immigration reform. I think that Democrats thought of it as a relatively harmless issue that would satisfy republicans, and the major news networks followed with coverage about immigration when they saw it was a hot topic.

I think I should point out that I am a leftist and I do have a bias. I do want to understand what others think is the cause.

If you're unaware of the depressing state of modern society, the american version of the grt is that the elites, meaning largely democrats, are trying to replace the white population with brown and black voters so they can win elections. Nazis take this further and blame jews.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba)

The [Geneva Convention](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/war-crimes.shtml) defines a ""war crime"" to include: ""extensive... appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly"".  This straightforwardly meets the definition, since taking of houses from 700,000 people is pretty ""extensive"".

A common response to this is that the territory was seized as a result of a war that was started by the Arab states; however, under the standard definition of a ""war crime"", it doesn't matter. It's still a war crime to take civilian houses even if the other side started the war.

Other excuses I've heard in response to this argument have been ""The Arabs would have done the same or worse if they'd won"" and ""Arab countries were doing the same thing to Jews at the same time"". Even if true (and the second one is in fact true), none of these change the fact that it met the definition of a war crime when done by Israel. CMV."

Government regulated rent prices would also effect the housing market prices as home owners would no longer be able to charge absurd prices if it's actually cheaper to rent a government supplied living quarter long term.

When you study history, you see that for a long time rulers have attempted to controls their populations to ridiculous extends, but they were limited by their technology, lack of mass communication, slow transport, and so forth.

Those barriers are all gone now.

It is only a matter of time before some sort of world ruler comes to power and slowly changes the system to grant less and less freedom to individuals. But they'll be so effective at propaganda most people will welcome the changes with open arms.

Gene editing or whatever comes from that in the future will increase the divisions between elite and non-elite massively at some point.

At some point there will be someone who controls everything, and has the technology to stop any sort of rebellion or uprising, anywhere, at any time, because of their technology.

What happens when someone has unchecked power and absolutely 0 reason to listen to the people? They'll increase their oppression and exploitation to the point life becomes incredibly horrible for people.


Furthermore, imagine when they finally reach the technology required to keep someone alive perpetually. Sounds like a blessing, but death brings changes often. We'll be stuck with the same people forever at the top. And furthermore, because there is so much at stake, that further incentivizes them to make absolutely sure nobody can harm them, thus limiting everyone else's freedom.

TLDR; Thanks to future technology (surveillance, AI, gene-editing, etc.) we will eventually be ruled by a ruler that is incredibly harsh to everyone else and nobody will able to overcome them"

Earlier this week when Nalvany was most likely murdered by the order of the Russian government Biden chose to do absolutely nothing. 2 years ago he stated that there would be dire consequences if anything happened to Nalvany, but in a recent press conference he essentially said “that was 2 years ago, things have changed”. This acts as a metaphor for his presidency- he has way more bark than bite.

Another example of this were his compromises with republicans, essentially abandoning his party to continue supporting Ukraine/Israel. He completely changed his stance on border control just for the sake of staying involved in another damn war

Lastly Gun control: Biden has stated his intention to increase firearm regulation over and over again, but has he done anything? Nope! With mass shootings becoming honestly part of everyday life even in blue states such as New York it’s just infuriating how afraid he is to do anything. This brings me back to when Obama refused to say the word “gun” in his speech after the Sandy Hook school shooting being afraid to upset his opposition.

Again to clarify I know that ultimately the executive branch has pretty much no power in legislation, but the president is also a figurehead that should represent strength and freedom. Biden represents neither."

Furthermore, the Trump administration negotiated a series of treaties and normalization between Israel and several of its neighbors under the Abraham Accords, where Bahrain, UAE, Morocco and Bhutan recognized the right for Israel to exist. This was a massive step for peace in the Middle East. The last peace treaty with its Muslim/Arab neighbours was in *35years ago** in 1994 where Israel and Jordan normalized relations.

Personally I feel that too many people are too blinded by their biasness and hatred over Trump to look at it objectively. Just looking at it purely from a statistical and objective viewpoint of facts and numbers, I believe that Obama and Biden have been massive destabilization forces in the Middle East, while Trump was much better for both the Palestinians and the Israelis."

Last years was incredible for the advancement of technology via the creation and public release of LLMs (like  ChatGPT) and diffusion models like DALL-e, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney. 
The release of ChatGPT has widely been met with acclaim and support and while there are very valid criticisms - it seems that LLMs are very palatable to people in a way that the art models were not. However, even before then AI continues to advance steadily. We are getting closer to self driving cars, AI is increasingly being used in medicine, in biology, chemistry, and programming without the moral objections that come with its use in the arts. The opposition to AI Art is founded in not understanding the technology, fear of misuse, and inconsistent moral policing or fear of unemployment and future career prospects. 

Essentially, immediately after release the art community was on the defensive about the images generated by these models. Many people voiced moral objections that AI art is “stealing” or that what the model was doing was simply putting together a collage of other artists work. That what it was doing was not “real art.” Most of the people who object to it fundamentally do not understand how it works. 
The other most common arguments revolve around moral inconsistency or simply holding art to a standard that is inconsistent.

1) AI art is a collage of other pictures 

It isn’t. This one is not even a tiny bit true. Diffusion models work by a neural network wherein the network is trained to recognize that a certain tag has a certain value and attempts to recreate that Diffusion models are a type of generative model that create data similar to the data they were trained on. They do this by gradually adding Gaussian noise to training data, then learning to recover the data by going in the opposite direction. You give it 100 pictures of an apple and then ask it to make a picture of an apple and it gives you a green spherical blob and you say “this is not an apple” and continue forwards until it can pretty confidently give you an apple most of the time. You do this with thousands of concepts until it can pretty convincingly come up with an apple as drawn by Leonardo Davinci on his lunch break. At no point did Leonardo draw an apple and there are no other images for it to stick together. The image is the first of its kind and has not existed prior to this. 

But let’s assume for a moment that it is actually just a collage. Collage is a recognized art form and thus either what the model made is art or collage isn’t.

2) AI steals artists work 

Only if you believe that you are stealing when you look at someone’s work and attempt to get better at it by imitating their style at home and having someone constantly critique how close you are. Since style cannot be considered intellectual property this argument is likely proposing one of two things: (1) either the AI is using actual pieces of someone’s work (or is close enough that it could be considered theft) which is not what should be happening given the training and if it is we can fairly admit that this is a problem. (2) the AI retains artist work to use, which we know that it doesn’t as once training is complete it is using only itself. Regardless, surgeons aren’t marching in the street because robots are being trained on their images or surgeries. Programmers haven’t unionized to block AI development or refuse to paste their code to GitHub out of fear of AI taking their job. Programmers aren’t writing “poisoned code” to make sure that anything they develop is unusable by data scraping in the future. 

But let’s say that this is theft. Using art to learn is theft because the artists did not consent to it. I have never seen an AI art opponent direct people to avoid SD, DALLE, MJ and to instead use Adobe or ShutterStock or Getty. Despite the fact that these sources used their own proprietary images and pay their artists. The second that an ethical source of AI images is found the goalpost is moved to “No AI art ever” despite the images now being “ethically sourced”

3) Artists are losing their jobs 

Yes. This sucks. Just like the combine harvester made many farmhands suddenly unemployed, just like a he printing press made individual scribes no longer necessary, low skill art has now been replaced. If the entirety of your art skill was making doodles and the company now has a machine that doodles at 100x the efficiency even with an objectively worse product then your job is going the way of the dodo. The highest level of skill for artists will always remain in demand and companies will continue to need artists to edit/refine/improve the AIs content but increasingly less. But the people who cry out against this have zero moral objection to the idea that truck drivers are soon going to be replaced. They have no complaints that surgery could very soon be done better by a robot. They don’t mind at all that a computer can likely calculate your taxes better than an accountant very soon. The people who object see truck drivers, doctors, and accountants as disposable but not artists. For some reason artists are untouchable. For some reason art is sacred. I find it morally reprehensible that people that are anti-AI are okay with AI replacing manual labor or essentially any other job except their domain. Art isn’t special, it’s not holy, it isn’t sacred. It is a skilled labor just like any other. And just like any skilled labor the democratization of that labor will displace those at the lowest skill levels. That’s not wrong or bad or evil. It means that those people now have to pursue other means of survival and that’s okay. Maybe their art can be better, maybe they can find a niche that suits them with specific clients, or maybe they can expand outwards and discover entirely new forms of art that do not require a corporate sponsor to perform. If anyone can now make an okay landscape in a few keystrokes doesn’t that mean that you can now make landscapes purely for love or enjoyment? Why should the entire world hold itself back for your career when you wouldn’t do the same for anyone else’s? 

And it’s frankly dumb to hold back a technology only because it harms your career prospects. Otherwise, let’s bring lamplighters and stone throwers back so we can wake up to get to work because machines shouldn’t be waking people up 

4) AI art can create objectionable things 

Yes. With how quickly AI is evolving, very quickly you’ll be able to create a video of president trump and Biden taking turns punching a small child. This is is horrible. It’s is also something technology is 100% capable of doing right now. It’s actually something technology was capable of back in 1902 or even earlier. It’s easier now. So we should advocate for policy that all AI images should have markers that identify them as AI. But attempting to stop this technology will only force it underground where much less savory types will have free run. Making AI harmless with good policy is much better than shutting it down In a Butlerian Jihad. 
 

The camera democratized image creation. It did not make painting obsolete, it simply added another medium to create. The mobile phone democratized the camera and did not make photographers obsolete. AI art has only further increased the ease of access to art. Previously unskilled people can now bring their thoughts and feelings to life in a way they previously could not. It will not make artists obsolete - it will simply give them one more tool"

I don't really mean 'middle-class' at all, not even on it's upper level. I'm talking about billionaires, people in the top corporate positions, A-list entertainers, and such.

I lost track of how many times I heard, both online and irl, people bemoan how someone got 'corrupted' by wealth and fame, or what a great person they used to be earlier on, and so forth. The whole 'money is the root of all evil' sort of conversation. 

I don't agree. These sort of top of the top positions never work solely on talent, hell, to a large extent they don't even work solely on dumb luck, either. You need a certain type of personality to thrive in certain areas. Knowing how to be a bootlicker when required, Machiavellian, selfish, definitely some narcissism, these are the kind of things you need after a certain point.

Nobody ever gets 'corrupted'. The availability of choices never corrupts anyone, it merely reveals who that person always was, to begin with. Someone's personality doesn't change simply because they reached the 'top', they merely have the outlets to now show their true colors. "

Under such outcome of an all-out civil war:

1. The winners will be all the survivors that share the same political belief (rightism or leftism). The winners will be able to immediately enact and enforce all their desired social policies with zero opposition. The winners will have all the opportunities to create an utopia that is dominated solely by their own political ideology, a society where everyone share the same political belief and unanimously agree / disagree with every social issue without the need to go through endless debates, mutual insults, repetitive elections, and dehumanizing propaganda against the non-existent (or more accurately, no-longer-alive) political oppositions.
2. The losers will be all the dead people that are ideologically opposed to the survivors. Although the losers will no longer have the opportunity to create their own utopia, they can find solace in knowing that through their deaths, they don't need to live the rest of their lives in humiliation, fear, and hiding from a reborn society dominated by opposing political ideology that openly despise their existences. Death is a blessing to the losers, for they earn the fortune of dying with dignity instead of surviving the civil war as living losers and spend the rest of their lives in indignity due to their humiliating defeat in the all-out civil war.

Regardless of whether you win or lose in the all-out civil war, you will benefit from it. Most importantly, society will finally be given a chance to be reborn and achieve permanent peace.  
Tl;dr: Every person in the West have the moral obligation to accelerate and trigger an all-out civil war between right-wingers and leftists that ends with the complete annihilation of all leftists or right-wingers in every Western countries. Western society can only be truly peaceful when every single member of the society shares the exact same political belief."

I don’t think this is the case because not all assholes are created equally. There are assholes who are that way because they have the power to be and can’t be contended. Or there are assholes who have just been raised to be entitled. But then there are those I think have a valid reason.

My brother was a very rare person and the epitome of altruism and caring for most of his life. I recall him buying breakfast for homeless people, helping people he barely knew move and shoveling old ladies sidewalks and refusing to take payment. He isn’t religious, and didn’t even seem to get joy from doing these things so it’s almost like he was just compelled to act this way. At the same time he would regularly reach out to people who would ignore him and the vast majority would ignore him, or come up with excuses unless they needed help. I don’t recall him hanging out much with people and he became pretty antisocial around 23-24

Eventually he made a bit of money and was able to achieve an above average lifestyle. I remember he he got a home on a private beach and decided to do an experiment where he contacted people to help him move or hang out and he was met with the same response. He then began to post more on social media and when people saw his lifestyle, they began reaching out to hang out or just talk and catch up. 

Today he’s a very straight forward, blunt and what I think most people would consider an asshole. Like if you needed to buy food for your kids and asked him for a dollar, he’d probably say fuck you and your kid. It’s just a general lack of concern for and care for people around him. 

To me this seems like a justified reason to be an asshole. I dont see how someone could tell him not to be an asshole based on his experience because it will always be skewed wouldn’t it?"

In my opinion ice hockey is the only team sport that one can objectively say is the hardest sport to learn. Every other sport as its very core requires one thing to get started in it; the ability to walk/run. Unless you are wheelchair bound, you can get started learning the basics of any given sport pretty much today. And for most sports the basics include footwork and throwing and/or catching an object which are all very human things. You’ll basically be running around while preforming the sport on top of that. With ice hockey you need to learn to skate before you can begin learning any of the basics of the sport. Once you’ve learned to skate, then you can begin preforming the sport on top of that new skill of skating.

Lastly let me make an example. If we took an average Joe with no experience playing any sport and stuck them in a game of basketball they would be terrible, BUT they would be able to run around the court. They probably won’t get passed the ball and probably won’t even touch the ball and they’ll be clueless defensively, BUT they would be actively participating in the game due to their very basic ability to atleast be able to navigate the court. If we took that same person  and dropped them in an ice hockey game they wouldn’t even be able to stand up let alone navigate the ice, thus rendering them unable to even participate.

I (52 y/o F) am a loner and have mostly always been a loner (married to a 54 y/o M who is the same). I am great with people and have always worked in customer-facing positions. When in social situations, I am extroverted. In those moments I enjoy myself but not enough to seek out the company of others very often.  
  
I don't even attend family functions beyond meeting with one sibling and their partner at a time, or meeting with my parents only, but no siblings. I have about a 4-hour limit on visiting and prefer to socialize perhaps one weekend out of every six.  
  
I find people interesting and like jumping into personality and philosophy-driven conversations relatively easily, even with people I don't know well or haven't known long. People seem to find me highly likeable and feel that we have been long-time friends in a relatively short period of time.  
  
I WARN PEOPLE that I am as I've described myself above. I don't give that much detail but I DO say, ""I'm mostly a loner. I have about a 4-hour max visiting limit."" However, I always say it smiling and they kind of laugh and say things like, ""Me too! I'm such an introvert."" However, it seems to always turn out that they didn't really believe me or take me at my word.  
  
Months or even a couple of years go by. They are almost always the one to initiate efforts to spend time together. As soon as I say ""Yes"" to an event and mark it on my calendar, I feel a sense of bondage and repression. The closer the date comes, the more anxiety I have. I still attend and I do get some enjoyment out of the event. Inside I feel like I've done something ""good for me"" by connecting with someone.  
  
Experts tell us that having a community and developing friendships are good for our mental health and good for society. I want to make an effort to do these things. I track, on my calendar, that ""I socialized"" - just as one would track drinking 6-8 glasses of water, or keeping up with an exercise routine or calorie counting.  
  
The reality is that the friend realizes that I will always have somewhat more of a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" attitude toward the relationship than they do. That does not mean it isn't special to me - precious, even - but not vital. Not necessary. That hurts them. I say ""Yes"" to too many things to try and alleviate what I know is an imbalance and then I hit a wall.  
  
Usually in January or February, when it's the dead of winter and I just don't want to keep going out on weeknights in the dark to keep up the friendship to a level tolerable to the other person. I put up a boundary and meet with resistance and surprise. I remind my fledgling friendship that I'd explained who I was from the start.  
  
They say I was so obviously having fun when we were together that I was either a) lying to them and pretending to have fun or, b) lying to them now about the reason I don't want to spend time with them on this particular occasion. I defend myself. They end the friendship. I am bewildered yet relieved.  
  
Every time I allow the approach of friendship, I feel like I've stuck my finger in a machine that then grabs me and starts to pull my whole arm into it. I just want to chew my arm off and get as far away as I can. I have now concluded that perhaps loners should not have friends. I'd love to be persuaded that I'm wrong or get any tips from loners who successfully maintain a couple workable friendships without it being lopsided and unjust to their friends."

Isn't this a dangerous precedent? If you don't agree with this view tell me why. Why do you think the October 7 attacks should be rewarded 

It's the reason why India does not support Palestine. Nor does China. Nor does Saudi Arabia because it does have a Shia separatist group operating in its Eastern region.

The erasure of white males resulted in historical inaccuracies. It must have been difficult for white males to have trouble finding images of themselves in media, but it's a problem that every minority group in America has dealt with for a century. For example, just yesterday, USC released a study showing that [female leads in movies reached historic lows](https://variety.com/2024/film/news/inclusion-study-2023-historic-low-women-in-leading-film-roles-1235917950/) last year. Women are half the population and yet were leads or co-leads in less than a third of the 100 top grossing films of the year. The number of Black roles in film/TV is finally proportional to the Black population in America, but the words they speak are [not likely to have been written or directed by a Black person](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/black-representation-in-film-and-tv-the-challenges-and-impact-of-increasing-diversity). Meanwhile Latinos are the second largest racial/ethnic group in the US [but have only 5.5% of speaking roles in film/TV](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/latino-representation-movies-study-1235637531/). What that means is whenever a person from a minority group turns on a tv or goes to see a movie, they are not likely to see themselves, and when they do see themselves, it may be a culturally or historically inaccurate depiction, not unlike what white males are experiencing with Gemini. But their problem will be fixed more quickly. 

To CMV, convince me that the problems are fundamentally different, the consequences are fundamentally different, or that the Gemini issue of underrepresentation will not be fixed more quickly than mass media's issues of underrepresentation."

On October 7th, Hamas took about 240 Israeli and foreign civilians as well as Israel soldiers hostage and brought them to Gaza. They are often used by Israeli authorities as a justification for their war on Gaza. If Hamas is dismantled and the hostages are released, the war will end, [Netanyahu repeated it again this month](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-02-14-2024-15eb8cbd5f15d52928711193081fe9c6#:~:text=Netanyahu%20has%20vowed%20to%20continue,Palestinian%20prisoners%2C%20including%20top%20militants).

Regarding the remaining hostages, we can clearly see that in reality, they do not care one single bit. First off, we can look at how Israel rescued hostages in the past.

The first one is the Entebbe raid of 1976. I won’t delve into the story in too much detail, but Israel sent a special forces commando to rescue the hostages who were held in an airport in Uganda. The operation, while not perfect, was a success : out of 106 hostages, 102 were rescued, 4 were killed and the commando only suffered one casualty (Netanyahu’s older brother).

Another precedent is the case of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. He was kidnapped in 2006 and held in Gaza for 5 years. [In 2011, he was exchanged for 1027 Palestinian prisoners]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit_prisoner_exchange). You can call it a bad deal for Israel, but at the end of the day, he was released and no one was killed in the process. 

If Israel really cared about the lives of hostages, it could have tried sending some commandos into Gaza or struck a deal like in the case Gilad Shalit. Some hostages were released this way through prisoner exchange deals during [the November 2023 ceasefire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_ceasefire#:~:text=A%20temporary%20ceasefire%20between%20Israel,during%20the%20Israel%E2%80%93Hamas%20war.) : 105 civilians were released, which included 81 people from Israel, 23 Thais and one Filipino, in exchange for 240 Palestinian ""prisoners"" (hostages too really), 107 of whom were children, and three-quarters had not been convicted of a crime.

Instead of continuing to negotiate, the Israel government and the IDF chose to pretty much destroy all the Gaza, killing many hostages in the process : 

- Alon Shamriz, Samer El-Talalqa and Yotam Haim [were killed by the IDF]( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/15/israeli-military-says-its-troops-shot-and-killed-three-hostages-by-mistake) in December 2023 in Gaza as they were trying to be rescued, they were visibly unarmed and shirtless and waving a makeshift white flag when they were killed.

- Ron Sherman and Nik Beizer, and Elia Toledano were likely [killed by and IDF bombing]( https://www.972mag.com/weapons-toxic-gas-gaza-hostages/).

- Earlier, on October 7th, 13 hostages held by Hamas fighters in a house in Kibbutz Be’eri [were possibly killed by an IDF tank](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-01-06/ty-article/.premium/families-of-israelis-killed-in-beeri-home-hit-by-tank-fire-on-october-7-demand-probe/0000018c-de77-daf6-a5df-df7f22d60000).

Outside of prisoners trade deal, wanna know how many hostages the IDF has rescued with their methods? Three. Private Ori Megidish was freed during a ground operation by the IDF in late October 2023,  Fernando Simon Marman and Louis Har were rescued in February 2024. 

Is this the behavior of a government and army that cares about hostages and tries to rescue them? It all makes sense if you have heard about [the Hannibal Directive]( https://archive.ph/20231221001524/https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2023-12-13/ty-article-opinion/.premium/if-israel-used-a-procedure-against-its-citizens-we-need-to-talk-about-it-now/0000018c-6383-de43-affd-f783212e0000#selection-963.175-963.335), which allows the IDF to endanger (read : to kill) a soldier to prevent them from being kidnapped.

Hamas [proposed a deal](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-02-14-2024-15eb8cbd5f15d52928711193081fe9c6) to release the hostages, and Netanyahu refused it : 

>Hamas has said it will not release all the captives until Israel ends its offensive, withdraws from Gaza and releases a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including top militants. Netanyahu has rejected those demands, calling them “delusional.”

The relatives of the hostages said Mr Netanyahu's decision amounted to a “death sentence” for their loved ones.

Again, you could say it's a bad deal, but if Israel's government really cared about hostages they would have taken it. They simply don't care about the hostages, they don’t mind them being killed, they are used as a pretext to continue their war on Gaza, [which plausibly constitutes a genocide]( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/01/genocide-gaza-israel-california-court#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYet%2C%20as%20the%20ICJ%20%5B,Joe%20Biden%2C%20Antony%20Blinken%2C%20the) according to the interim ruling by the ICJ."

i don’t think fighting is funny or exciting, i used to but now it’s just dumb. i never been in a fight and hopefully i won’t but i see a lot of videos on twitter and there’s fights that happen in my school & they’re really awful. it’s usually always so brutal, hair pulling, body slamming, nose bleeds, knockouts, jumping…

and the worst part about it, it’s usually over something dumb…like drama. i don’t think drama is something worth fighting about, i used to want to fight others who talked trash about me but it’s not worth it. yea it hurts but just because you guys fight doesn’t mean they’ll stop bc it’s their mouth. you’d be the better person just letting them be miserable then going to their level, they’ll get theirs one day.

not to mention, you can seriously hurt someone. id never want to make someone bleed or go to the hospital, that’s inhuman and you’d also get in trouble, a person can press charges on you. i’ve seen videos where people get seizures or concussions because of how much damage they suffered from rights and it’s terrible, that could also be you and i’m pretty sure you don’t want to suffer like that. 

it’s not a good way to control your emotions, if anything it makes it worse if you resort to physical violence once you are mad or upset. also, it can make people scared of you and that’s not a good thing.

it can also get you in trouble, like for a job or school if someone sees or gets a video of you fighting. no one is gonna wanna hire a violent person and schools obviously will suspended you for fighting and nobody wants that to happen. 

overall, please don’t fight. there so many girls at my school who always like to fight other girls and thankfully i stay out of the mess so they don’t attack me but they can be so vicious…

that’s all."

I don’t mean just loving the character they play in a movie or show, I mean genuine infatuation with them as a person. 

One of the arguments I’ve been presented for this is: “You don’t stop finding people attractive while in a relationship”. That in itself is true, but that is not the same as having a crush on a person. I find Zac Efron and Chris Hemsworth attractive, however, under no circumstances would I want to hug, kiss, date or have sex with them as I don’t have a crush on them.

Another argument is that: “It’s harmless, it’s not like they’ll ever meet them”. That is also most likely true, but the statement implies that, if given the chance, they’ll leave their partner for said celebrity. Or, arguably even worse, implies that you are someone they settled on, a 2nd option, as they can’t have their celebrity crush. “I’d prefer Zendaya, but I can’t have her, so you’ll do”, in a way.

I simply can’t imagine having (established, not fleeting) feelings that semblance a “crush” while in a relationship. "

Also im a former alcoholic and i hate the smell of alcohol but im not going to judge someone who drinks alcohol juat because I hate the smell of liqour.

The complaint is usually from the older boomer crowd where weed was still a major criminal offense. Then it comes from the religious crowd that is still mad that alcohol is legal and now weed is too. Sorry not sorry but stoners are good for business at least restaurants anyway. Because the more munchies stones get then the more food they buy and if they buy more food then that means more jobs for the economy. Sorry but restaurants should not have to kick stoners out just because you hate the smell of weed. If you are sensitive to the smell of weed then that is your problem and too bad no one is catering to your sensitive smell whether it be your neighbors or in public.

I feel as though espressions such as ""I want to die"" are not uncommon in conversation. These statements may seem insensitive to those individuals who are battling strong suicidal thoughts, but I do not think they are anything more than a coping mechanism. Obviously, know your audience, and if you're with someone who has struggled with suicide refrain from such comments. There is a balance to be struck between expressing one's feelings and considering the potential effects on others. But these offhand expressions of suicide are just ways are people expressing relief from current circumstances. Once again I do not want to minimize the seriousness of suicide. I also think people who make these passive comments excessively are exempted from this argument, as that crosses a line to where it becomes concerning. 

These comments about wanting to die might seem to suggest that escaping today's problems and the thought of easily leaving behind daily struggles could look tempting. However, in saying this and not acting on it you're also showing resilience and the understanding that suicide is not that simple of a solution.

15,2024-02-22,CMV: A key issue within the inpatient mental health care system in the US is the pay gap between psychiatrists and milieu staff,u/embercat_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1axeylk/cmv_a_key_issue_within_the_inpatient_mental/,changemyview,"I'm focusing on the United States for this discussion because that's where my understanding of mental health care systems is strongest. The mental health care system is crucial for the overall health and well-being of society. In particular, inpatient mental health care facilities play a vital role for patients in acute crises, providing a space for them to adjust medications and stabilize. However, these facilities face significant challenges, including poorly trained staff, understaffing, negligent behavior, and a lack of resources for patients. A fundamental issue behind these problems is the inadequate pay for milieu staff.  
For instance, a friend of mine works in a psychiatric hospital earning $17 an hour despite having a degree. Her responsibilities encompass leading group therapy sessions, conducting regular five-minute checks on patients, assisting those unable to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) such as personal hygiene and bathing, organizing activities and meal times, and overall, ensuring the smooth operation of her unit. She faces verbal and physical injuries almost daily. She's been slammed against walls, bit, had her hair pulled, been punched, kicked, etc. Her coworker literally got concussed because a patient headbutted her in the head. Another coworker was dragged across the floor by her hair. She is dedicated to building rapport with patients and loves her job, yet struggles to pay off her student loans. To make ends meet, she works overtime for extra shift bonuses. However, mental health care is not suited to overtime work. Staff need time away from work to practice self-care, ensuring they and their patients benefit from the best possible care. Yet, financial pressures from education debt make this balance difficult to achieve.  
The field struggles to attract new professionals because few want to endure mental exhaustion, physical injury, and inadequate compensation. Meanwhile, psychiatrists in these settings earn significantly higher salaries. My friend observes that psychiatrists spend about an hour at most on the unit per her 12-hour shift on-site, yet their income is substantially more. While psychiatrists undergo extensive training, expensive education and face their own set of challenges, much of their ability to work effectively depends on the continuous support from milieu staff, who are always on the front lines with patients.  
Offering reasonable salaries to milieu staff could transform mental health care. It would attract more professionals to the field, reduce staff burnout, increase competency, and decrease turnover rates. This change could significantly improve the quality of care provided. Mental health care should not compromise on standards or cut corners, especially when it comes to staffing and patient care. Prioritizing fair compensation for all mental health care professionals is essential for the health of the system and the well-being of its patients. This issue also affects social workers, who are significantly undercompensated for their extensive workload and the emotional toll their roles take. Given the substantial salaries allocated to psychiatrists, it's evident that the mental health care sector has the financial capacity to offer better remuneration.

I am coming here because maybe I am looking at the wrong area that needs changed. Maybe it extends deeper and is rooted in the expenses of education. However, I struggle to see how allocating more money to milieu staff salaries would be a negative thing for mental health care facilities. Thank you for taking the time to read this (:"

There should never be a point where these people get out of prison where these feelings never do go away, there is no way of rehabilitating it, and now they have to live a certain number of feet away from children, but do you think these feelings go away, no they don’t. So why do we let them out? Why do we let them find jobs? They are permanently damage and need to be removed from society. There should be no sex offender list for pedophiles as they would be in prison. Families would not have to be worried people potentially marrying these monsters, would not have to be worried. Jobs that would be hiring someone would not need to worry. Everyone would be in prison. The other option would be total castration.

Pedophilia (alternatively spelled paedophilia) is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children. Although girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12, psychiatric diagnostic criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13. People with the disorder are often referred to as pedophiles (or paedophiles).

I have always opposed Trump and Trump'ism. I don't like the man at all. Furthermore, I believe he is a threat to democracy.

I understand that “we” didn't trigger that defamation civil trial involving the alleged rape of E. Jean Carroll. This plays out in the courts and the American justice system. This went to a jury, and they determined that he raped her. That's just how it needs to be framed. 

The alleged story itself is quite fantastical in many ways. I would have assumed there would be a bit more public skeptical commentary about it, but there was largely none.

Mostly, the allegation is made with zero evidence. It went to a civil trial. Trump loses.

I'm not trying to be a so-called contrarian edge-lord, but I have this feeling we can't take our dislike/hatred of Trump, and then cause ourselves to get blinded by something that appears to be absurd.

I felt like political media (perhaps more liberal) didn't much as raise a finger at really analyzing this particular case. The issue of a Presidential contender being a rapist seems like a very serious thing ---- but, it didn't appear that way in the media. It was just more of the never-ending Trump circus.

Again, with the case itself, the allegations did seem very unbelievable logistically. It wasn't explored much how one of the most famous men in America raped (his rival) in the middle of a busy Manhattan department store. E. Jean Carroll herself is a bit of a flamboyant character, and has a history of weird Trump coincidences.

I refer to the idea of romance/courtship/dating, which I have heard talked about by girls and young women both in person and online, which posits that romantic relationships ought to be initiated through hints. This is directly inspired by a TikTok I saw recently of a young woman yelling ""Why can't men take a fucking hint?"" with hundreds of thousands of likes.

The idea that men should ""take a fucking hint"" is contradictory to the idea of consent. Definitionally, a hint is implicit; therefore insisting upon building romantic and/or sexual relationships on hints cannot coexist with explicit consent. 

Patriarchy is not a system solely enforced by men. It is enforced by women as well. This is just one example among many; another one that I've seen a lot online recently is women getting ""the ick"" from men behaving in non-traditionally-masculine ways. (If anyone wants to argue that the patriarchy cannot be enforced unintentionally, because these women are obviously not intentionally supporting a system that oppresses them, I would encourage them to apply that same logic to enforcement actions that come from men. Rarely are these directly enforced intentionally; male enforcement of the patriarchy often comes from insecurity or self-interest as well as from misogyny.)

Note that I am not saying that the act of hinting is anywhere near as morally wrong as the act of rape; the latter is obviously and unquestionably worse. I am merely saying that the two are both manifestations of the same cultural idea: that sexual and romantic relationships can and should be initiated without explicit and enthusiastic consent. Getting rid of one will require getting rid of the other."

Organisation, purely by the metric of popularity/’solidarity,’ is far easier on internet, it becomes possible to generate the interest of thousands or millions in days at clicks of a button. Deeper systems of organisation are often lost however. What you have is an organised mass who, on an internal level, is deeply disorganised. 

This shows it’s face at the sophistication of protests, which have lost hierarchical structure and pragmatic purposes in return for larger groups. The structures we are facing are very real, we can’t expect to understand them if all of our discourse and interaction exists outside of the systemic reality we are talking about. When a movement is dispersed and one step removed from reality, it also becomes even easier for current powers to co-opt and change the narrative. 

This online mode of organisation has been denoted as the both impetus and downfall of the Arab spring, where online fervour turned to mass protests and ousted Mubarak but did not have the organisation or functional capacity to deal with the political vacuum, so the military co-opted the sentiments and secured power.

The same, I believe, could be said for BLM, where the black emancipatory movement was promoted en-masse but eventually lost steam with no clear organisational purpose, so the neoliberals they set out to emancipate from in the first place often decided to co-opt the movement themselves and even commodified it.

As someone who doesn’t believe in god, I am consistently baffled by the decisions made by those who do. As an example, my Muslim friend consciously ate some of my sandwich (with permission lol) that had bacon on it because I told him he could before remembering that it has pork so he built up the expectation of eating when he was hungry, and continuing to go hungry was apparently worse than violating one of the rules laid out by a supreme power. That is entirely nonsensical. And before any Muslims start attacking him for being a ‘fake Muslim’ for doing so, do you drink alcohol, or have you ever done so? Do you have or have you had premarital sex? Etc. etc, the list goes on. And that applies to other religions as well, I don’t think I need to list off all the things people do that their religion says they shouldn’t, we all know that practice is very prevalent. 

But why is that the case? It makes absolutely no sense to me. I sure as hell wish there was a god, and if I had rock solid evidence that there was, I would consider what that god would think of pretty much everything I do.

Evidence strong enough is what it would take for me to believe, and others who I’m talking about already do believe. It’s not the evidence itself that would push me to do so, it’s the knowledge/belief that a god exists that would. 

A lot of people who also don’t believe in god (or at least a specific one) seem to believe that being moderately religious makes more sense than being devoutly, or extremely (not in the extremism sense) religious. Essentially, it makes more sense to be… “semi Jewish” (what’s the right term here lmao, I know that’s not it) than it does to be an Orthodox Jew. I wholeheartedly disagree with this. If one believes that there is a god, it makes way more sense to model your entire life around that belief than it does to sparingly follow the rules and choose which ones matter. If anyone disagrees, I’d love to hear how and why."

89,2024-02-22,CMV: King Theoden should have ignored the Elephant Army in Return Of The King.,u/Legmog,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1axihgi/cmv_king_theoden_should_have_ignored_the_elephant/,changemyview,"I'll be referencing THIS video... [https://youtu.be/Jl8TiA3RwIY?si=r62nQKMgffK\_N4r2](https://youtu.be/Jl8TiA3RwIY?si=r62nQKMgffK_N4r2)

So we all know this scene... The Rohan army has routed the Orcs. The Orcs flee, but the Oliphant / Haradrim army appears. Thoeden orders a full frontal cavalry charge against the Oliphants... But this (in my opinion) is dumb as hell...

We can see at 0:48, 1:08 and 1:35 that literally THOUSANDS of Orcs are retreating behind the Oliphants. Hell it looks like the Rohirim have routed near enough the entire Orc army that's outside of Minis Tirith. It would be MUCH better to IGNORE the Oliphants completely and....

Go around to the left and right of them. Or go THROUGH them (similarly to how they do in the film)... But once you've gone through them... KEEP going and focus on slaughtering the retreating Orcs. Prevent them from rallying to fight another day. They're already in a state of routing.... It's an EASY slaughter.

The Cavalry is fast... The Oliphants by comparison are much slower... Theoden should have utilised this advantage. By focussing on fleeing Orcs, that's literally THOUSANDS of easy kills. The Oliphants would either have to turn around and pursue to help their fleeing allies, or carry on to Minis Tirith... In which case.... So what? The Oiliphants are too small to fit through the city gates, and even if they DID get into the city... They'd be pinholed into narrow passageways. They'd be easy targets, and probably trample more friendly Orcs than Gondor soldiers.

Theoden deciding to engage the Oliphants in a full frontal charge, maximises his own weaknesses, and plays directly into his enemies strength.... Turning the battlefield into a bloody meatgrinder slog, putting cavalry against the absolute tank Oliphants. You're ignoring 'easy kills' in favour of EXTREMELY difficult kills... Those thousands of retreating Orcs are able to once again fight for Sauron another day. And the Oliphants never posed a great threat to Gondor anyway....

Convince me I'm wrong!

And to add on she has to deal with having periods every month for years of her life just to be able to give birth to the child. I think the real problem is that all this is see as invisible labour and goes unrecognised when really this is A LOT. A man does not go through any of this. 

And to add, a woman’s body is biologically designed to take care of and nurture the child e.g. breastfeeding.

In my opinion I don’t see how it is equality if the man has a 50/50 chance of gaining custody of the child. The woman should get custody 100% of the time UNLESS proven that she is mentally unfit or is incapable of taking care of the child. I only see that as equal.

1,2024-02-22,CMV: it’s better to have sex abnormally early than abnormally late (males consensual),u/ImmanuelYemos,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1axjb8u/cmv_its_better_to_have_sex_abnormally_early_than/,changemyview,"tl;dr: I’m not including anything non consensual. It’s better to lose your virginity from age 12-15 than age 25+ if you’re male. I believe for females it’s reversed. Either way the optimal age is 18

Long version:

A decent portion of this is inspired by this paper https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4165811/#R44 basically I think for males it’s better to be in the pseudomature category of people who aggressively try to have sex at age 12 and are successful at having it early over the people who don’t have sex until after 25. 

We can all agree that losing your virginity at age 18 is absolutely optimal, but my point is that the grass is greener on the other side. Being an incel and unable to have sex at age 25 (every male 25yo virgin is either an incel or a priest/monk) is worse than being a highly status seeking socially undeveloped person with a criminal record who has had sex with a lot of people and possibly has an std. 

Basically I think overall the person with lots of sexual experience and stds and a criminal record and inability to have functional relationships can fix their life, but the 25yo virgin or worse a 30yo virgin cannot fix their life even if they are both high income and high prestige due to their educational background.

Both have lives that suck, but they got unlucky at not losing their virginity at 18 like normal people. But the early virginity person with nearly the worst scenario has things better than the late virginity person with nearly everything in their favour. The grass is definitively greener on the other side.

I’m a late virginity person and I can conclusively say the early virginity people I’ve known were all in better situations than me. The grass is greener on the other side

Obviously being molested is a separate issue and being female this is swapped so better to be abnormally late due to social stigma and slut shaming."

1,2024-02-22,CMV: Your relationships arent determined by how your mom/dad treated you,u/No-Square6519,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1axkttt/cmv_your_relationships_arent_determined_by_how/,changemyview,"Key word being determined. To expand on the point im making. If you are a girl, you don't seek men who act like your dad. If youre a boy you dont seek women who act like your mom. ( ik this logic applies to any sexuality)I want to use an example bc i feel like thats easiest for me.  
So, imagine a person with 2 parents. Let's say parent 1 is kinda cold, reserved, and not very expressive. Lets say parent 2 is loving, expressive, and outgoing. These parents dont get along very well. They argue and have disagreements frequently and they never end well.  Some people would say this is mostly determined by gender. If the child of these parents was a girl, and parent 1 was a boy, a lot of ppl have the opinion the girl will seek men like her father. Cold, reserved, and not expressive.  If the child was a boy, ppl might also say he would seek women who are loving, expressive, and outgoing. Simply bc they set the example for how that gender acts, or something along those lines.  
I disagree with this logic. I dont think a parent's gender, plus how they treated you, equals how your relationships will go. In the example I used, the parents didnt get along. I find it far more likely the child of the parents will treat their partner similar to how their parents treated another. Id assume the child of these parents to solve conflict the way their parents did, rather than searching for a partner LIKE their parents.  You're parent's relationships is your primary example of how relationships work. Even if they're not together currently, the time they were together, and even stepparents, still come into account. The way the make decisions, and solve conflict might set similar expectations in your dating life. Now gender does matter in some cases. Say parent 1,from my example, liked to make the rules. And parent 2 had little to no authority, their gender might matter more bc you assume the gender of the authoritative one to be important in their role. Or like, mom is solely responsible for housework and chores. so some people apply that to their own dating life. and that its a womens job to do x,y,z. However, this really only matters if your parents were big on gender roles. bc there also teaching you that gender roles apply and that goes for more than just relationships.

  
   Now i also believe  parents' personality has an important impact on a child but like, not necessarily  towards dating. To use my own life is an example. My dad is a jack ass and my mom is bonkers. Both equally absent but at different times.  Ive had a lot of people tell me, or witnessed men telll women like me that, bc we have an absent dad we're easy, or crazy or insert stereotype here. Solely because of my father. I saw this logic become popular on tik tok and social media. This idea has existed for awhile, but i think some TikTok knock off therapist incorrectly explained things and reinforced this idea. I know women and men who use the logic im disagreeing with. Its just annoying to see bc it it makes to kinda weird. Like ive seen multiple tiktoks of these dads taking their daughters out to eat or shop. The caption is usually ""taking my daughters on nice date she doesnt settle for your crusty son"" like no joke usually something like that. Like bro your her dad. your taking her to dinner . ik there not making it sexual or implying anything gross. but the implaction is still ""I am dad, this is daughter, I must treat daughter good so she finds good man"" like bro just treat ur child good bc ur a child.  
   So, obvi treating your child bad might make them put up with bad behavior.  But it mostly just messes them up in every way and that happens to apply to relationships as well. If you want your child to have healthy relationships in life set the example. Treat your partner nicely and have equal roles. Solve conflict peacefully and here each other out. That will determine more than anything what your child will expect later in life.

It is in my opinion that humanity's last great achievement was landing on the moon. 55 years ago.

Since then (outside of smartphone technology, which isn't a positive achievement IMHO) there has been no big breakthroughs.

For a few examples:

a) We still haven't landed humans on other planets or even sent any probes past Saturn after Voyager (New Horizons being an exception)

b) Still haven't gotten a flying car, or anything that will put the airlines out of business, or even an actual jetpack

c) We still haven't eradicated cancers/AIDS/genetic disorders/neurodivergence or created cures for them

In fact, one could make an argument that humanity has regressed in ways. For example:

a) While AI/Smartphones exist, all they're used for is are stupid things (joke images, social media, etc)

b) Plenty of adults unironically believe vaccines are bad, leading to long beaten diseases to come back

c) Anti-intellectualism is still rife in society (despite intellectuals being the reason for what little progress we have), and it seems the dumbest people get to the top despite being dumb.

1,2024-02-22,"CMV: The American welfare state is different from the ones European/Nordic nations nets *not* because Americans are blind, ignorant and stupid but because we’re a different nation with a different culture.",u/nowlan101,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1axmz1p/cmv_the_american_welfare_state_is_different_from/,changemyview,"It’s almost a cliché at this point to hear Europeans or americans on the far left complain about how americans just don’t seem to know what’s good for them when it comes to social safety nets. The reasons are usually clustered along these 3 prongs.

1. Americans are too stupid and stubborn to change their ways.

2. Americans are too racist to improve welfare programs because they feel it disproportionately benefits Black Americans. 

3. Americans *would* support these programs but the big bad Republican party, through a combination of brainwashing and lies, convinces these poor, simple folk not to support expansive union protections and an expanded welfare state.

While for the most part I understand each point made here, and agree there is an element of truth each, Liberals and Europeans once again underestimate the sincerity of their beliefs. Americans are not confused Europeans, we are americans and we have our own ways of doing things both nationally, internationally and locally. And I’d argue it’s been like this for a while.

Take a look at [this study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-american-political-development/article/public-opinion-organized-labor-and-the-limits-of-new-deal-liberalism-19361945/BE6F3649EBF096131A7A9BDC10D903DF) here done on early American polls taken during the New Deal era, arguably the high point of both labor and European style safety nets in US history.

When things like social security, unemployment, the NLRB and other worker protections were enshrined in federal law. While the polls show broad support in principle for those safety nets, by 1937/38 we see the beginnings of a backlash against the New Deal policies. Not because Americans were too ungrateful for the largesse handed to them but because they had sincerely held beliefs about individual rights and the role of the federal government. In large part this can be traced to the increasingly negative opinions on labor unions, which then spilt over to the wider economy.

The fact of the matter is outside a few echo chambers, the public doesn’t like strikes and they don’t like labor radicalism. It was true then and I have no reason to think it wouldn’t be true now as well. Yes big business I’m sure spent money to try and sway the public against labor. And? Labor did the same thing too so it’s not as though they were being unfair or cheating by advocating for their interests and if the American public supports that. Then who are we to say they were too dumb to realize the “mistake” they were making.

From 1937 well into 45’ the American public inexorably turned against unions. In the north, the south, the west and the east. Even among two or even three time Roosevelt voters. Labor has a right to strike and that should never, ever be taken away. But the public has a right to decide to punish them for it.

Look at this extract from the article:

>  a January 1936 Roper poll asked respondents: “Do you believe that any of the following abuse their power?: Bankers, Press, Radio, Pulpit, Veterans.” Labor unions were not even offered as a response option, suggesting that unions were not, in the immediate aftermath of passage of the Wagner Act, viewed as particularly powerful.
But two years later it was a much different story.

> when Roper asked “Which of these is most in need of reform?” Indeed, unions were by far the top choice: while 38 percent of respondents claimed that labor unions were “most in need of reform,” just 14 percent listed public utilities, 13 percent listed stock exchanges, and 4 percent cited the Supreme Court.
Things like labor policy and “closed” or “open” shops had little widespread support either. Even among traditionally pro-labor voters and that’s carried into today. But labor isn’t the only focus here, it’s the prism by which we can see larger attitudes of the American public when it came to spending on federal programs. To be clear, Americans wanted to keep the policies and laws on the books already by a strong and sizeable majority. However,

> a March 1940 Roper–Fortune survey asked what respondents wanted the next administration to do about the New Deal. Of those with an opinion, a mere 13 percent wanted to “go farther with it,” while another 18 percent wanted to “keep it as it is.” A plurality of 45 percent wanted to “modify it,” while 23 percent favored “repealing most of it.” Northern whites were actually less supportive of going further with or keeping the New Deal “as it is” than were Southern whites, though the difference disappears when one isolates Roosevelt voters. 

Americans didn’t want then and don’t want now revolution. They want incremental modification and adjustments.
And as the war wound to a close,
> Gallup began to ask whether respondents preferred for the administration to “go more to the left by following more of the views of labor and other liberal groups,” or “go more to the right by following more of the views of business and conservative groups.” When no middle option was offered, as in a December 1945 survey, 56 percent of respondents favored moving right versus 44 percent who preferred moving to the left. The mention of “labor”—and the possible civil rights connotations of “liberal groups”—may explain why a resounding 74 percent of Southern whites favored moving right.

> The North was more liberal than the South, but still showed a small margin for the conservative position (54% vs. 46%). In other surveys, when respondents were offered a middle option (“follow a policy halfway in between the two”), most opted for the moderate course, with “rightward” and “leftward” shifts well behind.

Americans are a center-right or center-left country depending on the weather but we aren’t moved towards extremes. American conservatism isn’t a scam or an aberration in the body politic. Swings to the Right and the Left are normal parts of cause and effect in a democratic nation and if liberals want to effect more change to get us to a “European style” welfare system, then they need to be more cognizant of the national mood. Not just hope some new combination of words and sentences will magically make a conservative support wealth redistribution and reparations anymore then it would a liberal supporting Medicare privatization."

I don't agree with Israeli government policies both around Palestinians and the fact that Netanyahu is extremely right wing on many other issues as well. As a public school teacher my school is facing budget cuts because the government has ""no money"" but is sending Israel millions and millions of dollars every day. 

Besides that I'm an American citizen, I fail to see why my Jewishness should be contingent on my loyalty to a foreign country.  

When I go to mainstream Jewish spaces I feel intense social pressure to keep my mouth shut. If I were honest about my views I feel I would be ostracized. Mainstream Jewish groups like the Anti-Defamation League have called Jews who dare to criticize Israel as ""self-hating""

I try to imagine this situation in any other ethnic group. Just imagining Chinese-Americans being called ""self-hating"" for not supporting the CCP. That would be insane. So why does it happen to Jews?

It was Hitler's viewpoint that Jews were secretly loyal to a foreign government. It's wild to me that mainstream American Jewish organizations have come around to essentially the same view - American Jews must support Israel or they are ""bad Jews.""

Anyway, I'm sad about what is going on Gaza - but also sad because I want to raise my child within the Jewish community and feel very disconnected right now.

What would not change my view: you should support Israel, you are a bad Jew. That would just prove me right. "

It’s fun as fuck and total bullshit to say you suffered to get where your at, with the exception of watching your food, I don’t do that but am lucky with my metabolism. the consistency is something I suppose you can be proud of sure, but in my experience going to the gym has always been fun and something I was excited for, and it always felt good prepping for the gym, during, and after. Getting stronger, doing hard reps, etc it releases endorphins and I’m sure that’s a big part of why it doesn’t feel like “hard work” much like a shitty job might or other things in life that are actually “hard work”. Hard work is reserved for things you sacrificed to achieve and the act itself isn’t pleasant. Maybe for some it isn’t fun working out, but those that have great physiques and telling everyone it was hard work are the ones especially lying and enjoy the shit out of it"

The camera then pans over to his hand wearing the Infinity Gauntlet, and he snaps, killing half of all life in the universe. It would have been better if Thanos had said, ""you should have aimed for the *hand,""* for a few reasons. 

For one, the camera pans to his hand after he says that, so it would have created an aurally-pleasing match between the dialogue and visuals. Also, his hand is wearing the Infinity Gauntlet & and is responsible for the snap itself. If Thor had cut off Thanos' hand instead, Thanos wouldn't have been able to do the snap. It just feels like Thanos' hand is more important to the overall equation than his head. Granted, Thanos couldn't do much without his head either, but he couldn't do *anything* without his head, so it's not as specific to the situation and the Infinity Gauntlet per se.

And lastly, ""go for the head"" is already a turn of phrase unto itself, so it's not clever or snappy to say ""you should have gone for the head."" But if Thanos had said ""you should have gone for the hand,"" it's like he's putting a new twist on an old phrase to fit the situation, so it feels more clever and surprising.

One should also have to take a test much like California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE). One should have to show a basic proficiency in needed and real world computer knowledge in order to graduate.

It should also include the basic mathematics that one can both complete and know using Python up to Calculus and using something like Matlab or the  R coding language for more in depth analysis.

Intensity is what determines how severe damage in a certain location is. 

In Japan the intensity scale is widely known and when they broadcast earthquake news they always focus more on the intensity than the magnitude. For example in the earthquake in Ishikawa last month the broadcast just said ""There was a strong earthquake in Ishikawa. Intensity 7 [roughly equivalent to MMI X] was observed where, intensity 6+ [roughly equivalent to MMI IX] was observed where, intensity 6-... The magnitude is estimated to be M7.6..."" 

The news headlines were all ""Intensity 7"" instead of M7.6 because it's literally no big deal if an M7.6 earthquake happens somewhere too far away or too deep down.

1,2024-02-22,CMV: Rape of women is biologically inherent to men,u/Ok-Raspberry-3142,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1axs02z/cmv_rape_of_women_is_biologically_inherent_to_men/,changemyview,"Let me preface this that I'm talking in generalizations, hence I'm going to talk about men raping women, which is the most common rape act. I'm also a woman myself btw. I'm also talking neutrally, and I'm not defending rape in any form or shape.

There's a common concept roaming in mainstream that rape is about 'power and not sex' and it's only 'monsters' or 'pyschopaths' who can rape, and a 'human' human male wouldn't rape a woman out of empathy or so. I disagree. I think that rape is an inherent biological characteristics of men. Most men wouldn't rape, yes, but it's only because of laws and conditioning. An analogy would be how finding sugar and oil delicious is biologically inherent to us humans, but we shouldn't eat it because it's bad for our health. Here's why I think what I think:

1. The avg male sex drive is much stronger and higher than the avg female's. There are multiple studies, and a meta study of 600k people on this topic. The libido increasing effects of testosterone are well known and tested. This difference in sex drives can also viewed in gay and trans communities, where gay men and trans men are banging anything with a pulse. Anyone who denies this difference is a highly naive and misinformed person. Men, in general, have a drive to bang anything with a hole. This is an innate drive, a man might supress it because of conditioning, but sex is innate to a male.

2. Testosterone also contributes to aggression and violence. It also increases competitive drive in men, which makes men yearn for a position of dominance and power.

3. Rapes are something which is found cross-culturally and have always been practiced during wars. There's not a single culture or war which did not have a high prevalence of rape. I'm sick of Hindu nationalists claiming that pre-Islamic India was some safe haven for women. Nearly all religions too mention, and sometimes condone rape (of enemies).

4. It's a great evolutionary method for spreading your genes, if you can't get sex that is. Men have a much higher need to spread their genes since reproduction doesn't require the male's energy. Men also don't pair-bond with women during sex , which makes it much easier for them to ditch a woman after raping, unlike a woman raping a man. 

5. Men are much much physically stronger than women. This makes it easier for them to rape women than vice versa.

I will say it again, I'm not defending rape and I believe it's a very horrible crime. But, I feel the current feminism movement is doing a very bad job of correctly informing women, and this results in naiveness. It's in male mind to rape, he may not because he's a good person, yes, but it's something as inherent as appreciating art or forming social bonds. I'm not victim blaming, but I think it would be good for women to not trust a man until he has proven that he's a decent human being."

Where a large portion of the governed are not allowed to vote, the government lacks moral authority.

The morality of excluding long term immigrants cannot be justified. It's not even rooted in history. The first naturalization acts only required residence for 2 years. The Alien and Sedition Acts were considered tyrannical, in part, because they imposed a 14 year requirement for naturalization. With the requirements to get a green card, then a 5 year long wait to apply for citizenship, then a 2 year process to become a citizen, it can take people more than 14 years to become a citizen today. It is absurd that someone living here for a decade can't be considered enough if a citizen to vote. 

And in 40 states prior to 1926, non-citizens were afforded some voting rights. Hell, Minor v. Happersett, an 1875 case, points out that non-citizens could vote in Missouri before women legally could. 

The arguments against allowing long-term immigrants to vote are unavailing. Is there seriously a concern that it will allow foreign influence in elections? That doesn't make any sense. Foreign entities are more likely to just pour money into propaganda to convince Americans to vote against their best interest than they are to send thousands of immigrants to live her for years to influence elections."

Most so-called “Racists” are not racist but territorial. 

I know a guy from Japan. He seriously hates both White men and White women. He does not fetishize White men and White women. He is what I call a racist person. 

I know a guy from the Netherlands. He has a love-hate relationship with ethnic men and he fetishes ethnic women. He believes that Black guys have bigger buttocks, Asian men are submissive, and Women of colour are better in bed. He is what I call a territorial man.

I know another guy from India. He thinks that East Asian men look unattractive and that all East Asian women look hot. He is also what I call a Territorial person.

In my opinion, most men are territorial, not racist.

But Ned sort of tortured his wife with this lie, which lead to a shitty situation for Jon and Catelyn.  I feel like if Catelyn were ‘in on it’, she could have better endured the ‘indignity’ of The Honorable Ned Stark’s Bastard in her home. Catelyn wouldn’t have held so much venom towards Jon (a true innocent) for his whole life, and they may have even come up with a better plan for Jon than to simply ship him off to the wall.

I think Ned was not a shrewd operator, and emotionally stunted. But by sharing the burden of this massive, realm-shattering secret, he and Catelyn could have done better by Jon for Jon’s whole life.

So what was the downside? That Catelyn simply couldn’t be trusted? Would Catelyn have let the information slip in some way?  

Because I think Catelyn would have held the secret closely out of respect for Lyanna and love for her nephew. I think Catelyn would have raised Jon much more like one of her own, and been happier in doing so.

Is that the downside? That Catelyn would have been suspiciously warm to her husband’s bastard?

74,2024-02-23,cmv: Having inventors majority rights in their invention is good for society as whole.,u/EqualPresentation736,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ay1rol/cmv_having_inventors_majority_rights_in_their/,changemyview,"Pretty much the title, case in point: Norway. After the end of the ""Professor's privilege"" in Norway, it effectively moved from an environment where university researchers had full ownership of their inventions to more akin to the American system today, where inventors hold a minority of the property rights (while the university holds the remainder). [The shift in rights from researchers to university reduced both the quality and the quantity of inventions.](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20160284) It led to approximately 50 percent drop in the rate of start-ups by university researchers. Patent rates fell by broadly similar magnitudes. So overall by reducing researchers owenership stakes, appears to have discourged university innovation.

Similar in corporate research, when the inventors have the majority stake in their own research, they often have more bargaining power in the corporate setting, and this often results in them running the spin-off companies of the innovation they themselves created. And these companies are more experimental in nature since the inventor is driving the ship itself. There seems to be a coexistence between islands of centralized control—the large corporate labs—and start-ups and spin-offs, often producing the most conducive environment for fast experimentation and growth.

For starters, I am a 37-year-old millennial who comes form relative (although not remarkable) privilege. This CMV applies to mostly to developed countries, primarily North America and developed western European countries. I fully believe major work reform is needed. The concentration of wealth and power of corporations today is beyond absurd. There absolutely needs to be major changes when it comes to compensation, regulation, and taxation.

All that being said, a common sentiment I see on reddit and other spaces inhabited by young people interested in work reform is that a major goal of work reform should be reducing the number of hours a ""standard"" workweek consists of. To quantify this, I will use the 40 hour, 9-5 Monday to Friday schedule as the threshold. I think it is a serious misstep to have this as a work reform goal. Here are my reasons:

&#x200B;

1. First, and most obviously, **it confuses and complicates the movement.** Successful social change is usually driven by a small number of finite goals. Compensation, benefits, and protections should be the focus.
2. **Pushing for a less than 40 hour work week does not engender public sympathy.** Including from yours truly. I've seen people on this website claim they'd be better off as a serf in feudal Britain because they'd get ""time off"" in the winter. Like, not one person, a lot of people. Anything that even comes within the orbit of that level of ignorance will make most older adults shut off immediately when it comes to supporting your cause. It's ridiculous. Working 40 hours (provided you have vacations and benefits) is really not that bad. I get that it's a hard transition into the working world, but it's very hard to feel sympathetic for people who complain about that level of workload - leaving aside exacerbating factors. Do you know which country I visited where people had the most ""time off""? Sierra Leone. Working less than 40 hours isn't great when it devastates you/your country's quality of life. 
3. Related to the last point, people who are feeling this squeeze are often the victim of the work reform issues that really need addressing. They don't have time in their day because they can't afford to live close to work, can't afford a car, can't afford to eat out when they feel tired. Can't take a day off because their sick days are gone, or because their healthy insurance is crappy. **More money buys you more time.** If you gave me the option to work half as much as I do now (I'm at about 55 hours a week) for what I make now or keep my hours and get double, I'd do double. 
4. **Decreasing the work week plays into the hands of those in power looking to squeeze the middle class even further**. Look at how many people get hired as part-timers or consultants. The shorter work week is what they want. AI will just make this worse.

To Change My View, I need you to convince me that there is a benefit conferred by advocating for lower work hours that wouldn't be conferred by better compensation, benefits, and worker protections. And that it outweighs the above factors. Thanks!"

However that's runaway deflation. 2% deflation is well below what even a normal person can make on investments so it will not discourage productive investment just unproductive investment (like housing). It discourages borrowing money (inflation encourages maxing out your credit), encourages saving (way too many people live pay check to paycheck) and perhaps most important instead of getting a passive pay cut every year you get a passive pay raise every year. Instead of having to fight for a cost of living adjustment your boss has to fight to lower your wage. 

I don't see how any of these things are bad especially after several years if not decades of high inflation.

EDIT: I think the means of controlling deflation should be the government destroying more money than it prints. Based on the comments I'm starting to think the reason deflation is considered bad has nothing to do with deflation and everything to do with it being triggered DESPTIE the government printing tons of money."

1,2024-02-23,CMV: It would be a mistake to consider student-athletes employees.,u/Medical_Ad9671,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ayij5d/cmv_it_would_be_a_mistake_to_consider/,changemyview,"This topic has probably been done a few times, but I haven't seen any done since the NIL rulings. 

First of all, the main argument for student athletes becoming employees in the past was that athletes bring in revenue for the colleges, so they deserve to be paid. I find this argument flawed for a few reasons. First of all, student athletes are already compensated fairly well. They are often able to get into colleges that they otherwise would not have been able to get into just on the basis of their academic skill. Not only that, but they also often even receive scholarships for their skill, so they're completing college at a cheaper price than the majority of other students. Now, with the NIL rulings, the argument seems even more weak. Student athletes are now able to benefit off of their name, so they can score brand deals and sales that they couldn't receive before that. This means that the athletes who are actually bringing in viewership, revenue, and recognition to colleges are now compensated. These athletes are arguably professionals, and they are now compensated as such. However, athletes that are part of say, the men's track team, won't benefit from NIL deals, but they bring in a lot less revenue, so they don't ""deserve"" professional compensation like the famous athletes anyways because, at the end of the day, they are just amateurs.

Moving on, I'd like to point out the harm I believe making student athletes employees could cause. 

First of all, this would undoubtedly be extremely expensive. Most colleges already lose money from their sports programs (even from large sports like football and basketball) and this would compound that issue. Colleges would be forced to provide, at a bare minimum, minimum wage, and colleges that wished to maintain a competitive sports program would be forced to keep up with competitive pricing.   Meaning that many colleges would be forced to spend far more than that.

I see this leading to two outcomes.

1. The end of amateur sports. If colleges were forced to spend thousands of dollars extra for each athlete they have, there would be far less incentive for colleges to provide those programs. They already lose money on smaller athletic programs (I'll again use the men's track and field example), and this would make the issue far worse. Thus, many colleges would opt to not provide those programs in the first place in order to maintain the far more important basketball and football programs. (Just a note, this would likely affect women differently than men because Title IX would ensure that colleges would still have to spend their funds to employ women.)
2. Lower quality of education. Any college that chose to keep amateur athletics would be forced to draw funds from education to pay for those needs. As simple as that. Plus, there might be fewer poor students able to attend college in the first place because funds that might have gone towards scholarships might be directed towards the athletics department instead. This decreases viewpoint diversity, which is again, not beneficial to education. Of course, poor students would still be able to receive the athletic scholarships if they were athletes but making them employees would decrease their focus on their education anyways.

&#x200B;

Specific sources and statistics are very compelling to me, and I would love it if you provided those to change my mind. (Admittedly this might be a bit hypocritical considering I didn't cite anything)

There's nutrition information about what is harmful to consume that everyone thought was okay, and what ingredients to avoid that lead to cancer, colon cancer, dementia, etc. 

It also just brought me a lot of dopamine from funny videos, but I know that leads to doom scrolling and in the end doesn't benefit me. As an artist, I felt it also brought me a lot of inspiration for my art. "

Were I born in the time where every resource was available for me and the concepts of 'money' and 'buying' did not exist in any form we understand beyond the expense of time itself and if even that was inexhaustible (biological immortality, some sort of uploading), I would have been a happy man. 

Well, I would not be happy then, either, if I was not able to physically traverse cosmos and explore it.

What is my worth, today? Why should I care about pursuing any happiness if I still fight for basic resources like some well-dressed, ancient Sumerian dirt-farmers? When I live in the world where my pursuit of education is limited by the depth of my purse? Where people mock me for it, something even beyond my ability to change overnight, like many think I could. Even though they themselves relied on mommy, daddy, luck, bad luck of others, or are also struggling like myself or even WORSE?

In fact, is there some notable difference between a meanest, illest beggar and the most powerful of people in this world?

Both are always at the threat of losing everything. Both are at risk of depression, betrayal, feeling unfulfilled. Does their suffering even matter, due to how limited they all are? How WE all are, myself especially included?

I think I should just shut up and take whatever is coming for me. I don't think we ""stand on the shoulders of giants"". Our lot is to be a sacrifice for the time when humanity will truly be free and content.

Many political subreddits allow for people to identify themselves as maoists, stalinists, or other similarly authoritarian ideologies. These people are also much less likely to be banned for expressing their views compared to nazism. Additionally, most people are much less likely to punch a self-proclaimed stalinist than a nazi in real life.

The reason I think their beliefs should be treated like nazism is simply due to the fact that they advocate for systems that have killed millions of people, through execution and man-made famines, and simply glance over these horrendous events like they aren’t a good criticism.

Most of them also try to convince people that it wasn’t mainly the fault of the dictator or the ideology, and a few go as far as to justify it. They ignore the horrendous things that have happened under these systems that have been tied to their ideology, and expect to be treated with respect.

While they may not outwardly express the will to kill people, they glance over the terrible things that happened, and I see no difference between them and a nazi besides presentation.

There is no reason we need stalinists or maoists to be given a platform, and it disgusts me that we do anyways.

The Apple Vision Pro, recently released, wasn't even that noteworthy in the end. There were reports of plenty of people returning the headset just days after trying it out (granted I couldn' find any exact statistics) but the lack of hype and talk shows how even an Apple branded VR headset can fall short so miserably. Meanwhile Meta's Quest headset, already super niche before this, tried riding the hype but I dont think the product sold much to begin with. 

Here's the main issue with VR headsets... **They just do NOT fit the lifestyle of the everyday man/woman.**

Think about it. What is the point of a VR headset for? 

1. To play games? - That's what Meta Quest was all about but the problem is it only appeals to a very niche kind of player. You first need a large enough room in your house to go all cray cray and run around in. Not many people enjoy such a luxury, esp. in other countries where landed properties are less common and most people live in tiny apartments.
2. It's all a lonely solo thing. - The whole reason Nintendo's Wii took off so well was due to this. The typical casual gamer does not like playing big games alone. They usually only play games with friends. With the VR headset you don't really have this ability since you'll be the only one that can see what the headset shows you. Similiarly, the Apple Vision Pro lets you do all these wonderful stuff in spatial technology. But when you're the only one able to see it from your headset, it does get rather lonely, and weird. While you're impressed with your view, your friends and family will just be confused at whatever since they can't see what you're seeing
3. It is still mostly just used indoors - THIS...this i feel is the far biggest barrier to VR headsets. Even if they own one, most people never dare to wear theirs out in public. And given most people spend their days outside anyway, VR kinda ruins the point.  Like so what if you can have this awesome Vision Pro work desk for? Unless you're WFH-ing and the company allows you to work with your own Mac and Vision Pro, you're unlikely to use it. Or even if not work-wise, sure you can lie down and stuff hands-free, but people already have their comfortable habits using their phones/computers leisurely at home.
4. The headset needs get smaller to be less embarrassing to wear out but that's the Catch-22...  how can the companies further innovate on the product but the product doesnt sell well to begin with? I imagine it'd probably take a very long time, maybe a decade later, before Apple can realistically shrink down the Vision Pro to the size of an inconspicuous pair of glasses. But by then, can they still keep up with the budgeting and revenue from their small market?

I've admittedly posted here before not really open to much opinions but for this topic, I really do want to see my view changed. Because yes, I actually do want to see VR succeed. I think the product is cool as hell but unfortunately as it stands now, it seems unlikely to fit in today's society. Apple seems to have forgotten to ask themselves who their target audience is. If they think their target audience can be their same mainstream iPhone users, it's gonna be a massive uphill battle for them to change minds"

I had this opinion before, but this cemented it for me.

Most of Isreals landmass is set up along the south, while all the major city areas like Jerusalem and Telaviv are to the north and center where they border the Gaza strip and the West Bank.

This is such a stupid concept to me, because the only REAL reason we have for borders is to prevent warfare and chaos from reaching other neighboring countries.

Most of the conflict comes from Isreal wanting political dominance over those regions. There's nothing inherent to the regions that cause mass warfare. The conflict comes from Isreal not wanting to share space with another region.

One region of the world I can see some benefit of borders is Hati and the Domincan Republic. Hati is inherently in a state of unrest due to centuries of colonialism essentially nuking their government infrastructure and economy.

That border keeps the Domincan republic safe from the unrest.

BUT on the other hand, you have areas like the US and Mexico.

Realistically, Mexico isn't some gang state like Hati. It's a pretty well off country compared to the rest of the Globe.

The idea that people are illegally immigrating from Mexico to the US or from other central/south American countries is a real problem, is just silly to me.

Like, for example. If you wanted to travel from Oregon to Washington, no one would bat an eye. But if you wanted to move from Mexico to Texas, suddenly it's a massive conflict and culture war? Who cares if they're 2 different countries. They're literally right next to eachother.

Like, no other animal has this much of a stick up its ass about migrating to new territories to get better resources.

I think that realistically, borders are illusory. That land mass is land mass. If you wanted to migrate to a new area of land, there shouldn't be as much bureaucracy to do so as there is.

I think if we want to progress as a species, we need to stop caring about borders for any reason other than protecting an area from active conflict in that area, like a quarantine.

I think we are too caught up on imaginary political lines and monkey brained ooga booga territorialism.

After seeing that blonde OF model murder her black boyfriend for no reason it made me realise white females psychologically have a brain wired to enjoy seeing other people in pain.

2,2024-02-24,CMV: Telling men to 'Figure it Out Themselves',u/ContraMans,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ayuet1/cmv_telling_men_to_figure_it_out_themselves/,changemyview,"I understand there are a lot of problems in the world, women still face a lot of problems and there are a lot of groups that have a lot of problems that need to be sorted out. Not everyone can always be there for everyone else and I appreciate the need for everyone to tend their own crops, as it were. However I feel that there are too many people out there who are gregarious in their efforts to help certain groups with their groups and turn a blind spot to a particular demographic's crops and that is of course men. I don't feel that it is necessarily malicious in nature, I think much of it is derived of either ignorance for how difficult it can be for men to address the issues of their mental health and developing emotional intelligence, for themselves and otherwise, or well meaning encouragement even if somewhat misguided in my belief.

&#x200B;

Firstly, it does much to further this notion that men should not rely on anyone else. It tells men that they should be accountable all of their own personal needs and should not burden others with helping them tend to their emotional and mental problems. I think it's fairly clear to anyone who has suffered mental health issues how damaging this can be. I am one of those fortunate men who had a very strong emotional support network that helped me alongside my own therapy, of which I've made significant progress with but still have much work to do on improving myself and becoming more in touch with my emotions. I still struggle sometimes with regulating my emotions and have realized I'm a blind as a fucking bat to most of the emotions I experience even though I can identify them very easily in others.

&#x200B;

It is incredibly difficult to do this on your own and even therapy itself was grueling to the point I nearly quit multiple times through. It made me feel as if the gulf of the problems I was unearthing and how little progress I had made and how much yet there was yet to do was just utterly, impossibly insurmountable and I would not have made it without my friends and loved ones to support me along the way. There is no understating that I have little confidence I would have made it where I am today if I was not helped along the way by both my therapist and my own personal network of friends and loved ones.

&#x200B;

Secondly, and this one is likely to catch me a good bit of flak, but it strikes me as a bit odd to tell men to 'figure it out' and then get mad at the often ineffective ways in which they do so. Sometimes even cruel and malicious methods they come across. Now that's no excuse for the blatant misogyny that often comes with it or outright bigotry towards the LGBT+ community and POC. I'm not saying that this is remotely acceptable... but it is predictable. If, for the type of men that fall into those radicalizations, it wasn't this it would be drug addictions, alcoholism, criminality, pick your poison. And it's not just a male thing either, it's when you do this to anyone. When people feel alone and isolated and alienated, like nobody cares about them in trying to square that circle they will either decide they have no regard for their own self, they don't care about anyone else either and often both. Ostracizing them to their own machinations which they have expressed they are incapable of using to fix themselves with the tools they currently have is a recipe for a disaster every time.

&#x200B;

Now I understand, the burden of self improvement is upon them. They have to want the help and be willing to take the steps necessary to see that through to getting the help they need to fix the problems they have. This is obvious, we all know and understand this. You can bring a horse to water but you can't make it drink. And there a lot of people, men, women and otherwise, that simply don't want help they just want to feel better and I think we are quite jaded about this and not unjustly so. But whenever the response to someone asking for help is to tell them to figure it out, be better and other such responses you're kinda just throwing the baby out with the bath water I feel. There is a presumption we have become all too comfortable making that everyone crying about a problem just wants attention and to be coddled and I think that has more to do with being jaded about attention seeking behaviors on social media and otherwise more than being outright malicious or resentful. 

&#x200B;

Thirdly, this severely undermines how difficult it is to overcome mental health issues. These are some of the most complex, intertangled and difficult problems anyone will face in their life time. I myself have struggled with my mental health for the entirety of my life and only in the last couple years have even begun to realize how bad it actually is. A lot of it is extremely difficult, regardless of your emotional intelligence and self awareness, to even properly identify that there IS a problem much less exactly where your problem points are. It's like a terminal illness with symptoms that your brain gets conditioned into perceiving a perfectly normal biological functions and that kind of cognitive dissidence can sometimes just be impossible to break on your and almost as impossible to even recognize without professional help. The brain is an incredibly sophisticated organ and mental health is even moreso.                            

&#x200B;

It seems like an extreme oversimplification of such a complicated issue as mental health to simply dismiss it and it's not just men this happens to obviously, we do this to lots of people. I see it a good bit with men in particular, regardless of the gender of the person speaking it to them, and it's difficult to ignore for me. Perhaps this is an instance of personal bias as this is the sort of thing I have struggled a good deal from, especially in feeling an inability to express my emotions and a profound, horrid shame any time I had done so in the past, so it's something that stands out to me more than with other instances and it's a case of the sorest spot getting the most focus for me personally. And I confess that because of this soreness and past it is something I am more emotional about because it is something that has plagued me for many years and so I would like to open this up for discussion to try to expand my perspective and maybe provide some further perspective myself on the matter as I have seen it personally or elsewise.

1,2024-02-24,CMV: the founding of Israel was significantly more evil than that of other nations.,u/BiryaniEater10,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ayvqsk/cmv_the_founding_of_israel_was_significantly_more/,changemyview,"I feel like the only people you really talk about this conflict with are severely biased one way or another. So there’s nobody to really give an unbiased critique which is my goal here.

A formerly common talking point is that Israel’s founding is no more violent or disgusting than the founding of other nations, but I don’t see it this ways

IMO the founding of Israel is easily top 5 in most immoral countries.  

If we look at colonial areas in Afro Eurasia, Europeans withdrew out of non European areas, Zionists were essentially the only group in the Eastern Hemisphere to never withdraw from their conquered land, so it creates a situation not seen anywhere else in the Eastern hemisphere.

Admiittedy, the UK were very clever in terms of how they chose to keep what is essentially an irreversible colonial hold on the Mandatory Palestine region, and the fact that this region remains forever colonized to the point the colonialists could win a democratic electoral college like election in a one state solution is a testament to that. The British unlike the other European powers have lost major colonial outposts before. They knew that if they followed the lead of other colonial powers, that the people would eventually attempt declaring independence somehow. this is what happened in Congo, Algeria, and Morocco. These lands are rightfully *mostly* in their rightful owners’ hands.

The British however have one, or maybe two, examples on how they kept control over a so called “independent” nation that is even today out of their rightful owners hands. That is of course America. With America, they did something I see as uniquely evil. They straight up replaced the indigenous population instead of ruling over them. What imperial powers noticed is that if you *replace* an indigenous population, that the calls to give Natives back the land are much weaker. They know that people will empathize with the new population and that empathy will cancel out any belief of the previous inhabitants being the true owners. 

One other thing is that Natives who call for reparations and/or large amounts of land back, or even the US back, are usually called sore losers, which is still much less than Palestinians,  who call for similar things, though admittedly, that may be due to the Palestinian movement being much larger and endorsed by multiple UN recognized countries. 

Regardless, in Mandatory Palestine, the UK saw an opportunity to do what they’ve done in America, and essentially create a European adjacent ethnostate that would disrupt the rightful rule Arabs had over the region. Essentially, they knew that if the UK allowed migration to the land instead of just ruling it, they could hold an influence because they know that people would give legal migrants more of a standing to create a state and/or remain in the region and be exempt from the decolonization efforts.

They couldn’t kill Palestinians straight away like they did with Natives because the world at the time would’ve condemned it wholeheartedly, so they did something different. They essentially allowed Zionists to migrate there and Zionists justified their migration as being ok because it was legal and their “land purchases” were legal. They also worked with the UK under the guise of Israel being their land which they had a right to return to, despite this being a basically morally nonexistent right that can’t justify mass migration and/or replacement into a place where the present day locals don’t want you there. Then, when Arabs attacked them, they claimed that they were the victims, even though anyone with a brain would tell you you don’t get to mass migrate, regardless of intent to build a state, and then claim victim when you get attacked. The Arab attacks weren’t inherently justified but we also need to look at the context in which they occurred. This essentially fed in to the Zionist persecution complex as well, because they said “well  we bought this land legally and we’re getting attacked for a fully legal migration.” They further used the fact they were the recipients of such attacks to justify building a state just for themselves, and the truth is that this was a sick and depraved migration, not a migration of the world’s victims who just wanted peace. 

Since they now made up the majority of a lot of pockets of land and were on the recipient side of attacks (though even that is debatable), they decided they were justified in building a state. And as such the process of Europeans building a state in the Middle East was assured of its success, and the Zionists would use the fact they were in a 50/50 split or majority in some regions to establish a state and push the evil that led to said demographics under the rug.

Some questions I have for people who may disagree. What did pre Israel Palestinians do that was immoral in your opinion, and what would’ve been a better response? Also, how does being the victims of the Holocaust turn an otherwise immoral migration into a moral one?"

I can't level with the US complacency and 'standing silently by' as Israel destroys all of Gaza, murders 30,000 people including thousands of children, and openly plans ethnic cleansing and to take over / settle the West Bank and Gaza - pushing to completely eliminate the Palestinian people from the region under the guise of 'get rid of Hamas'. It's shocking that the US is fine with this.   


Then there's this whole election this year....I am more leftist than liberal, not a big fan of Biden (and Trump is much worse) but I've been scorned by democrats telling me that not voting for him is a vote for Trump..which is a vote that would make the situation in Gaza worse. Would make women's rights in this country worse (true IMO).   


But at the same time I can't see myself voting for a guy who claims to be FOR women's rights in this country and gives missiles to our zionist ally to slaughter women. A vote for him is in some ways a vote FOR continuation of that. It's in some way SUPPORTING that. 

But then if I vote for Marianne Williamson or someone like that, it's just a vote for Trump anyway as she and others have no shot.

I can't see how I'm not f\*\*\*ed in this voting situation either way."

1,2024-02-24,"CMV: If you have a lot of student loan, because you got a liberal arts degree that does not yield a job or low pay, you have no right to complain.",u/shoshana4sure,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ayya97/cmv_if_you_have_a_lot_of_student_loan_because_you/,changemyview,"I’ve always wondered why these GenZ and millennials always complain that they owe student loans to the tune of $250,000 or more, but they have some type of worthless liberal arts degree like art, history, or philosophy. If you get a degree in math or science, or something valuable, you can easily make six figures out of college. But if you get a degree in women’s studies or underwater basket weaving, you will most likely be working at Starbucks, owing an incredible amount of money.

There should be no student loans for liberal arts degrees, unless you have an immense amount of money, or you can pay for it, and realize that you most likely will not get a job.


“What do you suppose inspires so many career-minded young people to take on ginormous student loan debt to obtain useless liberal arts degrees that haven’t been in demand since resumes were printed on typewriters? And where are their doting, or maybe the more accurate word is coddling, parents in all this?

I understand that some of these young adults are into literature or causes, but are they also into flipping burgers at McDonald’s, editing content for peanuts, working as a Starbucks barista or dumpster diving for food for the rest of their lives? Or maybe they’re just taking the easy way out, or so they think.

Here’s the thing. Ten years after graduation, median salaries of students who attended elite liberal arts colleges are far lower – as much as 50% lower, in some cases – than those of students who graduated from equally selective research universities, according to the Wall Street Journal and data from the U.S. Department of Education.

Now that’s a shocker. Who would have thought that students from Stanford and Harvard, which crank out future technologists and executives by the boatload, would fair far better in the real world than their liberal arts counterparts from elite schools like Swarthmore and Oberlin College?

Look, this is nothing new. When I was a kid back in the dark ages, my folks loved that I read a lot by they loved my interest in science and math even more. They weren’t geniuses, mind you, just working-class people who wanted their kids to have the opportunities they never had and a chance for a better life.

As you know, that guidance worked out pretty well for me.

If we’re going to send our kids through years of college and they’re going to be burdened by crippling student loans, don’t we at least owe it to them to provide some counseling in the realities of supply and demand and the basics of personal finance? At least then they’d know what it takes to pay off their debt, have a fulfilling career, and achieve financial independence, all of which are pretty darn important.

Funny how much whining we hear about income disparity and technology eating up all the jobs, but I’m a baby boomer and, even way back in the 60s and 70s, my poor parents knew enough to guide us into fields where the jobs were. And those fields have not changed. In that sense, surprisingly little has changed.”

Most notably the Public Order Act of 2023, which the government can arrest protestors that are deemed ""disruptive to key national infrastructure"" or ""obstructing major transport work"". A few months ago a Just Stop Oil protestor was jailed for 6 months for participating in a slow march, and plenty of JSO protestors were arrested and jailed by using this act.

There is the Rwanda Bill and the Illegal Migration Act too, which basically gives the government incredible power to deport anyone they deem ""arrive illegally"". It's a severe breach of rights as they not adhere to the European Convention of Human Rights at well.

It seems to be a problem that no one is talking about, and Keir Starmer doesn't seem to be interested in reversing this trend either, with the exception of Rwanda Bill."

But anyway, there were times when redditors hated emojis (though, well, at that time I only visited r/memes, and I didn't have account back then), and the only emoji allowed was the moai emoji. Then for some reason it was cancelled (and I don't remember why), and redditors made a war (again, maybe it was only a local event for r/memes) over what ""special one"" emoji is allowed now. I remember, for example, when one memer declared that such emoji is bread emoji. And now I see that emojis are all over the place on Reddit. And I think to myself ""What the fuck, this place used to be so puritanical back then in regard to emojis, this is not a Facebook or Twitter"". And of course there's something I just don't like about emojis, like, think about it, human race spent ages honing the art of expressing one's self through words and sentences, and accomplished quite a lot on this field, I guess, than in XXI century this ""emoji"" things drops, and you no more have to dedicate your mind to thoroughly express your mental state in a clear way (which actually can be much more expressive than an emoji), you can just type a sign which literally says ""you have to feel this or that way, or I feel right now this or that way"". Ever since I made an account on Reddit, I never used an emoji or even an emoticon, it became something like a bushido to me, even if it's not very rational, though as far as I know bushido is not very rational either. I mean, yeah, I feel sometimes like I'm a last samurai or something. It just grinds my gears how people don't realise that almost like yesterday this thing was implicitly forbidden in this place.

As keeping these ""children"" on life support costs up to one thousand dollars per year, proving that it is not for financial reasons is difficult. 

But, the embryos lost during the IVF procedure (due to lack of implantation) would be considered a loss of life.

Unlike fully formed people, the embryo has no obvious signs of awareness or lack thereof (ex. brain function). Therefore the only way for viability to be measured is through temperature.

1,2024-02-24,CMV: Anti-Zionism is racist and antisemitic,u/Ok-Waltz-4858,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1az0rer/cmv_antizionism_is_racist_and_antisemitic/,changemyview,"Lately, I have been concerned about anti-Zionism, because (1) it makes me fear for the safety of innocent people in Israel, if this ideology is allowed to spread further. And (2) it targets Jews in the West with discriminatory messages, threats, physical attacks, etc. Perpetrators of such attacks commonly claim ""I'm not anti-Jewish, I'm just anti-Zionist"", as if Zionists didn't deserve equal rights.   
  
Anti-Zionism is thus a largely violent and discriminatory ideology. It targets peaceful expressions of solidarity with the Israelis. It requires that you support ceasefire on Hamas' terms or else you are threatened.  
  
I would like to believe that anti-Zionists, and there seem to be many of them, are not racist and anti-semitic, because I would like to believe that common people are better than it seems to me that they are. So, I am asking you to change my view.  
  
Below is a more detailed reasoning why anti-Zionism should be considered racist and anti-semitic, along with some disclaimers.  
  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. I assume Zionism is defined as an ideology that supports the development and protection of the State of Israel, and the right of Jewish people in particular to immigrate to and settle within Israel.
2. I do not deny that extremist elements within Zionism have been responsible for great atrocities in the past.
3. It is of course permissible to criticize some of Israel's policies, military operations, etc. Thus, please don't write things like ""Israel is inflicting too many civilian casualties in Gaza, therefore Zionism is evil"", because it conflates Israel's policy with Israel's right to exist. Unless you have a good argument explaining why this is relevant.
4. Why Zionism is justified:  
\- Jewish people have a historical claim to the land, which has been colonized by the Roman Empire, the Islamic Caliphate and the Ottomans. If you believe in ""decolonization"", then you should support Zionism, as it is a decolonial project. (I actually don't believe in decolonization, but my point is that Jewish immigration to the lands of Israel is more decolonial in its principles than Palestinian presence.)  
\- Jewish people have been subject to unspeakable atrocities before and during WWII. After WWII, Jews usually couldn't return to their places of origin and most countries placed heavy restrictions on Jewish immigration. European Jews lived in refugee camps and Israel was one of the few places they could go to (if even that). Jews from Arabic countries also fled persecution after 1948 and found safety in Israel.  
\- Partitioning of British Mandatory Palestine into Israel and Arab Palestine was done in order to prevent continued violence (from both sides; between 1945 and the establishment of Israel, Jewish militias killed around 720 Arabs while Arabs killed around 600 Jews.) Note that Israel was not carved out of the country of Palestine and neither was Palestine carved out of the country of Israel; since none of these two existed in 1947, nor in 1913.  
\- Modern Israel is not an ethno-state and it grants equal rights regardless of religion or ethnicity. (However, a fair criticism might be that it doesn't grant equal rights to people living in occupied Palestine. See point 3.)
5. Why anti-Zionism is racist and anti-semitic:  
\- It is against the right of Jewish people in particular to immigrate to and settle within (lawful borders of) Israel. Thus, it excludes Jews from immigrating specifically because they are Jews. It mirrors common Arab attitudes of antipathy towards Jews who were opposed to Jewish immigration even before WWII, even while Arabs migrated to Palestine in great numbers.  
\- It also ignores that a common (main?) cause for immigration and creation of Israel was a desire for safety.  
\- Usually, the right of a nation to exist as a state within roughly their historical borders and according to the principle of self-determination is not questioned. (Even after WWII majority of people did not want to wipe Germany off the map.) By denying this right to Jewish people (Israel satisfies the two criteria), anti-Zionism denies this right specifically to Jews.  
\- By denying the right of Jews to their state within the land of Israel, and prioritizing the right of Arabs, it legitimizes violent conquests/colonization by the Caliphate and other invaders.

1,2024-02-24,CMV: taking out the garbage to the bin outside and replacing the liner in the trash can are two separate tasks and not a single operation,u/lettersjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1az0rrd/cmv_taking_out_the_garbage_to_the_bin_outside_and/,changemyview,"1. the phrase most often used for this set of chores from unitaskers is ""taking out"" the trash/garbage. there's no implication of anything beyond literally taking it out. otherwise ppl would use a phrase like ""take care of the garbage"" or ""handle the trash"" which would be, at least, a bit more ambiguous of a descriptor. 

2. i often take out the garbage on the way out of the house to goto work or wherever. it is inefficient to come back in just to redo the liner just to head out again. 

3. I'm not saying one person shouldn't handle both ever but not because they're beholden to for taking out the garbage in the first place. when assigning chores/tasks in multi-person households, it makes sense to have both tasks listed for assignment. it could be to the same person. but it shouldn't have to be.

1,2024-02-24,CMV: There's no point in voting in a primary nor the actual election for president unless you live in a state where the electors are required by law to vote with the popular vote.,u/suddenly_ponies,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1az13jo/cmv_theres_no_point_in_voting_in_a_primary_nor/,changemyview,"It's possible that with enough people turning against Trump, someone else might be on the ballot for the party of insanity, but for the Democrats, there's only Biden. There's no chance it will be someone else so there's no point in voting for the primary.

Then, come election time, because we have no ranked-choice or similar option, the vote is simply for or against sanity and that's an easy choice. Even if Biden isn't a great choice, the alternative is far, far worse. So that's settled.

But the problem is that it doesn't matter even then. With our corrupt electoral college system, only a handful of people need to be leaned on or threatened by foreign or local powers to steal an election. Unless we live in a state where the electors are required by law to vote with the popular vote (and there's strong enough teeth in the law to enforce it), there's no point in voting for a president at all.

A tiny handful of possibly compromised electors will decide and everyone else should just stay home. I'm aware that every vote is something of a message, but the message is weak enough that it doesn't justify putting in any effort. Even if you have a mail in ballot, it's just not worth the effort.

What would change my mind: showing me that there's actually some point to voting that justifies the effort.

1,2024-02-24,CMV: The J6th protestors should be pardoned,u/love0_0all,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1az1zr4/cmv_the_j6th_protestors_should_be_pardoned/,changemyview,"Thought: political speech is meant to incite people to action. The mechanisms of overthrowing power have historically been violent. Without creating action, is political speech even effective? Political speech that seeks or encourages violence is not protected, however, unless a violence is being done to the people speaking truth to power, in which case they may have to resort to violent means in order to protect themselves from the abuse of said power.

It's not clear how the Jan 6th actors were abused, except that they were told they were by Donald J. Trump, who will live in infamy as the perpetrator of the Big Lie, meaning they believed the election had been stolen from them, and in such cases, when a clear injustice of the people's will is occurring, and their rights are being abused by the state, violence is (in some minds) morally authorized. Donald Trump lied and gave the protestors moral authority to do violence and strike fear into the hearts of Capitol members, up to and including Vice President Mike Pence, the Capitol police, and members of Congress. Some of this mob had weapons, some did damage, some injured officers, many were trespassers, but in the end they would not have done anything had they not been lied to about the results of the election by Donald J. Trump in a rally directly preceding the events of J6th and for months prior to that, in spite of all evidence, many open-and-shut court cases, and numerous close associates telling him he had lost.

""I just couldn't believe it"" isn't a valid defense when you are proved wrong time and again in every court of law, and particularly when the result of broadcasting that disbelief is violence based on your unreasonable criteria and stubbornness to cede to reality. Donald Trump invited violence and should be punished, just as those he whipped into a frenzied mob must be pardoned *for doing their duty* *when their President asked them to*. He, Trump, lied. *They* were good citizens who trusted their *President*. That he betrayed their trust so thoroughly is abhorrent and tho they still bear responsibility, each for their own actions and memories of that day, we cannot blame them for being lied to. They are victims of Donald Trump and should be seen as such moving forward. With few exceptions, they deserve pardons and doing so would benefit our nations."
1,2024-02-24,CMV: There is nothing inherently wrong with incest and arguments against it are equivalent to those used against homosexuality,u/israelpalestine234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1az29nv/cmv_there_is_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_incest/,changemyview,"Ill start this off by saying I dont want to fuck my family. I dont have any female relatives in an age range close enough regardless (im a straight guy), but I personally also find incest disgusting. My CMV is that that my or others disgust, should not dictate other peoples love lives and arguments for it are equivalent to why some people justify homophobia. 

There is just nothing inherently wrong with it. If you reproduce thats a different matter which I dont understand the science behind well enough to have an opinion on. Its also morally difficult as you have to draw the line between eugenics and the childs health. So for arguments sake, this CMV is largely limited to incestuous relationships without reproduction.

There are arguments for it being grooming, but that again seems irrelevant to how related you are. Grooming can happen when its not a relative, and it can happen when its a relative. 2 cousins the same age for example wouldnt (in most normal cases) involve grooming. 

There are also arguments that its weird to fuck someone you grew up with, but people marry very close childhood friends all the time.

The argument for it ruining family dynamics also doesnt make sense as a reason for incest being inherently bad. It can be selfish depending on family dynamics, but again it just depends. Using that logic, dating a friend is bad because in some situations if you break up it can mess up friend group dynamics.

Lots of strawmans here I know. Just heard them a lot and dont want to have to reply the same if lots of comments mention those points.

Again, I find incest disgusting, but I dont think that makes it inherently bad. There are lots of examples of situations where incest could be bad, but they are only due to the situation (which is sometimes more likely with incestuous relationships) but its not the family member part thats actually bad. The only argument ive heard for why incest itsself is actually bad is ""but its just disgusting you cousin fucker"", which yeah I agree with, but isnt that the argument used for being against homosexuality? My irrational disgust shouldnt affect others love lives."
1,2024-02-24,CMV: Feminists are going to keep pushing men away until they start to address the ways women uphold and enforce patriarchy on men.,u/MadWithTransit,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1az2aos/cmv_feminists_are_going_to_keep_pushing_men_away/,changemyview,"""when women have issues, society needs to change. But when men have issues, men need to change"" 

It's a common gripe I've seen as a masculine identifying person in more progressive spaces. But it underlines something I've noticed in feminist spaces that whenever men speak up about gender issues or patriarchal expectations. There's always somebody chomping at the bit to say ""by other men"" 

But it isn't. To start off it's not statistically unlikely that an average male child may grow up without ever having a male caretaker/teacher/authority figure. 

There are even studies that have found that mothers are the ones teaching their sons that ""boys don't cry"" 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/canada/article-mothers-have-boys-dont-cry-bias-new-study-suggests/

But because of the notion that men as a group hold and share all the power, agency and influence. The inevitable answer is that men alone need to fix themselves and women's behavior. 

This is IMHO very present in dating. I'm a pansexual and for a while I gave up on dating cisgender women because I had so many experiences of being treated like I was born to be a stoic provider rather than a person. On top of all the toxically masculine ways I would be expected to act for them to treat me as valid. Expecting me to fight others on their behalf, shunning emotions and intimacy. And being closed off to nonsexual intimacy because ""men don't cuddle this much"" 

Not to mention young men in more progressive spaces are put in a deadlock where they overwhelmingly get the message that they shouldn't rely on women and relationships to have their needs for closeness and intimacy met. But there's no mention on how men living in less progressive environments can find other people they can platonically meet those needs through. So the only way that they can have those needs met in a socially accepted way is through a romantic relationship.

I think men are turning to figures like Jordan Peterson or Andrew Tate because they're giving them advice for how to be (at least attempt to be) successful within the shit system rather than focusing on a future utopia and telling the young men in question that they're the reason we're not there. 

Women are strong. Women have agency. Women are every bit as capable as men. And that includes their ability to enforce toxic gender roles onto men.

0,2024-02-24,CMV: High School should be either done away with or be made CLEAR to every parent that it is optional AND potentially detrimental.,u/Longjumping-Fee278,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1az2v2p/cmv_high_school_should_be_either_done_away_with/,changemyview,"High school is the stupidest institution that currently exists, and we'd be better off without it. It should be discussed with EVERY parent that high school is optional and that some students may be better off taking the GED and going to community college, even obtaining a bachelors while the rest of the crowd is just getting their diploma.

Here is my A-G reasons why high school sucks and why we should get rid of it. 

A) Bullying is the worst in high school. Punching, kicking, insulting, baiting....it's ridiculous. No one should tolerate that. This leads to violence and possible death, which is abhorrent and disgusting.  
  
B) People can coerce you and manipulate you into having sex with them when you are emotionally vulnerable and still unaware of the implications like childbirth and sex offender registry. Yes you heard that right, it IS a SEX OFFENSE to have sex underaged, and very limited states have Romeo and Juliet laws.  
  
C) False accusations of rape due to the fact that it is too young for people to understand implications of sex are common. So instead of being charged with having sex, you know are a felon and a rapist and a sex offender for life.  
  
D) Teachers that push their political views and other beliefs on their students. Just a gross abuse of power.  
  
E) Gossip is the worst in high school. You make one mistake, you are suddenly branded for it. It's stupid, creepy, and stalkerish. Some people don't know where to draw the frekkin line.  
  
F) High school can actually be harder than community college. Community college gives more office hours, lighter and modifiable courseload, the same or better disability benefits, and is customized to the field of study you are interested in. It is also a lot more CAREER focused instead of COLLEGE focused, and let's face it. If you did poorly in high school you burned your time.  
  
G) High school is awful for people with mental disorders. They get picked on and get driven crazy by that environment. They need their own private space so they can breathe easy and focus on their work. High school is full of nosy poorly behaved brats. Community college properly addresses their needs and prepares them for a job.  
  
I can't think of a good reason high school is worth attending to, but if you could change my view to understand why such an institution exists I'd be grateful. "

I am here to make the argument, that this is not the case at all and US simply find themselves confronted with circumstances incomparable to any EU nation, namely: Firearms.

Much of modern police work *simply relies on an advantage in weaponry.* European police have a monopoly on ranged weaponry in 99/100 situations. They can give people reaching for pockets/their waist the benefit of the doubt without issue or quickscope-magdumping them, 99,9% of times, it wont be anything that can harm them if a certain distance is maintained (obviously knives are dangerous af too). Furthermore the rarity of firearms in the hands of the public in Europe means *much more specialized and competent units are utilized to deal with genuinely dangerous threats.* Ill take my home of Germany as an example: if they get even so much as the sound of gunfire (or even vague threats that are deemed at least slightly credible) the area will be swarming with SEK Leos - a real, T1 SOF, not some ragtag group of motivated misfits that have to buy their own gear like SWAT. I personally believe that despite being underfunded the US police does a reasonably good job at what they do but are faced with incredibly difficult circumstances and its alienating an essential public service from the public it was always meant to protect, Change my view."

No matter how you say it relationships are not real unless it’s your family, but friendships, love or whatever are all fake, I can’t genuinely think that people can actually love each other unless it’s business, and by business I’m not talking about money, it’s just that you can’t ask for something and not give back something else. 

I mean there’s nothing called “unconditional love” or a friendship without expectations. You want something from that person and that person wants something from you as well.

Humans expect and want from each other:

-Social comfort
-Social status
-Social security
-Financial Security
-Knowledge & Skills
-Political Benefits..
-Emotional Support..
Etc..


As a professional introvert, I find it really difficult to communicate with people, even though somehow I always find friends and very good friends as people might say but at the end of the day I fk it all up.

I just can’t feel obligated to stay with anyone, it’s not like I go searching for other people but I always end up “ghosting” them for no apparent reason, it’s just that I don’t feel comfortable around people most of the time and I appreciate my alone time a lot, I also am the type that waste a lot of time on unnecessary things so I always end up “hurting” them or so they say, and since my guilt won’t allow me to go back and apologize I almost never speak back to any of them. You might call it “ego” but it’s not about the ego, it’s just that I can’t see myself wanting things to go back when I’m the one who caused all the trouble in the first place. 

I don’t understand why or how can someone want me around even, like what difference can one person make to you? I never really felt attached to anyone, and whenever I do they leave so it’s just as normal for me to do so? 
I’m in a state where even if my whole family were to do the same to me, I still wouldn’t care or feel anything even though I do believe these relationships exist only between family and I do appreciate my family alot.

I will probably end up alone and I have already accepted this fact long ago, but just wanted to try something at last maybe something can change then."

I know you cannot fully understand the intentions of a person's words over text, so try to trust me when I say I am not angry or upset, just want to have a conversation about something and I am trying to be as kind as possible :))***  


I am a very left-leaning person and would say I align with more socialist ideas, despite being a registered Democrat for “primaries” reasoning. I am looking forward to this upcoming election, but I’m very concerned about how a large amount of left-leaning people are approaching the candidates. I am very against the “voting blue no matter who” approach and considering that I fucking hate Biden, I don’t want to see him as our president again (Cornel West for President!!). But despite how much I despise that sentiment, I feel that this election is such a dire one that it worries me to “start a revolution”, knowing that true change takes such a long period and so many conservative politicians are revving up to destroy our country (even more than they already have).

I would love to see new democratic candidates and for Biden to step down and recognize the valid criticisms against him, but it isn’t going to happen. Primaries have begun and campaign videos from Biden have begun to spread, showing he isn’t stopping any time soon. Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be the two primary candidates in our upcoming election, and I am prepared to do whatever I can to make sure Trump is not our president again.

I see so many left-leaning people saying they will not be voting at all because of how Biden is approaching the issues in Gaza. I believe he is doing such a poor job and endorsing genocide is not okay by any means, but all I’m getting from people not voting is that they believe Trump will not only be better for this country, but for the safety of Palestinians (I doubt this genocide will cease any time soon). It genuinely seems like all of the young leftists I see speaking about the election are saying they won't vote at all and that ""nothing is worse than having Biden still in office"", but I feel that all of that is pretty much saying that they don't care if Trump is re-elected and prefers him to Biden.

Again, I agree that Biden should step down, and the DNC should be pushing new candidates they are doing such a poor job, but I feel like a lot of people aren’t being realistic here. I am a black, queer woman who fears for my life and family every day. Knowing that things like Project 2025 are real and coming if Trump is re-elected is terrifying and I’m confused as to why people feel this shouldn’t be talked about, despite how terrible everything is in Gaza right now.

I understand that what I am going through isn’t on the same level as those in Gaza, but I am also a bit tired of people only being able to focus on one thing at a time, and therefore invalidating someone’s experiences because they aren’t as severe as another’s. I’m feeling confused and scared right now and I’m seeking insight on what the “plan” is. I feel it is very important to help Palestinians in any way we can, but getting Trump re-elected will ensure that they continue to suffer and damage our efforts and rights as well."

As if he simply arrived and corrupted everyone… a sweet innocent public.

My post is probably going to sound like a screed from the John Birch Society, but I have a lot of loose thoughts here.

There was a meanness and sickness to the culture at times, that we simply might have forgotten.

As someone who has followed politics, I can't stress how wild and nutty the Obama v. McCain election cycle was. Those McCain/Palin rallies were full of unhinged and crazy people. It's true that McCain was a relatively measured man, but the lines of people outside his rallies were pretty much the same MAGA people without the label yet. They were the eventual “tea party” people. I've never believed the myth that rank & file MAGA loyalists were non-political and simply got woke up in 2016.

It's the same usual suspects. They have just put their former campaign accouterments in storage.

There was a nastiness in popular culture for a while. 

All those daytime talk shows like Jerry Springer were common on all the networks. Go back and watch clips of these shows. Audience members take the microphone and call people on a panel, “BIG FAT SLUTTY PIGS!” to the roar of the crowd.

I was a massive Howard Stern radio show fan. An era where he would get disabled people to fight with the Klu Klux Klan, or openly use the “n-word” on terrestrial radio. Trump was a frequent guest.

There were just a lot of sleazy things that wouldn't be around today. A popular television commercial was for “Bum Fights,” a mail order VHS where someone got homeless people to attack each other.

Never mind Tucker going to Russia. Late '90s and early 2000s political media was horrendous. Anyone remember MSNBC's Michael Savage? He was telling people to get AIDS on TV.

This was the tone of the media. Bush v. Kerry was a wild and crazy election cycle, too. I remember Zell Miller challenging Chris Mathews to a duel on live television, or Ann Coulter calling Al Gore a ""f*g"" on TV, without much notice in pre-Twitter world.

Trump comes from celebrity popular culture. My first board game as a child was a Donald Trump one. He comes from this world.

He was a character. Comedy Central did a celebrity roast for him right before he became a candidate. They've never re-aired it, and simply pretend it never existed. Most of the jokes were about how he could grab any “pussy” he wanted because he was rich.

Trump was a long-planted seed that finally produced fruit. I've known that some populist crazy celebrity was going to eventually arrive. WWF wrestlers were becoming Governor in Minnesota.

I can't feign my poor virgin Puritan eyes and ears weren't ready for Trump, and it shocked me.

The American people were ready for it. Enough of them wanted it. We had been conditioned for it."

Some may say you can use decimal points to get a finer temperature gradient, but you can technically do the same with Fahrenheit for an even more precise measurement. A reddit user [Joshblade](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13cjij1/cmv_celsius_is_better_than_fahrenheit/) said it well why the small gradient in temperature matters ""People are very sensitive to temperature and can definitely tell the difference in a 1F change. Think about fevers. in Celsius, 37 is normal body temp, 38 is mild fever, 39 is pretty close to you should go to the hospital and 40 is you should have already been at the hospital. In F you have that nice round 100 is mild fever and then a smoother gradient from mild to extreme fever. Same goes for conditioning your house. We definitely have a sweet spot in F for our family where 1 degree warmer is too warm and 1 degree cooler is too cool.""   
  
I guess my big critique of Celsius is it performs pretty poorly at lower temperatures when the range gets below freezing - see the following conversions-  
  
 32 °F, 0 °C  
10 °F , -12 °C   
\-30 °F , -34.4 °C

1,2024-02-24,CMV: The positives of social media outweigh the negatives,u/Pow32,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aza77j/cmv_the_positives_of_social_media_outweigh_the/,changemyview,"It seems to be a pretty popular sentiment that social media has mostly been a bad thing for society, yet a lot of the people who say this themselves use social media on a daily basis. This got me thinking about the positives and negatives of social media, and I'm a bit torn, but am leaning towards the conclusion that it's more beneficial than it is harmful. Here's how I currently see it.

**POSITIVES**

(1) Makes it easier to keep in touch with people. This is self explanatory 

(2) Easy access to information. Self explanatory

(3) Good way to organize events. Self explanatory

(4) ""Free"" entertainment. Obviously you have to pay for internet service and a phone or device, but you get what I mean. 

(5) Easy way to meet people. Some people might disagree with this, but as an example, I've dated multiple people that I met through Instagram or dating apps. I don't think this is a good replacement for meeting people in real life, but it can be a good supplement to meeting people in real life.


**NEGATIVES**

(1) Easy way to spread misinformation. This is the dark side of having easier access to information in general, a lot of that information is deceptive or misleading

(2) Creates echo chambers, can be especially harmful when it comes to fringe or more extremist groups. 

(3) Can make some people insecure. People tend to post the best pictures of themselves and curate what they post to show a misleading representation about their life. I don't think this affects most people, but some people get insecure because of it.

(4) Privacy concerns. Self explanatory 

(5) Decreases attention span. This is debatable, but there seems to be a trend where people's attention spans have decreased due to social media consumption.

**Conclusion**

In my opinion, pretty much all the positives of social media are examples of how it is useful as a tool. Meanwhile, the negatives mostly boil down to potential consequences for people who abuse social media or have poor media literacy. 

Like anything in life, social media is best consumed in moderation. If someone spends too much time sitting down, it can make them out of shape and have poor posture, but this doesn't mean that chairs are an overall negative to society. It's the same thing with social media in my opinion. It is only a negative to people who spend too much time on social media, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is bad for society. Maybe going forward, we need to do a better job at educating kids about how to safely use social media. Since social media is so new there have been growing pains, but I am not convinced that it is nearly as bad as many people make it seem.

125,2024-02-24,CMV: The Ten Commandments shouldn’t be displayed on court grounds or in schools because many of the prohibitions listed are legal and even encouraged in a capitalist society.,u/GuyWithNF1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1azbic0/cmv_the_ten_commandments_shouldnt_be_displayed_on/,changemyview,"In the debate over displaying the Ten Commandments on public property, particularly courthouses and classrooms, the argument almost exclusively centers on the separation of church and state. While this is a worthy discourse, I’ve noticed a point in my topic post that seems overlooked. Let me explain:

The first commandment is moot in the American legal system. It’s perfectly legal in the United States to not worship the Abrahamic God (particularly of Christianity and Islam). For example, I hold the cannabis I smoke in higher regard than the God of Islam and Christianity. I’m free to hold and express this belief, while conservative adherents to the Abrahamic faiths are also free to express their disapproval, which I can easily shrug off.

The second commandment is also legally moot. People are free to make any graven images they want, as it is an expression of free speech and, ironically, religion.

The third commandment is legally moot as well. Blasphemy is perfectly legal in the United States, a right I’m quite passionate about. I regularly engage in blasphemy without shame and have no plans to stop. This is a right I would fight to the death for.

The fourth commandment is also legally moot. People can refuse to engage in divine worship on any particular sabbath or holy day. I will most certainly not be forced to attend any religious service.

The fifth commandment is legally moot and can be dangerously problematic in certain situations. Should a child “honor” their parents if their parents raped them or sold them for drugs?

The sixth commandment is obvious: Don’t murder. This is the first one that is legally and morally applicable.

The seventh commandment is also legally moot but could be argued as morally sound advice. However, this is open to interpretation. What about open, consensual, and mutual relationships? Is that adultery? Most conservative adherents to the Abrahamic faith would argue “yes,” but their feelings on this topic have no standing in American legal society.

The eighth commandment is obvious: Don’t steal.

The ninth commandment is certainly good advice, and bearing false witness against somebody can damage their life and result in legal consequences.

The tenth commandment is probably the most paradoxical on this list. The vast majority of people who advocate for the Ten Commandments on courthouse grounds and in our public schools are strong proponents of the capitalist system, as am I. However, the desire for material possessions that other people have plays an important incentive for people to work and make more money. Without this incentive, the capitalist system would become very stagnant.

I usually see child support as a thing a mother is given when a father doesn’t want to raise the kid, but I simply don’t get the concept. In an age where we have abortion, it is the mothers decision weather or not she wants to have a kid. The father rarely gets a choice. So why doesn’t it work the other way? If a father isn’t ready for a kid and mother is, why should the father be responsible for the mothers choice. I’ve seen this happen to people I know. My older cousin, who is 19, got his girl friend pregnant. She wanted to keep it he didn’t. They broke up. He will now have to pay child support for 18 years for a baby he didn’t want in the first place. Another thing is it kinda makes it easier to baby trap. If your boy friend wants to leave, you could get pregnant to either a) make him stay with you, or b) force him to pay money. I get supporting single mothers, but that shouldn’t be the responsibility of the father. If anyone has some information to enlighten me, please do share.

If you cheat, you had to either purposefully approach another person to cheat with, put yourself in a situation where others would approach you, or be receptive to an unexpected approach. All of these are conscious choices that take more work to do than not to do, and the idea that any of them could be a “mistake” and not a purposeful action is stupid. Even if someone approaches you repeatedly while you are in a relationship, it is a choice not to authoritatively shut them down and continue to be in their presence regularly.

1,2024-02-24,CMV: Firing someone for being “unprofessional” should be illegal in the US.,u/Savelives4love,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aze8yy/cmv_firing_someone_for_being_unprofessional/,changemyview,"My definition for “unprofessional” for this discussion is: any behavior that employers rule is not allowed but does not 1) cause physical harm, or 2) works to illegally take possession of employer assets. 

These behaviors can be identified by the presence of or are otherwise mitigated by employers by:

-tone policing, 
-toxic positivity, 
-sugarcoating/ omission/ misrepresentation of facts because they are deemed “negative” or otherwise “hurt the company” but have no direct connection to the success of projects on a pass/fail basis (not on a magnitude of speed basis- if the project is a time sensitive project and an employee does not perform their work quickly enough that is not doing their work. Ex. A hacked computer has to be righted in x hours. But, if say expressing a concern for a project lengthens the timeline where otherwise the project would not have succeeded without the concern being accounted for that would be on a speed basis Ex. We forgot a government mandatory requirement and so we need to change the plan and that will add time)
-judgments on working vocabulary/ tone/ pitch/ facial expressions/ hair/ makeup/ attire (fit and branding), 
-conformity and silence as expected signs of submission
-Employees often can only discuss their hobbies or interests that are approved by judeo-Christian values.

Some attributes are categorically separate from being “unprofessional” for the sake of this discussion and would remain as fireable offenses: 
-stealing, 
-lying about credentials,
-screaming at employees or using profanity in meetings 
-not doing your work (duh)
-poor personal hygiene (This is tricky- As in never showering or washing your clothes or otherwise smelling such that people around you gag. I don’t put cosmetic actions in this category. So some examples that should have no effect on your chance of being fired would be 1) having washed your face, but not wearing makeup. 2) Or having clean, but poorly cut clothing for your body type that is not revealing reproductive body parts- boob, butt, groin. So, like having slacks that are a little too short but they are laundered. 3) Having a long hair style or facial hair when others deem you shouldn’t so long as they are clean and tied back/ face or hair net used when appropriate)

Certain professions that are wholly dependent on appearance would be excluded from certain appearance freedoms for ease of discussion related to attire and makeup or hair. Actors, models, spokespersons, communications people whose mediums include their face or body presentation (not solely written communications as an example) could still have appearance requirements that employers could hold them to. Similarly spokespersons would likely still be expected to not say negative comments about their company publically, but could express their opinions as a form of private criticism to their employer no matter their tone. But any non-brand-embodying professional could have short slacks and wild hair and a sassy attitude as an example.

I personally think the ability of an employer to fire you for these things, even in an at will state should be outlawed. I think if an employee can record the discussion and two other employees would attest to the employer exerting one of the above mitigation behaviors, then the employer should be fined. After a threshold of fines- say each fine is $1,000 and after 50 lifetime instances submitted by employees for that company, the company’s business license should be revoked and the brand name blacklisted so it cannot be used again. This wouldn’t necessarily stop a business from rebranding, but they would be constantly paying this small (to big companies) $50k and the punishment would be giving up the brand you built. It would also make the public aware of companies that are abusive of employees in the hopes that it would be difficult for customers to continue to pursue the company’s products or services on the market. The above listed mitigation actions by employers are just another form of oppression. I dare you to give me some examples where I would feel differently."

When people compare Swift to icons like Michael Jackson and claim she's the biggest artist since MJ, I think they are completely forgetting the frenzy that surrounded Bieber during his prime. At his peak, Bieber's fame surpassed Swift's; he was a global sensation, recognized by people from all walks of life, and quite possibly the biggest person on Earth. His notoriety was also fueled by being infamous, which only added fuel to the fire. My foreign great grandmother who didn't even speak English knew who Bieber was. Even Google search trends reflect Bieber's unmatched popularity at his peak, far surpassing Swift's. Overall my point is that JB has probably had the biggest fame/popularity peak of any artist since Michael Jackson."

For most of my life I've viewed Anime characters as Japanese by default, and that's because the art style is known for its emphasis on youthful and neotenous facial features like big eyes, short heads, flat faces and small noses and lips. And because Asian people hold those traits more than any other race, I believed that is what made Anime characters appear Asian. I was aware that there were some people who thought anime characters appear white/Caucasian, but I dismissed them as ignorant foreigners who think that all Asian people have comically small, slanted eyes. It wasn't until a few months ago that I started researching peoples' views on this topic, and I've realized there are a lot more solid arguments contending to how Anime characters supposedly ""look white"".

Probably the most concrete argument I've found is [this image](https://i0.wp.com/omnigeekempire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/main-qimg-9caf876065b8d524dad2780d0e194a64.jpg?resize=1140%2C641&ssl=1), which (based on my research) was created in a Japanese forum discussing parallels between the anime art style and white features. The problem is that Anime characters in general are too simple to apply racial traits to, which means you can skew what ethnicity this character is in any direction you want. [Here's an edit that I made](https://imgur.com/pQbzjEW) using the same character with the same idea of what white features look like, only this time I over-exaggerated white features in the white version of the character to prove that the original character is Asian. But I believe that both arguments are redundant anyways because Anime characters have facial features that do not purely lean towards one racial group, as shown by both examples.  


TDLR: Anime characters are designed to look racially neutral (according to my evidence), therefore all arguments that contend that they appear white or Asian are false because (according to my evidence) they weren't designed with race in mind."

I know it's unpopular to acknowledge, but let's face it - some people's time is more valuable than others. I understand it's logistically impossible, but a doctor walking into Starbucks for their morning coffee should just be able to walk in front of everyone in line. 

I understand that *some* of this is acknowledged, those on the top of the chain generally earn more, and income doesn't not equal worth. However, the person who works hard and helps society absolutely is worth more than the person that leeches off society, and we should acknowledge that. We can argue about who is worth more, but my point is that some are worth more than others. Organ donations, life saving procedures, etc, should absolutely go to those those that are at the top.

And for the record, I'm not a doctor, nor anyone I would consider at the top, I'm somewhere in the middle, probably below the median. 

We can argue about who's ahead of who, but in reality,"

Now, it's fair to criticise capitalism and it's flaws and holding an opinion that it should be replaced will make you Anti-Capitalist. But, here's the funny thing, a lot of Americans may be choosing Communism as a solution because they've been told it's the antithesis to Communism. And, that would be incorrect.

One, in theory, Marx saw Communism as the next logical step to Capitalism in rich countries, it was not intended as something to stand against Capitalism and its functions, but rather the elite.

Two, in practice, open up a damn history. Giving one man all the power has worked badly for Communist countries. It gave them the exact issues Capitalism has and some more. And a lot of yous might be commenting ""but it ain't true Communism!"", and you're right. It ain't but, true Communism isn't something achievable in the real world, history has shown, and if you truly think this time for America it'll be different, you're insane.

Most think of human rights as progress. But as Adorno and Horkheimer pointed out, “progress” is in reality a veil covering the regression to barbarism. 

I’m not saying human rights are bad per se (who doesn’t support freedom of speech), but in the modern age it has come to define our idea of morality. When morality is reduced to the idea of a human right, it is easily manipulated, particularly by “the west.” We begin to rely on law, not basic morality. The state grants and takes away human rights, they do not intrinsically exist. In addition, the state also defines what rights are in the first place. The USSR defined rights as material rights, America defines rights as civil rights. Human rights are just a form of domination. Human rights is not progress, it is a specific set of tools given to us by the powerful so that we don’t imagine an alternative society. We speak in the terms of the capitalists, and they will grant concessions on occasions, some rights here, some rights there, but nothing really changes. 
	
Enlightenment is the domination of humans, one form this takes is so-called human rights. 
	The very system that promotes human rights violates them. Thus we need to focus on abolishing the capitalist system not promoting human rights under the capitalist system. When both politicians and activists say the same thing (human rights good), then that’s a problem. 

I don’t see how human rights can actually give us any real freedom. If we rely not on our fellow man and environment, but an absolutist idea of “rights,” then that merely serves enlightenment domination. And domination is “bad” because I personally prefer self determination, though I guess the person who doesn’t mind a dictatorship if they can just live comfortably would say otherwise. That’s the only situation where I can see human rights as “good,” if you just want to be passive and be “guaranteed” the bare minimum. 

Are there any real situations where human rights can be considered supportable? Surely it can be utilized in some sense (other than just being jargon)? 
	Though so many mainstream speakers perpetuate the mythology of human rights, so maybe it’s safer to just not contribute to meaningless mainstream politics. We should look at subjects in terms of political analysis, we shouldn’t just go “those people deserve rights.”Because the state— to put it bluntly— doesn’t care. Why would they? The job of a system of power is to perpetuate itself. "

It is a trend now on social media such as Twitter and Instagram that some artists love to edit fictional characters' skintone into a darker one. The reason they do it is that they believe it allows darker skintone people to see themselves as the characters. Another reason is that it encourages diversity. However I find these arguments to be weak. 

The problem I got with the edit is that it is meant to mess around with the perception in order to make viewers think the characters are now a different race. It feels disingenuous and also disrespectful to the original creators who intend to make their original characters non dark skinned. 

Additionally it is seen that many people edit characters who are from anime/manga etc. to a darker skinetones version and claim them are from a different racial background. Those established characters are asian, and doing so I think it is erasing the racial identity of the characters.

People may also argue that blasians exist, mixed people exist which is true of course but I find this argument to be weak when it comes to skin edit because people can also use the same argument to justify editing characters into a paler skintone and say they are half caucasian. such action sure will be classified as whitewashing which is validly deplorable. 

In conclusion, it is ineffective to edit existing character's skintone into a darker one for representation. It will be a different case however if the character is newly created, or is a spinoff from a series (Miles Morales for example) because their background and design are original and have some cultural significance to them. If a poc artist wants to create a character that represents themself I think it is perfectly fine.

The question of when a fetus transitions into a human being is so complex, that I don't dare to say when this happens.

However, I acknowledge that there are extreme cases where abortion may be necessary, like rape, teenage pregnancy, or when there are serious health risks to the mother or fetus. 

We should make laws to protect these outliers, and so we have to accept that some women will use abortion as a contraceptive. Even though that thought makes me a little nauseous.

Change my view, guys. Whether on that is the abortion is murder part or the abortion needs to be legal part.

This area hasn't changed much in 50 years (which is why we moved here). Lately there has been a lot of changes.

308,2024-02-25,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,u/GorrilaRuffy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1azmbbp/cmv_dating_is_objectively_harder_for_men_than_it/,changemyview,"
I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating."

I'm maybe biased as a Jew but I don't really think palastinians are deserving of a state . 

First of all they rejected all past offers for independence in favour of killing more Jews . It begun in  1922 when they rejected the first partition of Jordan as the state for Arabs and Israel / palastine as the Jewish state , then they pogromed all Jews out of most parts of the west bank in the Arab pogroms of 1929 and 1936 , rejected again a partition that would have given them 80 precent of the land of the mandate to keep supporting **Hitler** and the axis in WW2 (and even helped in ss operations like operation atlas and their elected leader the mufti of jerusalam was a close friend of Hitler's ) then to reject partition again in 1947 to start a war that led to the creation of the state of Israel and the annexation of the west bank by Jordan and Egypt , kept perpetuating terrorism ,helped during the 1967 wars while 5 Arab countries invaded Israel again and then rejected every peace offer and offer for statehood ever since 


Second of all , palastinians is invented term from the later half of the  20th century ,  there were not a palastinian identity before that , they were Egyptian / jordenian /syrians and identified as such , they even had citizenships in those countries before 1967 . I don't see how their genetically , culterly or ethnicly different from other arabs 


Third of all we already saw what palastinian self determination leads to , events like the 7th of October , the Munich massacre , the 2ns intifadah  black September in Jordan , the lebanese civil war , their help to Iraq with the invasion of Kuwait , and alot of more violent acts shows what a palastinain state would be like . Palastinians also never had a leader not associated with terrorism and crimes against humanity 


Fourth of all , even if a palastinian state wouldn't be imidiatly a threat to regional safety , right now is not the right time after 100 plus years of palastinian terrorism not just against Israel but all Thier neighbors as well , will be rewarding terrorism , palastinians need to show that thier capable of coexisting in the region 


Because of this points I don't think palastinians are deserving of a state, and I'm realy looking towards other world views that maybe less biased then mine "

Now, imagine programming this robot with a belief system that diverges from basic arithmetic principles, such as convincing it that 2+2 equals 3. Furthermore, the programming extends to imbuing the robot with the conviction that it can logically demonstrate the validity of this mathematical assertion.  
  
This thought experiment raises a philosophical question: How can we be certain that our own cognitive processes and understanding of logic are not similarly influenced or programmed in a way that fundamentally deviates from objective reality? Could it be that our human logic, which seems inherent and self-evident to us, is merely a product of programming or conditioning, akin to the scenario with the AI robot?  
  
This line of inquiry leads to a more profound epistemological challenge. If we entertain the possibility that our understanding of logic is subjective and contingent, we confront the unsettling notion that there might be inherent limitations to our capacity for objective reasoning. The very fabric of human logic, which we rely upon to make sense of the world, may be flawed or biased in ways we are incapable of perceiving.  
  
In contemplating this, one might assert that there is an inherent uncertainty in our ability to establish absolute truths. Even the statement suggesting the potential fallibility of human logic becomes paradoxical, as it too falls prey to the overarching skepticism — if everything is subject to doubt, then so is the doubt itself."

Even if you set that aside, how can there be such a profound lack of sympathy for innocent people raped, murdered and taken hostage? Where was this outcry during other conflicts and massacres? Is it because the victims were Jews?

To me October 7 wasn’t a wake up call but a moment where views I held about Jewish “allies” and Jewish assimilation proved to be correct. We are unwanted and unwelcome amongst mass groups of people who openly celebrated our indiscriminate slaughter. A lot of American Jews are waking up to this fact but are unwilling to give up the false comforts of assimilation."

I am not aware of any other occasion of this happening. Also, an important lesson (IMO) to the Western ""decolonize X!"" crowd is what it entailed: decolonizing Israel did require displacing some of the previous colonizers of it (i.e., the Arabs who originally came from the Arab peninsula to colonize the levant and then north Africa)."

Israel is relatively new and Palestine/palestinians have been there far longer, so Israel is from what I understand a European colonizer state. 

This conflict is being pushed as a war on hamas which is a corrupt Palestinian group, but also seems like a natural reaction to the things Israel has done.

Charles Babbage's ""Difference Engine"" a 19th century computer, was ""AI"", an autoexposure and autofocus we've had in cameras since the 70s is ""AI"", most basic Excel functions are ""AI"", automatic gearboxes in cars, parking sensors, autopilot, a Google search, a Spotify reccomendation, the list goes on.

This Narrow Artificial Intelligence (ANI) has been in wide ranging use for years, decades even. The best chess players were being beaten by ""AI"" in the 90s. 

The current hype around AI seems to just be ANI for stuff we can see on a computer - writing text, making images, making videos, doing code, organising lists, etc. *This* is my definition of AI for the purpose of this post. The AI that people generally mean when they say ""AI"" in the past few years, the current massive hype with governments getting involved with regulation and the like. 

I also exclude future (possible far-future) development of General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) which *would* be massively game-changing but is only a theory at present. It could happen, but like fusion power it might be in a few years, it might be in a few hundred years. That would change humanity forever, for the good or bad, but that's a debate for elsewhere. ASI is a whole other topic again.

So - 

For AI as defined about. It is crap. Awful. Totally useless. And I'm *stunned* people can't see it. 

A few examples, some I've used myself, some I've been told about by others who are more clued up -

AI images - OK some look a bit ""wow"" because they've turned from deformed smears into something vaguely real looking, but they're still obviously digital art, and high school level at that. I don't see any potential use case for this or any fear around it. There's an uncanny valley AI cannot get out of because it is simply *unable to think like a human* and is just seeing pixels, not a face, not an expression. This is a common theme and I think AI has hit something of a hard-limit here. It just isn't that impressive and doesn't seem to be getting any more ""wow"" now it's hit the ""that's impressive and realistic, but my 95 year old grandmother could tell it is fake"". 

AI video or ""deepfakes"" as they're commonly known - again, not impressive at all. They don't look anything like the person they're meant to be, again because AI doesn't know what a face or a human expression is. Any slight missing angle and they go all janky and flickery. The ""solution"" to this was to simply blend in more of the original model's face, but this is just done to the point you can't tell who they're meant to be faking. They haven't improved in several years now and seemed to hit a hard limit first, because like with so much technology, porn was the driver to improve them. And yeah, they're just terrible. I'd happily be deep faked into a porn film safe in the knowledge it would either be obviously fake or look nothing like me. 

AI visual landscapes - probably similar to the above but breaking it out because of SORA. It is PlayStation 2 level graphics which is basically just moving around low-res Google Earth Photogrammetry. Again, Google or the like *could* improve their Photogrammetry resolution, but all you're really doing is taking objects from it and making a new scene. Quicker and more control doing it yourself. This seems to have some way to improve, and will, because of the resolution issues, but it will then hit a hard limit because it doesn't/can't know that the scene doesn't look ""real"".  

AI writing, mainly GPT-like engines - awful. Toddler with learning difficulties level. It's basically just Googling, quickly, without the human ability to spot if information seems off. For any kind of legal, technical, research, or scientific type work, it is entirely unreliable because you need to double check everything it says anyway, most of which is wrong so you've just wasted more time. It *can* help in some organisational tasks, but only with the level of functions we've had in Outlook or Google Calendar for years if not decades. For creative writing it is just appalling, non-functional. It cannot even tell the difference between styles of different poets, something it could have programmed in quite easily so that could be fixed, but even then it would fall at our usual hurdle of nothing being able to think like a human. Any writing it does seems alien and wrong. 

For coding I grant it does look impressive, but that's probably because I can't code. People who've can have told me it isn't really much of a time-saver and they have to check it for the many errors it makes anyway. It will likely become a decent tool, as above, but it isn't replacing any human.

**So I'm looking for two things to change my view -**

1. **Obviously the whole point of the sub, an explanation as to why I'm wrong.**
2. **Actual** ***evidence*** **to back this up.**

I keep getting people saying ""no no, AI is amazing, you know nothing about it"" but then they're curiously unable to provide any examples. On Reddit this criticitsm of AI is not only met with zero examples, AI fanboys tend to go on a mass downvote with no response, because they don't want people to see criticism of their precious AI. 

Let me be clear - I *want* AI to be great and do all the stuff people claim it can. But at present it can't.

And finally, it seems all the fears around AI are based on misconceptions and nonsense. Classic moral panic from people who have never seen or used AI. In some cases, quite the opposite of fears about AI being used for nefarious means, people are already using the ""AI"" excuse if they do a video or are pictured doing something they don't want people to see. Which doesn't wash because it is either clearly AI and a load of crap so they had no need to worry, or it is clearly not AI and everyone knows they're lying. "

3,2024-02-25,CMV: Ryan Gosling deserves an Oscar for his performance in Barbie.,u/Fando1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1azr94j/cmv_ryan_gosling_deserves_an_oscar_for_his/,changemyview,"The reason for my post is actually more of a general point around best actor Oscar nominations and wins.

It seems very few comedic performances are even nominated for academy awards… let alone win them. 

I found the below list of nominations for comedic parts here: https://aframe.oscars.org/what-to-watch/post/comedic-performances-that-got-oscars-credit?amp

My girlfriend is a professional actor and director, and she won me over on this point. 

She explained that people generally seem to think a ‘emotional’ or teary performance is the most challenging for an actor. 

And no doubt many Oscar’s are well deserved for this kind of role.

But perhaps the most challenging performances are comic ones. The timing has to be perfect, it has to be ridiculous but not over the top. 

Think about all the great comedic actors like Jim Carey and Robyn Williams. They are great in serious roles, but they’re real, unique talent shows in comedies - Mrs Doubtfire, The Mask, Ace Ventura. Yet these roles almost never win Oscars.

Now Gosling’s no Robyn Williams, but he that doesn’t mean his performance wasn’t fantastic. Expertly delivered, immensely skilful and not something many (even great) actors could do.

Just to pre empt, I’m sure some people will want to chime in about the perceived controversy of the film as being ‘offensive to men’. Irrespective of your thoughts on this, I ask you to park this for a moment and just consider the performance alone."

It's not because men are wimps.

It's not because the technology doesn't exist : there are thousands of users of still experimental methods like the heat based method right now, with spermiograms to confirm their abysmal fertility rates. And the majority of them are satisfied with it.

It's because ethical panels won't allow any side effects for their participants if the ratio side effects/benefits is too low (which is why it's ""acceptable"" for women to endure much more since they can die from pregnancy), and it's because pharmaceutical companies don't invest much into it because they see it as too much of a gamble for many reasons. 

Also lots of men are already satisfied with condoms, vasectomy, pulling out or letting their partner handle it, so for that and many other reasons, they don't see how it's interesting.

I don't see how that's going to change anytime soon, so I don't see how we're not headed for another 50 years of waiting."

1,2024-02-25,CMV: the civil rights act of 1964 should be removed or revised entirely due to how it tramples on the negative freedom of freedom of association and relies on the equity fallacy.,u/anotherblackanon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1azs2hb/cmv_the_civil_rights_act_of_1964_should_be/,changemyview,"disclaimer: I am a black man and I know of the horrors of racism and racist government policies that affected my people but I just do not think the civil rights of 1964 is good law due to how it tramples on the human privilege of freedom of association.

the civil rights act of 1964 was a well intentioned law to remedy the past government policies and acts of racism and the general racism at the time but it should not exist today due it again tramples on freedom of association. the civil rights of 1964 is just on the other side of coin alongside with jim crow laws, the civil rights act just force people to integrate with each other and jim crow laws forces people to be apart. these two laws are very different but are the same in nature where it strips freedom of association from the individual. 

forcing people to be together is much more harmful for society than letting them choose to be together. we do not need government interference in this case to how we can be better as a society. minorities and whites no longer need to actually try but instead the government forces them to integrate with each other and they don't have to really try anymore. 

also this civil rights law relies on or at least brings about the equity fallacy, the equity fallacy is the fallacy that any sort of inequality or unequal outcomes  is seen as discrimination. 

>Section VI discusses intentional discrimination or disparate treatment as one type of Title VI claim. Another type of Title VI violation is based on agency Title VI implementing regulations and is known as the disparate impact or discriminatory effects standard. While a discriminatory impact or effect may also be evidence of intentional discrimination or disparate treatment, this section discusses disparate impact as a cause of action independent of any intent.  


I don't think I need to state how wrong this is but I'll do it anyway. inequality or unequal outcomes existing does not prove that always t discrimination is happening. this had led to cases where companies can be sued for discrimination on this disparate impact standard even when zero discrimination can be proven. 

negative freedom is the absence of external constraints on personal decision making. the government enacting these civil rights laws are impeding on an individuals freedom of association which is a negative freedom. I think its best to be accepting to all groups but that should be done out of an individual choosing to be accepting and not the government forcing him to or someone suing for him for discrimination because he didn't hire enough black people are his business.

Mostly because human attention spans have gotten worse.,u/bobbdac7894,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aztak8/cmv_movies_are_no_longer_king_mostly_because/,changemyview,"Yes, new movies today aren't that good. But it's more than that. I even have a hard time rewatching old classic movies. Like I used to watch Jurassic Park, Godfather and other great movies multiple times.  But I don't even bother watching them anymore. 

  
And I think I know why this is the case. Humans attention spans are getting worse and worse. I asked a kid what shows and movies his classmates watch. He said they watch nothing. That they only get on tiktok. That's when I realized kids don't even watch movies and shows anymore. They would rather watch few minute clips instead of sitting down and watching a 2 hour movie. And if they see a movie trailer that interests them. They can watch a 20 minute summary of it on youtube.

  
And I realized, my attention span has gotten worse over the last ten years too. I used to be able to watch the Lord of the Rings movies, all 3 hours long, in one sit in. 100 percent focused on the movie. But now when I watch movies, I have a tablet or nintendo switch in my hand while the movie is on the TV. I'm multi tasking. My attention attention span isn't that focused on the movie. It's in the background to be honest. 

  
People no longer having the attention capacity to sit down, watch a 2 hour movie, focus on the plot and characters. It's getting too much for them. People would much rather watch short clips on tiktok or youtube. 

  
The numbers are kinda backing up what I'm saying too. Video games has already surpassed movies as an entertainment medium [https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/mustafa-mahmoud/video-games-are-bigger-than-films-and-music-combined/](https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/mustafa-mahmoud/video-games-are-bigger-than-films-and-music-combined/)  . 

  
Now, I'm not saying movies are dying. They're not. But they're going the way of books. Some kids roll their eyes when they have to read a book. Movies are like that too. They're old fashioned. And a ton of people and kids have an appreciation for books. And that will be the same for movies. There will people who will continue to hold an appreciation for movies too. But movies are no longer king anymore. "

I mean you can demand to referred to a certain way if you want but if you're hearing about yourself in the 3rd person all the time it's an issue of people being rude talking about you while you're standing there.

Oh my lord is celery fantastic. Raw, celery is amazing. Celery just on its own with some homemade buttermilk ranch is a top 10 snack of all time. Celery with chicken wings provides a fantastic texture and flavor contrast which is unmatched. Are you an alcoholic? Fantastic! Bloody mary’s with celery can fix any hangover. It’s healthy as fuck, full of fiber, and low calorie. And dip that celery in hummus or throw it in literally any salad and oh my good golly jeepers will you have an experience. Sure it’s a little stringy but that’s a part of the celexperience. 

Oh and cooked? That shit is gas. Ragu sauce without celery is like chicken nugs without sauce. Celery is a key contributor to many of the most renown cajun foods. Soup? Oh wait there’s hella celery in soups like chicken noodle, veggie. Even straight up celery soup is like sex in a bowl. Even just braised celery on its own is delicious. In a stew? Don’t even get me started.

You think I’m done? Start using celery leaves as an herb in your cooking and your life will never be the same. Are chicago dogs something you fancy? Guess what, celery salt brings those dogs from wieners with a bunch of veggies to wieners of monstrous proportions. Also celery salt on anything is so great and is even used to preserve food. 

I am unbelievably jaded by all the hate celery gets. It is so useful and good and people don’t give it a tiddlywink of the respect it deserves.

One particularly hilarious piece was one where he shopped at a russian grocery store. The three minute segment, reminiscent of a north korean propaganda piece, featured an astonished tucker walk around with childlike amazement as he bore witness to a normal shop filled with basic goods and commodities found in every other functioning economy in the world. The end though was truly comical, with his usual face of mild constipation tucker broke into a moving speech about how groceries in russia were a lot cheaper than in the USA and how after this incredible revelation he was radicalised. It is genuinely a piece of comedic gold. 

Here's the link to it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7atS2QVCJ2M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7atS2QVCJ2M)

Now anyone with any common sense will understand prices are cheaper in russia is because wages are lower. But let's take this specific situation average monthly wage in moscow is 125,637.600 RUB or roughly 1,300 dollars. Carlson stated he payed 104 dollars in russia so about 416 dollars per month in russia. This would be about 32% of a muscotives salary on groceries based on tuckers numbers. Now comparing the usa, if using tuckers numbers of 400 dollars a week so 1600 dollars per month, and the average us wage being  $6,228, so roughly 26% on groceries in the usa using tuckers numbers. So in terms of how much groceries cost in respect to earnings they are similar. I feel my numbers might be slightly wrong so please correct me but I think my point still stands.  

Now my point is this tucker, took the TIME and EFFORT to produce this piece of media with a specific message (that people have better standard of living/can buy more food in russia) based upon a point that is demonstrably false. So he has either:

1) not done his due diligence, and doesn't understand basic school grade economics, which is shameful for a grown adult man that claims to be educated and knowledgeable and with a team of producers around him. And why should you listen to someone so incompetent.

2) Or he knows these facts, and he has purposely tried to mislead and misinform, by omitting basic context. Which I believe is what has happened here, I really can't believe even he can be this thick.

So anyway please change my view, try and prove that he isn't stupid or malicious. Because this man has real influence and i would like to know that he is in fact a competent and trustworthy journalist.

Short-medium term over the next 5-20 years there may be an influx of imprisonments and executions, but longer term that should let the drugs addicts either die out or be hidden away in prison, either getting clean or slowly dying.

Scientists do not know when life starts, there is absolutely no consensus on this. Most will agree that there is such a thing called consciousness but we have no idea when that gets implemented. When you kill a fetus you could be killing a soul even if it is 1 week after pregnancy. So when people use the argument that aborting a baby is killing a person, it is completely legitimate because it could very well be the case but we just don't know. The argument that it is better safe to be sorry is completely relevant.

Israel is a country. And as such responds to acts of terrorism how most countries would. By going after the terrorists. Hamas expects this. Moreover it wants this. It wants Israel to kill as many Palestinian civilians as possible. The more civilians killed, the more anger against Israel. This is why Hamas demands Palestinians stay in areas in which they will be killed and hides among them.

Every time a woke-activist bitches about Israel killing civilians, they are the primary and direct reason Hamas continues to commit acts of terrorism. And super ironically they are therefore a large and direct reason that Palestinian civilians are killed.

Everytime you accuse Israel of genocide, or proclaim some gross misinterpretation of the conflict to condem Israel, you playing into Hamas' hand -  perpetuating the conflict.

If every single person stopped condemning Israel and started condemning Hamas, the incentive for Hamas to commit acts of terrorism vanishes. And if Hamas does not attack Israel then Israel does not retaliate and Palestinains don't die."

This makes sense. But there are other animals to consider for the chopping block.

Rhesus monkeys are horrible, and are higher on the food chain. Anything that predates on rhesus macaques must get food from other animals as well. These other animals probably compete with macaques and I am going to go ahead and assume they are less annoying / hostile / evil than macaques. If we simply erase rhesus macaques from the world, the animal kingdom would thank us and no-one in charge would be the wiser."

Whenever I ask them how they would like Israel to respond, they always refuse to answer. They either respond saying what they wouldn’t do (which is just a weird way to respond to any question, and leads the conversation nowhere), or they deflect to talking about Israel occupying palestine (thus implying that massacres are justified and Israel should just accept them). This leads me to conclude that they don’t actually have an issue with Israel defending itself. They have an issue with Israel existing (which is dumb given that all the countries of the world met together and voted that Israel has a right to exist). So, now to my question: I live in California, which used to belong to Mexico. Therefore, we can safely say that California is occupying Mexico. The Mexico-USA situation is therefore a perfect setting to remove the pre-existing bias or alignment with one of the Israel-palestine sides. If you were the governor of California or president of the USA, how would you respond to the government of Mexico sending soldiers to murder families (including children), rape women, and kidnap people (including women to be used as sex slaves), and hide them in tunnels below Mexico City (and promise to do it again and again and again). Also, consider the fact that the soldiers are fighting in civilian clothings, and their tunnels are underneath residential neighborhoods (including schools and hospitals). If it was me, I would send evacuation notices to the citizens, then bomb the houses to expose the tunnels, and block the tunnels. Now, pro-palestinians are clearly not ok with this strategy (given the large protests). So, if you are not ok with the bombardment of Gaza (i.e., one of the real or online protestors), and think Israeli should have responded differently, how would you return the hostages and remove Hamas from power without getting civilians killed? I’m excited to see if you can change my view."

https://x.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1760387644608192560?s=20 

Reasons for holding my view: As an Indian citizen, I strongly believe in the importance of independent journalists who utilize social media to report incidents across the country. Unlike the mainstream media and press, these journalists provide us with valuable information about the current state of our nation. However, it is disheartening to see that the government is imposing strict regulations to suppress their social media accounts, preventing them from influencing others. I believe that the government is doing this solely for their own benefit.  
  
What could change my view: I firmly believe that this situation requires significant global attention. It is crucial for everyone to understand what is happening, and international organizations dedicated to supporting freedom of speech should investigate this matter. By doing so, we may witness a more impartial electoral process in the future. This would not only convince me but also many others about whether our leaders truly represent the expectations of the people.  
  
Counter arguments that I find unconvincing: While there are numerous counter arguments, I will focus on one for the sake of simplicity. Some argue that our government has successfully heightened Hindu sentiments like no other leader before. Undoubtedly, this is true. However, it is not something that should be expected from a diverse country like India, where people of all religions coexist. Communal riots have unfortunately been a recurring issue in our nation. Nevertheless, the government should have refrained from promoting the belief that ""Hindutva is the way of life"" to Hindus. Consequently, other religions have also started excessively glorifying their own beliefs, further widening the gap between different faiths. I implore you to make the right choice and prevent our country from being labeled a dictatorship in the future."

In my opinion, wokeness is a slang umbrella term that is used to describe a collection of ideas that are currently popular among progressives in Western countries. More specifically, they largely refer to ideas that were in some ways influenced by modern political theories and ideologies such as critical theory, intersectionality, 4th wave feminism, etc. Some examples of ideas and trends that are under the ""woke"" umbrella include DEI, modern gender ideology, identity politics, political correctness, white privilege, male privilege, systemic racism, toxic masculinity, fat acceptance, etc.

NOTE 1: I'm aware that the term woke originated as a slang term in AAVE and once had a different meaning. I'm referring to the more common modern usage of the term. 

NOTE 2: I'm aware that many people overuse this word, especially right wingers who use it as a pejorative. I only am using it because it's an easy way to label and group together all these previously mentioned ideas. 


**Why the left is shooting itself in the foot**

In my opinion, I think the left would be much better off focusing on a few key policy issues, such as health care, labor issues, the environment, corporate abuse of power, foreign policy, etc. Instead, the conversation is largely dominated by these certain hot button ""woke"" topics, and it gets in the way. I'm not just talking about politicians making ""wokeness"" a core part of their platform or brand, but also the media, corporations, and many left leaning people in general.

People like Donald Trump are a direct response to this. He won the 2016 election largely because of the backlash against ""wokeness."" In fact, the right wing in a lot of Western countries, especially America, essentially don't have any real platform other than being ""anti-woke."" The rise of right wing populism is essentially a direct response to it, and it's really their only source of ammunition. I would also say that it is the primary source of polarization, at least the primary reason why polarization is so much worse now than it has been in the recent past.  

I'm sure some people will argue that this is because the right wing are a bunch of racists, sexist, transphobes, fatphobes, etc. but comments like this actually just give more ammo to the right and help people like Donald Trump. Obviously there are some right wingers who are bigots (there are bigots on both sides, to be fair), but I don't think that is really an accurate assessment of why someone like Donald Trump can win an election. 

The core reason many people, especially conservatives, are so resistant against ""wokeness"" is because they are resistant to the idea of tearing down the traditional social constructs and social fabric of western civilization and replacing them new social constructs that are based on new age political ideologies and theories. They view it as the decay of Western civilization, almost like the fall of Rome repeating itself. If the goal is to progress and improve society, I really think the left would be much better off focusing on some key policy issues that are more practical, rather than focusing so much on tearing down Western culture and trying to rebuild the culture into something new.

I'm an immigrant in New York, and I'm a pretty libertarian-minded blue voter. 

That being said, I think McCarthyism was not only good but indeed necessary for America to prosecute the Cold War properly. 

It is well-documented that FDR and his ideological bloc of New Deal Democrats were fairly soft on communism, and I don't know many people who would dispute that, had FDR survived into his fourth term, he wouldn't have taken the hardline anti-communist stance that his successor Truman did. 

Despite Truman's strong anti-communism, at the beginning of the 1950s, FDR supporters, socialists, and fellow travelers were still a big part of the American political scene. Keep in mind that in 1949, Albert Einstein, a leading public intellectual of the time, felt comfortable publishing an article called ""Why Socialism""?

McCarthy, once and for all drove socialist sentiments (and, by extension, Soviet propagandists), which were still somewhat mainstream, ten feet deep into the ground. Yes, some (most?) of his accusations were false, many were bluster, but from a purely utilitarian lens, if prominent socialists were allowed to freely express their political opinions at the time period, it could potentially have weakened America's resolve and willingness to prosecute the Cold War as aggressively as they did. Even if McCarthy went after the wrong people, the *real* spies were forced into the shadows by the sheer anti-communism in America's political consciousness. American socialism never really recovered from McCarthy.

If we hadn't the Cold War, we would still have an evil (oftentimes bordering on genocidal) regime in the former Soviet Union, along with Eastern Europe and large chunks of other continents being controlled by said regime. 

Essentially, if we didn't have McCarthy, we'd have far less resolve to go after the USSR as aggressively as we did (thanks to Communist propaganda openly being disseminated, as well as it not being taboo to be a socialist in politics), which would mean that global communism would still be a thing.

Insight into Regulatory Dynamics: The theory provides a useful framework for understanding how seemingly opposing groups can align to support particular regulations, shedding light on the complex dynamics behind regulatory capture and rent-seeking behavior.  
Coalition Building: By forming alliances between groups with differing motivations, regulators and lobbyists can increase the chances of achieving their goals. The moral argument appeals to the public and policymakers, while the profit motive ensures financial backing and support.  
Stability of Regulations: Policies supported by both moral and economic interests are more likely to be resilient against challenges or changes in political climates. This stability benefits both the ""Baptists"" who seek to uphold moral standards and the ""bootleggers"" who seek to maintain their profits.  
Arguments Against:  
Simplification of Complex Motivations: Critics argue that reducing regulatory dynamics to a simple dichotomy oversimplifies the complexities of policymaking. Not all regulations can be neatly categorized into ""Baptists"" and ""bootleggers"" camps, and many regulations arise from a variety of interests and factors.  
Neglects Genuine Moral Concerns: By framing moral arguments as mere cover for self-interested motives, the theory can undermine the sincerity of genuine moral concerns. It suggests that moral arguments are always used strategically rather than emerging from deeply held beliefs.  
Overlooks Role of Public Interest: The theory tends to overlook the possibility of genuine public interest driving regulatory policies. Not all regulations are solely influenced by special interests; many arise from legitimate concerns for public health, safety, and welfare.  
Dynamic Nature of Regulatory Capture: While the theory captures a common pattern of regulatory capture, it fails to fully account for the evolving nature of regulatory capture and the potential for countervailing forces to challenge entrenched interests over time.

1,2024-02-25,CMV: Watching porn when you're in a relationship is fine and women who punish men because of it will die alone,u/ahollowuniverse,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b02c7s/cmv_watching_porn_when_youre_in_a_relationship_is/,changemyview,"There's nothing wrong with your choice to indulge, but it's also important to understand that women don't think like us, and most don't want to accept and/or understand that a man can cherish and desire his woman and also jerk his pole to randoms when he doesn't have access to her.

Women are often illogical when confronted with the sexually dominant aspects of men's nature. To them, sex and desire are almost always directly tied to emotion and intimacy. It's quite difficult for them to separate the two, which is why situations like these are often so stressful to navigate, and why men tend to find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place when trying to come up with a solution.

To be clear, there's likely no win-win scenario for you. You're either going to have to give up porn, pretend to give up porn and still stroke it in private, or end your relationship and find another woman who will consider your porn use in a more logical manner, which isn't common.

What's funny to me is that it's extremely likely that if you were a woman and made a post complaining about your SO's disgust and uncompromising stance regarding your porn use, many comments, and especially comments made by women, would have a more patient and sympathetic tone than might be found in the opposite case, and would also possibly demonize your SO for being ""controlling, manipulative, insecure, ignorant, and/or difficult.""

Women will often punish men, even the ones they're supposed to be building enriching futures with, when certain factors in a relationship (like porn use, for example) don't directly contribute to their satisfaction. Yet they'll also punish men when similar circumstances they engage in are placed under scrutiny.

Women tend to want their cake and eat it too, which is not only impossible, but usually does nothing but damage a relationship in the long run by way of confusion, frustration, resentment, disgust, and in due time a complete lack of respect.

In my opinion (if you're open to the idea of kicking porn), asking your SO to provide photos and videos of herself to replace it is a logical thing, but she may refuse to do so in an attempt to punish you or control you with whatever sexual access you'll get tossed your way when you eventually ""behave"" or are ""forgiven.""

When a woman ridicules, restricts access to, and/or dismisses your sexual needs, you're not dealing with one who has your best interests at heart. You're dealing with a selfish, vitriolic person who finds pleasure in your misery: never the sort of woman to be considered a permanent part of your life.

With all that said, it's also vital for us to acknowledge that, just like men, women are free to have expectations and exercise boundaries in any relationship. There's nothing wrong with you wanting to watch porn. However, there's also nothing wrong with a woman NOT wanting you to watch porn. What's wrong is when she expects you to behave unrealistically, punishes you for expressing a desire to communicate and compromise, uses ultimatums to unfairly get her way, and then refuses to acknowledge the hurt that surfaces when double standards are created and enforced.

To the younger men in fledgling relationships, understand that situations like these don't often change when you get older, so, if you find yourself dealing with this now, take it seriously and be honest with yourself and your other half about why you both do the things you do and think in the ways you do (that includes the reasons for your porn use, its frequency, and how it may or may not influence your day to day life, positively or negatively).

Some of your relationships may end because of circumstances like these. Sometimes the fault will be yours, and sometimes your other half will reveal herself to be an undesirable monster. Regardless, in each case, do your best to build the habit of not hating the women who put you through the ringer. Although at times they can be unpleasant, ungrateful, and selfish, they're not evil. Many of the things that make them that way are not inherent to the gender. They're taught. Always keep that in mind.

And never forget that the best relationships are a balance of patience, compromise, communication, and respect.

All the best.

TL;DR

Your porn use isn't the worst thing in the world, but your SO may demand that you stop, which is her right. Come to a clear conclusion why by communicating openly and take appropriate action, but don't allow her to dictate and enforce strict preferences, rules, and boundaries when you have none. The best relationships are a balance of patience, compromise, communication, and respect."

Possibly more (e.g. other federal justices), but at least those groups listed above.  

My view is that these officials have elected to fill these positions, and part of the public contract should include opening up their financial records to public scrutiny. The goal here is to reduce corruption and to shine light on the interests that influence public policy in this country. 

Individuals who choose to run for these offices, or accept these nominations, should agree to have their financial records completely open to public review and inspection. This period should last as long as their term lasts, plus some time after they leave office. My loosely-held belief is that this probationary period should last as long as their term in office did, i.e. that if they serve 6 years in office, they should keep their finances open for a further 6 years after they leave office. The details of the probationary period are less important to me than the idea that they should have their finances open while they're in office, plus a brief time afterwards.

I believe that this isn't because Nintendo itself is inherently a company that hates their fanbase, rather, I believe that this is because the current legal status quo in Japan is for publishers, developers, and other companies to be as litigious as possible in protecting their IP. Nintendo's cease & desisting is a direct logical consequence of having a country with legislation that doesn't protect fair use.

Whenever I see Japanese streamers or youtubers play games that parodies Nintendo or other Japanese gaming companies, they always say: 'Is that ok? Is this legal?' kind of as a  joke about how companies are super strict about this. Its something they have to be aware of when streaming games, companies follow these laws, I as a Japanese citizen need to follow these laws, those Palworld devs need to be aware of those laws, and basically everyone at least this side of the border is aware that fair use doesn't exist.

So with that in mind, if you are making a fan game using a Nintendo IP, I think you're running into a brick wall, or at least, ignorant to what will happen to you in the near future.

I believe if fan game developers want to make fan games, they should just make quick redesigns of Nintendo properties to make their games. Japanese parody games and art does it all the time. Like, I think the internet is pretty aware on how manga authors usually say: ""Super XXrio OXthers"", or ""PXXemon"", or ""Final Fantasia 17"" with characters consisting of ""Bario"", or ""Pakachi"", or ""Claude Strike"". its not really had to do and I dont know why more developers don't do it.

If you actually wanted to change the legal system, that's a whole other can of worms, but I do believe that foreign citizens interfering with an increasingly isolated political situation is kinda not really the vibe of this country imo.

I observe the people who make friends easily and have people excited to hang out with them  
and I always ask what is it about them that makes them so desirable ?

  
Is it because they're funny? Is it because they're more kind? Usually not I see assholes be adored  
Is it them being understanding?

  
And these are all things I've tried to implement in my own lfie

  
I've observed people say random shit and no one bats an eye and sparks conversation based off the mundane absurd thing they said.. I could say something worth while and people look at each other wondering why I'm talking  
I've seen people say vulgar, annoying shit and still be accepted...

  
And so I finally realized it's appearance.. because time and time again before I even talk to people they already seem turned off by having to be around me... if you're not doing anything wrong to hurt anyone, or saying anything offensive what is there to be that disgusted by if not looks? Whereas they let other better looking people talk or not talk and still accept them

  
It made me realize that NO ONE IS SPECIAL.. IT'S NOT some magical miraculous attractive personality that's making people like them. Usually it's the acceptance they are granted from their looks that informs how they are allowed to act around other people and people usually just accept it when you're not ugly ..

  
Like I cannot stress enough how hard I've worked so much more than people at my job thinking people hated me because I was lazy... just to have pretty bitches barely do anything and people love them so much and they make up shit about me

  
I can't express how much I've talked just to get told I was annoying but to over hear a person with an ANNOYINGLY GRATING VOICE BE Laughed with and accepted

  
I can't express how many times I asked for help in a normal, calm, respectful tone and people acted as if I farted in their face

  
I can't express how many times I've been quiet to protect myself from criticism and bullying just to overhear people say I'M SO WEIRD AND PSYCHOTIC AND they're scared I'm going to shoot up the place.... like it's shit like THAT that actually makes me ANGRY cause I'm over here trying to protect myself and people make up the stupidest shit just because I'm ugly

  
I can't express how much I thought that it was because I was dumb that people hated me when when I've showcased intelligence people criticized me for being a "" know it all"" but then when I messed something up they said I was ""retarded"" then when they mess up it's ""LOL OOOPSIES"" ""it's ok girlie you're only human"" smh dumb bitches

  
I can't express how much I thought it was because I wasn't friendly enough , but when I was smiley and upbeat and literally went out of my comfort zone to connect with people they turned their noses up at me and I had one person a couple weeks ago say to me "" you're making a fool of yourself trying to say ""hi"" and talk to people"" why? I thought that's what normal people do? me talking to you guys is only weird because you think I'm ugly lets be completely honest cause that sounds dumb ass fuck. Y'all all get excited to see and talk to each other and so this pretty much confirmed that I'm only outcasted because I'm ugly because I ACTUALLY TRIED and had someone telll me I'm making a fool of myself by trying to talk to people... something that everyone does... lol

  
And so I look at these people... and I realize... ?? Where is the special trait or feature that's making them so accepted and liked and me so hated.. of course the answer was given to me when I got called ugly so many times in public unprovoked...

  
And it made me realize when you're not ugly you're free to just talk to people and people treat it like normal casual convo and are open to talking about whatever with you.. but when you're ugly anything you do is wrong.. so talking to people becomes ""OMG THEY'RE SO CREEPY AND DEPSERATE FOR FRIENDS"" not talking to people becomes ""omg they're sooo creepy and a loser""

Then she murders the baby and everyone acts surprised when she's in jail because her family didn't give her the option to give it away for adoption, so she murdered it because she wasn't ready to be a mother. But that's not what the news tells people. All they say is ""Mother kills child"" and leave it at that. Then society calls her a horrible person until years later when she comes out with an interview telling the truth that she had no choice and the only choice she had to get away from her depressing, horrible life was killing her child and calling that a mercy. Then people switch up REAL QUICK and say, ""I'm so sorry you went through that.""

1,2024-02-25,"CMV: We should normalize telling guys when they are below-average-looking, and telling them when this is probably the reason that a woman rejected them.",u/bennetthaselton,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b06fal/cmv_we_should_normalize_telling_guys_when_they/,changemyview,"Before proceeding with the more controversial argument, two premises that I think are near-mathematically certain (you can try to cmv about these, but the bar is higher):

* If you have never told a guy that they are below-average-looking, you cannot possibly be giving accurate information, since 50% of guys are below-average-looking. (I am incorporating height as a component of ""looks"".)
* If you have never told a guy that the reason a woman probably rejected them is because of their looks (including in cases where you are the woman), then you almost certainly cannot be giving accurate information, since below-average-looking guys are rejected at a higher rate.

These two statements are, I think, obvious. The real question is when it's beneficial to *be* honest.

(Throughout the discussion below, when I refer to ""telling a guy why they were rejected"", I am referring to both a woman telling the guy why she rejected him, and to a third party telling the guy why he was probably rejected in a specific instance, or why he is generally rejected more than average. I think the reasoning is the same in all cases.)

Now, if someone is rejecting a guy because of their looks, they might think they are making the rejection sting less if they tell a guy that it's something they can change (e.g. clothes), because that gives them hope for the future (although it's usually implied you should change things up and ask out a different person, not switch up outfits and try again with the same person!). But if this isn't the real reason, you are just setting the guy up to be disappointed later, which is not morally right or helpful. Plus possibly causing other harms in the process (wasting money on clothes, or encouraging the guy to adopt a personality change that is not really who he is).

Meanwhile, if someone claims they don't want to tell a guy he was rejected because of his looks because it would ""hurt his feelings"", that is obviously not true if they attributed it to something else (dress, personality, etc.). Making up an alternate reason is not going to be any less hurtful. More to the point, it's likely to be *more* hurtful because it explicitly puts the blame on something that is the guy's ""fault"". If nobody is willing to admit that rejection is because of looks, this results in below-average-looking men being regularly insulted about their character, intelligence, posture, hygiene, dress, or anything that a person might pick as an alternate explanation. This results in more angry and depressed men and boys who often lash out, and nobody benefits.

So, what are the benefits of telling the truth to below-average-looking men:

* One is that it offers a more realistic path forward for the man to find a mate. If a man is rejected more than average because of his looks, and you (falsely) tell him it's because he is rude or annoying or low intelligence (and he can't think of anything he does that is rude, so he can't change it), then he could reasonably assume almost all women will also be put off by these attributes and that there's no point. On the other hand, if a man is below average looking such that only 10% of women might find him attractive, that just means he might have to ask out 10 women, instead of 2 or 3 women. That's annoying and unfair, but hardly insurmountable.
* The other is that it shows more respect for below-average-looking men to tell them the truth. They're already dealing with higher than average rates of rejection; on top of that they don't need insults about everything *except* their looks. If they don't know the truth, then they can be overwhelmed from the feeling that everything about them is broken; if they do know the truth, then they just experience society as an endless series of people lying to them.

Now, this does not mean blurting out ""She doesn't like you because you're ugly!"" every time you think this to be the case. A more polite version might be, ""Well, chemistry is a funny thing, if someone doesn't feel chemistry with you, then everything else doesn't matter much, but it doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with you. Try asking out 10 different women and see what happens."" What I mostly mean is *don't* be part of the problem by saying ""You look fine"" and then just randomly picking something other than their looks to criticize.  Once again: if you have never told a guy that he was below-average-looking (or that this was a reason a woman rejected him), you can't possibly be giving accurate information. If that hasn't sunk in, read it again, because that's the key to everything else.

So, tell the truth to guys who are below-average-looking, which is the right thing to do in and of itself, and will also suggest a strategy that is more likely to lead to them finding a mate.  CMV."

1.) The size of space. The universe is unfathomably large and it’s ever growing too. Given the sheer size of it, it would be more surprising if we ever *did* encounter any alien life form than not. It is possible that two alien civilizations have encountered each other before, but I imagine they would have to be close in proximity.

2.) Technology. It would take a lot of technology to be able to leave the planet and find aliens. We struggle to go to Mars, let alone venture into other planets that could harbor alien life. If we as humans struggle to find alien life forms, they would probably struggle finding us too.

3.) Development of life. If there are aliens out there, most of them will probably be bacterial life at the very least. Some might be intelligent, but I doubt most alien life will be as intelligent as humans are, as no life here on Earth is intelligent as we are. There probably are intelligent aliens (maybe some more than us), but it’ll probably be the minority of alien life forms.

All in all, the Fermi Paradox does a bad job of explaining why we haven’t found aliens, as most aliens are too far from us, not technologically developed, or not intelligent life forms that would be able to communicate with us."

You can easily apply these same reasonings to abortion. Legally (In the USA/North America), abortion was practiced from the 1600s to the 1860s, then banned, and once again made legal during Roe v. Wade. Secondly, the harm a pregnancy can cause is not to be underestimated. If you feel threatened by the risk of an intruder with a firearm (which is a very valid fear), I'm not sure how you can act like you have a moral high-ground to those who fear the complications of pregnancy and childbirth.

I've been in plenty of situations where I share more than enough values and interests with a woman to be mutually compatible. We'll text for a week or so, meet up, and have a seemingly good date where we're both nervous but manage to have good conversation and not have to bail out prematurely, but then it seems the default reason to cut it off is a lack of chemistry. After one date.  
  
What exactly does chemistry mean? It's not necessarily synonymous with compatibility, because if we agree on pretty much everything, why would they say there's no chemistry? It could be physical attraction, but I don't think that's it for multiple reason, plus, nor have I heard it argued that that's what it is. If you were going to explain what chemistry is to a person who was completely new to the concept of dating and relationships, you'd probably say something like, ""It's hard to explain, but you'll know when you have good chemistry. You'll just instantly click with the other person,"" or, ""You'll just feel like you can be yourself around them.""  
  
What kind of person do you think of that has a knack for getting past barriers and making people feel comfortable? Con men (con being short for confidence). Am I trying to say that everyone who is able to have chemistry with another person is a con man? Not in the sense that we know con men to be inherently devious and evil, but by definition, maybe. I'm convinced that chemistry is simply where one or both people have enough charm/confidence to get past the other person's guard. I don't believe it's a magical or abstract quality that happens between two people who've been predestined for each other, nor do I think it's some invisible biological trigger or pheromone reaction.   
  
I'd prefer to believe that chemistry does exist in a more supernatural (for lack of a better term) way, where it's merely chance and that everyone has someone out there with whom they have ""chemistry."" But I've seen too many people who have instant chemistry with everyone they meet to think it's anything more than just an innate ability to charm anyone. Serial killers come to mind."

1,2024-02-26,"CMV: Any healthy individual can survive comfortably on $15 an hour full time in America, given that they're not choosing to live in very high cost-of-living areas.",u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b0bntz/cmv_any_healthy_individual_can_survive/,changemyview,"I've traveled around the USA quite a bit and I've lived in a few different places. I've discovered that even though the federal minimum wage is $7.65, I don't imagine there are many counties where the average ""low end"" wage is actually close to this, or if they do exist they are few and far between and have a very low cost of living (and are probably not pleasant places to live).

And I would say, for people who live in places where their income potential genuinely caps out below $10 an hour, they should make every effort to move somewhere where the low-end of the wage scale pays more than $10, because whatever loss or hardship they go through in order to make the move, the huge jump in profit potential they gain will be very much worth it.

And while housing costs can be very high, there are several ways to mitigate this cost as an individual.

Living in an efficiency apartment or renting a room is rarely going to be more than $800 a month. In case you aren't aware what an efficiency apartment is, it's basically below a studio apartment. Essentially a hotel room with a kitchenette.

I would say any area where an efficiency apartment costs more than $800 is an unreasonably high cost-of-living for a person whose education and skills will not avail them of an income potential over $15 an hour, and such places need to be avoided. A person who doesn't have an income potential of more than $15 an hour would be making a dire mistake by moving to such an area, and should not expect to be able to financially survive in such an area.

It seems to me that while housing costs and cost-of-living can be volatile, it's entirely possible to survive on $15 an hour full time (I should know, it's how I live) - I think there are a few reasons why people complain about not being able to afford to live, or complaining that they're not being paid a ""living wage"":

1) Choosing to live in high cost-of-living areas where their income potential is incompatible with the area.

2) Not spending their money wisely/having excessive spending habits.

3) Not choosing housing situations which are compatible with their income potential.

I think #2 is often overlooked because people know that they aren't going to be required to show you an itemized list of their non-essential spending, and as such they can just say, ""I'm not getting paid a living wage"", even if the truth is that they spend a significant portion of their income on non-essential things.

While it may be true that some places in America are very expensive to live, that's unfortunately the nature of supply and demand. The United States is a very desirable country to live in (hence why so many people immigrate here), and as such the most desirable places will be expensive.

So in short, I think the problem is typically that people don't modify their expectations to be in accordance with their income potential in America, and this is why people claim that places don't pay a ""living wage""."

- You can make yourself more marketable by developing your skills and hobbies, but it ultimately makes it sadder that you're applying for an entry-level job the older you get, as others are developing their careers alongside you. 

- You can go on websites where lots of people are advertising, but it's so impersonal trying to sell yourself with just what you can write about yourself, and besides, the websites profit on you being unsuccessful and desperate, so they'll try to keep it that way. 

- Even if you make a great application, ultimately they can ghost you at anytime, without you knowing why. It might be in the first shortlist, maybe after the first interview. In theory, you can both withdraw at any time, but you've put your time and soul into the application, so you're more invested than they are. 

- All the time you're unemployed/single, you're aware of the opportunities in the adult world you're missing out on, especially what the media tells you. For this reason, you're more inclined to blanket the market with generic applications, making it even more impersonal, and putting yourself at risk of being exploited. You might even set aside some of your integrity to increase your chances.

* A republic is a state in which political power rests with the public through their representatives. 
* Democracy is a system of government in which state power is vested in the people or the general population of a state. 

The media narrative and Democratic politicians have claimed endlessly that January 6th was an ""attack on democracy"" - however, the *democracy* part was essentially completed at that point, and we were well into the republican phase of the election process. 

January 6th was a violent attack on our representatives and an illegal political attempt to install illegitimate electors in the Electoral College. The events leading up to January 6th and the attempts to push false certificates of ascertainment by the Trump campaign were mostly targeted towards influencing elected representatives to bend the rules for him.

The Electoral College (love it or hate it) is an extremely republican concept. Electors can be faithless and stray from their state's vote in the event they come to believe their candidate is not fit for office. 

To me an ""attack on democracy"" would be something like coordinated voter intimidation or some other method of preventing citizens from exercising their voting rights in the first place. 

Both in terms of accuracy and to highlight the specific hypocrisy of Republicans who defend anti-republican actions, we'd all be better off if we used ""attack on the republic"" to describe January 6th. Whenever the media or Democrats use ""attack on democracy"", many Republicans make specious arguments that ""America is not a democracy"" since America is not a *direct* democracy.

I'm open to having my view changed.

The decision to have a child is made solely by the parents, without the child's consent or choice in the matter. It's a decision driven by the parents' desires, needs, or societal pressures, among other factors. Consequently, the responsibility to care for and raise that child falls naturally on the parents as a direct outcome of their decision. From this perspective, providing for the child is not an act that warrants gratitude but rather a fundamental duty stemming from the parents' initial choice.

I acknowledge that gratitude is a positive emotion and expressing it can strengthen relationships. However, it should arise naturally out of genuine appreciation and recognition of kindness and support, rather than being an obligation imposed by societal norms or parental expectations.

I'm interested in hearing counterarguments or different perspectives on this issue. Perhaps there are angles I haven't considered or implications of my view that I've overlooked. Change my view."

I think the first time I saw this ""reasoning"" was in a video about Juchebong (which if true I have to say is the best thing North Korea has ever done and is something that all countries should implement) to those who don't know about this, to summarize, it is a punishment for pedophiles in which their penis is slowly mutilated. Most of the people in the comments thought the same as me, and were commenting things like ""the only good thing about North Korea and it's fantastic"", ""I wish this were implemented in all countries"", ""if this were done to rapists and pedophiles the cases of rape would be greatly reduced for fear of the consequences and we would live in a better world."" but there was a small sector of men terrified, and repeating like parrots the ""I prefer that all rapists and pedophiles be free than a single innocent person sentenced"" which is absurd and crazy to think, in the first place because such horrendous and disgusting crimes should never go unpunished (and unfortunately they often go unpunished, which is a disgrace that must be changed), and secondly, are you really telling me that when there is no doubt that that person is a pedophile, we should not act due to a supposed possible innocence that cannot exist? There are cases in which it is very obvious that that person is a pedophile, there are cases in which it is very obvious that that person has raped, these cases should not be executed in a ""soft"" way due to a non-existent possibility of innocence.

The next times were here on reddit (which makes me consider deleting this app if it's full of this type of people...) in posts talking about how women can ruin the lives of innocent men, which is absurd because many times they cannot even ruin the lives of those who are guilty because these types of crimes are not punished fairly and the penalties are laughable (also, those same men who say this are more likely to be raped by another man than to be falsely accused, but for some ""strange"" reason they are not afraid of the first thing I mentioned). Other times I have seen this argument in debates about prison sentences for this type of crime, which are very low, pedophilia and rape have to be punished in the harshest ways possible in my opinion, but these people, even with the current penalties think it is better to have all rapists and pedophiles free rather than a single innocent person convicted, which I see as the most obvious way to incriminate themselves, what are they so afraid of? Why do they see it as wrong to punish crimes as horrendous as rape or pedophilia? Why do they only think like this with these crimes but with other much smaller ones like theft they are in favor of the worst punishments? Why are they against not condemning any pedophile or rapist for fear of a single innocent victim but they are not anti-prison? Why so much hypocrisy and so much fear?

Maybe in some remote case they are neither pedophiles nor rapists, but they are hiding something, even if it is some type of abuse they have committed and hence that fear."

In a particular booth, there was an awesome display of lightning. Many flocked around, and the representative was explaining. The audience was silently listening without any questions; 5 mins into it, a man started asking the meaning of some terms the rep had previously used.  The rep explained the terms in simple language, and then the interaction went to a different level as many from the crowd started asking questions, which showed their genuine interest. What would have been a lost opportunity turned into a very informative interaction. 

I think many in the crowd held back initially due to maybe saving face, getting intimidated by competition to showoff as the world does compare confidence to competence. 

I think accepting being ignorant about something is a powerful choice one can make as what we know is only a miniscule as per our knowledge and experience, and what lies outside is a large domain of knowledge.  It is liberating in a way to realize how little you know as it opens up a pathway to learning or seeking knowledge. 

 Acknowledging it in front of others is like showing that I am ready for hitchhiking on the path to reach my destination. 

The title of the post is actually from a quote by a mystic Sadhguru – ‘Being ignorant is a borderless possibility’ - which I found very powerful."
1,2024-02-26,Cmv: comparing the meat industry to the Holocaust is antiSemitic ,u/f0remsics,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b0hsax/cmv_comparing_the_meat_industry_to_the_holocaust/,changemyview,"I should start off by saying I myself am a Jew. I've seen a bunch of videos by a bunch of vegans that use the phrase animal Holocaust to refer to the meat industry. I believe this is anti-Semitic for a variety of reasons. First I will explain why I believe it is a bad comparison:

Firstly, animals aren't killed because we think they deserve to die. They are killed as humanely as possible for the sake of human sustenance. Jews, however, were killed because they were deemed deserving of death, and viewed as ruining the gene pool with their continued existance. If you think that that reason applies to animals as well, you should probably talk to a psychiatrist, because animals don't affect the gene pool.

Now for why I believe it is anti-Semitic. There are quite a few insults that are slung at Jews. One of the common ones is pig. By saying that the industry that kills pigs is the same as the industry that killed jews, they are directly comparing Jews and pigs. That, to me, is close enough for comparison for me to be extremely insulted.

I really would like to be less angry at these people, at least for these reasons. Is there some sort of missing logic in my argument here? Or is it a good stance? Change my view."

I know many bad things have happened because of nationalism, but that's not the essence of nationalism and it's not fair to criticise nationalism because of that. It's like saying the worst atrocities of Stalin and Mao are what socialism is all about. Nationalism is simply an idea that a group of people united by shared culture, language, and history is a nation and a nation should have the right to self-determination such as a nation-state.

Merriam-Webster defines nationalism as

>loyalty and devotion to a nation especially : a sense of national consciousness exalting one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or supranational groups

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's definition is

>the attitude that the members of a nation have when they care about their national identity, and  
>  
>the actions that the members of a nation take when seeking to achieve (or sustain) self-determination.

I'm from Korea. Without Korean nationalism in the 20th century, Korea may never have gained independence from the Japanese colonial rule and Korea would never have existed as it does today. In fact, most of the world's nations would never have existed as it does today without nationalism. Nationalism is not immune to criticism, of course, and there are many legitimate problems with nationalism. (I find the anarchist critique of nationalism to be very compelling) However, considering that the vast majority(at least 99%) of humanity identifies with a particular nation or nation-state, and therefore is a nationalist, I think today's criticism of nationalism goes too far and is unfair(And I also think it's highly likely that most people who criticize nationalism are nationalists themselves.)"

I had to be quite specific in the title because folks here often go just for the title.

Yugoslavia: that country was like a shirt owned by a person who had gained a lot of weight and Tito was the one button still keeping the shirt together. Tito's death was immediately followed by ethnic conflicts. If a country needs a dictatorship for people not to kill each other, these people are better off as separate countries.

Africa: some of the shitshow that happened on the continent since the departure of the colonizers is because these new countries' borders were deliberately made disregarding ethnic borders so the countries would have a hard time being their own thing. A country needs a common attribute for its populace to unite. It's easy for a more ethnically homogeneous country like Iceland or Slovenia, but harder for a more diverse country. Even diverse countries have one thing in common to create unity (Islam in Pakistan, vague ideals of freedom in the United States, whatever unites Canada, among others). However, the damage is already done, remaking the borders to match ethnic borders will only cause more wars.

United States: the so-called ""melting pot"" (although this term has assimilationist implications), where people could (allegedly) be free, a country that is proud of its population of cosmopolitan origins. The United States initially didn't adopt an official language because of the non-British settlers. However, a lot of problems in the US are because of racism. The same country that didn't assign English as the official language nationwide because of settlers of other European countries also forced the indigenous populations to abandon their culture, forced Africans to become basically flesh machines, forced the then-newly-freed Black people into lesser roles and into basically a separate worse society, forced Filipinos to stop speaking Spanish, forced Hawai'ians to give up their language and culture, and now, despite being a nation built by immigrants, a lot of Americans hate immigrants. Now Indigenous people in the Americas deal with generational trauma so bad it's kinda in their genes, **incluing being unable to listen to a colonial language without triggering a trauma**. Also, American culture is apparently bland and boring so people identify with their ancestors' quite gatekeepy culture(s), making mixed-race people ""confused"" and have identity crises, like half of /mixedrace is angst over not fitting anywhere.

Europe: mostly made-up of (somewhat) homogeneous countries, these countries have ""diversity"" mostly because of immigrants. The immigrants only go to Europe because Europe fucked up the rest of the world to the point of looking like a utopia by comparison, and the high quality of life depended and still depends on them fucking up the rest of the world even more. And Europe only ""needs"" immigrants because it has an economic system that relies on constant growth, there needs to be a lot of young workers to sustain the elderly population, and ""native"" Europeans aren't ""breeding"" fast enough for the market's liking (and are often too expensive for those stingy businesses).

Brazil (maybe the rest of Latin America as well): often called ""racial democracy"". There is no racial harmony. Black and brown people are way more likely to be poor and Latin America has the worst wealth inequality in the world. Much of the miscegenation in Latin America comes from whitening policies and from the rape of Black and Indigenous women. This is why a lot of Black activists in Brazil think that miscegenation is genocide and that the word ""pardo"" (word commonly used for the mixed-race brown people) ""should only be used for paper and bears"".

Have you noticed all those groups for Black/Asian/Latino/LGBT+ whatever, even for stuff that has nothing to do with race or sexuality (like constructed languages or gardening)? Being a minority makes people feel unsafe in ""general"" spaces just by being outnumbered, making ""good segregation"" necessary sometimes, and your very specific experiences get drowned by ""white"" or ""cis-het"" experiences. And that creates a vicious cycle where the ""general"" forums get more and more dominated by the majority population.

Also, have you seen children at a school? Kids bully each other over **anything**. This is why the alleged benefit of school unity of uniforms doesn't work. This is why a nation-wide list of approved names for newborns is pointless."

I also want to be clear that I do NOT condone any of the morbid actions that some of the really radical incels have committed.

For those who may not have been following, I am almost 25, never had a relationship or sex in my life, and will probably never have a good career to rise above those who mistreated me in my life. I went through profound bullying in the latter stages of elementary school, all of middle school, and early high school. It took various forms, from physical early on to verbal and cyber later on, in addition to experiencing a plethora of passive aggressive exclusions and betrayal from my peers, along with neglect from the adults in my life. Not to mention having to see most of my peers doing better than me over the past 8 years after my mind suffered its irrevocable destruction.

Sounds eerily similar to a lot of incels, don't you think? Take Elliot Rodger and Alek Minassian, they experienced bullying, neglect and overall feeling like failures. While I have no concrete info of the conditions that the former lived with, I know the latter had autism and Tourette's, which would explain much of the bullying he went through. While these people certainly deserved every bit of condemnation for what they did, a big part of me believes that they also deserve some bit of understanding and empathy for a lot of the stuff that led to them feeling the way they did, and even may have prevented them from following through if they were genuinely supported.

Now onto why I say that. It's bad enough to be mistreated for various things, but imagine if you were being mistreated for something you had no control over, like autism, being short, balding, you name it. Now some people would welcome such challenges, but I'd wager that the vast majority would feel utterly helpless and resentful, take any of the subs dedicated to such issues. 

As such, I feel like if these two, among many other incels that are less radical had gotten genuine support prior to the onset of whatever issues they may have, then they wouldn't have fallen into the dark abyss that they cannot escape. I certainly can attest to it, as I feel like I did not get the PROPER support growing up. I was diagnosed with autism at 14 years old, but wasn't told of the diagnosis until 5 years later. And while I had seen about 6 therapists by the time I had found out, and am currently on my 12th, I feel that by that time my mind become irrevocably destroyed in a way that I still can't seem to describe succinctly. Also, not having the therapists be able to be fully transparent and dedicated to working with me on my autism due to my parents deeming me unfit to know of my autism, really hindered their ability to provide the best kind of support. As such, I too experienced the suffocating loneliness and feeling like a total loser failure the way many incels can attest to. 

Additionally, I have encountered far too many people on Reddit and some in real life that seem to not really grasp the profound difficulties that many incels go through. Some people online have kicked me while I am down, and some people in real life have dropped me because of my ""attitude"". Okay, that's valid, but it seems like they never considered the REASONS behind said attitude.

Once again, I want to make it transparent that I DO NOT want to go down the immoral and heinous path that Rodger and Minassian, among others, went through, but I nevertheless thought I'd express just how much they must have been suffering and how them not getting the help they need may have contributed to their descent into darkness."

As a generally pretty left wing and not conspiracy minded person, I’m surprised by the reaction from people I usually agree with about 15 minute cities.

These concerns seem to be seen as a ridiculous conspiracy by most people I’d usually agree with politically…. But to me it does feel like recent context makes them a genuine concern.

I’m from the UK and in the past 4 years we have had 3 separate legally enforced lockdowns where it became illegal for people to mix or to travel without good reason. During this time however, it was still possible to travel by car, train or public transport because some people had genuine need to do this for work, medical reasons etc and so the whole system had to be enabled.

My concern with 15 minute cities is that it gives the government an excuse in the next lockdown to ban all travel “why would you need to travel at all now that our 15 minute city initiative means all you need is in the local area?”

I’m particularly concerned about this in the context of climate change - which I agree is a profound threat to the world, and in the long term a much bigger concern than Covid was.

It feels very possible for people to soon be calling for a complete travel ban once 15 minute cities are completed - “emissions cause global warming, you have no need to travel because everything is nearby, therefore all car trips or public transport is banned for the foreseeable future”. This feels like a pathway that could lead to essentially permanent lockdown. 

I’d really like someone to change my view because I feel like I’m on the edge of agreeing with silly conspiracy theories…. But given the government literally did make it criminal to travel during COVID I can’t help but think it’ll happen again and 15 minute cities will enable it.

1,2024-02-26,"CMV: Laws against so-called ""Marital Rape"" are evil and should be repealed",u/vocl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b0mfrm/cmv_laws_against_socalled_marital_rape_are_evil/,changemyview,"People often look at you like you have 3 heads if you question ""marital rape"" laws, and states which were slow to enact them get made fun of as ""backwards."" 

But these laws are *extremely* modern inventions, pushed by radical anti-family feminists in the 70s and often not enacted till the 80s and 90s. They have no basis whatsoever in tradition and centuries of humanity went by without any reasonable person ever believing it was possible to ""rape"" your wife.

Arguments for the problems with these laws will be below, but first, some may object that I use ""religious reasoning."" I mean, yes, Christianity is the moral system that founded the entire Western world and built the civilizations we all enjoy, so I think it's quite relevant what it has to say. (That and the fact that it happens to be true, of course). 

But if you would have me throw it out, with what should we replace it? How would we do any moral reasoning at all? You may say I have insufficient evidence for Christianity, but there's obviously more evidence for the truth claims of Christianity than for your ""inalienable right to bodily autonomy"" or ""gender equality"" or any of the dogmas of your false school of morality - where's the evidence for any of this stuff? There's less evidence for that than for the flying spaghetti monster, it doesn't exist and I see no reason to believe in it. If you think I'm wrong on this point somehow and you can ""prove"" that ""inalienable bodily autonomy"" or something exists as some sort of immutable ""right,"" maybe you can focus your rebuttals on that point.

_____________________

- Ontological misapplication.

It actually just is not *possible* to ""rape"" somebody who is your wife, any more than it is possible to ""rape"" a dildo, a dog, a male human, or yourself. These do not belong to the category of ""rapeable"" things.

We know that in marriage, the man and woman become one flesh. Further from St. Thomas Aquinas we receive the explanation: ""The man who is just married has, in virtue of the betrothal, a **certain right in her**: wherefore, **although he sins by using violence, he is not guilty of the crime of rape.**"" Therefore a married woman cannot be raped by her husband; this is an ontological impossibility.

Words have meanings and we do violence to them when we forget this. The concept of so-called ""statutory rape"" is another example of this problem; non-violent acts do not suddenly become ""rape"" because a politician passed a law or because of the age on somebody's birth certificate. I suspect this is another case of many so-called ""Conservatives"" not being willing to go far enough back to get to the root of a societal ill, much as many see how feminism of the 1990s was horrible but fail to realize that the evil root goes all the way back to the 1890s, and every idea and outcome it produced was utterly irredeemable and condemnable.

- Encourages destruction of family

Let's suppose ""rape"" of a wife was possible though, or that the ""sin of violence"" that Aquinas speaks of was worthy of being prevented by law. What then? Is criminalization of this act the best way to deal with the issue?

Traditionally we understood that the fundamental building block of society was the **family**. Now, due to the feminist revolution, the world believes that the fundamental building block of society is the **individual**. This is where all these misguided ideas about ""bodily autonomy"" and ""rights"" come from.

Encouraging a woman to try to send her husband to prison is horrific. What of the kids? No matter how badly a husband sins, it does not appear that the woman should have the right to reveal these sins to the public without grave reason, for she is oath-bound to support him always, and the good of her household demands it. At her wedding, a bride irrevocably swears that her life is now as a sacrifice, a sacrifice of service to her husband and to the rearing of her children. She no longer belongs to herself. 

Even if some sort of punishment is necessary for uncharitable actions towards a spouse, jail is a hideous anti-family solution. Deleware had the right idea until fairly recently when it allowed for lashes as a punishment specifically against domestic abusers - the idea being that jail time would disincentivize woman from reporting, rightfully so, because that would be bad for their income and their kids and their household. Then some quacks said that's too ""cruel and unusual,"" whatever that means - locking people in cages and tearing children away from their parents for years is the only way that ""civilized"" peoples punish their criminals, I guess is what they want us to believe?

- Based on a false conception of ""consent.""

One of the biggest lies with the modern ""religion"" on sexual morality is that it holds ""consent"" to be the biggest (only)? moral factor when obviously it is not.

We actually know that the modern dogma on this matter is a complete reversal of the traditional truth. ""Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."" 1 Cor 7:5

Did we all catch that? ""Consent"" is actually required to **withhold** sex from a spouse. You don't actually have any ""right"" to do that. This is something totally fake that moderns came up with without evidence in the past couple decades.

Traditionally we've known that there is a ""marital debt."" Sex is owed to a spouse. You need their consent in order to *abstain*, not in order to do what is normal and owed.

In conclusion, it seems that these ""marital rape"" laws were an anti-family, anti-Christian poison pill that fake ""Conservatives"" knowingly swallowed in the 80s and 90s, and opposition to them is a moral duty.

I believe you have to be highly talented.
 
I am saying once you reach the point to where you draw the attention to be drafted by a team (by being one of the most talented players in the world), I think chance/opportunity play more of a roll in getting continuous contracts. 


Notice I said most. Most players are not the ones you know the name of. Most players do not start. Most players aren’t making $10mil+ a year. I am not talking about the all stars. I’m not talking about 6th man contenders. I’m not talking about someone who regularly gets 15+ minutes. Most players cycled in and out are the 7/8 players who get consistent playing time. 


I think sometimes a player with a certain skill set is in the right place at the right time where he can get a contract to mostly ride the bench most of the year. Whereas an equally talented player is dropped from the team because his talents are not needed on that team at that time. 


For example, Ryan Broekhoff. Doesn’t matter who he is. Dropped after 2 years. Averaged 4 points and 1.8 rebounds. 

Jeremy Evans. 7 contacted years and averaged 3.5 points and 2.6 rebounds.

Neither were especially useful to their teams but do you think there was any reason (talent wise) that Evans lasted over twice as long in the NBA? I think things outside of their control mattered more than their personal performance. 

You could look up many bench warmers. Some guys who played several seasons, never started, averaged under 5 points and or rebounds yet some kept getting signed.

While some others do no worse but get dropped like a sack of rocks.

Why do you think that is?
I think most of the time (main reason) it is team needs, style & direction. Not that one bench warmer is objectively better than another. 

A secondary reason could be that someone is a lazy bum with a bad attitude. But I don’t think the hundreds that are dropped vs those that stay are stark differences in attitudes.

Let me first say unequivocally that managing a household is actual real and necessary work:  school, getting ready, being available, knowing teachers, getting kids to and fro safely, keeping track of social engagements, food prep and planning, purchasing gifts to make a nice holiday, it’s crazy and it takes a ton of effort. 

Mental load seems to arise in the context of a two parent household with children. I’ve seen it used in situations where one parent is the sole earner and one is the stay at home parent. I’ve also seen it used where both parents work and for situations in between. 

For this let’s think in terms of one parent working outside the home and one parent working inside the home. In the case of both working, or some combination thereof, the load absolutely needs to be discussed and figured out. 

As far as I can tell, the assertion is that all of the planning efforts take time and energy and that the “mental load” of running a household is somehow unaccounted for and makes the stay at home parent’s life more difficult than the parent that is working elsewhere. 

The reason I have a problem with it is that it’s discussed not only in terms of being more difficult, but also making the person claiming the load somehow more virtuous. 

Raising a family is difficult. Supporting a family is difficult. When children are young school age it’s a particularly difficult season of life. It just is. 

My secondary issue is that nobody is suggesting that bearing the full weight of a family’s fiscal survival comes with its own mental load, anxiety, stress, etc. a sole breadwinner knows if the income goes away, the family can’t sustain itself.  There is a laundry list of load types for the stay at home. The at work in my mind includes healthcare (US), taxes, benefits, saving for retirement, saving for education, paying all the bills, dealing with insurance of all types, making sure vehicles are paid and maintained, etc. 

These two loads are equally as important insofar as one cannot exist without the other. No money, no life. No household management, no household. 

Now, if both are earning money, the household needs to be meaningfully split. Period. If one person is doing it all then the other is taking advantage. 

But a stay at home parent needs to embrace the job, the load is part of it just as it is part of working for a paycheck. If you’re only home because childcare is too expensive then it is a temporary phase of life. If you’re there by choice, then change your situation. 

TLDR: complaining about the “mental load” of managing a household is childish unless your partner is actively minimizing your contribution.  The “mental load” is dealing with life. Deal with it or split up the load. It’s also extremely victimy and implies both resentment toward your partner and minimizes the other’s contribution.

138,2024-02-26,CMV: I am not convinced that a one-state solution is the best solution for the Israel-Palestine situation,u/_Richter_Belmont_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b0tbbq/cmv_i_am_not_convinced_that_a_onestate_solution/,changemyview,"Let me make it very clear from the start that I am not trying to have a debate here on the legality/morality of Israel's actions in Gaza right now.

I've been seeing a rise in popularity in the ""one state solution"" to this conflict, particularly among progressives and especially among progressive commentators.

The one state solution from what I am understanding would mean:

\- (In theory) Free and democratic elections

\- Equal rights for all, regardless of ethnicity, religion, or any other identifying characteristic

Whether it's called ""Israel"" or ""Palestine"" or something else doesn't really matter.

I don't really have an issue with this premise. It will solve the issues around territorial disputes and settlements, two issues that have been sticking points in two-state negotiations for a long time. It also resolves the Palestinian right to return issue, which is another major hurdle in negotiations. Both parties will also have free access to important religious sites.

I think practically this won't work though, and here's why I think that (let's assume both parties' representatives agree to the one state):

\- Both Israelis and Palestinians have been scarred by this conflict and I don't see a world where Israelis in particular feel safe/OK sharing a country with people they perceive to be hostile to them

\- I am almost 100% certain in this new state there will be systemic racism towards Arabs/Muslims

\- I'm pretty confident that, while Hamas/other militant groups will lose a lot of support with the advent of freedom/democracy for all, separatist groups will still persist and commit acts of terrorism (like we saw with Spain and Ireland)

\- I fear the implications of acts of terrorism persisting in this single nation. With the case of the Basque in Spain, for example, while democracy and autonomy really plummeted support for the ETA (the Basque separatist/terrorist group), attacks persisted by a faction who were dead set on having the Basque Country be an independent sovereign state, or ""free from Spain"". While Spain, after the death of Franco, ceased collectively punishing the Basque for their terrorism I am not confident that this single state (which, let's be honest, is likely going to see Jews hold the majority of the power in government) is going to take kindly with the likely scenario that acts of terrorism will persist by separatist groups

Since the whole ""one state solution"" seems to be quite popular with progressives, and since I agree with the premise, I'd love to be convinced that this is a favorable solution to the two-state, but I personally just don't see it as a practical/realistic solution."

Neither is anyone worse for relegating an ex into a quarantined compartment of their life that is never touched or revisited. Certainly not if abuse, violence, or other genuinely nonconsensual harmful actions transpired in the context of the relationship. I am not referring to those exceptional instances, for which my mind needs no changing.

However, by consensually sharing a life together founded on a genuine concern and mutual appreciation of the other, the people in a relationship are irreversibly altered in a fundamental way. When a relationship, then, ceases—for whatever reason that doesn’t include exceptional scenarios as in the preceding paragraph—in its romantic form, the personal alteration remains and to treat the ex like a complete stranger unworthy of any regard is actually a symptom of a malaise and something awful.

I’m thinking specifically of people who have children together and then separate never to speak again, and people who have been in relationships for awhile that after separation cannot speak to the other."

This episode features a bar in Santa Clarita, CA called ""The Tailgate.""

A brother and sister own the bar where they hired a bunch of family members who were not fit to be in their positions. 

The brother wants to take out the trash and fire the incompetent employees, whereas the sister wants to keep giving them chance after chance.

One of the people who they want to fire is the cook, Robert.

During Jon Taffer's stress test, the deep fryer experiences a grease fire. Jon Taffer keeps saying how the fire was Robert's fault. 

Then the culinary expert that was on the rescue with Jon Taffer, Brendan Collins, pretty much tells them to fire him. He's only been there two days and they just fire him because the douchebag wannabe Gordon Ramsay said so.

A lot of stuff was wrong with the way he was fired:

* I'd be pretty pissed if someone who had only been at the bar for 2 days comes in, tells the owners to fire me and they fire me.
* Jon Taffer, when talking to the sister, kept saying ""This is what Robert did to you"" as if he deliberately committed arson.
* When the sister went to go fire Robert, she was saying ""forget about working here and fucking up my business."" When in reality, he's not the one who ""fucked up the business."" She is. HE was just the scapegoat. The owners decided to wait until Jon arrived to bibbidi-bobbidi-boo their bar to then say that Robert was the problem and needed to go, and used a grease fire (out of his control) as a perfect excuse to do so.
* Whether or not the grease fire was Robert's fault, if his skills were really lackluster, he should never have gotten hired to begin with."

2,2024-02-26,"CMV: the view among some Palestine supporters, that the descendants of ""recent"" immigrants to Israel should be deported, is the moral equivalent of ethnic cleansing",u/bennetthaselton,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b0xn48/cmv_the_view_among_some_palestine_supporters_that/,changemyview,"I have seen this view expressed in some pro-Palestine group chats e.g. ""settlers should go back to the countries they are originally from"" (by which I assume they overwhelmingly mean Jewish immigrants since the late 1800s).

My position is that this is the moral equivalent of ethnic cleansing.

Now, whether or not it is ""technically"" ethnic cleaning is unclear -- I couldn't find any definition of ethnic cleansing which included removal of a population based on ancestral national origin (Wikipedia for example only lists ""ethnic, racial, or religious groups""). The Wikipedia definition also says that ""ethnic cleansing"" means actions done with the aim of making the remaining region ""ethnically homogeneous"", and that's not what people in this case are advocating for (e.g. they don't think Jews should be deported who have lived there continuously for thousands of years, so the remaining population would at least consist of Jews and Arabs).  However, I contend that what they are advocating is *morally* equivalent, since:

* you are still singling out a group of people born in that region and punishing them for an attribute (national origin of their recent ancestors) that they have no control over;
* if you're kicking out one group, morally I think it doesn't make any difference whether the remaining population consists of one group (""ethnically homogenous"") or two or more groups.

And whether something is ""technically"" ethnic cleansing only matters if you're prosecuting it, and currently there's no chance of this deportation action ever happening, much less that it will then be prosecuted. What matters is that it's morally equivalent to ethnic cleansing, if you're arguing that the people advocating for it are morally in the wrong and are discrediting the movement.

Now, I don't think they're doing it from a place of hate; their stated justification is ""If you stole something, you have to give it back"" (direct quote). The problem is that there's a big difference between applying the standard to an individual and applying the standard to their descendants who didn't do anything wrong. If people were unjustly displaced at the time, and if they have descendants who are still worse off as a direct result, then that's an argument for reparations to be paid for them, not an argument for descendants of settlers to be kicked out of the country.

So, I claim that people advocating for this are advocating for the moral equivalent of ethnic cleansing, and it's wrong.  CMV."

Under no circumstances is it OK for someone born male to breastfeed a baby. There have been an increasing number of cases where people who were born male have started lactating and giving that discharge to an infant. The formulation of this discharge is not breatmilk and poses an actual real risk to the babies health. 

I believe that if a male puts any part of body into a baby (nipple or otherwise) a charge of pedophilia should follow. 

Although an article from the NHS stated that ""the milk is just as good or better than mother's milk"" it was a single case of a man with a disorder that caused him to lactate, additionally the claim that it was better was due to the fact it had a higher fat content which isn't indicative of ""better milk""."

The radical left hates him, and they try and charge him with rape, with most of them coming right before the 2016 debates, around the time when it was obvious Trump was rolling quickly and there wasn't much to stop him with. My opinion is that the elite left wants something and it involves making the USA extremely weak, helping the elite left in the process. They've called Trump racist and sexist, when there's literally no video evidence of such things whatsoever.

After reading different books on the matter, I can confidently say that there is a lot more going on in the body than just being fobbed off by doctors who constantly say ‘anxiety’. Yes, anxiety can be a symptom of the physical cause, but majority of the time there’s something not quite right that is going on in your body. Things can get overlooked and most conventional doctors aren’t trained in spotting certain root causes. That’s why they give you tablets and say be on your way.

People don’t realise how things like Mold (which is common in many houses across the world) can contribute to the forming of anxiety and depression. Again, doctors don’t normally recognise this when you present your symptoms to them and generally don’t offer a test than can see if you’ve been exposed to the harsh toxins of Mold.

Heavy metals is another one, it’s often in the foods we eat. Rice, certain fish all contain heavy metals. Over time, these can have a detrimental effect on one’s mental health without realising why they are feeling this way. Once again, tell me a doctor that has ever looked down this route?

Bacterial overgrowth in the gut can wreck havoc on the system. Unfortunately, many doctors don’t see this as a legitimate thing. I can tell you now it is, personal experience.

Some of you may not know about it, and that’s okay. It’s being discussed on various social media platforms. 

Instead of people acknowledging that firstly what Bushnell has done isn’t depicting Martyrdom, people are glorifying the act of self immolation because “this is the way protesting should go” or “this is how we make an impact in protests / get Israel to stop the conflict”, is ridiculously stupid. 

You have to be mentally ill to commit suicide regarding a cause that actually doesn’t really affect you at all, and people are glorifying that. And the people who think it was totally ok and are happy Bushnell committed this act is what is wrong with both stances in the whole ongoing war. 

I acknowledge that Israel are committing war crimes and is committing Genocide against the innocent civilians in Gaza, but you are just as bad as those advocating for death to the Palestinian people if you believe you should use someone else’s mental illness to prove a point. 

Bushnell isn’t a martyr, he was someone who was brainwashed into believing this was his cause to fight and clearly had mental health issues. 

Having the stance that Palestinians ‘deserve’ what’s happening to them **is wrong**, BUT believing that it’s ok to use Bushnell’s self immolation to prove a point that it “helps the cause of Palestinians” is equally fucked up.

Those people deserve to shoulder their share of the blame. 

One thing is that the world is not always a safe place, it would be nice if we could walk around somewhere we are allowed to be and not have to worry about something happening, but that's unfortunately not the case everywhere. And there are a lot of places that are known to be dangerous that should be avoided. For example in a number of countries there is a prejudice to foreigners and there are places that will do harm to tourists if they are caught alone. Some of these places are well documented and good hearted locals will warn travelers not to go to those places. However, is someone chooses to ignore those warnings and go to those places and something bad happens to those people then they share a portion of the blame for knowingly going somewhere dangerous.

Another thing is stupidity and the lack of awareness when doing something dangerous. If someone decides drive and not follow the rules of the road they are putting themselves and others in danger. If these people decide to run a red light and get T-boned resulting in significant injury or death then the reckless driver, despite being the victim, shoulders most, if not all of the blame for what happened to them. 

As well as mishandling weapons, and tools especially without proper training. If someone is using a table saw and while cutting a board decided to use their bare hand  intead of a proper guiding tool and it results in the person losing a finger or worse it is entirely their fault. Same goes to someone kid who gets their hand on a butterfly knife and decides to try and do tricks with it and ends up stabbing themselves. The share the responsibility with whomever made it possible for the child to get their hands on the weapon.

These people in the hypotheticals are all victims but they are bare some or all of the responsibility for their situations and it is not a bad thing to acknowledge that. There is a time and place to mention it so doing so should be kept within the parameters.

A victim is A person who is harmed, injured, killed as a result of a crime, accident, or other event or action."

Abrahamic faiths posit that our place is within a cosmic kingdom, all answerable to the big boss, who we should appease and stay on side so that we can be rewarded for our servitude.

Hinduism and it's descended philosophies of Buddhism, Sikhi, Jain etc instead position each individual in the role of the God head, the atman of which rahman the ground of reality is constructed.

There is no cosmic hierarchy because everything that exists is one and the same within that existence. Sure there are interpretations of the mythology which invoke a hierarchy but that is personal choice.

However on the most basic level what matters is not pleasing god in hope of future reward but in pleasing one another, living a good life right now for the reward which can only happen in the moment.

I'd like to know if there are structures which may have even healthier ways of looking at life and our role in the universe, because I think that Hinduism covers it all pretty well.

2,2024-02-27,CMV: stunting goldfish is not intrinsically bad,u/Nofantasydotcom,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b182oj/cmv_stunting_goldfish_is_not_intrinsically_bad/,changemyview,"**INTRODUCTION**: If you hang out in fishkeeping and aquarium communities, you will come across the claim that goldfish are the most mistreated pets as they're commonly kept in way too small containers (bowls or little tanks), when they should actually be kept in ponds or at least huge aquariums (70+gallons), mainly for two reasons: the first reason is that they pollute a whole lot, meaning a big water volume can help prevent stagnation of ammonia. The other reason is that a well-cared for goldfish can grow to more than a foot in length. Both are very good reasons. On the other hand, you have people who kept their goldfish in small (5-10gallon) tanks for many years, and there are instances of such fish surviving for 40+ years. These fish are not a foot long, their growth was arrested by lack of space, a phenomenon that's called *stunting*.

&#x200B;

**CLAIM**: It's widely held as true, in the fishkeeping community, that allowing your fish to become stunted is bad for a series of reasons. These are the arguments I came across doing my research:

1)The stunted fish's spine stops growing but the organs don't, leading to compressed organs which make the fish suffer and get sick more

2)stunting fish is bad because of the other implications of keeping them in a small tank, such as the water getting dirty with poisonous ammonia more easily

3)goldfish are curious and will get bored if they don't have enough room to explore

4)if you do continuous water changes to prevent point.2, then they will not stunt as the stunting hormone just gets changed out, meaning they will outgrow the tank.

5)goldfish did not evolve in puddles, so a tank that small is unnatural for them

&#x200B;

**MY VIEW**: I am not persuaded that any of the points in the claim are true. First of all, the fact that goldfish can grow to over a foot in size is no doubt true, but it's also true that goldfish, just like lots of other freshwater fish, will arrest their growth when they're in a scarce environment, which is also known to occur in the wild as an evolutionary adaptation to a wide range of living conditions. I don't get what's so bad about a process that's evolutionarily selected.

Now to the aforementioned points:

\>The stunted fish's spine stops growing but the organs don't, leading to compressed organs which make the fish suffer and get sick more

I haven't found a single piece of evidence that this is true. I have, however, found evidence that the mechanism that stunts fish arrests the development of all cell lines, not just the spine, so this claim is unsubstantiated. I'd also like to point out that several ornamental varieties of goldfish that have been selected to look chunky, such as [oranda](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Orange_Oranda.jpg), [ranchu](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JC_4HC_R8Rc/maxresdefault.jpg) and [pearlscale](https://www.exoticfarm.shop/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/71Sfe6Z9bfL.jpg), do have compressed organs, leading to a series of complications such as swimbladder disease and gut blockages, but next to no one seems to believe it's a big problem that these varieties exist.

\>stunting fish is bad because of the other implications of keeping them in a small tank, such as the water getting dirty with ammonia more easily

This can be easily fixed by doing large and frequent water changes. Say, changing 80% of the water every two days. Unless the tank is really small, like a fishbowl, this should be more than enough to contain the concentration of ammonia and other pollutants. While it is true that goldfish excrete ammonia through their gills, most of the ammonia that they produce comes from the decomposition of their solid waste. That can be siphoned out easily. It's also possible to attach a small filter to the tank that will host nitrifying bacteria.

\>goldfish are curious and will get bored if they don't have enough room to explore

Regardless of tank size, goldfish spend their entire time either sifting through the sand or looking for food near the surface. These two activities do not require ample spaces. I'd say a 10 gallon tank is enough. Also, even in a 70gal, or even a small pond, eventually the fish is going to run out of room to explore anyways, it'll just take a couple more days.

\>if you do continuous water changes to prevent point.2, then they will not stunt as the stunting hormone just gets changed out, meaning they will outgrow the tank.

This is simply not true. Growth arresting hormone in fish is called somatostatin and it's endocrine, it is not released into the water, meaning frequent water changes do not affect its concentration. What does affect its concentration is swimming space and food availability. Therefore, it's perfectly possible to keep a goldfish in, say, a 10gal with pristine water parameters and it still become stunted.

\>goldfish did not evolve in puddles, so a tank that small is unnatural for them

The way goldfish evolved in the wild is radically different from any fishtank. For example they evolved the ability to survive total lack of oxygen for a short period of time, resorting to anaerobic respiration, which they can do better than any other vertebrate because they can dispose of lactate (the metabolic waste of anaerobic respiration) particularly well. This ability allows them to survive stagnant water, water that freezes over throughout the winter, and a plethora of other conditions that they can handle just fine. Plus the fact that they evolved the ability to get stunted, it suggests that goldfish actually did evolve to withstand various different sizes of habitats. Keeping a goldfish in a 10gal with pristine water, stable temperatures and plenty of oxygen is nowhere near the extreme of what goldfish can and do withstand in the wild.

&#x200B;

**FINAL THOUGHTS**: I do not advocate for keeping goldfish in bowls or tanks that are any smaller than 10 gallons. Even I believe that is too small and bordering animal abuse. But, let's say, your kid won a goldfish at a fair and all you can get him is a 10gal tank: as long as you do frequent water changes to keep the ammonia down, put some sand at the bottom for it to sift through and keep that sand clean, and perhaps put a plant or two, I don't see why that should be bad. And yes, the fish will probably become stunted. I don't see why that's bad. It just means it won't grow to full size. You'll just have a bonsai goldfish.

&#x200B;

**WHAT WILL CHANGE MY VIEW**: I will gladly change my mind if provided solid evidence that I'm wrong, especially but not exclusively in the form of scientific research. Experience and anecdote is also fine as long as it comes from a reasonable source, such as a freshwater fish biologist.

1,2024-02-27,CMV: Allowing Artists control iterations on their creations / imitations should be seen as a pragmatic compromise and a necessary evil rather than some sacred right,u/ALTAIROFCYPRUS,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b19gq4/cmv_allowing_artists_control_iterations_on_their/,changemyview,"This is mostly because I see people belittling games/art pieces/ products as rip-offs when they contain an arbitrary amount of similarities with a contemporary product. I believe that firstly, all art is derivative of previous art. An artist does not emerge from the womb already having fulfilled their potential in whatever fields they desire. They learn, by practicing, by observing, and most importantly, copying. Nothing is new under the sun.

For an example where I am in the clear minority is the game Deviator, which is wildly held to be a blatant copycat of the game Hollow Knight. I've seen certain content creators even go so far as to say Gami Studios (the developers of Deviator) owe an apology to Team Cherry(The developers of hollow knight.) because they are similar. I would argue if that's the case, Team Cherry owes several apologies to several studios from FromSoft to Pixar. The only difference is that one is copying and combining from several sources, while the other is copying and changing some elements from one source. 

I chose this case since the plagiarism is not really debatable and quite egregious, and my objection to the discourse that surrounds this game is not to its quality (which I am unimpressed as well) but the idea that there is a moral sin being committed because a style of production is being mimicked, which to me is an arbitrary decision and poses a threat to the very medium as it stigmatizes the creation of an experience inline with the vision of its creator  because someone else did something similar."

I'm open to changing my perspective if presented with strategies to maintain or increase birth rates without relying on patriarchal systems.

1,2024-02-27,CMV: “Life begins at conception” is just as arbitrary as any other criteria for personhood,u/Mr_Botticus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b1b5sl/cmv_life_begins_at_conception_is_just_as/,changemyview,"Edit: the title is meant to imply personhood begins at conception, I agree that human life doesn’t necessarily imply personhood but that’s the line I typically hear

Most of the time when I hear conservatives argue against abortion the argument is typically that every other criteria selected for personhood other than conception is arbitrary. I don’t understand how conception is any less arbitrary of a criteria. I’ve heard the argument that it’s because an embryo will “naturally” (whatever that’s supposed to mean) develop into a human over the course of time without you doing anything, but that seems just as arbitrary a decision to make AND has flaws. I could then say using a condom is murder, as it prevents the “natural” course of action of the sperm merging with an egg to form a human.   
Another argument that I hear a lot is that criteria like brain activity can be applied to already alive people (like people in a coma who will theoretically wake up in 9 months) to justify killing them. I feel like I have the answer to this but would like input. I think value (whatever you define that to be) should have a recursive definition: you have value if you have value in 2 out of the 3 time frames: past, present, and future. This seems to correspond to real life situations in which we have to determine a human’s status as a person. I’ll give examples of some of the permutations of this:  
  
Past and Future:
This is the coma example. Assuming we define value to be brain activity (which I don’t necessarily believe), someone in a coma will have had value in the past and will have value in the future. They therefore are considered a person and you cannot kill them.   
  
Past and Present:
Let’s say we knew someone was gonna die in 10 years for sure. It shouldn’t be legal to kill them just because they wont have value in the future.  
  
Present and future:
This would be the case of abortion.  
  
Just the past:
Someone who is brain dead does not have value in the present nor in the future and as such can viably be taken off life support.  
  
Just the future:
You could say a sperm has potential for value, but of course killing it would not be considered murder.  

Do these criteria address the “potential” argument completely?  
As for my opinions on what actually determines value, I don’t actually know. I think any criteria must inherently be arbitrary because of the way language and definitions work. But, I think we can define places along a spectrum of value for which a human is FOR SURE of value and FOR SURE NOT of value. For example, I couldn’t tell you a concrete definition of a chair. BUT, I could confidently say the sky is not a chair, a 4 legged platform with a back is definitely a chair, and a beanbag might be a chair?  
  
Applying this to abortion, I can pretty confidently say (personally) that a sperm or blastocyst does NOT have value IN THE PRESENT. I can also pretty confidently say that an 18 year old human does have value in the present. I make that distinction based on a sum of factors such as conscious experience and effect on other people’s lives, things that to me seem self evident as non-arbitrary. I can therefore define some range in between these 2 extremes of which personhood is murky. I would say that range is from around 8 weeks (start of neural activity) to birth. Therefore I could confidently say that a fetus up to 8 weeks would only meet 1 of the 3 criteria for personhood. I can't really imagine an argument for lets say a 10 day old embryo's value IN THE PRESENT and not based just on its future value, which would also apply to sperm or eggs.

Now obviously I realized that's not the case as I've been humbled through many rejections

And then after high school I've practiced introspection as to why do I want a relationship in the first place.

 Is it because I genuinely wanted one? 

Or because of subconscious societal influence?

Over time I realized that what I'm really looking for is self solitude, personal autonomy, emotional intimacy, and sexual satisfaction

And you don't necessarily need a romantic committed relationship for those things to occur

As an only child, I love being alone. It's the greatest thing for me

But I admittedly do want social interaction, intellectual stimulation, emotional bonding, and sex, and that's where my friends come in

Not all of my friends can fulfill all of these roles of course. And I don't expect any of them to. But I feel all my connections to my friends equally (or as equally as possible) is the some of the best love I can ever have. 

Instead of prioritizing one person over others because of some relationship hierarchy

I'm just going to say it. There's no way you don't know you're not straight. When you hit puberty you start feeling sexual attraction. You know right then and there what you're attracted to. Sorry if you live in a bigoted community, I wish bigots would vanish, but that doesn't give you the right to waste years of someone's time that they can't get back. Especially with kids involve. You're a dad who did nothing wrong and suddenly your wife says she's been lying to you for years. For you to leave the house. Now suddenly you see your kids only 4 days a month instead of every day. In what world is that fair? 

Now this is towards western culture. A lot of Asian cultures parents have far more control. but if you live in the US, there's no arranged marriages, no one can force you to get married. When you hit 18 you can bail for green pastures. There is literally no excuse"

Prisons in southern states, especially Texas, are notorious for just how inhumane they can be. Much of the farm labor in the south that isn't done by seasonal workers from Mexico is done by enslaved prisoners. They use a loophole to avoid calling this slavery. Prisoners are simply charged more money in prison fees than they're allowed to make in a day. It keeps them in permanent debt, so in the eyes of the law they're more like indentured servants. Because of the lack of regulation in the private prison system, many prisoners aren't guaranteed food that isn't rotten, water that isn't contaminated, cells that are above hypothermia inducing temperatures,  or anything else that are basic requirements for survival. Supporting the American prison system is saying that it's alright for a teenager to be locked in a cell and r*ped for smoking a joint. Its really as simple as that. Any crime you can be imprisoned over is a crime you can be r*ped and enslaved over. This is America."

Many of you are sick of “bad” protesting. That might mean disrupting the Macy's Day Parade, or blocking traffic…. Or yes… burning yourself alive.

You know… this isn't a bad idea. I'm also pro-Israel. It's just that a pragmatic movement has manifested, and I can't deny I feel a little okay by it. It can really only do good, as it might put a focus on a ceasefire and *some* resolution.

As for your children… Its one thing to leave behind loved ones - that hurts them and leaves them less than they were with you in their life.
   
Its another to leave behind children. You have a responsibility to your children to take care of them and provide them love and a knowledge of how to make it in the world.
   
There are ways you can improve the world without abandoning the most vulnerable kind of person possible that needs you - you directly.

&#x200B;

So Wendy's just announced this idea. I'm not arguing the merits of the idea, just the comparison to Uber. As I understand it, the Uber argument is that there is a limited resource (drivers) and so increasing pricing during peak use hours encourages the best economic use of the resource.

But I don't see that being analogous to a restaurant. Unlike Uber (DoorDash, Lyft...) where the supply is controlled by an outside party (the contractors willing to drive at a particular time), the resources available to the restaurant are internally controlled. That is, if it seems that there is insufficient bacon/patty/lettuce/whatever then the owner can simply buy more, like they've done for decades.

So help me see how ""surge pricing"" from a restaurant is comparable to DoorDash, etc. Thanks!"

She seems to have very impossible standards for relationships (think of that awful quote that goes ""if you can't handle me at my worst you don't deserve me at my best"" type of thing), and is struggling to find and keep relationships. I tried pointing out some of her unrealistic expectations and she wasn't having it.

That got me thinking about the phrase ""unconditional love"" and that I really think all love is conditional. I think a lot of people would be happier and less frustrated if they accepted this as a fact. 

Additional context: I'm happily married and have a child. I love them dearly and they love me. However in my wildest, darkest imagination, I'm sure there are horrible acts and situations that could cause them to stop loving me and vice versa. I plan to never get into one of those situations but I think everyone has their limits. In fact, I think I act like a better partner when I acknowledge that my actions could negatively affect my partner to the point that they may no longer want to be with me (again, not planning to ever get to that point). 

I also think pushing for unconditional love can lead to pushing for unhealthy relationship dynamics. Like a person is allowed to make mistakes and not be  perfect, but they also have to take responsibility and make real changes to their behavior, if it's a serious and/or ongoing issue.

I believe this is because of the simple fact of how incredibly devastating such a war would be. In a WW3 scenario, both sides would know this. Therefore I see no reason why either of them would risk starting a massive nuclear war.

Similar situations have also been seen in history. As an example, during WW2, both sides had chemical weapons, however they never saw widespread use by either side due to the fear of retribution and the knowlege of how terrible they were. Chemical weapons are so much less devastating than nuclear weapons, that I think the same principle would apply in a hypothetical major conflict between great powers such as China, America/NATO, or Russia.

In the mid 1960s, the US had an absolute crime surge, in the 1960s, crime was relatively low (around 5.5), but ever since 1965, it has doubled and it was that high until the 1990s. Then incarceration rates started to rise, and crime started to go down.

* More recently, we saw a huge surge of crime in major cities, which heavily correlates with criminals not being prosecuted and being released early from prison.
* Defund the police completely backfired, when cities proposed a cut in budgets, crime surged, and cities were forced to increase the budget several times.

Singapore has caning for violent crimes, which is one of the reasons why they are incredibly safe. This is basic psychology, if you don't face punishment of any kind, you will continue to perpetuate that kind of behavior. And if there is punishment, people will think twice before doing it.

El Salvador, the most recent example, was one of the most dangerous countries in the world. But since Nayib Bukele took office, they absolutely incarcerated all the gangs, and it's now safer than the US. Just for the record, I'm not saying Bukele is perfect, his administration has been accused of rampant corruption, as did previous administrations, but he managed to decrease crime to a very low level. Corruption, while is a crime in of itself, is infinitely better than rampant violent crime. 

Common Counterpoints:

1. But what about Scandinavia? They are incomparable, they never had a crime problem to begin with. If they didn't commit any crimes, the incarceration rate will remain low as well. Historically, it's either these cases,
   1. Incarceration rate high, and crime rate low.
   2. Incarceration low and crime rate low.
   3. There has NEVER been a case where an increased incarceration has increased crime.
2. Violation of Human Rights For Prisoners: This I found a bit hypocritical, because *Criminals themselves violate human rights*, I don't understand why you don't care nearly about the victims of the crime, as the perpetrators. 
3. What about Freedom? Incarceration *does* increase freedom in practice. It gives people freedom to do more things without the fear of being victimized by others.
4. Poverty Drives Crime!!! No, it doesn't. Since the 1960s, the poverty line remained relatively flat. Crime had several surges too, despite poverty not deviating much. In fact according to actual numbers, there shows no correlation between crime and poverty. This isn't to say that people in poverty don't commit crimes, but it doesn't effect the whole picture. 
5. Social Safety Nets Avoid Crime! They might prevent *some* people from committing crime out of desperation, but we don't know whether someone did it out of desperation or not. And Social Safety Nets and Crime Laws are not mutually exclusive. Singapore has both.

I am not here to have my view changed on my beliefs or support on the Palestinian cause itself, or who is in the right in the war that is happening, or whether or not the conflict can be classified as a genocide. I am here to very specifically talk about how a portion of those that support the cause for Palestinian liberation only cared about the fact that the soldier lit himself on fire for their cause because he was a white man in the military that died for them. Essentially, from what I’ve seen, they only like or show tolerance towards white people as long as they die for their cause. 

I would imagine to be a Black leftist is to see the conditions by which black people and other minorities around the world are almost universally disenfranchised by the majority populations in power and how this imbalance was supported by structural racism that shaped over the course of hundreds of years. In this way, I would assume that any member of the majority population that does not actively go out of their way to oppose the system that benefits them is complicit in this power dynamic. In this case, any white person that doesn’t go out of their way to oppose or disrupt the system that they benefit from is complicit in white supremacy and genocide in Gaza. Couple that with the fact that Black people have been historically oppressed by white people, and it’s no wonder that most Black leftists have disdain for white people.

In any other case, they would not tolerate him because he’s white."

For the longest time, ever since the Trump campaign, I've been so full of anger. It just baffled me. People became so nasty, so full of vitriol. I did too. We went from Obama, a true class act, to a man defined by mean-spiritedness. Regardless of whether you agree with me there, or what you thought about Obama or Trump, I think we can agree that in the last 12 years, or even 20, political discourse even among common citizens has become increasingly polarized and nasty. Obstructionism and factionalism are so rampant that it often feels there is no hope. I've felt that way many times. 

But lately I'm trying to rekindle my faith in humanity, because I genuinely want to again reach a place where I think we can come together. I want to look at people and see my neighbors. First responders, who help us in our most dire need. Welders, who help assemble and maintain the wonderful machines that make our lives better. Coal workers, who for generations have helped put electricity in our homes.

I don't want to hate people just because they voted for the other side, even though I view that other side as espousing policies that are anti-American and dangerous for a lot of people. I met a Republican firefighter on vacation in Cancun a few years ago who made me feel this way. He and I differed on more or less every topic of policy. He hated Hillary, I hated Trump. But we hung out and had a great time together. We drank in the resort pool, had heated political discussions in good faith, and at the end we shook hands and were genuinely glad to have had each other's company. 

In so many ways, those kinds of conversations feel impossible because you can't even turn on the TV without seeing culture wars, genocides, and any number of horrific things. So often it feels we see the other side as monsters. I certainly have. But I don't want to feel that way anymore. 

What will change my mind: Recent evidence of people on both sides cooperating, working together for the greater good. Prominent leaders talking about each other in good faith. People being serious in discussing policy and looking for common sense solutions to the problems we face. "

Sometimes police leave crimes to go on because they fear social backlash (especially when dealing with minorities) or litigations and lawsuits from activists and the so called civil societies like ACLU.

For example, gangs issues can be solved easily if we mass incarcerate males of ""*fighting age*"" usually which is 15-50. We must be comfortable detaining people for long periods of time without trial. (France is doing it when it comes to terrorism, 5 years without trial, Rwanda did it to genocide suspects). And lastly judges should be told to toe the line when it comes to doing that. Do that for a few years and crime drops to zero (Ecuador is a prime example).

Although this is an authoritarian governments traits, it comes with it's benefits. In Russia, you can't piss, shit and smoke crack on trains/metro like in the US. In China you can't beat the police or bully elected leaders like in the UK.  In Russia, they don't have no go zones like much of Europe. Immigrants are generally well behaved and integrated.

My main point is, much of the laws in the West right now were made when they were very much homogenous and they had no issues following them. Now times have changed and most people relish at the huge amount of ""*loopholes*"" (UK Modern anti-slavery law) they can exploit and it is either the West changes or perish.

Countries like France and Sweden have started aligning themselves by responding by changing their laws. France allows speedy deportation of aliens who stir hatred, usually within 12 hours of being arrested. 

Sweden is changing its laws to increase longer wait times for citizenship and a very high degree of integration. From the current 4-5 years to possible 15 years. CMV"

I even brewed myself for a short while. My brother, who is a bit of a smart alek and has the humor to prove it, dropped off some beer the other day. Chocolate Orange IPA? Vanilla Eucalyptus Stout? Triple Hopps and Double IPA? WTH. (my brother giggled the whole time I was pulling the beers our of the bag - like I said - smart alek).

It used to be that most (not all) craft breweries were mostly deepening the flavor of beer or more ""perfecting"" (???? - for lack of a better word) beer but were still very drinkable. It was still beer but beer with more interest than the same old, same old we got from the big breweries.    
For me that is what beer is.    
Beer is sitting around the fire in the back yard having a pleasant chat with some friends. It seems now so many craft brews have gone to a ""are you man enough to finish this bottle"" or a ""pucker your butt"" brewing model. Years ago, I actually liked IPA's. With the exception of a few still around from those days, most of them now are so bitter they make your teeth hurt.    
It is like brewers are now on a quest for who can make the weirdest beer with the weirdest flavors but have forgotten what beer really is."
1,2024-02-27,CMV: Parenthood is fundamentally unethical,u/Tyler_The_Peach,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b1ox6d/cmv_parenthood_is_fundamentally_unethical/,changemyview,"I am not talking about reproduction as such. Whether it is morally acceptable to bring a human being into existence is a question I take no firm position on. The focus of my opinion is about what happens after you have a child. The relationship between parents and child which most societies allow is morally indefensible, as long as we agree that a child, even an infant, is a full human being who is entitled to fundamental human rights.

My reasoning is along three main issues:

1. It is unfair to allow parents to choose a child’s name, indoctrinate it into their religion, program it with their values, and direct it to the particular education they see fit. In no other situation do we allow any human this much arbitrary control over another human’s development. 

2. It is unsafe to allow parents private, unrestricted, unsupervised access to their children simply because we assume parents would never intentionally hurt their own children. Children are far more likely to be abused by their own family than by strangers.

3. Proper parenting is a mixture of education, caregiving, and therapy. To do it properly you need an advanced knowledge of developmental psychology, rudimentary pediatrics, and child pedagogy. The overwhelming majority of parents (try to) do it with no training whatsoever, thus harming their children and limiting their growth and development even with the best intentions, because they will never do the job anywhere near as good as a professional would.



I have not committed myself to providing an alternative system of child-rearing, and see no reason to. Alternatives do exist, both in traditional cultures and in the radical scholarship of today, but describing them is not necessary to prove my point:




TL;DR: The level of control we allow parents over their children is degrading, dangerous, and detrimental to the children, and we already understand it to be unacceptable in comparable situations. "
1,2024-02-27,CMV: Bathrooms and other changing spaces should be desegregated in America,u/ChamplainFarther,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b1p3xq/cmv_bathrooms_and_other_changing_spaces_should_be/,changemyview,"Now that Draconian laws claimed the life of a sixteen year old child, I would like to assert that we should fully desegregate changing spaces entirely. This is not even about trans people, it goes further... much further, and would have massively outweighed societal benefit.

Okay so point one: I am a woman. As other women may know, our bathrooms are busy, overcrowded, and often you have to wait (if you're at any major event) ages just to piss. This is a negative. In an ideal society I would be able to walk into a bathroom, get a stall immediately and piss in peace. This is the ideal society. Now imagine if we were to spread that demand across both the men's and women's rooms, now desegregated, and people could freely choose whether to go to one or the other, there y equalising wait times and spreading it out over a larger amount of stalls. Would it eliminate waiting? No. But it would work to heavily reduce the issue.

Point two: this is a uniquely American issue. Other countries, like France, have desegregated locker and changing rooms and bathrooms and have for years. While critics will say that crime in bathrooms have increased due to immigration, they always point towards racial and ethnic minorities such as Arab and black individuals, and have failed to show a causal link between desegregation and crime. In fact, studies on inclusive bathroom policy has found ***no*** causal link here in America, therefore the increase, if it is a statistically significant increase at all, is not caused by desegregation of the spaces.

Point three: the Harm Principle. In discussing laws and regulations, it is important we acknowledge the reason for such laws. Laws that desegregate bathrooms and changing spaces have shown not to actually have any utility in reducing harm/crime and in fact have a *negative* utility in that it increases waits and crowding. The Harm Principle is an idea posited by Mill that is a foundational principle in liberalism which essentially states that your freedom to swing your fist ends at another's face *and no sooner.* Essentially, we should only have laws that *reduce* harm and no further."

Knowing that good intentions are spoiled by ignorance I enrolled in several courses this semester to gain a more solid understanding and, most importantly, learn some proper, effective methodology.

To say I am not impressed with what I found would be kind. I expected to be able to discuss and expand on my knowledge, but my professors at times seem to be unable to comprehend the ideas I bring up, as if they have never seriously looked into urbanism at all, or basic physics, or chemistry or any other field that would appear closely linked to sustainability. Red flag.

The most disappointing seminar of all was on Corporate Social Responsibility. I have grown increasingly sceptical of the entire idea, but the following story settled it: We were given a list of CSR measures from a big company, none of which was substantial but rather the kind of measure that sounds impressive if you do not understand the subject matter, i.e. marketing stunts. Many were singular acts of philanthropy or part of normal business operations, such as opening new locations. The company is doing what it would be doing anyways, but now they are adding a press release about CSR. These are now taught as proper examples for CSR at universities, without context or critical examination.

After class, I very politely pointed out I remained unconvinced: None of these would make a substantial difference. Changes would have to be more fundamental than a scholarship here or there. My professor did NOT take that well. They responded like an angry redditor: ""So you are saying that...""

Sigh.

I went home to do some research, because maybe I am clueless and EvilCorp are really doing their best. Instead I found that the **UN special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights** of all people wrote an open letter to EvilCorp, Evil Inc and EvilBros about their business practices, which are decidedly not socially responsible. At all. [Read them here.](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/amazon-doordash-and-walmart-are-trapping-workers-poverty-un-poverty-expert) I found this within seconds.

Corporations seem to love CSR for the free marketing and the distraction it provides while the people in academia who research this stuff seem not very interested in what companies are actually doing. I find it highly unlikely that a published(!) researcher would not have known what EvilCorp has been up to.

Hence my conclusion: CSR is a scam. It also represents lobbyism and greenwashing seeping into universities."

Looking at streaming services, like Netflix, too many movies, yet very few of them I have desire to own. Looking at video rental stores, so many movies, yet also very few of them I have a drive to own.

Every year movies have been produced and then distributed into movie theaters, television, home video, and streaming. However, this also causes movies to sit in studios' film stockrooms and collect dust or be neglected. Sure, there have been digital restorations and masterings. Nonetheless, I see many film studios would rather produce more newer projects than remaster older products, especially to stay relevant to the film industry and to attract general, newer or younger viewers.

Even ""new"" films would become part of back catalogue and, if forgotten or neglected, harder to attract newer generations. Unless re-marketed and re-released, older films would become the same way ""newer"" films would become: less appealing (especially to general or newer viewers throughout generations), less memorable, and less considered (especially for film preservation and archiving).

Every film production company must reconsider how many films to project and produce. As I'm trying to say, there should be less and less new movies, especially direct-to-streaming ones. That way, film companies should concentrate more on remastering older films, including ones new viewers are not aware of. Also, less and less ""filler movies"" that would clog up back catalogs; same can be said about ""safe"" movies and other movies primarily designed to make money at their initial theatrical runs (and initial home video and streaming runs).

I appreciate concerns about possible impact on creativity, but I worry about putting creativity... and diversification (of movies) above archiving and preservation. Money and profit are subjective at best, yet such terms have been used especially to refer to newer movies."

My therapist said I actually don't have to do that; I can and perhaps should message the woman for the sake of messaging, and just wanting to get to know her more is already enough reason to message her.

My main reason for my previous point of view: the most common advice people will give about crushes is to just talk with them directly. In a similar vein, it's always better to ask them out directly and communicate your feelings rather than trying to circumvent it by telling other people. One word comes to mind: efficency. My previous method of pursuing relationships in high school was by telling a bunch of my peers and using them as a vehicle to communicate my feelings for me, along with trying to manifest a relationship in my head. This often ended badly since it usually ended in a whole drama involving a million people that was not fun for anyone. That was not an efficient method of communicating my intentions since the transfer of information was not direct at all. Therefore, the better alternative would be to communicate my feelings more efficiently. How? By asking them out directly, cutting out all the extra buffonery, and communicating my intentions as fast and efficiently as possible.

Suppose you want to build a highway between two cities. What do you do? Do you wind the road up mountain sloped and squiggle it around through valleys? No! That is not an efficient route between the two cities. Instead, you build bridges over the valleys and rivers and blast tunnels through the mountains to keep the highway as straight, flat, and efficient as possible for efficient transportation between both cities.

Plus, imagine you have two types of cards you can play in pursuing a relationship. One card is a text conversation, and the other card is scheduling a date. Although both lead to the core of a relationship, which is ""getting to know each other"" (which I'll call relationship points for the sake of argument), they yield different values of relationship material. The text conversation card is immediate but yields less points, say, only 1 point. On the other hand, scheduling a date takes more time but yields more points, say, 10 points. Which card will I pick? I will pick the ""scheduling a date"" card, since, although it will take more time, it will yield more points in the end. One card just makes stuff, the other card makes stuff that can in turn be used to make even more stuff, therefore yielding more stuff in the end.

My other reason for only messaging when necessary (i.e. scheduling a date) are not wanting to come off as desperate. I feel like a lot of people complain about men saying ""hey"" because it's a dry and uninteresting opener, and there's not much to go off of. Therefore, a message such as ""Would you like to go on a date?"" might elicit more of a response. I also fear coming off as repetitive and thereby desperate. Let's say I ask a woman how her week was. Well, there will always be many many weeks, so every week I might as well how her week was every week. But then that would be very repetitive, and therefore coming off as desperate since I would be asking the same thing over and over and over again. I also fear coming off as the men on r/niceguys and sometimes r/texts who continually send messages over and over again without ever recieving a response. Therefore, I really only send messages when I deem it necessary so I don't come off as one of those desperate texters that people make fun of.

1,2024-02-27,CMV: I'm of the complete belief that the institution of marriage is utterly obsolete and purposeless by design.,u/ZOLforALL,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b1taym/cmv_im_of_the_complete_belief_that_the/,changemyview,"This is a view that I have held for as long as I can remember, really. It just never made any kind of sense why two people who are, for all intents and purposes, mutually in love with each other, would then see the need for a government document to validate that *yes, indeed they are in a romantic commitment* to one another.

Now, I understand that this might come off as a bit of an ""overly-reductive view"" (as I've be told by many), but is there anything more too it? According to soaring divorce rates, **NO**, no there isn't. 

I am frankly of the believe that our continued universal cultural romanticisation of this inherently valueless practice stems from two primary factors:

1. Staunch traditionalist social expectations and beliefs that equates virtue (especially as a women) with marriage: It's abundantly obvious that the past (at least prior to the 2000s) persisted of different social norms, and taboos from today. With the significant changes being spurred by a litany of different reasons, which may include, ever increasing multicultural population growth (symptomatic of globalisation), a change in socio-economic conditions (leading to the increase of things like the cost of living), and the organic shifting of public persuasions over more increasingly irrelevant social tenets (evident with the drastic decline of religious sentiments in the West). 
2. Our own dispositions in wanting to imitate glamorised elements of our entertainment: There is no deny that cinema, television, and other prominent forms of art and entertainment have sold this idealised conception of marriage. This can be seen from all levels of entertainment, from children's programing (animated features and so on) to adult programing and movies.  

I mean look, the only way I see this practice having anything that resembles a purpose, is if the idea of a divorce never existed. Then and only then, would there be an inherent meaning behind getting married (btw I'm not advocating for the abolishment of the right to divorce, I'm just raising a point). But since that's obviously not the case... I'm lost.

If you are married and reading this, can you please then answer me this. 

* Are there any tangible valuables that you have gained after you had undergone your nuptials (like a car, or even cruise tickets)? 
* Did you somehow get a level-boost in your love and affection of your partner? 
* Did you inherit a private island in the Caribbeans to visit over the summer? 
* Are you know eligible for a Pulitzer Prize (so some other equivalent accolade)? 

If you answered ""No"" for all of the above questions, then I rest my case. I just fail to understand the logic behind people who still continue to voluntarily do this? It's costly, redundant, and - unless you're hoping to get some kind of foreign citizenship - utterly pointless. I could go on and on about why I see marriage as a pointless practice (including how much of a bother it becomes when you want to terminate the union), but I think I've already conveyed my sentiments adequately enough.

So, I'm curious, is there something to this that I am obviously not seeing. Am I the ""callous"" individual that so many people seem to love to describe me as? Or am I not alone in this perspective. "

But a key component of emotional compatibility is the mutual ability to convey and understand emotional problems. To convey, we need a mediating language. Even sign language has a naunced and expansive linguistic system. Animalistic non-verbal communication, on the other hand, hardly goes beyond essential needs:  i.e. lack of food, water, and shelter. A dog can sympathize with the primitive fear of being homeless, but will unlikely understand or empathize with the skyrocketing rent prices. While you might feel emotionally relieved venting to a dog, the extent of emotional fulfillment is not comparable to that of a friend/partner. 

This overlaps with my next point: a dog’s intellectual capacity limits the mental intimacy of our relationship with it. The assumption I will make here is that we consider people our best friend(s) when spending time with them proves interesting or mentally stimulating, more so than with any other friend(s). To say a creature—with an intelligence equivalent to a 7 year old—is your best friend, is interesting. 

My second argument is: imbalance of power dynamics. A dog is subservient to us to feed it, bathe it, and clean up its litter. A dog’s obedience to us at the expense of its independence, lends itself to codependency in the human form. And according to the standards set for human relationships, it is unnatural.

To conclude, I am not undermining the importance of pets to our daily lives, rather clarifying the extent of the ‘companion’ role they play. 

TL;DR it is correct to say dogs make good companions, are incorrect to say they are best friends 

Am curious to see how my argument will be broken down :3

This is understandable. That being said, there is no benefit to living past 18. If you ask any person to answer honestly, especially in the United States, they will most likely say that their life is not enjoyable and that it’s a struggle. We should stop lying to children and tell them the cold hard truth that life past 18 is mostly bullshit.

This isn’t to say that for some people it can be better. I.e: abuse victims for example. Children who have been abused in their childhood start to have more financial freedom and opportunity to be away from their parents and have more control. But most people have an average childhood, and adulthood in comparison is not good.

Rape: Theres more rape going on in 1st and 2nd world countries like USA ( google some statistics and its gonna show you a 10x to 20x difference but even if India doesn't consider marital rape and most rapes are unreported still 10x-20x. The crime rate in India is also pretty low and the crimes that are committed are pety crimes most of the time.

Hindutva: Usualy people say India's current government is run by fascists which is sorta true because 20% of those people talk like fascists but they think this is hindutva and it mean the world should revolve around Hinduism and nothing else is allowed.
They are so fucking wrong about that because hindutva i agree is political Hinduism but it was invented to fight political islam and Christianity. We know what happened to Pakistan. The only difference between India and Pakistan is that India has democracy because its not run by a religion that says non believers should be killed. There are no violent rules in Hinduism and you can be an atheist, monotheist, polytheist, henotheist etc. India and Pakistan got divided but minorities in India are flourishing and a white man won't have a single problem living in India unlike Pakistan Afghanistan Bangladesh (not so good benchmarks but ok). I think this is all because of hindutva (if you are angry then remember i said hindutva is not hindu world domination) because it meant accepting that caste is a bad thing created by Hinduism and there is other bs fron Islam and Christianity ( there are so many examples).

Casteism: India is compensating by making education and jobs easy for the oppressed. The first rule of hindutva was also to abolish caste.

Im an Indian and i hate my parents school government and all that stuff but i do not forget that this was all because of the British and their puppets from the indian national Congress like Gandhi,Nehru,etc who still kept hindering India.

Also indian boomers and baby boomers uncles should be nuked because they are all trads who think they know everything but in reality they know nothing. Their wives never ever had and orgasm and they explain us marriage and want everyone to have an arranged marriage and start breeding. They are sometimes straight up racist and they hate minorities.

Common elementary mistake. Hypergamous doesn't mean nymphomaniac, seeking many sexual encounters or any of that. Hypergamy is the tendency of women to date across and above their own genetic traits and status. All studies came to the same deductions. 

Women feel better when men are 12+ centimetres taller than them. 2-3+* times more experienced than them. 1.5+ times bigger income than them (no matter how much she makes her self. If she is at 100K. She'd prefer him make 150+). That's hypergamy.

Will manifest differently on each one, and not two will give the same gravity to the exact two same traits. But the general gist is like doing bargains in Chinatown..you just don't want to feel cheated into a crappy deal. But instead feel it's the best you could do for your genetic and social buck. 

Each species has it's own constitution and characteristics. In mammals like gorillas, bulls etc the male tends to be the bigger stronger more aggressive one. With rare exceptions like hyennas. 

In insects the females are the big and strong ones and you have the reproductive rituals of praying mantises and the like. Different society, different energetic needs. And different intergender behavioural dynamics.

Humans are considered primates, and as such they have men with high muoskeletal density and spatial awareness due to being the main hunters and fighters etc 

So women are born with a primordial deficit. They have to choose a partner among a group of beings they are afraid of. They can't just rip our heads off our shoulders with a swing of their arm like the much stronger and larger female praying mantis can at any moment.

This creates conflicting feelings in them. They have to balance choosing someone who protects her from the other big, strong, scary and often rapey males. And a scary unknown world in general with wild beasts and harsh weather conditions to overcome. But also doesn't trigger much anxiety and competition inside her either. 

Also the same man won't be compelled to share his resources with many more other women. So he must be preselected but at the same time maximise loyalty in some way. Which is one of the main reasons often indulge in HYPOgamous instead of Hypergamous choices. 

But it's not easy to get society at that level of stability. Till then, primal forms of hypergamy, are the best bet to pass down genes that will ensure her own and her bloodline's survival. Kings and warlords will be prefered over twinky thin programmers that make nice Christmas cakes.

But women being homo sapiens, can greatly abstract those concepts. So today we are at a point where hypergamy is outsourced mostly by the state and it's lavish provisions. 

Women have carefully tailored, trained and selected their sons and husbands, and managed to create through seduction, whining and demand, a collosal hyperstructure that on paper, managed to completely detach us from our nature and primordial fears. We just can't relate back to those people's struggles anymore. Daddy the state protects us all. 

Women created the superhuman Chad to end all cavemen. The spear to end all proverbial mammoths. The campfire to end all existentially freezing winter nights. Why men went in all this trouble? Well because life on earth is harsh as we said. And life without women seeking your provision and sharing with you their nurture is also harsh. 

Problem detection and solution construction. How do i ease women off their existential stress and anxiety? Provide a more stable environment for them. Who holds the resources for that? Earth and other people's labour. And if you are not very easy on the eyes, you better go a bit the extra mile on the provisional stuff.

Women gatekeep the keys to sex, affection and childbearing. (When they live in a barbaric society they try to minimise the damage with diplomacy and get under the wings of the more ""tolerable tyrant"").

And how do they exchange value with men in peaceful times? Well it's never identical. They go through the risks of pregnancy. They get other women's competition. Nothing is a perfectly symmetrical or fair exchange. One side offer some things. The other other things. And they meet somewhere in the middle. 

Today we got at a point where the world is so safe and lavish with material goods. And social media made the dating marketplace such a global phenomenon. Where people's dormant cave instincts have gone off the rails. 

Now we participate in real and abstracted status hierarchies that were never relatable to our ancestors. Now women are even over the classic existential dread of securing a good man. and have to think instead how to become men in the place of men. 

This delusion that im too good for men at this point so i must become my own man. Is only possible with the capitalist and industrial post agricultural society. Now the world is so safe and big, that all tribal and communal rules and values are left behind.

Only a cacophony of those traits remains, keeping and exaggerating the worst parts of our communal and herd mentality nature.  Those who don't fit in the narrative get octracised or even treated ss terrorists against the system.

So humanity is trapped in the chains of it's own freedom siege tower. We fell down a gate, just to enter a new wider type of prison. And the sad part is we made it too lovely and comfortable a place to ever want to get rid of it. 

Now our frontal cortex is playing some wild gymnastics on us and we even question our basic identities, since we are out of natural dangers to dread over. So we create drama and conflicts anew.

Women now are free to evolve on whomever they wanna be (which usually looks more like a high status male with extra steps). But can also indulge to their evolutionary instincts with minimal shame and supervision. 

Will they go out and waste all their youth chasing uncommitted chads and then complain at 40 why noone marries single moms? No. A big chunk might do it. But a way bigger don't. On the other hand it's far more likely we are heading towards an asexual and unerotic society too absorbed in their Virtual Reality headsets. Filled with choices of escapism. A general air of mistrust. And a steep population decline.

 If your child and partner don’t get along to the extent that your child doesn’t want them present at the wedding, then you should absolutely still attend the wedding alone, as the parent of the bride/groom. Youre your child’s parent, they love you more than anything and do not like your spouse If you care about your child in any way then you would accept their feelings but also make every effort to ensure that you’re present. Maybe I just grew up differently but my parents would never miss any event of mine even if I requested they come without their partners. 
My dads wife did not attend my sisters graduation as she wasn’t particularly wanted by my sister, and she understood and my dad was there cheering my sister on and respecting her wishes. 
If your child doesn’t like your partner then it probably has to do with insecurity over their place in your life and the fact that it seems to be such a common and acceptable thing is alarming to me. 
Your chose your partner, your child did not- if they don’t have a good relationship then such is life, that doesn’t mean you stop being their parent- you just keep those two seperate.

They say that both ideologies protect freedom and liberty, they provide options for the masses, and they both incentivise innovation. It's very common for people to say ""democracy is the marketplace of ideas"", intentionally showing how complimentary they both are. But I think that's false.


Capitalism, at its core, is about the belief that those who are ""better"" should be given more wealth. And since under such a system, wealth is a proxy for power and influence, they deserve the extra power they are granted too. That's the antithesis of how a democratic systems works, which believes that power is only granted if it's consented by the majority of the people, and such power is often checked and balanced by other mechanisms, like an independent legal system or free and fair elections. Capitalism does not inherently provide such mechanisms and often requires anti-capitalistic measures from the government to keep capitalists in check. 

To address some of the parallels that people like to draw:

1. The form of freedom that capitalism is fundamentally different from the freedom that democracy protects. The former overwhelmingly protects the freedom of a small minority while the latter protects the freedom of all. 

2. While capitalism provides options for consumers, it is not the same kind of options that democracy provides. There is a lot of restriction on what each consumer can choose, especially for the poor. And there are a lot of collusion and monopolisation that happen without the consumer knowing.

3. The point of innovation is the only reasonable parallel one can draw, but I'd say capitalism only innovates for the benefit of the small minority, not for the majority, so it's not exactly democratic either.

Anyways, given how prevalent the parallel between both is, I'm open to change my view on this topic."

Likewise, I don't believe in fringe protests. I believe in pragmatic protests that have the chance to change minds.

I believed that this “uncommitted” vote was very important to my friends. Furthermore, I knew Biden wasn't going to lose the primary, but it would be a chance to elevate the discussion of a ceasefire. This ceasefire *seemed* like it was the most critical issue to my friends. There was certainly more media here yesterday than voters. The storyline was pretty propped up in what would usually be regarded as an uncontested primary.

I voted “uncommitted” and made a simple quip that I had done so on my social media.

That's when the discussions really started. My Muslim friends (who I identified as moderate intellectuals… hell, we played Little League together) saw me as an ally, and started sending me materials.

It was mostly propaganda, conspiracy theories and other materials I thought we quite insane. Leave me to judge the materials, but some of it was like “Joe Biden and the US Military are flying jets into Gaza with new paint jobs, and secretly bombing people.”

Or, Aaron Bushnell had secret documents and orders… and that I need to listen to some Glenn Greenwald podcast.

After a night of sleep, I woke up wondering, “Was this what I was supporting?”

Echo chambers are echo chambers. And I do regret being part of that. I'm having trouble joining together what “I” think I did… versus what the movement was more about. Just a dislike of Jews that would continue beyond a ceasefire.

I believe that the majority of men are good-natured – they're kind, helpful, and reasonable people. In simpler terms, most men aren't trash scumbags; most aren't cheating, abusive, or harassing/assaulting women  


The issue lies in the fact that these good men often go unnoticed or ""invisible."" What I mean by this is that the actions of the few bad men who engage in heinous behavior garner more attention. For example, news outlets and social media platforms extensively cover cases of cheating, abuse, and other crimes committed by these men.  


These behaviors are often repeated by the same group of men. A man who abuses his partner likely has a history of doing so with previous partners.  


Because the ""good men"" are not as visible, the actions of the bad ones stand out more, dominating discussions on social media and in the news. This, in my view, is a significant problem in how gender issues are portrayed in these spaces.

Example: idiot, dolt, retard, intellectually challenged.   

I’d argue that the pejoration of clinical worts for limited mental capacity has ended with the word retard because the word retard is so linguistically versatile (I.e. as a suffice like Libtard or Fucktard).    

 Any subsequent clinical terms for being intellectually challenged are probably safe from pejoration because none will be as versatile as retard.

Alright alright, buckle up, because we're going to discuss why there is only one (and only one!) acceptable way of dressing, namely: right sock > left sock > right shoe> left shoe. Here is why this order is the real MVP:  
1. \*\*Sock First, Shoe Second\*\*: Putting on socks first ensures your feet are cozy and ready to rock. Then, sliding into shoes feels like the natural next step, providing that perfect balance of comfort and style. also, your feet will start to warm up and by the time you wear your shoes you're feeling all comfy.  
2. \*\*Consistency Is King\*\*: Think of it as your dressing routine's secret sauce. By sticking to the same order every time, you eliminate any room for error. It's like following a recipe for your favourite dish, you know exactly what to expect; every.single.time.   
3. \*\*Smooth Operator\*\*: Starting with the right sock, left sock, right shoe, left shoe is like following a well-choreographed dance routine. It's all about keeping that flow going, from start to finish. No awkward pauses or missteps here! You don't even need to think about it, it is done.  
4. \*\*Finishing Touches\*\*: Ending with your left shoe is like putting the cherry on top of a sundae. It's that final flourish that brings everything together. It ends the routine perfectly with no chance of accidents.   
So, there you have it, the secret to mastering the art of getting dressed like a pro. Right sock, left sock, right shoe, left shoe. I welcome all replies to help me change my view. With the subreddit's rules, I am willing to change this view. "

Is there some reason that prevents work on off-peak hours? Why is it absolutely necessary to shut down the road during those peak hours? 

Do city/county/state organizations have measures in place to make peak-hour road work a LAST RESORT measure? If not, WHY NOT?

The obvious exception is when some part of the road is unsafe and requires an immediate shut down. Are there other reasons, besides ""efficiency,"" that could justify increasing traffic tenfold and delaying peoples' commutes (often WITHOUT NOTICE)?"

This got my brain going, why do our lawmakers here in the United States allow companies loophole their way out of our wage laws. 

The list is massive, but let’s take a look at how many industries use call centers for their customer to business relations:

Banks which include the major four, as well as many local chains

Grocery/Home stores such as Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Costco etc

Telecommunication companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Etc

Restaurants such as Pizza Hut, Dominoes for their delivery, and McDonalds for their customer support. 

Technological companies such as Apple, and Microsoft

Offshore call centers not only take jobs away from the United States, but they bring a terrible customer experience to the table. I can barely understand most of their thick accents, the network based phone systems are crackly and filled with white noise, and most of the time, they don’t know what they’re talking about. I’ve been transferred back to the States for this reason, so i know some of these companies do indeed have the capabilities of having call centers here in America. 

These companies also get around serious United States wage laws. While minimum wage isn’t anything to live on, these huge companies save massive amounts of money by skipping over it, and hiring where wage laws are even more laxed. This shouldn’t be allowed, it goes against everything our founding fathers dreamed of. 

There should be a notable mention that some of these call centers are used as scam hubs to steal money from people around the world. 

These call centers, no matter customer support, sales, or technical support, shouldn’t be legal if they are not stationed in a recognized State of the United States - Change my mind.

1,2024-02-28,CMV: Adultery should be a serious crime,u/Dependent-Pea-9066,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b2emby/cmv_adultery_should_be_a_serious_crime/,changemyview,"Say what you will about freedom and bodily autonomy, but adultery is perhaps the most harmful thing in society for which the perpetrators go unpunished. The reason I believe adultery should be a crime is not because of it being a sin or marriage being sacred or what not. 

The first reason I believe so is that it is essentially defrauding your partner. Committed relationships, especially marriage, are an agreement between partners to share their lives and most things in them. When one partner is not faithful within the relationship, that partner is not upholding their part of the arrangement. 

The second and more important reason is that being cheated on feels so violating that it’s hard to describe. When you devote yourself so much to another person thinking they’re equally devoted to you, it’s the greatest connection two humans can have. Now imagine the entire time that this idea is a lie because the partner is not devoted to you. Being cheated on is only half the pain. The other half is that your devotion to each other was an illusion from the beginning. Every memory you made, every feeling you thought you felt, was all based on a lie. 

The third reason is that there are long term impacts from cheating. The cheater not only screws up their own life, but that of their partner. Their partner suffers more. Sometimes they can never feel trust or devotion again. And this is so much worse when there are kids in the picture. Kids suffer incredibly when they realize one of their parents was raising them in a lie, and that their role as a parent was a second thought. Victims of cheating end up truly broken, and all of them suffer some degree of long term issues with trust and relationships. 

And all of this for what? For the cheaters own self gratification? It’s so pathetic that the law allows anyone to create so much pain and turmoil for such selfish reasons. I don’t care what your beliefs are, violating a committed relationship is wrong and creates lasting harm. I don’t care what you do in your bedroom if you’re not deceiving anyone while doing it. But the moment you start deceiving those closest to you, making sometimes years of their lives a lie, I think it should be criminal. "

I find it haunting and nerve racking when I think I'm potentially disappointing people I've never even met. Who are they to judge my actions and how I live my day to day life when we never even had a chance to meet? Why would I entertain the thought of making them proud?

I made that last bit sound worse than I really meant it to, but that's what I believe.

Looks do matter, how people perceive you based on your relationship does matter. There’s multiple people I’ve had the “looks are the main factor” debate with who later on express not wanting to be involved with someone cus they’re ugly. 

Being drawn to certain surface level personality traits that you’ve grown to associate with attractiveness is different from connecting with someone on a deep level. Someone saying the right thing to trigger some fantasy you have is different from connecting with someone on a deep level. You might be drawn to someone because you have things in common, but that person still has to be in the range of people you could find attractive in the first place. If It were about a personal connection there wouldn’t be a standard of attractiveness to begin with.

People sometimes give me the argument of”sex means more when it’s someone you care about” spending time with someone in general can mean more when it’s someone you care about, but someone you have sex with still has to trigger your attraction. Once an attraction there it can grow bigger over time, but it’s still starts from surface level things your brain is programmed to enjoy. 

Connecting with someone on a deep level is completely different from attraction. Is anyone denying there aren’t tons of people on this earth in relationships with people that make them miserable and would want nothing/very little to do with if they had no attraction to. From my perspective people usually vibe mor with people of the same gender, yet there are way more straight couples than gay couples. There’s tons of intimate friendships that last for years that don’t result in sex showing it’s not the apex of connection. Is it possible to also connect with someone on a person to connect on a very personal level with someone they’re having sex with? Absolutely, but that’s nowhere near always the case and usually not why people pursue each other in the first place.

In my opinion we should just view it as a biological urge. Prostitution should just be the norm extended to acting out all fantasies. Whether or not your attractive shouldn’t be seen as relevant to who you are as a person , and a life partner should be completely separate from who you’re attracted to."

Additionally, I'm not even fully convinced money makes a huge difference at that high of an election level. In a local, even congressional race, sure, but the public is generally pretty oversaturated, to the point where I think past a certain point you cannot meaningfully buy more votes.

""But the superdelegates""

The superdelegates were perfectly free to change their minds at any point and likely would have done so if Bernie won primaries that involved voters, as they did with Obama.

""But the DNC leaks""
To this day I have never heard a person actually tell me what those emails supposedly said that was so damning. The party leadership is allowed to have preferences, that does not mean they hijacked anything or forced their primary voters to vote in any particular way.

Yet of course those sacred updoots, likes, and short video clips keep that lizard brain of ours pumped full of dopamine. 

But social media can be insidious. A white kid who grew up in Texas, and had enlisted in the airforce, got brainwashed through social media echo chambers into thinking he had to kill himself to free palestine. He burned himself alive, and in the video you can hear his intense screams of pain. 

How did we get to this point? For one thing, people who support palestinians over Israelis have artificially raised the stakes of this conflict to an insane degree. There are millions dead in the Congo. 400,000 dead in the Yemen civil war including 75,000 children. At least 200,000 people dead in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. An *actual* genocide going on in China to eradicate the Uyghur Muslims. 

But the pro palestinian forces need people to think their pet cause is the most important thing in the world right now. That’s how they win more supporters over to their side, that’s how they gain a sense of meaning in this world, and that’s how they convinced Aaron Bushnell to kill himself for them. 

And now they are glorifying his death all over social media. Calling him the bravest hero. A martyr for the cause. You can be sure another kid without any sense of purpose in life will be convinced to kill himself for the palestinians as well.

2,2024-02-28,CMV: America is not nearly as fat people think,u/TheSlimmestofShadys_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b2ivi3/cmv_america_is_not_nearly_as_fat_people_think/,changemyview,"First, I’m fully aware the United States is fatter in comparison to other countries. However, the numbers about how fat we are either wrong or at the very least misleading. When you think of “overweight” and “obese” you also think of “fat.” When I think of “fat” I think of, well, someone who’s fat. You can either see it or you can notice someone who’s not particularly skinny. I only bring up “overweight” and “obese” cause that’s the terms used in data since they have a specific range. 

Now when people hear these crazy numbers, 42% of Americans have obesity, 69% of Americans are obese or overweight, etc, they all think we are a bunch of fatasses. I don’t blame them, I would too because I also associate these words with being “fat” as in I can tell you’re a fatass. Since the rest of the world and many Americans have made memes about the majority of us are fatasses for years, I start to look around. 

Pretty much my whole life just observing people around me, there’s no goddamn way 42% have obesity and over two thirds or overweight or obese. Im not sure of exact numbers but my point is I see no where near these figures. I have spent significant time in Minnesota, Colorado, California, Michigan, and beyond that I travel all the time, seeing many different areas. So I don’t think I have total bias of maybe just being in an unusually skinny US area. In college in Minnesota, i walk around the halls and I’m like there’s no way even 15% of these people are overweight/obese, much less half. Ok well, maybe it’s just cause young adults are skinnier. Then I get into the work force, maybe aside from really older people near retirement age with like beer looking bellies, there’s still no goddamn way half of the people are overweight. And as mentioned, I travel a lot and see people everywhere, I have never came across an area where I could remotely believe half of us are overweight besides at a KFC at 9pm. 

So why are these numbers so high? I see a few possibilities

1. All these supposed fatasses that make up 50% of our population that I’m not seeing are just staying home. Which makes sense given the context, but I refuse to believe that many just never get out into the world. I don’t think there’s actually a lot of my 600 pound life fatasses that literally never leave their home.

2. They classify overweight and obesity in a dumb way leading to a higher number. I think this is the main cause. I noticed it’s calculated by BMI. Here’s me, a skinny 140 pound 5 foot 10 male. I struggle to find shorts and pants that are long enough but aren’t too big for my waist. I’m like right in the middle of the “normal” range. If I hit the gym and gained muscle mass, pretty quickly I’d be considered overweight. Literally all my friends in my main group are considered overweight, one of them even obese, and non of them are “fat”. You would not look at them and think “that guy is fat”. They just have more muscle.

3. Maybe even with everywhere I’ve been I actually do have location bias. Really the only region I rarely go to is the southeast, which I think is fatter than the rest of the US, but really that shouldn’t change the numbers much. Unless it’s that bad, and it’s like that moment where Eric Cartman single-handedly made his school the fattest school in the United States based on averages.

Now if the second one is the case, then I think it’s a bullshit at to interpret how fat we are. Sure we have more round spheres liked I mentioned earlier, but this 50% of us are fatasses notion that everyone gives us shit for is just stupid. If that’s the metric for overweight, then being “overweight” shouldn’t be looked at as a problem like it is. 

In conclusion, America yes is fatter than the rest of the world but the whole narrative that if a foreigner enters America and will come across a sphere every other person like I’m sure everyone who hasn’t been in America thinks, that’s just a bullshit. I get it’s a meme, but still. "

I am for alleviating those who are located on the severe ends of the spectrum but a ""cure' for, say, schizophrenia is ridiculous. There are people in indigenous, rural communities that the DSM would categorize as schizophrenic but live with it effectively because this state of mind isn't viewed as a defect but a different perspective on lived experience.

I believe it’s like this across America (correct me if wrong pls.) 

In a road test, the person is tested on their ability to drive a motor vehicle safely under normal traffic conditions.

When you go in to get your drivers licenses renewed, you have to do a brief eye exam in a little machine. You only need to meet minimum vision standards. 

If we required people to retake their road tests every few years, the roads would be much safer. 

We have old drivers out on the road driving extreme passive (causing them to drive unpredictably, which causes accidents.) Old drivers are out driving on the sidewalk. You just gotta take the test once when you’re cognitively able, and you’re set for life! Until you finally kill someone and get your license taken away. D:

Someone could develop an addiction, and if they are so dependent and can’t stay off of it for the reoccurring test, their license won’t be renewed. 

There are so many other reasons that could cause someone to be unable to safely drive. This is why we need to have road tests more than just once. 

People tend to forget or ignore safety rules. Making them retake the test could be a good refresher. (For the average person who doesn’t want to kill people while driving. I ain’t talking about the crazy people who use cars as toys.)

There could be other things I’m not considering that could make this not possible, or make this not even effective. Or I could even have some misinformation. Thanks everyone.

Rags to riches stories like Carnegie, Vanderbilt, and even Oprah have become symbols of the American Dream.

It is easy to say that a billionaire who inherited their wealth, or someone who won the lottery, hasn’t really earned it. But I’d go further and say that as it stands today, no billionaire has earned the wealth they control.

To accumulate that much wealth, a person must make decisions to better their own position. They might play the stock market, or consolidate an industry, or rely on relationships to climb a corporate ladder. None of this is necessarily *hard* work, nor is it *morally valuable* work. The process of accumulating that much money is inherently damaging to a competitive economy and the political influence of billionaires is much of what keeps massively popular measures from being implemented into law.

A factory owner who reaps the majority of capital produced by his business might make more money than his laborers, but he isn’t *earning* more money. He has simply been born into a favorable position or otherwise made some savvy business / investment decisions; that’s not earning. It is impossible to work hard enough to earn a billion dollars, even if the work is morally valuable.

It could be argued that someone who invents something that benefits the world, and subsequently makes a ton of money, has earned that reward. However, they can’t *earn* a billion dollars, no matter what they invent. Steve Jobs is credited for the creation of Apple and its products, and was a multi-billionaire. Sure, his product revolutionized computing and the cell phone market, but he didn’t invent either of those things and selling luxury electronics doesn’t qualify as earning.

Besides, products like iPhones are enormously complicated and require hundreds of professionals to design and market, and thousands of underpaid laborers to mine raw material and make the product. Henry Ford made billions off cars, but he didn’t make them himself, he just sat at the top of the company that made and sold them. That’s not earning.

The billions that sit in the bank accounts of the 1% cumulatively come from *middle or lower class people*. That is why as wealth inequality gets worse, poor folks lose wealth as the rich gain it. It is possible to earn a lot of money, and provide a very nice life for oneself, but not a billion dollars. At that point it surpasses earning and becomes accumulating, nearly always off the backs of underpaid workers."
1,2024-02-28,"CMV: If you still think that ""illegal"" migrants are a problem you lack critical thinking.",u/acfreeman94,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b2m5kh/cmv_if_you_still_think_that_illegal_migrants_are/,changemyview,"The ""illegal migrant crisis"" seems to be the main rallying cry of the right this election cycle despite the fact that we have so much data that directly disproves that narrative. It's not even a new or unique talking point because it's literally just rehashed xenophobia from the past. The same was said about the Irish people when they immigrated en masse due to the Irish Potato Famine. That's where we got the term ""Paddy wagon"" from. Then after the Civil War when black people started having more unrestricted freedom to move throughout the country many stereotypes were created to fear monger over black people assimilating into the country. Then post WWII when a large number of Italians immigrated to the country and a lot of stereotypes were made about them. That's where we get the word ""Wop  people shouldn't care, and those who do I'm convinced are racist, dumb, or both.

1. Migrants are not dangerous.
Many studies have been conducted on the topic and have always shown that migrants are 11x less likely to commit a crime. Think about it logically, why would a person commit a crime and attract attention to themselves? That would mean they get deported if they commit crimes.

2. This is old anti-immigrstion propaganda.
As I stated above America has a habit of making shit up about the hot new group that is immigrating into the country.

3. Immigration helps the economy.
Many studies have shown that immigration helps the economy. More mouths to feed increases food production, which creates more jobs in the food sector. More people means more houses/apartments need to get built making more people more likely to live in said homes. And more bodies means more hands to work.

4. Immigrated will not affect you.
I cannot tell you how many times I've heard people say that they have a problem with the migrants who will never be affected by one ever. They don't ""take jobs"" because let's be honest, you weren't pining over a laborer job picking fruit to begin with.

5. If you aren't Native American you really don't have a leg to stand on
""My family were immigrants but they did it the right way"". Hey genius, the country didn't have an immigration policy back then because we prided ourselves on giving a home to immigrants in need. There were literally no laws in place governing immigration. Your ancestors came from another country to provide you with a better life and your response is to close the door on those doing the exact same thing. Dope."

So, here it is:

**Disclaimer:** This is a post that will be exclusively centered from a purely secular point-of-view. If you're a pious theist, who's religious adherence doesn't allow them to engage in any kind of hypothetical worldview, than I advise for you not to read any further.

Morality. Morality as a construct is something that is as inherently human, as our baseline human emotions, like fear, anger, and joy. But, does morality's rudimentary factuality underscore an objective truth?

Is there such a thing as objective truth or not? Well, I don't believe so.

Objectivity, denotes the existence of unquestionable truths. A criteria on which, we as people, can with complete consistency and assertion extract constant returns and feedback, under ever kind of potential circumstance, without fail. In reality (our shared reality) no such truth exists. 

Now I don't subscribe to the belief that morality is entirely subjective. This extreme would directly conflict with our intrinsic community-prone symbiosis. 

So, then, the question becomes: Where exactly does our *moral sense/moral compass* come from, if not a moral truth?

I believe that the answer is that, it comes from us. Within our symbiosis, we outline a universally shared moral baseline. These are certain tenets that we can all agree on (90% atleast, practically everyone), and decide to brandish as moral and immoral. From this immoral accordance (commonly known as taboos), we then, as a society, continue to derive other corresponding immoral constituents (which can be unique to us as a specific society).

The procedure follows an evolution of: outright taboo > commonly held no-no > less agreeable violation (and btw I'm not saying that **all** agreed moral stipulations are derived this way, just most). 

**MURDEROUS ACT > PHYSICAL VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR > MENACING BEHAVIOUR**

We can all agree (with very few acceptation) that murder is wicked, from that we can also reach an agreement that any form is physical violence is wrong (""  ""), and from that we can concurrently stand against menacing behaviour. 

**HUMAN CANNABILISM > CARNIVORISM >  LOCTO-OVO VEGETARIANISM**

We can all agree (once again, with very few acceptations) that human cannibalism is vile, less of us go a step further and assert that any meat consumption is unethical, and even less are against the consumption of anything of an animal.

**PHYSICAL INFEDELITY > EMOTIONAL INFEDELITY > FLIRTATIOUSNESS**

You already know how it goes. From the baseline taboo, to a more arguable stipulation.

Though, in as much as we can attempt to reach a common ground as people, this common ground can never be perfect, once again, because there is no immutable truth, but a contractually agreed upon consensus. 

But, who knows, I might be completely off, I'm open to hearing what others make of the matter of objective truth. Is it there? Or are our scruples all that we have? "

We both are relatively cynical, but they are much more so than me. I ended up in a political argument with this person that degenerated quickly because of their absolute lack of faith in the US political system. Their relative negativity has rubbed off on me a bit, hence this post.

For context, I am an 18 year old bisexual cis male, currently enrolled in college. My friend is similarly aged and also queer, but I will not share any further details for confidentiality reasons.

It's no secret that the US political system is dysfunctional. It seems like every other news article is talking about further corruption or obstruction or discrimination (generally by one party, but not exclusively to them). My friend was insisting that the entire political system is broken beyond repair and that the safest option for them is to leave this country and never come back. Examples they gave for their hate (specifically on Biden, but also the government in general) included the continued support for Israel's genocide in Gaza (my view on the situation is that everyone should stop murdering each other, but I acknowledge my naivety, and my friend will not have their mind changed), the continued funding of the Willow Project, and that Biden seems to have done nothing constructive to help the average person. 

Direct quotes from my friend regarding Biden: ""he is killing the planet while avoiding civil war"" and ""stop defending someone who would rather us barely pass by while making ripples than make the change we need while causing waves. he is covering his own ass.""

Examples I gave of positive things the Biden administration has done include the CHIPS act, the infrastructure package with the largest investment in clean energy ever, and the Respect for Marriage Act. However, my friend's serious negativity had a genuine effect on me, and I've found myself agreeing more and more with their points. I look around and see people like me and my friend getting literally murdered just for our identities (not elaborating further because I'd like this post to not get removed, if you know you know) and state laws getting passed restricting the rights of women and minorities, and then I see Congress more focused on political grandstanding than actually keeping the government functioning, and I'm having a really hard time coping. As Gen Z voters, the climate is a critical issue for both me and my friend, and it feels like we are doing worse than nothing, we are actually being counterproductive in the fight against climate change.

Then I look at a country like New Zealand. Higher standards of living, better rights for minorities, better income, better social safety nets, more dedication to fighting climate change, and just overall happier citizens, and I wonder what the heck I'm doing still living in the US when it feels like there's no hope to actually manifest real change. I plan to vote in November, but as a voter registered in Massachusetts, my vote doesn't really matter - the outcome of the election is a foregone conclusion regardless of which bubble I fill in. Why should I stay here? If my vote here doesn't matter, shouldn't I just move to a country where I'll be happier, even if I can't vote?

I will award deltas for users who can provide genuine and well-reasoned explanations for why there is still hope for the USA and well-reasoned explanations for why Joe Biden has actually been a good president despite his failings (both the ones I listed and rebuttals of the quotes from my friend). My friend will probably never see this, but try to keep them in mind as you're answering."

687,2024-02-28,CMV: it is impossible to ethically accumulate and deserve over a billion dollars,u/champagne_papaya,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b2o53w/cmv_it_is_impossible_to_ethically_accumulate_and/,changemyview,"Alright, so my last post was poorly worded and I got flamed (rightly so) for my verbiage. So I’ll try to be as specific in my definitions as possible in this one.

I personally believe that someone would hypothetically deserve a billion dollars if they 1. worked extremely hard and 2. personally had a SUBSTANTIAL positive impact on the world due to their work. The positive impact must be substantial to outweigh the inherent harm and selfishness of hoarding more wealth than one could ever spend, while millions of people starve and live in undignified conditions.

Nowadays there are so many billionaires that we forget just what an obscene amount of money that is. Benjamin Franklin’s personal inventions and works made the world a better place and he became rich because of it. Online sources say he was one of the 5 richest men in the country and his lifetime wealth was around $10mil-$50mil. I would say he deserved that wealth because of the beneficial material impact his work had on the people around him. Today there are around 3-4 thousand billionaires in the world, and none of them have had a substantial enough positive impact to deserve it.

Today, there are many people working hard on lifesaving inventions around the world. However, these people will likely never make billions. If the research department of a huge pharma company comes up with a revolutionary cancer treatment, the only billionaires who will come out of it are the owners and executives. If someone single-handedly cured cancer, and made a billion from it, I would say that is ethical and deserved. But that is a practical impossibility in the world today. Money flows up to those who are already ultra-rich, and who had little to do with the actual achievement, in almost all cases.

On entertainment: there are many athletes, musicians, and other entertainers who have amassed billions. I recognize that entertainment is valuable and I do think they deserve to be rich, but not billionaires. That’s just too much money and not enough impact.

Top athletes are very talented, hardworking, and bring a lot of joy to their fans. I don’t think they bring enough joy to justify owning a billion dollars. If Messi single-handedly cured depression in Argentina, I’d say he deserves a billion. There’s nothing you can do with a sports ball that ethically accumulates that much money.

Yes, a lot of that money comes from adoring fans who willingly spend their money to buy tickets and merch. Michael Jordan has made over $6 billion in royalties from Nike. But I would argue that there is little ethical value in selling branded apparel or generating revenue based on one’s persona or likeness. It’s not unethical, but it doesn’t change the world for the better. MJ deserves to be rich but doesn’t deserve billions. I’m open to debate on this.

My general point here is that if you look at any list of billionaires, the vast majority are at the top of massive companies and profit directly or indirectly off of the labor of others. You could say that’s just how to world works but that doesn’t mean it’s right. I don’t think there is any person who has individually contributed enough to the betterment of the world in their lifetime and has also amassed a billion dollars. I am open to any particular billionaires and their work that might change my mind. I also should say that this is a strongly held belief of mine so I would be hard pressed to offer deltas but I absolutely will if someone provides an example of one person who has made a billion that deserves it."

Yes, I think if Mitt Romney had been elected in 2012 most likely the USA would not have had to deal with Trump and the polarization that followed, but apparently no one in America likes to talk about that because they live in denial or something, but for me it's the truth, I think it would be better for Obama to lose in 2012, and return in 2016 or 2020 becoming the new Cleveland than the risk of the new Cleveland being Trump now in 2024.I really believe in this,make me change my mind because I dont see a way of Romney becoming President in 2012 and Trump still happen."
0,2024-02-28,CMV: If you're going to insist on finishing work at exactly 5pm then you should be expected to be 100% productive during your full work day,u/TheCricketFan416,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b2pize/cmv_if_youre_going_to_insist_on_finishing_work_at/,changemyview,"It's been a popular trend for quite a while now for workers on social media to throw their support behind workers fighting to make sure they get full use of their compensation and they don't let their employers take advantage of them with unpaid overtime etc.  
  
And while in general I think this is a good thing, I think a lot of the videos I see on social media lack nuance (surprise surprise).  
  
For instance, one of the sentiments I see repeated often is that you should be steadfast in logging off from work/leaving the office at exactly 5pm (or whatever your stated finishing time is) irrespective of the context around what needs to be done in the workplace.  
  
I would say this view would only be justified if you could genuinely say that you were productive and working for every single moment you were on the clock. No checking your phone, no scrolling through reddit, no extra long coffee/lunch breaks, no non-essential appointments during the week for haircuts etc and you never ask to leave early once you've completed all your work for the day.  
  
If you're going to take this hard-line stance that under no circumstances will you work beyond the scheduled end of your shift, you should expect in return for your employer to take a hard-line stance around you scrolling TikTok or responding to personal messages during work hours, yet I highly doubt these people would accept this kind of draconianism by their boss.  
  
I think at the end of the day your relationship with your employer should be about give and take. My boss doesn't have any issue with me taking a longer lunch break or going to get my haircut or having sport on in the background while I work, because she knows at the end of the day I'll only leave the office for the day/week once the work I needed to get done is done. I think this is a far more reasonable stance to take than militantly watching the clock for that 5pm timer so you can log off."

They are wrong and here’s why:

Aaron Bushnell was a single man with NO children.

He worked in IT Infrastructure Monitoring & Oversight /
Cyber Defense and IT Management with the US Air Force

https://www.instagram.com/p/C33yxNivl_J/?igsh=MXZvM3NheDdmbDhncQ==


We civilians are seeing thousands of videos of innocent civilians being indiscriminately killed by the IDF (IOF) and US and even intentionally targeted by snipers, so the footage he would have seen thru his monitoring position would be even worse, things that would never be revealed to the public, and were likely major factors in his decision for what he did. There’s a reason so many soldiers come back from war with PTSD. People are trying to claim he was mentally ill; if anything, he had PTSD from the war crimes he saw his own forces and allies committing, making him complicit. He said specifically “I will no longer be complicit in genocide” before performing the most extreme act of protest.

https://www.instagram.com/p/C35ljVdPno-/?igsh=YmRzdWw2MXd0OGlh


People are saying his actions had no impact and will be forgotten. You’re wrong, his actions are already having a major ripple effect including emboldened other military personnel to come forward with their shared feelings, as well as US new coverage from major news networks that original refused to cover anything that made Israel look bad, and now they’re quoting his words and broadcasting them across the nation. “FREE PALESTINE!” He’s opened so many people’s hearts who were ignorant to the situation, and many other examples of him making an impact.

I have to post here because I was banned from a couple certain news subs for making comments opposing genocide and they won’t explain the reasoning for the bans. It’s clear the Zionists run those subs and Reddit - but it’s still not enough to overcome all of our combined efforts. That’s why Aaron Bushnell’s actions matter. He is part of a combined effort and Israel is slowly becoming more and more of a pariah state as more and more people feel safe to call them out on the colonialist genocide. His legacy will always be remembered because of it.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1b1feix/students_at_the_university_of_texas_ask_a/

For those that don’t want to watch the gist is that an engineer for Lockheed Martin was speaking to a college class and a few students in protest asked questions along the lines of: 

If I worked at Lockheed Martin would I be working on radar systems or something or would I be able to develop weapons to carry out a genocide right away?

How much money do you think you’ve made per child you’ve killed?

Things like that. I found the amusing in a way but I don’t think I buy into the premise to begin with.

I don’t think someone working to develop weapons for the US Military Industrial complex is supporting or complicit in genocide. 

I think that the US having a robust defense industry is overall, in modern times, generally more positive than negative in the world. 

The US having a strong military is something that the entire global west generally benefits from in my opinion. We ensure that free commerce is possible on the world’s oceans for example. Look at how disruptive what the houthis have been doing has been for trade. A US led coalition is the force that is pushing back on that. 

Additionally, look to Russia and Ukraine. The US has taken the lead to support Ukraine in their desire to defend their country from an invading force. 

I think those are both good things. I could list many other examples of the benefits that the US military and our allies which we sell weapons to provide to the world. Taiwan not being invaded by China for example. 

I just don’t think I buy into the premise that these students are basing their questions on. It’s only a ‘gotcha’ moment if the speaker and audience also agree that the US and our military industrial complex are supporting genocidal acts and I don’t think that really paints the full picture."

A lot of women actually pride themselves in the fact that they’re sexy. 

The day they dressed provocatively and no one paid attention: they’d be sad. They’d get insecure and self conscious. 

In one breath they’ll say “they’re just nipples, they’re just breast, it’s just my chest”.

So, I have no problem with using others in minor speeches, but there should be limits. Why to hear them and not their speechwriters directly? If you can't appeal to the audience with your opinions. redefining them with beautiful and persuasive words won't change anything in the long run. Also, being a skilled writer/orator is a requirement to this job, it's like saying a race driver needs an assistant to drive. Although, I believe that their speeches should be checked by someone with writing skills, they should write them by themselves when it comes to important speeches."

I’m surrounded by people who think the Covid vaccine was created by dr fauci and bill gates to cull the masses.

I live in a small prairie city in Canada. To this day, in 2024 there are still weekly rallies of people who drive around my town in their pickup trucks and SUV’s riddled with Canadian flags, signs, paint and bumper stickers that promote sentiments like “fuck Trudeau” “fuck fauci” “*something…something* plandemic” “*something…something* death jab” “mandate freedom” “thank you truckers” “freedom convoy 202X” “honk honk”.

I did get vaccinated for Covid, back when it first rolled out. I got the two shots, got my vaccination card and that was it I thought at the time. I thought I could move on. But no. 😀

 My dad’s side of my family really encouraged me, especially my stepmom who is a nurse and one of the smartest people I know. My mom and step dad are the other side of the discussion. I’ve been sent so many videos… I hate it but I’ve had to distance myself from them a bit. I still love and respect them a lot. My mom and my stepdad especially are smart people. I respect them, I love them. I never saw this coming. Life was so much better before all of this. I just don’t know what to believe anymore.

What’s frustrating is that some of their rhetoric has gotten on my head. I second guess myself all the time, and wonder which side of the argument I believe more. After all, I’m no scientist. It’s tough, because Dr’s have supposedly “whistleblown” according to people like my mom, and they retort to anything I tell them with things like “official numbers and organizations aren’t accurate on anything because it’s all a big ruse and the damage is being hidden from everyone” But then other people are like they’re delusional… then the other side barks back “no they’re in denial. Sheep!” vs “they’re just a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists”. It’s exhausting.

TL;DR/my view: The fact that the Covid deniers might be onto something.

Starting with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, eventhough it’s know that the Russians live under a very controlled dictatorship, with a vast propaganda and their freedom restrict, and that going or not going to fight the war was not a personal choice, as even those who didn’t want, had too, we blame them. We hate them. We ban them. We openly “wish them dead” and we direct all our hate towards them.


The same with the Israel and Palestine. In the beginning, movements and pro-palestine manifestations were forbidden in some countries, and we all had something to say about “how the conflict is there fault”, and that Israel has to protect himself from this people, that agree with a terrorist group.  Later on, Israel is now committing genocide and the palestinas should be protected. Israel is the invader and has to be stopped. And now we all blame Israel, and act as if we always did.

Continuing to the immigration, and talking as a EU citizen, everything is their fault. “If there’s no houses, it’s their fault. If there’s crime, it’s their fault. We hate them, they need to live, they are not like us. Our culture is dying because of them”. 


I’m not saying that this things are true are false. That’s not the point of the post. Where I’m trying to reach and, of course, using “we” it’s a super generalisation, it’s that maybe, humans have an irrational need or will for hatred. That hatred, or the possibility of hating, shapes our thoughts so much that we don’t take the time to analise what’s being told or what’s happening. 

This intrinsic movement towards hate makes everyone, somehow, a puppet of the power and like so, we are the same as, for example,  the Russians, that led by propaganda, hate the West or whatever. The difference is that they had the chance to expel that hate and we don’t.

Tho conclude, how utopian is to think that we could bring this (supposed) instinct to hate to conscious, and stop it. Stop hating what we are told to hate, stop hating entire cultures, countries, nations just because it’s easier, and somehow, look at the people that constitute theses cultures, countries and nations as, well, people. Fallible, irrationally rational, just as we are."

Most older Israeli, Hebrew is their second language. Most newcomers to the region also a second language. The utter cognitive dissonance exhibited over gazan's not being human is very visible. The younger generation though still often taught their parents mother tongue have a higher chance of being taught hebrew first or at least at the same time. Prior to oct 7th the youth in Israel were becoming more resistant to the status quo (record nos of refusal to join IDF etc)

Converts to Islam learn Arabic as a second language. They are far more likely to become rabid terrorist than someone for whom Arabic is their first language. The cognitive dissonance of some islamic terrorist groups seem to be worse (eg boko haram taking schoolgirls as wives) , but their access to resources lesser in general than their cousins in faith.

I'm beginning to think it may not be religion at all - been pretty vehemently anti religions for some time citing wars as prime example of us and themism..  

Since seeing this video i have also noticed in myself how differently i think. Presumably there would be a predisposition to being radicalised, certainly lots if american children questioning the zionist propaganda on birthright vacation, but many dont, and this is fed in their own native tongue

Militaries and militia's and drugs cartels al develop their own sublanguages of terms and shortcuts, to evade the enemy is this tapping into the language thing?

Loads of international decision's are made in foreign languages - but they at least get the option of a translator- presuming no bias in the translation - does this remove the phenomenon or having heard it in the foreign tongue too does the effect outcome

Because of this they feel they had the right to take the land of the people who had been living their for 100s of years and establish a new nation. This is absolutely atrocious when you look at it from a neutral point of view. For context I am descended from a extremely wealthy Scottish family that owned vast amounts of Scotland for 100s of years.

Even if we suppose, that life begins at the conception the argument of bodily autonomy still would be valid. And even in this case abortion and infanticide still would not be analogous. Fetus requires the body of the mother to get nutrients  Infant can survive without the mother, if other people take care and dont leave them unattended. Fetus’s all bodily functions are sustained by the pregnant person on their expanse, unlike the infant.  Also fetus and its existence  can negatively influence the health and well being of the pregnant person and everyone  has a right protect itself detach from any harm, even if it comes from  the other living organism. ..

Prohibitionist policies have failed to curb drug use or decrease associated harm. For instance, despite decades of stringent drug laws, drug-related deaths continue to rise. In the United States, where the War on Drugs has been vigorously pursued, drug overdose deaths reached a record high of over 93,000 in 2020, according to the CDC. Legalization and regulation would allow for quality control, education, and harm reduction measures, similar to those employed with alcohol and tobacco. Countries like Portugal, which decriminalized all drugs in 2001, have seen significant reductions in drug-related deaths, HIV infections, and drug-related crime. By treating drug use as a public health issue rather than a criminal one, individuals can access support and treatment without fear of legal repercussions, ultimately leading to safer communities.

Regulating all drugs would undermine the black market that thrives on the illegal drug trade. Criminal organizations reap massive profits from drug sales, fueling violence and corruption. Legalization would divert revenue away from criminal enterprises, potentially reducing crime rates associated with drug trafficking.  
  
Moreover, legalizing drugs would alleviate the burden on the criminal justice system. The current approach leads to overcrowded prisons, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. In the United States, for example, nonviolent drug offenses contribute significantly to mass incarceration, with people of color disproportionately impacted. According to the ACLU, Black individuals are over 3.5 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than their white counterparts, despite comparable usage rates.  
  
By legalizing and regulating drugs, society can redirect resources towards prevention, education, and rehabilitation programs, fostering a more humane and effective approach to addressing drug-related issues."

While the idea of government surveillance may evoke concerns about privacy violations, the reality is that robust surveillance measures are essential for protecting citizens from various threats, including terrorism, cyberattacks, and organized crime. The utilization of surveillance technologies enables authorities to gather intelligence, identify potential threats, and prevent attacks before they occur.  
  
Statistics reveal the efficacy of surveillance programs in thwarting security threats. For example, according to a report by the New America Foundation, surveillance played a crucial role in preventing at least 94 terrorist plots in the United States between 2001 and 2013. Similarly, in the UK, surveillance measures aided in disrupting numerous terrorist plots, such as the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot.  
  
Moreover, surveillance programs are not solely focused on counterterrorism efforts but also contribute to combating other serious crimes, including human trafficking and child exploitation. For instance, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) reports that online surveillance has been instrumental in identifying and rescuing numerous victims of child exploitation and abuse. In 2020 alone, NCMEC received over 21 million reports of suspected child sexual exploitation imagery online, highlighting the pervasive nature of this crime and the importance of surveillance in combating it.  
  
While concerns about privacy infringement are valid, the potential harm caused by allowing security threats to go undetected outweighs the impact on individual privacy rights. Additionally, proper oversight and accountability mechanisms can help mitigate abuses of surveillance powers by ensuring that surveillance activities are conducted within legal and ethical boundaries. Ultimately, the imperative to safeguard national security necessitates the use of surveillance programs, albeit with careful consideration of privacy concerns and adherence to legal safeguards."

I personally work in automation maintenance and engineering and am seeing firsthand, if not directly contributing, to the elimination of human workers for more and more tasks. This seismic shift leaves brings us to a crossroads with two starkly different paths: on one hand, the potential for what could be described as a socialist utopia, where basic human needs are met through extensive subsidies, and on the other, a dystopian scenario of societal disintegration, where the wealth gap is wider than ever before, and wages are driven down to keep up with the ever increasing efficiency of automation, equating nearly to slavery.  
  
To avoid the worst of those scenarios, I think a series of radical changes are honestly required. These include food stamps-esque programs to cover essential non-food items such as gas, utilities, and toiletries; implementing widespread housing subsidies; making education, including higher education, accessible to all through subsidies; and ensuring comprehensive healthcare coverage, including dental, mental, vision, and general health care, alongside subsidized childcare. The funding for these initiatives could and should come from a fairer taxation system that targets the increased profits garnered from automation.  
  
This isn't merely an ideological stance but a pragmatic solution to the impending socio-economic upheaval promised by the relentless march of technology. The alternative, as I see it, could very well be mass unrest, starvation, and a societal collapse that could throw us into chaos.  
  
Despite the clarity I see the two paths, I'm open to having my view challenged. Is there a middle ground I'm not seeing, or perhaps flaws in my reasoning on the sustainability of mass subsidies? Could AI and automation, rather than spelling doom, actually facilitate a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunity without necessitating such drastic measures?"
36,2024-02-29,"CMV: Most attempts at representation of LGBT people in media are unhelpful and sometimes, insulting",u/andrew21w,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b2z0hc/cmv_most_attempts_at_representation_of_lgbt/,changemyview,"Before you say anything: I do not care about gay, straignt, bi, non-binary etc being on movies, games or books, no matter how shallow their personalities are. If anything, bad stories exist all the time.

However, what I have beef with is the reasoning behind it and motivation. Here's why:

&#x200B;

1) ""If we put gay people on movies, we will look good""

Slapping a gay person in a movie is the \*easiest\* thing in the world. Companies like Disney, Netflix or whatever do this in order to improve their reputation. Not because they care. 

While that itself is not necessarily a bad thing, I wanna ask a simple question. How many of these companies preach about diversity and inclusion, while behind the scenes they treat these people way worse than their straight counterparts?  My answer. Too fucking many!

This does not give a message of equality. It just says: ""As long as you act good in public, you can act as shitty as you like when nobody's watching.""

&#x200B;

2) ""Well boys, we did it! Homophobia is no more!""

Movies, art, etc are just entertainment. In my opinion they should not be a source of learning (Unless \*explicitly\* intended as such) and taking cues from it and use it in our culture in such things is bad idea in general.

Nobody is gonna watch two gays kissing in a movie and then be like: ""I am not a homophobe anymore! Thanks Netflix!!!"" And those who will, I do not want them on my side. I want people who come to such a conclusion by themselves by looking at actual evidence.

This is a bit of an overexaggeration but you get my point. To me this just makes a fake sense of accomplishment. Like puting a bandaid into a broken window and calling it the best thing since sliced bread. I hate this.

&#x200B;

3) ""You are a victim, and here's why. Also, here's a movie about a character you may or may not be relatable to you because we feel pity for you""

This is where the ""insulting"" part comes in. Treating me like an inferior who needs help. 

I do not need anyone's pity. I do not want people to walk around eggshels around me because I am bi or pander to me because of it. 

If you want to make a gay book so be it. But do not do it because you feel sorry about me due to the lack of representation. No need to feel sorry for me. 

You ain't contributing anything major to the LGBT anyways (Unless it's something \*explicitly\* educational, then the story completely changes). 

If you want to help, try your best to vote for politicans who will pass laws that benefit LGBT individuals. This is \*far\* more substantial.

I will say it again: Personally I hate being viewed as a victim. Even when I am. I am not a baby. I am an adult that can carry his own weight

Is wanting to be treated like a normal person an not a magical mysterious being too much to ask for?"

It's a tricky thing, as I certainly feel and know that Israel needed to respond militarily to the surprise militant attack on Oct. 7th.

You've also got the very heavy and serious issue that around 130 hostages were taken.

Urbane warfare and the problems that come with it are well-documented in history.

The main concern is the alleged casualties coming in around 30k. A horrific incident has taken place this morning at a humanitarian aid station. The news is slowly breaking at this moment.

That's just too many people. That's too many people to sweep into the category of the “fog of war.”

I have this sick feeling in my stomach that you can surely “win” on the battlefield. You can kill every single militant (probably not), get the hostages back and pop off a ceasefire… but, you can still “lose”.

I doubt in 30 years, history will look back at this and say it was good.

So, the question arises in this CMV post, what should have Israel done?

Well, it's certainly tricky and dire for the hostages. I honestly don't know.

At the same time, I do question cutting off power and food initially. I question the concept of bombing buildings, without much explanation beyond guessing these could be terrorist hubs.

As an internet moron and not a field general, I would have advocated for more patience and a long-term tactical war? Sure, there must be something better than a full invasion. We see the worries have come true.

First, dogs don't try to fit huge bags in the overhead bins. They're happy with just a toy to chew on. Simple and easy!  
Second, dogs are super chill during the flight. They don't kick the seat in front of them, argue about who gets the armrest, or do weird stuff in their seat. They just take a nice nap or look around happily, maybe hoping for a snack.  
Also, dogs don't clap when the plane lands. They know the pilot is just doing their job. And you won't see a dog asking for more drinks because they're upset by a crying baby.  
So, I say we should let dogs on planes more because they're just better passengers. They could even show us how to be cooler travelers. What do you think? Can you really argue with that?

157,2024-02-29,CMV: There's nothing wrong with sexualizing characters/celebrities in your private fantasies,u/Brilliant-Guest-4155,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b33mao/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_with_sexualizing/,changemyview,"Simply put, I don't see how having private sexual fantasies about fictional characters or famous celebrities is immoral. And I don't mean very tame and very clean fantasies in which you imagine yourself talking to them for a long while, getting to know them, getting their absolute consent, appreciating them for their mind more than their body, and then doing only the safest and most bare minimum of things with them. No. I'm talking about full-blown superficial porno fantasies.

I've seen the argument that if you sexualize or fetishize characters, particularly female ones, then it's a sign that you're clearly a misogynist who disrespects women and treats them like objects rather than people. But I've never had that experience, as a man whose best friends are all women and who is even married to a proud feminist. Not once have my outrageous sexual fantasies ever affected my real life relationships with women. Everyone I've ever closely known, including my own wife, assumed that I was *asexual* because I never talked about sex and never commented on women's looks. Even when I do find a real-life woman hot, I keep those thoughts to myself and never let it be known to her or anyone else.

That doesn't mean I approve of actual pigs, as in men who really do grope or cat-call women, or men who think women are supposed to be trapped in medieval gender-roles. I simply can't understand all those guys who think women *must* be submissive sex slaves to emotionally-challenged alpha-male wannabes, and who complain that society is going to shit because of women having more freedoms than before. I can only assume those guys are living in a sad and lonely world of their own making.

But with that stated, I don't see anything inherently wrong with sexualization, objectification, and other superficial things within the context of a purely immaterial fantasy, having no effect on your relationship with real women. I have such superficial, outrageous, highly sexually charged fantasies, but most people don't even suspect I'm sexual in real life. A few boomers have even accused me of being ""gay"" when I didn't join them in talking about women (yes, I hate it when people make assumptions about your sexual preferences in general.). My sexual fantasies are so divorced from my daily life that my female friends think I'm more attracted to my intellectual/creative hobbies than I am to women."

I say this now because I saw a few posts about this topic, which led me to think about the fact that women typically don’t involve the male chest during heterosexual sex/foreplay/etc., whereas the female chest is a big part of sexual acts. Why is that, then, if boobs and female nipples aren’t sexual? If they’re equivalent to men’s, shouldn’t we be giving guys’ pecs attention in bed too? Shouldn’t we be fondling and sucking their nipples, etc.?

As a woman, if you swear that your boobs are equivalent to men’s, you should relinquish the pleasure of having them involved in your sex life. Because they’re not sexual and deserve to be freed on those grounds, according to you. Simple as that.

Therapy (talk therapy, CBT, and DBT) was fairly helpful in interrupting negative thoughts spirals and regulating anxieties, but has done exactly nothing for depression or trauma. I know myself pretty well and I tend to intellectualize problems, so I have a very good handle on what I feel and why I feel it.

Any citizen, regardless of age, should be able to vote in both state and federal elections.  I’m absolutely willing to hear logical arguments to the contrary, but I can’t think of an internally consistent reason that an 18 yo can vote and a 17 yo old can’t, and then go down to 16, 15, etc.  Everyone has a stake in the future of our country trying to do everyone should have the same power in electing our government.  Some arguments you may want to make but shouldn’t:

1) “Kids aren’t intelligent/informed/mature enough to vote.”  Most kids today know much much more about our country and the world than most adults did 100, 150, 200 years ago.  Some kids today are smarter than many adults. They have access to more information than adults did 50 years ago.  But that isn’t the real argument; the real argument is we don’t base voting eligibility on intelligence or maturity. The dumbest adult in the country gets to vote (and rightly so).  If uninformed/stupid/immature people over 18 get to vote, people under 18 should get to vote as well. 

2) “Babies can’t read!  They can’t even lift a pen!  How can they vote?”  Many adults can’t read. Many adults can’t lift a pen. That’s why we have a system to help others vote.  Ability to lift a pen is not a qualification.

3) “But then adults will just tell their kids who to vote for!”  Yes, just as many adults tell other adults who to vote for. Just as many people will vote exactly how their spouse, pastor, bartender, caretaker, etc. tells them.  Formulating your own opinion is not a prerequisite for voting. 

4) “18 is when you have to register for selective service so it makes sense to have that be the voting age.”  There is no link between military service and voting.  People who are ineligible to serve also get to vote.  Adults who are too old to serve get to vote.  And we no longer even have selective service so it doesn’t even make internal sense. 

So hit me.  Tell me why a US citizen shouldn’t be allowed to vote based on age.  Change my mind. "
132,2024-02-29,CMV: Abortion should be legal and fine,u/imadethistocomment15,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b35xqj/cmv_abortion_should_be_legal_and_fine/,changemyview,"let me start off by saying that, yes, I'm pro-choice, but pro-life people seem to not understand half of what being pro-choice means and are mainly Christian (probably the reason why there's so many people who hate abortion or are pro-life), the reason I think abortion should be legal and available is because of many reasons, let's start off with the main ones. Let me, who the actual hell thinks it's alright for a rape victim to be forced to carry the child of someone who not only raped them, but traumatized them beyond comprehension, why should they have to carry the child of there rapist? Some may say, ""it's not the baby's fault!"" I'd argue that even if it's not the babies fault, the women shouldn't be forced to keep the child of her rapist, it's not only a constant reminder of what they went through but life three threating in some cases and it's also the fact that they didn't choose to have the child forced into them, why should they be forced to hold the child of there rapist, the person who ruined there life in many ways, why should the victim not only have to take the consequences of there rapists actions aka have a whole ass child from the very same person who traumatized them in multiple different ways, why should the victim be forced to go through the pain of labor and pregnancy pain for months on end and then go through hours of extreme pain just because of someone else's actions? Why should the victim have the change or make a life time long change that could ruin there life against there will and if they want to keep it, they can but I'm talking about those who were raped and don't want to ruin there life because of someone else. They shouldn't be forced to is what should be the answer of any sane human being.

second main reason; what about children (specifically teens or younger) who got raped, for them it could be even worse, a teens body isn't ready for that type of pain yet, it could also damage there internal organs and nor are teens financially, mentally, emotionally, nor physically ready for that responsibility, so why should a teen, be forced to potentially ruin her life in every way possible because of someone else's actions? Again, the answer for any sane and mentally well human being would be that the teen shouldn't have to unless they want to. This also goes for teens who weren't raped, there teens, hormones hit like a bitch, there not gonna be worrying about protection because when they have the chance to have sex with someone they like, there gonna take that chance, and teens also can't purchase condoms either which makes my point even stronger.

third main reason; What about incest? the whole reason why I say this is obvious, the child is the product of incest and would have a whole list of disorders and wouldn't live that long, the child would also, (if it lives) have a bad life in public and in school, people these days will sit there and shit on your for existing and point out all your insecurities and more, just to make you feel like shit, an incest baby would live one of the worst lives, not only having parents that are related and having a huge list of disorders and disabilities, but would be absolutely picked on and bullied or worse, people these days [do.Not.Care](https://do.Not.Care).

fourth main reason; what about women or men who poke holes in the condom? for females, that's basically rape and forcing the male to be forced to pay child support (because if you found out your partner did this, no way in hell any sane man would stay with her) and for a male, it's the same thing, it's basically rape and forced impregnation and she wouldn't know until it's to late, again, not her or his fault that there partner did this to them.

fifth main reason; what about the fact that it's her body, she's the one that's gonna have to be in pain while carrying and giving birth to the child, it's the women's body, not yours, your not the one carrying the child, she is, it should be her choice if she's ready for a child or not."

The idea that a president is completely immune from all prosecution of any act while in office is so antithetical to the constitution and the history of the law that it may as well be insanity. 

If the Trump legal team’s argument is correct, the sitting president could kill Trump and every one of his followers or supporters with no legal consequences. In effect, the POTUS would be a god king. 

The fact that the court granted this argument be heard, is terrifying, even if the most charitable view of why this court agreed to hear this idiotic argument, that they want to completely end the argument forever with a full ruling, they have effectively allowed Trump to get away with the crime he is accused of because the trial will be pushed out after the election now. 

Aside from this insane move by the court the perception of corruption of the justices themselves has grown to a point where any honest observer cannot conclude the court is not corrupted. Justices taking millions of dollars from people *whose cases the justices sat on afterwards* is the definition of conflict of interest. These justices then not only did not recuse themselves but hid the gifts from the public. There is no other logical conclusion than that these justices and the court as a whole is irredeemably corrupt. 

I believe we are one major crisis away from a total loss of the justice system’s credibility in the eyes of the population. That dosent just mean that people won’t like the court, but people will stopng to their rulings. This has already begun, with the Texas governor ignoring rulings about the southern boarder issue.

If that kind of thing continues political disputes between local governments and political parties will devolve into violence. If the law Carrie’s no credibility that’s the end game. 

I think if the legislative branch wishes to prevent this outcome (and it’s unlikely the bodies as a whole do) the entire Supreme Court must be impeached and replaced, as soon as possible. 

If the polarization in the branch won’t allow this, POTUS must expand the court by twice its size and the Senate must end the filibuster and install the judges he puts forth.

The way I see it, Zionists see decolonization as indigenous people having an inherent right to immigrate back to their land (with an implication that indigenous people absolutely can’t be colonizers) and establish a state in said land, which is why they often see non Zionists who claim they are for decolonization as hypocritical. 

The issue is not only are those things not fully compatible decolonization as a lot of people believe in it, but rather those things straight up are against decolonization. 

One thing is that colonization is about the methods you used. Sure Zionists can possibly trace their history back to the Levant, but ultimately the methods they used to return were depraved and monstrous, and essentially a more evil of what most colonial powers did. They accepted a massive colonial power’s blessing to move into the region and also stole land via so called “legal land purchase” knowing that they were entering communities that did not wish for them to be there, with the intent of stealing said locals’ resources and displacing them. This is colonizer behavior and is not made any better by being indigenous. Additionally, in a decolonized system, immigration should be done in a way that benefits all, not just the indigenous in a region.

Decolonization would more be accurately described as everyone in an area living equally and together in one region wherever possible. As a side note, this is why a lot of people believe the 1880-1948 Palestinians were heroic in their goals (not always their means). What Palestinians at the time wanted was essentially what decolonization is. Which is for the colonizer (and again, indigenous populations do not have an absolute exemption against being colonists) to not have special rights. Whether Palestinians today get too much credit for their ancestors’ humanistic ideas is its own question. 

Think about this. The confederacy tried to separate from the United States, and the US chose not to respect any “right to exist,” and it led to very positive humanitarian changes in the US. 

This alone debunks the idea that any country has the right to exist, be it Israel, Palestine, Jordan or whatever, since the whole point of decolonization is that the people who are oppressed by a state, whether they are inside or outside said state’s borders, ought to be afforded some  legal way to either seriously alter or dissolve the country they are in in such a way that the new government provides justice for all and oppresses nobody. 

Also, decolonization should not be associated with said drastic measures being necessary, just not inherently immoral. For example, in Minnesota, natives already have a full right of return there, but the flag had praises of expelling Natives. They successfully approved a flag design that doesn’t do that, and such a thing is a great example of decolonization.

While I don’t fully agree with decolonization, decolonization is nothing more than having all people in a region side by side as equals. 

One downside of decolonization is that it doesn’t have an answer for what happens when a group wants to not be with others under one nation. We have the confederacy where the US just forced itself upon the confederates but not too much more examples of a nation straight
just conquering another nation with the conquered just accepting it. The answer may be that we just need to get over our American or Canadian disgust that we innately have and just simply accept that in a lot of the world people do divide themselves by ethnicity and will continue to do so.

Another downside is that most decolonization involved someone leaving with no intent to come back, and there’s no option for when the colonists don’t want to leave. For instance, white people left the Congo on their own will. If they wanted to stay and Congo has tried to expel them before or just after being a sovereign nation, Belgium would’ve probably destroyed them with fury and possibly have occupied them to this day. This matters because nobody in the Levant is willing to leave."

[Link to the Catholic Definition and Requirements of Marriage](https://www.catholicweddinghelp.com/questions/rules-requirements.htm)

Please note, this objection only applies to Catholics who believe that Catholicism is correct and that Natural Family Planning is a valid means of controlling pregnancy.  Non-Catholics (Christians or otherwise) as well as those Catholics that think Natural Family Planning is invalid?  All good.

Summary:

In Catholicism, Marriage is between a man and a woman and must be open to having children.  You can be infertile, you can be too old and be unable, but you have to be open to it.  You can have sex for whatever reason you like, any time you like, but it has to be an act open to having children (which means it has to end with PiV without pulling-out/condom/BC/etc).

Natural Family Planning is a Catholic approved means of controlling and spacing births.  Notably it is supposed to be used only in ""serious"" or ""grave"" circumstances.  That is generally up to the couple to decide, though usually a Priest or Pre-Marital Counselor will talk with them about those circumstances.      It's not about preventing all Pregnancy, it's about health of the mother and spacing as circumstances need it.

My objection is this:

If at the very moment you say ""I Do"" you intend to delay pregnancy... you shouldn't be allowed to Marry in Catholicism.

That isn't to say that couple should break up, or that Marriage shouldn't eventually happen, but that Marriage should be delayed until NFP would not be needed at that moment.  Having serious or grave reasons to not have kids is an impediment to a valid Catholic Marriage.

In this context, claiming the world is not collapsing seems naive. The signs of our downfall are clear, yet there seems to be little will to address them head-on. Change my view.

I'm open to arguments that might show a different perspective or solutions that could convince me we're not as doomed as it seems."

Also worth noting, I'm talking as a matter of principle, and not looking for reasons why it would be too difficult to accomplish.  In other words, I'm looking for reasons why we shouldn't do it, not ones why we can't do it. "

In a way, it is a mind and body dissonance. Being transgender is largely related to have a mind and body dissonance, they don't believe themselves to be in the right body and try to outwardly show others that which they feel internally, often to a stereotype degree. I see far too many parallels with the logic behind these two lines of thought and I find it interesting that a large majority of the lgbt community doesn't like or accept transracial as an idea, as if being transgender doesn't follow similar lines of logic. To play devil's advocate: if we are to accept one we are to accept all. 


TLDR: Explain why one is largely seen as acceptable by the lgbt community and one is seem as unacceptable given the above explanation. Change my view on transgender and transracial not being different on a logic level. "

As shown by the absolute havoc and terror in Athiest movements in the 20th century have wrought, this is morally correct. From Pol Pot and Mao to Lenin and Stalin. The further people stray from religiousity the more acts of absurd violence you get.

In reality religion is the only way to properly unite a people, have proper social norms, and doing this all without centralized government. In absence of religiousity, people inject some sort of crippled moral basis in its stead, leading to mass societal ails through what I would personally argue is demonic possession."
1,2024-02-29,CMV: The Alex Jones civil judgement is absurdly over the top,u/Ok_Spell1407,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3binm/cmv_the_alex_jones_civil_judgement_is_absurdly/,changemyview,"For those of you living under a rock, Alex Jones was on trial multiple times for defamation for his Sandy Hook conspiracy theories. The victims suffered harassment and distress because of these conspiracy theories, something terrible to suffer for already-grieving families. The verdicts against him total around one billion dollars, most of that being punitive damages. What he owes is several times more than his net worth, so he clearly will never be able to pay the amount back in full. 

Make no mistake, Alex Jones is a POS who should be forced to compensate the families of Sandy Hook victims for his defamation. However, I take issue with the amount he owes. Punitive damages exist in the U.S. (but not most other countries) because sometimes a severe financial loss serves as a deterrent against similar behavior in the future. For example, McDonalds can easily afford to pay out a $50,000 claim every so often and leave their hot coffee intact. However, the infamous thirty something million dollar verdict against them (mostly composed of punitive damages) made enough of a dent in their profits that McDonalds couldn't simply ignore the problem and continue to pay out lawsuits by each person injured. Likewise, say a huge grocery chain decides ""we're done carding minors, the new alcohol sales to minors will more than make up for the occasional lawsuit we'll have to pay out"", punitive damages make it so that any verdict against them will be impactful enough to change their behavior. 

Punitive damages, contrary to what their name suggests, are NOT a vengeful punishment for past conduct. Rather, they're simply meant to protect the general public from suffering damages that a wealthy individual or corporation can ""afford"" to be sued for. This is where my problem with the Alex Jones verdict lays. There is not a doubt in my mind that the juries in all of these cases wanted vengeance against Alex Jones for the evil rhetoric he spewed. But that is not the point of punitive damages. Punitive damages against Jones should only have been in the amount necessary to reasonably ensure he would not spew such rhetoric again. I think losing 1/3 to half your life savings would be more than enough to make you not even think about doing something like that again. Jones owes multiple times more than he has. 

What these runaway punitive damage awards do is embolden people like Jones in their victim mentality. Instead of being deterred from spewing conspiracy theories in the future, Jones now is in debt more than he'll ever be able to pay back, and has nothing to lose. Another $1 billion verdict in the future would do nothing to him. His supporters also see this verdict as validation that our legal system is illegitimate and corrupt. 

Making a mockery of our legal system is exactly what people like Alex Jones want. By ridiculously high and impractical judgements against him, we're proving his point. Let's not let feelings get in the way of how our legal system is meant to work. Remove emotions from the equation and ask two questions. How much in damage did Alex Jones cause the victims' families? How much more on top of this would be sufficient to ensure him and others are deterred from repeating dangerous conspiracy theories? "

Every year, every holiday companies buy billions in merchandise for seasonal items. So much that they have no way of selling it all so most of it ends up in the trash. Especially with how cheaply made everything is, even if they sell it itll usually end up in the trash. We the people are told to be greener and do our part in combatting global warming when it feels like the average person is a drop in the ocean compared to these massive companies. Just think about 1 single item Walmart orders for valentines day, they are probably gonna have about 500(if it is a small item) per store times the 10,000 stores that exist gives you 5 million of a small plastic knick knack of some kind made of plastic. Times that by the 100 or so other small items they have for the rest of the valentines decorations and your left with so much shit. So much shit that was produced in foreign countries with very lax emission and pollution regulations and you're just destroying Earth for a $1.99 table cloth that may or may not end up in the trash.

Is there not some regulations to this shit? I gave very random numbers but i've worked in grocery stores before and the amount of waste you see is unimaginable. Whether it be perishable or nonperishable goods you can just look at a single case of an item and think, ""how many gas powered vehicles and machines were use in the creation of this product"" Then those same products will just go unsold. You see all these non perishable goods just get thrown in dumpsters after the holiday is over and not donated to anything, only to end up in a landfill where they will sit for the next 2 million years. Nothing is done about it though, how have we become so wasteful as a society? How is the government failing so thoroughly in putting limits to what these companies can produce and do. Its pathetic, they need to start fining the shit out of these companies. WE DO NOT NEED A DIFFERENT VARIATION OF THE SMALLEST AND MOST SIMPLE DECORATION. "

31,2024-02-29,CMV: Intersectionalism has failed to appreciate degrees of suffering.,u/RabbitsTale,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3elj7/cmv_intersectionalism_has_failed_to_appreciate/,changemyview,"So, I may just be ignorant here, but intersectional justice is meant to try to address all types of discrimination simultaneously so that systems of oppression aren't able to reinforce each other. Many of these categories are (relatively) binary: womanhood, blackness, immigrant-status (or perceived immigrant status), queerness, etc... but there are two categories of exclusion and discrimination where there is a wide range of levels of impact, namely, disability and economic status. When you look at something like ASD, where a person might suffer no outright disabilities all the way to persons who cannot speak, control their body movements, or tolerate the sensations present in normal public spaces. If we look at two persons on the opposite ends of the spectrum, and we have at one end a woman who is lightly impacted/minimally impacted and on the other a man who is severely impacted, it's clear (to me) that the onus of need (for advocacy, understanding, outreach, etc...) rests with the person severely impacted, but, in public discourse anyway, the female + disabled generates more vocal and immediate support, because the oppressed groups she's part of are actual less persecuted, and therfore more able to advocate for themselves, going so far as to paint the female experience of autism as intrinsically worse than the male experience, which, despite problems with medical equity, and sexism/patriarchy and general, just can't begin to bridge the gap between the least and most impacted. To take this even further, if a person in a privileged group also belongs to an oppressed group, even when the extremity of their disability/poverty/etc... actual makes them in more immediate need of help and recognition, their lack of multiple oppressed identities tends to push their suffering behind people who live with less suffering but who can place themselves within multiple oppressed groups. This is obviously only a problem within left/progressive spaces, but I legitimately believe those spaces are ignoring the worst disability and poverty in favor of lifting up the relatively priviledged but technically more marginalized."

The only possibly wrong thing is the killing and torturing of animals.,u/Drymdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b3fgws/cmv_there_is_nothing_wrong_about_eating_animal/,changemyview,"I find arguments against the killing of animals for food, especially in cruel factory-farm settings, to be persuasive. Animals have conscious experiences just like us, they are sentient, they feel pain, etc., and so killing/torturing/inflicting pain on them is morally similar to doing the same to a human.

But: **once the animal has been killed by someone else,** what is wrong with eating the meat? Meat isn't alive, has no conscious experience, doesn't feel pain, etc., and you didn't commit the act of killing the animal, so the act itself of eating the meat seems fine. 

**Possible counterargument:** perhaps it could be argued that eating animal meat encourages industries that kill/torture animals. However, I am not convinced (yet) that this is a great argument. The effect of my individual actions on encouraging the [$1.6 trillion](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/meat-products-market#:~:text=The%20global%20meat%20products%20market,4.6%25%20from%202024%20to%202033) meat market is surely so minuscule that it's morally irrelevant."
