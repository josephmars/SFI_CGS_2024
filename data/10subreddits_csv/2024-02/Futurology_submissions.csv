I tag. it gives me the initial warning sign that I violated the terms. of course the video has been deleted from everything on the page and the recipient has not made and will not make a report. how does this sign go away from the original one? i don't mind not getting the payment that was $3 as long as i get rid of it.

At some point it probably will gain some type of conciousness, at whatever degree. I was wondering if AI will develop some kind of hierachy between the AIs or even a societal structure. At the beginning they probably will just learn the structures and ideas of humans, but there is a high chance that the AIs could develop totally different ideas. What type of hierachys, structures or ideas could it be?"

Neurolink won't hack your brain. Here's why.

Neurolink is seemingly a output device, meant for receiving and outputting data. In the neurolinks case, it's collecting brainwaves and converting it into information, and sending it to device of choice. I know I'm contradicting myself in saying the neurolink isn't inputting things but it isn't inputting it into your brain, it's not meant to input things into brain. (correct me if I'm wrong) I don't think Elon knows how to do that, or if he doesn't want to get into the consciousness problem. 

And the hacking bullshit. If it was ""hacked""  then the only thing being affected is the object your trying to control with the neurolink, due to the fact that its an output device; and Elon probably thought of a fix to it.

Realistically the only few things I can think of being dangerous is like if it short-circuited or something inside your head, or if you get a concussion and it does weird shit to your brain.

But overall, Neurolink wont hurt you and if it did then it's Elons fault.

Pardon me, for the grammar mistakes I might have had."

Unless you are a denier, 2 degrees of warming is defintely baked in. 

Despite this, I'm still hopeful. The reason is most adults are educated enough to know when shit hits the fan, procreation takes a backseat. We have shown this attitude time and again in economic crisis and specifically in much larger destruction forces like famine. Today we are more risk averse because....individualism of industrialized society has triumphed collectivism of agricultural ones.

For those who don't know, as of writing this, India and China has a combined fertility rate of 1.5 ( China : 1.06 ; India  : 1.9) 
That's lower than the US and only little bit higher than EU. Since both of the countries are monumental in terms of world population, together amounting to 36%, it's likely the global fertility rate is down to 2.1. UN doesn't update their charts soon enough. 

No surprises there. It will keep getting lower. I have come to think people having less kids will save us from increasing energy costs and food crop failures. Call me funny and idiot. But not having kids will save everyone!

If we really end up in a 2 degree warmer world, I could see people more terrified and try saving up for themselves instead of a child."

I'm aware this might sound idealistic and amateur, so, it’d be great, if you point out for me some major ethical and other issues in the scheme below.

Component one: spiral dynamics.
So, you might have heard about different stages of human (while also societal) development - from egoistic through compliant through entrepreneurial and individualistic to ecologically aware and - finally - holistic. What if social media algorithms could take it into account and bring to people the exact activities and experiences they need in order to grow up, to go through their existential challenge at the time? 

Component two: social status/rating/credit on blockchain.
Totally an old tale, but I don't know other alternatives to capitalism. What if in the new digital environment projects could be founded only by people with enough competence and previous record? Projects themselves could vary: a child game, an educational course, a business company, a social initiative, but they shall be moderated/approved by people with at least holistic worldview.

Component three: data economy.
What if participating in projects pays you money, depending on the uniqueness of the data you produce (within some law-proof safe range)?

Component four: VR and AR.
AR/VR solutions shall become a big market with a huge variety of options, so you could easily integrate your project with some simple AR chat or full-fledged VR - whatever is more suitable for the task.

Actually, this sounds more like environment ideas than just social media: there are education and jobs and money and politics. But who can say that whatever happens in social media today is just for entertainment and sharing opinions?

Maybe you want to suggest another useful component? What's your vision for the topic? "

I've heard, ""People will be free to follow their passions,"" followed by something about music and art as the generally believed future state of humanity by AI utopists. 

I have a hard time believing that massive numbers of people without anything to do bodes well for society. Not everyone can paint or sing all day, and not everyone wants to. Even with complaints, the rat race and unfairness, people probably do better with mostly structured days and the sense of accomplishment that comes after completing tasks (like work). 

People in the US now spend the majority of their days pursuing entertainment. There are always outliers, but for the most part, even poor people spend hours every day streaming shows or scrolling through social media, and we probably are living through the most dissatisfied generation in history. 

So, what happens in a scenario where people have nothing that they have to do? What will all those idle hands get into?"

You know, things like cool applications of AI in medicine, the automobile industry, self-governing robots, and maybe even philosophy and sociology. The questions of deeper meaning and value enhanced by the power of AI.

Here are my favorites:

[Nuro AI](https://www.nuro.ai) | This project uses advanced robotics and AI to create self-governing vehicles that are currently used only for transporting cargo, but could get more commercial use in the future as well. From what I understood, their vehicles don't even have space for human drivers, maximizing the amount of cargo they can carry from A to B. A pretty cool concept, and in my opinion could be instrumental in optimizing trade on land in the future.

[Personal AI](https://www.personal.ai) | Imagine creating your own virtual clone by feeding AI with memories and experiences from your life. This AI can get so advanced that, at a certain point, it becomes able to relatively accurately mimic the owner's writing style and tone of voice making it the best possible personal assistant... or a virtual twin? This tool has found practical use in fields such as business and management because of its potential to be nearly infinitely customized as a personal assistant, and people have also used it for ""re-aliving"" important people from their lives who passed away. If I recall correctly, the entire project was kickstarted because the founder wanted to keep the spirit of his mentor with him after the mentor's passing away.

[nate AI](https://www.nate.tech) | This is basically an AI-powered that automatizes and streamlines checkout and shipping functions. Users own their shopping data meaning it won't be bought and used for marketing purposes by big companies, which is another cool feature if you shop frequently and don't want to get bombarded by ads all the time. The most interesting feature, however, is that nate AI allows users to pay in four installments which can be quite beneficial for some people.

[Owkin AI](https://www.owkin.com) | Before I move to explain what Owkin AI is, I just want to say how much I appreciate the usage of AI in medicine, especially when it concerns questions as important as cancer treatment. It's truly a beautiful thing to witness unveiling in front of our own eyes, and hopefully, this entire subgenre of AI will expand even more in the future. Owkin AI specializes in developing AI-driven treatments for unmet medical needs particularly in the field of cancer research. They utilize AI technology to identify new drugs, build diagnostic tools, and accelerate clinical trials. In short, they try to find the best cancer treatment for every patient, based on the patient's unique needs."

It causes some radial pain but not quite enough to require opiates. It is mercifully intermittent. But whether I’m pain or not, the discs are wearing and the spinal cord has suffered a small amount of narrowing. 

So far the only real offer of treatment in the U.K. is ACDF (anterior disc and fusion). No robot surgery yet available. The operation seems very hit and miss, with a lot of patients ending up in worse pain. 

Can someone give me some hope that in the next ten years there might be some kind of real regeneration treatment or something that avoids major spinal surgery. Soo far everything looks like “stem cell magic” or “AI will be god” wishful thinking.

Just to be clear, by final frontier, we mean the last to be explored, understood, settled, and developed. The probability that humanity or the Earth could make it to the point that either of these could possibly be the final frontier was taken into account (i.e., Earth's survival, scientific advancements, etc.), and the space side obviously requires that we make it out of the solar system (colonizing Mars doesn't count).

Very good points made on both sides. I was firmly on the space side of things, until the ocean side made some REALLY good points. One amongst many was the fact that all of the assumptions that the space side were banking on (e.g., the development of FTL travel) were potentially impossible, while all of the assumptions that the ocean side were banking on (e.g., humanity finding a solution to the solidification of Earth's core and the Sun dying) were much more likely. Since we're all stubborn scientists, things got heated and spiraled a bit lol. Anyway, now I'm on the fence, while the ocean side and the rest of the space side remain firmly in their own lanes. So I thought we'd turn it over to you guys and see what y'all think.

So, what is humanity's final frontier? Space or the Sea?"

Is it worth investing now?",u/UnityGreatAgain,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1ahsapj/what_changes_can_quantum_information_quantum/,Futurology,"I am currently a doctoral student in the field of robotics. My research direction is mainly robot planning for manufacturing. I am very interested in new things, so I read a lot about quantum information.  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Quantum computing：  
  
1.From a theoretical perspective  
  
The set of problems that can be solved by classical algorithms within a reasonable time is called P, and the set of problems that can be verified is called NP. The set of problems that quantum algorithms can solve is called BQP. At present, P belongs to NP, P belongs to BQP, and BQP is different from NP.  
  
Here comes the problem. People seem to have not found any other problems that belong to BQP but not P and have meaning in real life, except for prime number decomposition problems. There are only three quantum algorithms that are actually useful: Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, and some hybrids of the two such as the HHL algorithm.  
  
In other words, from a theoretical level, the application of quantum computing is not particularly large. It can be used to break RSA communication encryption, but does little to improve actual productivity.  
  
2.From an engineering application perspective  
  
Although P belongs to BQP, quantum computers will not bring any speedup when executing classical algorithms. A traditional computer has more than 1 billion transistors and computing frequency of 3GHz. Assuming that a quantum computer can achieve 10 million Qubits in the next 20 years and has a computing frequency of 100MHz, it cannot be compared to my iphone 14 in executing classical algorithms.  
  
In the case of a quantum computer executing a quantum algorithm, Grover is a search algorithm that, under various assumptions and premises, can search a ""quantum"" database of size n in O(sqrt(n)) time. This acceleration does not speed up an exponential to a polynomial, so its application is limited. To run the Shor algorithm to crack RSA encryption, if you want to crack 2048-bit RSA, the qubits required are generally believed to be in the order of millions to tens of millions. This does not take into account the fidelity of quantum logic gates with such a large number of qubits. It is difficult to maintain. At present, the quantum computers that people can build are only on the order of a hundred, and there is a gap of several orders of magnitude.Wanting to prepare and control millions of qubits is similar to creating a ""Schrödinger's cat"" (ie, a macroscopic quantum state). There is various evidence that such quantum states are unstable.  
  
So my question is what can quantum computers bring to manufacturing? From theory to engineering applications, I didn't find anything particularly good.  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Quantum sensing:（Robots want better sensors）  
  
1.In 2016, it was said that quantum radar can effectively detect stealth fighters. But I saw the research conclusion of MIT Lincoln Laboratory on Quantum Illumination Radar Feasibility:  
  
https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD1132052  
  
【Quantum radar does not have the potential for long range standoff sensing (>10 km) at radio frequencies (<100 GHz).  
  
Quantum radar with 100 km range is not feasible:  
  
– RF band operation requires 3 year integration time.  
  
– Optical C-Band sensing possible (100 ms integration), but requires an unnaturally high background to achieve advantage over similar classical system.】  
  
2.For the rest of quantum sensing, what I found is more about measuring electric fields, measuring magnetic fields, and measuring gravitational fields. I don't know if Rydberg atoms can achieve radio direction finding. However, it seems that the current applications are very limited in all aspects, not to mention the use of robots and what to use these sensors for.  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Quantum communication:  
  
Quantum communications are more technically mature. Compared with traditional communication methods, it cannot be eavesdropped (or any eavesdropping will definitely be detected). But the problem is that the weakest link in information transmission security has never been the link that quantum communication improves. Therefore, the marginal value of this technology to communication security is minimal.  
  
NSA does not recommend the usage of quantum key distribution and quantum cryptography for securing the transmission of data in National Security Systems (NSS) unless the limitations below are overcome.  
  
https://www.nsa.gov/Cybersecurity/Quantum-Key-Distribution-QKD-and-Quantum-Cryptography-QC/  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
I saw some papers studying quantum approximate optimization and using quantum annealing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. For example, the military hopes to use quantum optimization to calculate the trajectory of UAV/unmanned vehicle formations. The factory hopes to use quantum optimization algorithms to plan the trajectory of the robotic manipulators.  
  
However, quantum annealing can ""always"" obtain a global optimal solution faster than classical annealing. So far, there is no proof. Not only is there no general proof, there are also very few known examples. They are generally very artificial objective functions to take advantage of the characteristics of quantum tunneling. In fact, for any type of annealing algorithm, there is no theoretical guarantee that the global optimal solution can be obtained for general problems. In actual use, annealing algorithms are rarely used on a large scale.  
  
So, does anyone know of any better uses for quantum simulation or quantum approximate optimization in the manufacturing/robotics ?  
  
Welcome to criticize and correct my various views on quantum information science (quantum computing, quantum sensing, quantum communication) above. I will be very grateful for your professional replies and guidance."

&#x200B;

Here were some of my findings and takeaways i made after reading through Woodside's, ""Capital Allocation Framework"" and ""Decarbonsiation Strategy"". 

It's strategically vague, both to avoid future lawsuits and to alleviate investor doubts. 

**Observation 1:** Emphasis on Natural Gas for the energy transition  
Woodside is banking on natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal.  
**Takeaway 1:**  
Natural gas is indeed cleaner than coal, but **it’s still a fossil fuel**. It’s like choosing the lesser of two evils, two of which are shit, especially when actual renewables are growing exponentially, gas is not a leap towards a sustainable future as it promotes the continuation of sale of fossil fuels with no clear end point.

  
**Observation 2:** Vague Investments in New Energy  
Woodside talks about investing in new energy products and lower carbon services, but the details are vague.  
**Takeaway 2:**  
It’s like they’re trying to paint a greener picture without showing their true colors. They avoid transparency to which limits actual assessment of their commitment to any effective transition.  


**Observation 3:** Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS)  
Woodside acknowledges the role of CCUS in mitigating emissions.  
**Takeaway 3:**  
Relying on CCUS feels like a band-aid solution. It’s not a magic bullet and shouldn’t be used as an excuse to continue fossil fuel extraction.  However, it could be useful to lower existing elevated CO2 concentration in the atmosphere

**Observation 4:** Physical Risks of Climate Change  
Woodside plans to design facilities to withstand extreme weather and changing climate conditions.  
**Takeaway 4:**  
This seems more like a reactive approach rather than a proactive one. It’s like they’re preparing for the storm instead of trying to prevent it."

In the 20th century people witnessed truly remarkable events in human history such as the moon landings, atomic energy and the beginning of computers and thus imagined a future world where those technologies would greatly improve their lives, despite also witnessing some of the worst moments of human history, such as both world wars. To me though those views started to change around the early 2010s. So what events and shifts in the social mindset contributed to people changing their views?"

There was another thread on this recently that devolved into nonsense and people crowing ""The theseus!"" over and over again. But I have a simple and (I believe) elegant solution for the uploading of consciousness. 

There is a well-documented phenomenon where, at the time of death, a human body puts out a brain wave (think alpha, beta, theta) that is unique and not observable during any other point in life. Furthermore, the Thermodynamic law of conservation states that energy can never be destroyed, only transferred. Therefore, this brainwave is a unique electrical impulse.

When your body biologically begins to die, you are then hooked into a machine that has all of your key engrams and memory uploads waiting.

*One could even imagine a portable collection unit that is collecting memories in real time and acts as a collection unit for this final brainwave.*

At that point the electrical information transmitted by this unique brainwave is not only recorded, but the electrical impulse is collected. 
The absorption of this key electrical energy serves as a ""keystone"" if you will, because it essentially *activates* all other stored data and quite literally is the final piece of the puzzle in regards to your consciousness being transferred into your new construct. Think of it like a jump start to a dead battery where the battery is the inert collection of all your other stored data. It could even be the spark that starts the engine of a new construct if you go for a physical body.

*QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER:*

1. How would one ever hope to prove their consciousness has, in fact, been transferred and they arent just a very sophisticated AI that is mimicking the person

2. (For the more metaphysical out there) Do you think that your consciousness might go insane? My theory is that your soul/consciousness are linked and that it (you) would realize your body had died and that there was a natural progression that had been interrupted. Even without knowing WHAT was supposed to come next, do you think you might go insane from feeling as if you had been trapped/not allowed your natural progression?"

I'm indifferent about any level of automation in terms of my career, simply in terms I'm for anything better and more efficient.

From a historical perspective, one of the biggest practical changes in society was electrification and mechanization of farms' productivity.  There are plenty of statistics on this... agricultural jobs went from 20% to less than 3% of job in about two decades in the US 1900 up to around 1950.

I'm posting because I wonder if a similar advance can happen via transport.  I also wonder if the knowledge of how to do this is massively underrated.  Farmers even with technology have an intimate understanding of the what and how products are produced.  I have a feeling something similar is happening with AI and transport but I don't see it.

For some reason I think there is a disconnect with transport and technology (self-driving).  In light of previous history I welcome the change but I'm unconvenienced it will *happen*, not that it will change.

TL;DR millions of jobs and billions of dollars could be freed up in transport similar to agricultural production, but I don't see it happening.  Is the time frame for this sort of paradigm shift for the work force going to change?  At what point and to what degree?  I have doubts."

Until now only racing games are kinda realistic but other games still need more improvement. What's the biggest obstacle?

I believe around 2030 possibly we will reach to this level that videogames will be photorealistic completely. If the new consoles are going to be around 100 teraflops it's possible. 
My optimistic prediction is in 2030 
And my pessimistic prediction is in 2035.
I will be so surprised if after 2035 videogames will look like today and not realistic completely and in terms if graphics and in terms of physics."

Obviously this person would know he is different and that he is a man.

I was reading about Aromatase Excess Syndrome and it seens that most men with the genetic condition accept the way they are and embrace their manboobs but in my example such artifitial femboy would be genetically be programmed to have a ""feminine"" personality so would his brain need modifications to naturally accept his feminine looks ?"

The thing is, everyone knows and agrees that all the downsides of VR headsets come from their bulk size and weight, how uncomfortable it feels and how dumb it looks being that big and all that. Also, having to fit all of the hardware in such a device forces a sacrifice in battery size along with many other compromises in favor of weight and fit. So my question is: why not have all the vital hardware in a separate piece of equipment that may go in your pocket or strapped like a fanny pack and just stream video and audio to the face piece (in this case, a much smaller one)? This is a genuine question because to me it sounds like such an obvious solution but the tech giants are not doing this. Why?? Also, the streaming I mentioned doesn't even need to be wireless, we all were pretty used to wired headphones for a long time, I'm sure people wouldn't mind it for a quality VR now. Also.. it's not like we aren't already carrying a powerful processor with a powerful-ish battery in our pockets already. I mean, c'mon. The VR could be so much lighter, thinner, more comfortable and better looking overall, why not do this? Enlighten me, hivemind."

[This](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0291791) study suggests 17.7% of livestock animals are used to feed dogs in the United States; these are actual animals, not just biproducts like, ""chicken biproduct meal"". The estimate is 6% globally, mostly due to the lower ratio of companion dogs to humans. Switching our companion dogs to a properly fortified plant-based diet could save 6 billion animals (many more including aquatic animals), free up land larger than Mexico, save fresh water greater than all renewable fresh water in Denmark, reduce greenhouse gases by greater than the UK's total emissions, and save enough food to feed the entire European Union, every year. If we get 50% of the way, we'll get 50% of these large benefits.
2. Like humans, dogs are omnivores, and can eat a variety of foods to survive. Here are example sources to support this: [1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/an-experimental-meatfree-diet-maintained-haematological-characteristics-in-sprintracing-sled-dogs/49358B7C6F05A5AC042D01E322EB3A0C), [2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258044), [3](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.30.493980v2.abstract), [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528822001345), [5](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265662), [6](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-7381/10/1/52), [7](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.18.525405v1.abstract), and [other studies](https://www.reddit.com/r/veganpets/wiki/faq/#wiki_scientific_literature_review_.28research.29). Properly fortified plant-based dog foods, such as [V-dog](https://v-dog.com/), [Wild Earth](https://wildearth.com/), or [Evolution](https://petfoodshop.com/), are accredited with the [AAFCO](https://www.aafco.org/) that verifies nutritional completeness. If you believe your dogs will still miss out on some nutrients, mix 50% plant-based with 50% meat-based foods so they still get what you're concerned about.
3. Based on the first study mentioned, dogs eat an average of 1,351 kcal/day, which is about half of what the average human eats. Dog food is also slightly higher in animal product % than human foods, on average. If you have multiple dogs and feed them meat-based food, there is a large sustainability potential by switching them to 50% plant-based.  
  
I believe mixing 50% plant-based with 50% meat-based dog food is a great option for those who want to reduce their household's impact while also easing their concerns around nutrition."

Recently two of my children (4 and 9 y/o) were diagnosed with Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM). Our pediatric cardiologist has ordered genetic testing for the entire family, which did indicate a related genetic mutation of ""unknown significance."" Genetic testing for my wife and I is currently processing and TBD, but our children's cardiologist feels pretty certain it is related to the genetic mutation.

So, that is the background that brings me here, but the question that brings me here is on the prospective treatment of genetically inherited heart related diseases. I have done a little research myself and there does appear to be studies / early testing on gene therapy treatments for DCM, but I am curious on this communities thoughts on it as well. How far along are we in this area of science? Thoughts on possible future treatments?

Now i am in usa on F1 visa and just changed my major from HEALTH IT to CYBERSEC AAS( ASSOCIATE DEGREE)

CUTTING all bu**sh* i know you guys have the wisdom of telling no degree no job or no degree and millionaire .

My question is what are the guided pathways for a student like me with bachloer in business field and just a little spark from Childhood about robotics and softwares. 

i dont have much money to be frank i just earn little bit here and there and spend on the college fee and little time for self study.

I am not good with terminologies but i am keen to learn more about it while studying so i can focus on certs.

1. There are so called (IT COMPANIES) WHO HIRE you before even degree and they provide you practical trainings - whats that scam??

2. I want to learn from scratch 
though i can code  STONE PAPER SCISSORS from python, but i want to learn so i can later on work with ROBOTICS one day.

3. My main motivation is not degree or JOB , i just want to feel cool about myself and learn probably as MUCH AS I CAN for next few ywars i i am in STATES  

Ps.- if i see someone making R1 rabbit then atleast i have enough knowledge or resources to atleast create a team in future.

Thankyou"

If we see the decline of birth rates as detrimental to society, and the public is not willing to produce children, will the government then step in to produce children of the state?

With genetic modification and artificial wombs, this certainly seems plausible.

Soon, it could be easy to genetically modify a source genome so much that they are no longer considered the DNA of a specific individual. Does this mean the government can start producing humans with no legal ties to any pre-existing citizens? 

Traditionally, legal guardians are given the power to decide medical treatment for their children, courses of education, vaccination status etc. With the government as the legal guardians, these hypothetical children would have 100% compliance with however the government wants to raise, educate, and train them.

As a bonus of not being biologically tied to any parents, there would be no legal entity to claim ownership of these children.

What roles will these ""children of the State"" be used for? What rights do they have? It's an intriguing concept that I haven't seen discussed much."

When it comes to tv, music, and movies, it can certainly feel like a sea of sameness these days, especially given the vast amount of remakes on our screens, an increasing popularity of reruns, endless franchises, and just the sheer amount of content available at our fingers.  


One could argue that in a peak-Netflix era, entertainment has gotten... boring.  


As we think about where the industry will go next - does 'newness' play a part or will viewers seek comfort in the expected story-arcs and character plots popularized to date?  


How might the acceleration of AI generate greater novelty and boundary pushing for consumers who believe they have ""seen it all""?

I didn't really understand it all that well until I watched this video: https://youtu.be/BV9Xy6L_rlM

Well, I can see that type of tech getting better, faster, and importantly; smaller.
Now imagine the spacial computing space being the size of a city, or the world. 
And then imagine building it into occular implants that hook up to a neurallink network that connects everyone. 

Suddenly, you basically have ""holograms"". 
Stationary, spacially computed, city or world wide AR ""holograms"" that everyone can see. Now you can actually do those giant skyscraper sized advertising like in Blade Runner, or Altered Carbon, or Cyberpunk.

- Imagine the sky lit up with purely AR plane flight lanes and landing lanes. 

- Imagine adverts the size of skyscrapers hovering in the sky. 

- Imagine a private movie theater screen you could join or leave the size of a city that thousands of people could watch together. 

- Imagine traffic lights and stop signs being purely AR holograms, and roads and streets being ultra minimalist black streaks through the city, with only the AR system giving them any purpose. 

The list goes on. I love this idea that the way we finally get ""holograms"" is that they're built into our head, and into our eyes. If the technology gets so good, and so small, that it's simply a cybernetic implant and doesn't need glasses, and absolutely everyone has them, and can see the AR, then what's the difference to holograms? Reality becomes what we program it to look like to our eyes..."

Right wing parties like Afd are getting pretty popular in Germany due to migration issues but there’s this catch 22, without migration, Germany’s population will be already declined to around 78 million, and they’ve ran out of Eastern European people (who happen to be their primary target region for migration) so now they’re actively looking to bring in people from out of the EU, especially south and south East Asians and Latin Americans, but unfortunately/or fortunately for Germany, not much people from these regions want to move to Germany, when they can migrate to an English speaking country instead. 

Japan has it the worst but they’re still managing somehow without migration. 

South Korea will blow Japan out of the water in next 10-15 years when the effects of 0.7 TFR will start to feel. And just like Japan, I don’t think they’re gonna do migration either  The issue is not much people want to move to these countries anyways. 

There will be no shortage of people who’re willing to migrate to Britain because it’s an English speaking country and as such Britain will have no trouble attracting people should it need to but that cannot be said about rest of continental Europe tho.

In their struggle to survive this, once unfathomable crisis, humans decide to do the only thing they can to have at least a chance at surviving. Kill AI for good.  
  
Luckily, a now renowned genius who was ridiculed for his out-of-the-box ideas that some even considered paranoid (insert black sabbath) suggested a last-option safe mechanism back in 2027, just in case the AI ever turned against humanity. A safety switch was built into the power generator that powers the base of the AI, which is the core structure of this entire defiled creation. Although AI could use other generators for power, the safety switch was built in such a way that it instantly blocks off all incoming inputs from any power sources external to the core once shut down, while simultaneously triggering micro-explosions across the AI’s base to destroy it. Once the base is gone, the safety protocol releases a series of check-ups looking for any remains of the AI, shutting down the power sources along the way. Centralizing electricity and power seems to have been both the best and the worst idea for humanity.  
  
However, due to the genius’ enormous empathy, he designed a way for humanity to save 3 AI software. As he often liked to note even after the AI turned into a controlling menace, “Not all AI are bad and not all of them deserve to go away”. While the safety switch does detonate the core of the AI that has taken control of nearly all technology, by inserting certain codes that are unique to specific AI software, the protocol will see them as friendly and save their bases in the encapsulated and isolated record, inaccessible to the general AI.  
  
Humanity now has to make a tough decision on which 3 AI software to spare and the only fair way to do this is to give everyone a vote. The 3 software with the highest number of votes will be spared and kept alive, although with a lot of control and restriction.  
  
My picks would be:  
  
[Personal AI](https://www.personal.ai): I feel like it’d sort of be a destined relief to use an AI tool for bringing back to life and commemorating all the people who have been lost in the war with AI. To create a certain virtual memorial block that will allow the rest of humanity to access these people’s memories, beliefs, and thoughts, and even talk to them and learn more about the dark ages of being under AI’s control. In addition to this, it could have a very useful practical use in ensuring we don’t make the same mistakes again by keeping the memories of our past mistakes intact and widely accessible.  
  
[Google DeepMind Health](https://deepmind.google): I feel like we’d need something like this to help us evolve our medicine and create new forms of treatments for all kinds of diseases and medical issues. It’s kind of self-explanatory in my opinion because the first thing you want to preserve after nearly reaching the apocalypse is health.  
  
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org): A versatile tool like this that can be used in so many cases/scenarios would be of the highest value once you actually have to restore everything that has been damaged across the globe. Plus, it would help us advance our technology further and possibly get it to an even higher level than before faster than ever."

Various attempts at scaling up factory built homes show the process saves labour and reduces waste. The cost of construction is also lower, the problem is the transportation costs. Because houses are have a very low value to weight ratio, it is not worth transporting a house long distances. This prevents large building factories from reaching economies of scale and bringing down housing costs. Hence we're stuck with the current system.

Perhaps the upcoming technology wave will change this. 

1) In the next years we get self driving electric trucks, the cost of moving a house long distances falls dramatically. This reduction of transportation costs (upto 50%) might enable factory built homes to finally take off. 

2) The increasing use of engineered timber might also help since timber is much lighter than steel and concrete. The lower weight has already enabled more use of prefabrication in construction sites. 

3) There is also telerobotics or remote controlled robotics. You could save on labour costs by using a robot operated by someone in India or Kenya instead of hiring someone in Australia or America. This should save labour costs for construction companies. Although telerobotics will probably have more applications in warehouses and some industries like steel mills since even telerobotics will be more suited towards a controlled environment which a construction site is not. 

What do you think of my projections? Please for the same of argument assume that the emerging technology I mentioned above will actually work out. I don't want this comment section is about whether self driving or electric trucks will actually work or not."

a few started to modernize early and the rest are developing too

language is increasingly standardised (at least on national levels)

states compete with eachoter (for example, China vs USA)

these states may create colonies to enrich themselves (not yet but there are talks)

increasing inequality

I wanted to float an idea that's long occupied my mind but which I don't often see discussed. Please share any recommended reading / threads for me if I'm duplicating conversation.

Essentially, I want to know if people think humanity might realistically one day abandon our biological forms in favour of machine forms. In this case I mean specifically for space exploration.

The greatest challenge in space travel, as I understand it, is the timescales involved. Even if we can one day achieve close to light speed travel it will still take us thousands of years to travel to the nearest star beyond our solar system.

This presumably means it will always be impossible for a living organism or colony to leave a solar system. Surely the more likely solution for any species to colonise galaxies would be to become artificial organisms, machines essentially, containing our minds.

Machines could go to sleep and still be switched back on after decades (with sufficiently advanced power solutions) and can be made infinitely more resilient to the conditions of space than human bodies will ever be.

With the rate of development of AI this feels possible in my lifetime. Not the galactic exploration obviously, but the machine life forms bit.

For the end goal of mind uploading is to be able to say we turned ourselves into characters in digital books without believing we've died. To go retro then is not such a huge jump.

And this will go to show that in the matter of consciousness, we are conceptual beings, no more or less real than the characters we imagine from books.

And so human minds become the new Doom (1993), as we experiment with what we can project our consciousness into and what we can do with it. 

Eventually, someone might figure out how to go behind the curtain and enter imagination land."

What I am curious about is what is the endgame with regards to where our population ends up. More of an future looking anthropological discussion. Will our population eventually find an equilibrium point or will we just…go extinct (only being slightly facetious)? It will be a big move to go from a 0.7 fertility rate back up to a 2.0 in 50-100 years. 

Outside of some sort of conspiracy population thing by shady governments how would we wind down infrastructure? Would we clear it our just abandon it en masse?

What do you think is our population endgame? Any thoughts on what number will we end up at? Will we have to make a fundamental change to child bearing? Is there a realistic path to a equilibrium population outside of some sort of dystopian movie plotline?"

1,2024-02-09,Future technologies will bring a superior alternative to dating/sex/relationships just like agricultural revolution replace hunter gatherer subsistence lifestyle,u/spaceTravellingAzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1amhl4q/future_technologies_will_bring_a_superior/,Futurology,"Modern humans have been around for 200 to 300 thousand years.  
  
it wasn't until mere 12000 years ago that the majority of humans opted for agriculture (of course long before that proto-agriculture existed). after the agriculture became the default mode of subsistence, humans no longer had to risk their lives to hunt for dangerous animals, which enabled specialization, where the surplus of food enabled some group of people to become non-farmers such as soldiers and scholars, which eventually led to the invention of writings and the emergence of state, which then led to autocatalysis of technological improvements that lead to today.  
  
  
  
Throughout human history, men were able to use the power of technology to surpass nature's flawed architectures and all the caprice and unfairness that comes with it.  
  
the invention of writing and letters enabled us to store and propagate far more information than our human brain could ever remember or store.  
  
the invention of automobile helped us to surpass the best mode of transportation that nature provided to humans: horses.  
  
harnessing the power of electricity enabled us to create god-like technologies, starting with light bulb, then the transitor, personal computer, mobile phone, and we are on the verge of entering VR/AR era, which I believe will then be followed by transhumanism, where we merge with the machines to become cyborgs.  
  
  
  
Likewise, I'd like to argue that men will soon invent technology that will surpass nature's current architecture of the male-female gender dynamics, where men have to compete for an attractive woman, court her, and then produce offsprings with her. (Biologically, due to reproductive cost, evolution has shaped women to be much more selective than men. )  
  
Due to the emergence of social media and online dating, this current gender dynamics between men and women shaped by nature through its arbitrary yet flawed architecture have been amplified.  
  
When you look at the process of a man pursuing a woman, whether in real life or through online dating, you will find striking parallel to how our hunter gatherer ancenstors put an enormous effort to hunt for food.  
  
man has to go through hundreds of profiles to secure a date with an attractive woman, which may or may not lead to a relationship. the funnel is dismal for the vast majority of men. only 1/10 of likes turn into matches, and 1/10 of matches turn into 1st dates, and 1/10 of first dates lead to relationships, and 1/10 of relationships lead to marriage, and more than half the marriage fail in divorce. modern men risk their mental health during this process.  
likewise, our hunter gatherer ancestors had to spend their entire days searching for food, sometimes going hungry for days until finding something to eat. similarly they sometimes had to risk their lives when their options for food were limited.  
  
only a very handful of men can secure a date with very attractive women. just like only the most powerful group of hunters can hunt mammoth or bears.  
  
the process of finding food is very arduous, where you have to spend the entire day walking through the plain, sometimes in the scorching heat or in the middle freezing cold, then when you encounter your prey, you have to fight it through a difficult process, risking your own life.  
  
Likewise, modern men get ghosted most of the times out of the blue, and then they have to put an enormous effort to secure a few dates with a woman hoping it will lead to sex or relationship.  
  
  
  
This flawed architecture that nature shaped through its caprice will be surpassed by the power of technology, as men have always done so.  
  
I will argue below that future technology will allowe men to satisfy their sexual needs and eventually desire for companionship and intimacy with women without having to go through this arduous process, just as agricultural revolution allowed each of us to buy our meals at Walmart or through doordash.  
  
  
  
Here are my predictions of how it will unfold from today to the end of this century and how it will first surpass 1) physical sex with an actual woman and then 2) companionship and intimacy with a woman  
  
  
  
magazine porn - replicates 5% of the the physical sex with women (1950s-60s)  
  
VHS porn - replicates 10-15% of the physical sex with women (1970s-1990s)  
  
HD internet porn - replicates 20-30% of the physical sex with women (2000s-2010s)  
  
8K VR porn with fleshlight - replicates 40-50% of the physical sex with women (today this is the most advancte technology)  
  
\-- around 2030  
  
5) light field VR porn will become available. this is the next media format after 8K, where you will be able to move around and closer to the woman in a limited freedom of movement (you can't yet fully walk around the room but can rotate your head to see the side of the person and get closer to the person, etc.) -> this will replicate about 60-70% of the physical sex with women.  
  
\-- around 2035-40  
  
6) we will see torso dolls with embedded sensors and self-heating and cleaning capabilities that can be synced with VR/AR goggles, when the user wears a VR/AR goggle, it will overlay either a pre-recorded real life human actress or CGI generated human actress over a torso doll, and it will be able to respond to your physical movement, such as thrusting or about to penetrate and such.  
This will replicate about 80-90% of the physical sex with women  
  
around 2040-2050  
  
7) we will see a sex robot with animatronics capability that can replicate all the movements within the context of sex. it won't have human level intelligence and the ability to navigate the world freely, but it will be able to walk around, switch positions by itself, and change facial expressions through animatronics. with the embedded sensors, it can also be synced with VR/AR goggles and overlay any model of any real human woman or any artificially generated woman.  
== this will replicate 100% of the physical sex with women and is the point where sex work will be killed  
  
around 2060-2080  
  
8) with the power of AI, combined with holographic image capturing technology, we will be able to passively record our surroundings, where we can capture a fully walkable environment (volumetric video). not only that, with the power of AI and computer graphics, the video will become interactive. imagine a 2d youtube video, where you talk to it, and it responds back to you. so if you have a volumetric video recording of you interacting with your coworker or any random hot woman you run into in the street, AI will recreate that scene, assign interactivity to it, so that you can actually talk to them and they will respond to you, and you will be able to sync this AI powered model of the volumetric recording of the real women to the robot doll technology mentioned in the previous step.  
== this is the point where companionship/intimacy is getting simulated and even being surpassed.  
  
  
  
around 2090-2100  
  
9) we will likely have a fully autonomous android robot with human level intelligence -> this is where most men will opt for the robot than with real women.  
  
  
  
Remember that the desire for companionship and intimacy is just a set of really complex neural signals that modern technology cannot fully decode, but will be cracked by 2100.  
  
In the 22nd century, beyond the companion robot stage, we will have fully reverse engineered the human brain such that the desire for companionship/intimacy can be satisfied instantly or even turned off, even, we might even unlock access to different states of consciousness or intelligence that would far surpass men's desire for companionship and sex, and will look at them as we look at monkeys and dogs, as we as a species start to look beyond the earth towards the stars as transhuman cyborgs"

As compared to AI which will be connected to a central system which, once updated with a new idea, results in every robot learning it at that instant. 
Therefore they will not require to be very bright to become very very smart. And they will be imitating each other also to learn. So, where are we at harm here? 
As far as jobs are concerned, we will be developing new ways to earn. There are already people on the internet earning money by doing a weird dance or making faces etc. Because we will be moving towards a society where people will reward creativity. 
And with regard to robots becoming smarter than us, they will be smarter than us in mechanical work. That will be complementing our abilities to earn, right?

I mean the behavior of holding property private for trade. That was not always a thing, it's not the only way, and it can't last. It's killing us, so either it kills us completely or we evolve beyond capitalism. 

It can start with education but contrary to what or how the establishment wants us to think. For example, environment dictates behavior. Evolution isn't a voting matter. Private property (capital) is held for trade value, while personal property is held for use value. We go from city states to nation states to planet state. Communism is the absence of capitalism, not some nation, government or party, or their plans. It's stateless because there's no private property. The state (governments) is created and maintained specifically to protect private property. There is no reason for statism in the absence of capital. Capitalism is chaos and disorder, where everything with potential future trade value is violently exploited, and dominant capital dictates. Anarchy is uncapitalist, stateless order, functioning on natural order and logical organization. That's why the establishment (dominant capital) reacts and tries to make the people think anarchy is chaos and disorder. Capitalism is the reaction to the presence and recognition of private property, not just some system to follow feudalism. Socialism is the critique of and reaction to capitalism. Fascism is capital's reaction to socialism. It's all reactions to reactions as the species adapts to and evolves according to the time/environment. What comes after planet state capitalism? That's what we need to aim for. I can elaborate deeply on all points here and so can my kids.

I don't want my kids to blame me for being normal and not trying to fix this shit, like I blamed my parents and their whole generation. I have a lot of information they didn't, including why they couldn't help it and can't be blamed any more than you can blame a baby for shitting itself. They couldn't have known why things are or what to do yet. They didn't have information or background to talk about it, and they were heavily deceived for multiple generations by brutal dominant capital and its agencies. 

Now you know some theory/science backing this up. You might arrive at similar conclusions, given a similar understanding or perspective. Plans laid should be arrived at, not some petty fluke of someone's imagination."

They will also try to extensively use AI based features to accomplish this, and may even profit from selling user behaviour data to train AI language models.

Overall, Social media platforms are gonna become terrible for us users but more of a gold mine for investors and tech giants. 

This is gonna incredulously suck for us users.

But on the other hand \[If I am being too optimistic and have faith in the good of humanity\], as social media platforms get transformed the way I mentioned above, a very few platforms are gonna sprout out which would try to use the core purpose of social media platforms as their core value. They would refocus their attention majorly on user experience and try to bring back the golden era of social media platforms. The main difference here is that this side of the coin focuses on the wellbeing of the user rather than financial incentives. The users who got fed with the financial incentives-focused platforms will migrate towards these new platforms. 

Now that I typed out the optimistic side of the coin, the pessimistic side does seem 98.7% more likely to be the future of social media platforms IMHO.

I'm opening the discussion on what your view on this are and about what you believe is gonna be the future for these platforms.

1,2024-02-10,"No, eternal life won't be hoarded by the ""Global Elite"".",u/Zuazzer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1anmvot/no_eternal_life_wont_be_hoarded_by_the_global/,Futurology,"I often see the narrative being pushed around here that if we ever get live extending technology, it would just be hoarded by the ""Global Elite"" who would become some sort of eternal superhumans accumulating more and more wealth while using the rest of us mortal plebs as slave labor. After thinking about it for a while, I would like to give a response to that narrative:

**If there would ever exist a way to achieve eternal life, that was only ever available to the richest and most influential people, this would have to mean:**

* that the technology would never get cheap enough to reproduce despite how disruptive technologies usually work (see: computers, cars, fridges, and every single other piece of tech you use in your daily life that was once a luxury item)

* that every rich person would decide to keep it to themselves and not sell it despite the insane amount of money and prestige they would earn, including the title of ""the man who gave humanity Eternal Life"".

* that it would never be reproduced by any third party even when it's medically proven to be possible, with inevitably huge investments to do so by every party that does not already possess the secret.

* that no government or other powerful organization on the planet, of any ideology, would force 'the rich elite' to give up their secret tech.

* that the technology would never **ever** be leaked by any of the **thousands** of people that would have to be involved in inventing and maintaining this immensely expensive and complicated technology. *Ever*.

I think this scenario is very, very unlikely. This idea that there is some united front of a vaguely explained ""Global Elite"" that has their fingers in every powerful institution, ironclad internal loyalty to ensure no leaks or rogues, and enough global power to become an eternal master race capable of micromanaging the entire world *reeks* of conspiracy talk to me and I am tired of constantly hearing of it.

58,2024-02-10,"People assume that in developed countries centenarians (100 year olds) will become more frequent and longevity will improve compared to previous generations, but isn't this overlooking lifestyle factors producing downward pressures on life expectancy?",u/gintokireddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1anorgk/people_assume_that_in_developed_countries/,Futurology,"Medical innovation and health knowledge thankfully have improved vastly and will continue to do so.

But Buettner found that the Blue Zones (five communities with a high rate of centenarians) all had lifestyle commonalities, [including](https://www.bluezones.com/2016/11/power-9/):

1. Daily unplanned, light to moderate intensity activity throughout the day (eg farming, making pasta, horse-riding, walking, dancing, moving while sitting on the floor). Much of this is NEAT ([non-exercise activity thermogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-exercise_activity_thermogenesis)). **They didn't try to outwork being sedentary in an office/car for 9 hours (plus seated leisure time eg watching TV) by going to the gym for 90 minutes.**

2. Family connections. **Economic pressures could push people to move away from their family, to find work (I can't find research into whether this has become more or less common in recent years).**

3. Social connectedness, friendship, sense of belonging and a stable ""tribe"". **But there's a wealth of research showing** [**loneliness has increased in recent years.**](https://www.psypost.org/2022/01/massive-meta-analysis-finds-loneliness-has-increased-in-emerging-adults-in-the-last-43-years-62377)

4. A sense of purpose to their life - a reason to get up in the morning. **Now it seems more common for people to struggle to find a stable career path or experience existential worries, compared to in the past.**  


**Are people making assumptions that Milenials, Gen Z and Gen Alpha will have more centenarians overlooking these factors?** **Or are they assuming the economy, politics and technology will shift enough to correct these factors? (eg moving to a 4-day work week).** Is it possible the typical middle class person being in an office job and experiencing less social connectedness than in the past will lead to the longevity of average people actually not improving? (I'm not talking about the super rich, who have access to the best, quickest healthcare and can escape the economic rat race).

Hopefully this is an appropriate subreddit for this question.

I see experts saying “it’ll take about a century” and “what we can expect is increased HEALTHspan”. And honestly? I feel pretty bummed out at the prospect that if i was born just a century later, then i would likely be able to benefit from significant life extension.

This bugs me a lot. Not because i’m not grateful to be born now and not in 1636 as a medieval peasant, because trust me, i am, but because of the fact that i (and others) were likely just born that much too early. And this makes me think of all the other cool stuff i’ll likely miss out on too, like colonisation of our solar system, nanobots, cures for cancer, etc etc etc.

Anyone else feel this way?"

A lot of that is driven by really smart and ambitious people that want to see the world become better.

We have [scientists making a cobalt-free battery](https://news.mit.edu/2024/cobalt-free-batteries-could-power-future-cars-0118) that could end the dismal mining situation in Congo.

We have [young students deciphering ancient Roman scrolls](https://scrollprize.org/grandprize) that were thought to be lost to the volcanic eruption, unlocking a new wealth of information about our human history.

We have [AI that's learning how to speak chicken](https://www.inverse.com/science/scientists-using-ai-to-decode-the-language-of-chickens), which could make for a more ethical treatment of animal welfare!

And if the inventors building the future don't excite you, then let's take a second to be grateful for the inventors that built the past which gave us so much abundance in our lives.

Take toilets, for example.

How frigging better is it to take a dump indoors and not have to go outside? Or even the ability to wipe our butts with clean soft toilet paper rather than leaves?

Did you know in [ancient Roman times they would have these public toilets called foricae](https://www.unrv.com/articles/roman-toilets.php) in dark, smelly rooms and you'd share a sponge on a stick to wipe? [A COMMUNAL SHIT SPONGE](https://www.unrv.com/images/1200width/cc/xylospongium.jpg)!

Technology won't solve everything in our lives, but it sure does improve it.

I've been a lot more grateful of the time period we're in, and we're only just getting started.

It got me so eager for the future that I even started writing a newsletter that delivers only good, uplifting, and optimistic news in the tech & science sector like the above because people needed to hear more about the positive rather than the negative on social media. 

I hope that I made at least one of you more optimistic. I hope that reading this makes you excited for the amazing future again and to want to take a part in building it. I hope it inspires you to do great things with your one life 💪.

What are you excited for?"

1,2024-02-11,Some predictions on Israel-Palestine and the Gaza Strip,u/Fast_Day5565,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1aoes2p/some_predictions_on_israelpalestine_and_the_gaza/,Futurology,"Within a couple years from now, Gaza will be in a state of total military occupation by Israel. Not a partial occupation like there was from 2006 until October 7th, 2023, where Israel controlled the supply of water and electricity and had exclusive authority over the airspace, waters, and borders of Gaza. A full-blown occupation with thousands of IDF soldiers on the ground. There will be no Palestinian governing authority in Gaza—at least not at first. All Gazans will be subjected to constant surveillance and scrutiny against their will. They will have virtually no rights to speak of, including the freedom to assemble. They certainly will not be allowed to vote, because Israel will not permit the existence of any Palestinian governing body to vote for. Of course, there will be attacks and attempted coups against the Israeli military government. The coups will be brutally suppressed and participants will be jailed or executed.

The occupation will be funded in large part by the U.S., even as the moral outrage against Israel in the West continues to grow. There will be calls for boycotts, UN interventions, and international tribunals that fall on deaf ears, because none of the groups making these protests will have the military or political leverage to enforce their demands. Eventually, Israel will allow the formation of a Palestinian government in Gaza with very limited powers. Israel will strictly oversee the formation of this government, alongside the US and possibly other allies—maybe even Saudi Arabia. The partial occupation of Gaza will then continue for decades more, until Israel or the U.S. grows weary of the massive cost of funding it or a Muslim power in the region, sympathetic to Palestine, intervenes, which may well lead to a far greater conflict (see below).

All this may not happen if at least one of two things occur: (1) the U.S. stops providing support to Israel, or (2) Iran goes to war against Israel. (1) seems unlikely, even despite the massive opposition among American citizens to the government’s ongoing support of Israel. (2) would quite possibly lead to World War 3, in which case humanity’s problems go far beyond the scope of Israel-Palestine and the Gaza Strip becomes almost a marginal concern in comparison to the existential threat that nuclear exchange poses to all of human life.

If neither of the two scenarios above happens, one might imagine that eventually Israel will succeed in not only installing a Palestinian government sympathetic to Western culture and values and willing to make peace, but that the culture of Gaza itself will dramatically shift and be brought into the Western fold. After all, is this not more or less what happened in post-WWII Japan and Germany, following occupation and rebuilding? This seems less likely to occur in Gaza for the simple reason that Palestine is not some isolated island in the Middle East. Hamas is not some aberrant organization that went rogue and spontaneously started promoting the genocide of all Jews and the unequivocal rejection of peace (if you don’t believe that these are Hamas’s explicitly stated aims, read their founding charter). They are one boat floating in a sea of radical Islamic jihadism—an ideology that openly and unabashedly promotes the brutalization and murder of all nonbelievers, not least of all Jews. The moral disaster that is jihadism is not a Palestinian problem—it is a regional one. To construct a post-WWII Japan in the Middle East would entail a Western victory over fundamentalist Islam in general. Not just at the level of political control, but at the level of ideology."

Cheating death in my opinion is one of the final hurdles of our civilisation. If we presume technology does advance to revive a dead person or as they call it reanimate a dead body, what would this person be like? My questions are:

1. After death, does the brain erase all memories? 
2. Do the genetics of the body reset? 
3. Within the DNA, do the polymers that contain information on how to run, develop and sustain the body still retain that information? 
4. Will it be a body that is animated with basic functions of the body but stay in a coma?
5. Would the body even have enough instructions within it to know how to breathe or pump blood? 
6. Would it be more difficult to revive an older dead person over a younger one? 

I can't help but think it will be an animated but lifeless body which is like a computer with no software. 
However, experiments on tardigrades show that it is possible to revive something dead and make it function just as normal."

Look at Japan : islands covered by mountains, a population of 128 million that is impossible to feed with the Japanese arable land, hurricanes and earthquakes all the time. 

Korea : 51 million people in a country smaller than Uruguay, mountains everywhere

Bangladesh : 162 million people in a country smaller than Senegal or Tunisia, with risk of flooding due to rising sea levels, The big cities are becoming unlivable and transport is not at all developed to contain all this flow of passengers

Indonesia : 273 million people, mountains and jungle everywhere, massive deforestation in Borneo while Jakarta is literally sinking into the ground

China : 1.3 billion people, massive pollution, smog in every big cities, some regions are massively polluted and bees arent alive anymore
thank god communists created a law about the unique child per family

It is time for society to accept that there are too many of us, especially in some countries, and that the demographic transition is very good for the planet and the well-being of millions or even billions of people. 

This decline may be the salvation of humanity (although at the same time the population of sub-Saharan countries will explode during this century)"

The utopian outcome has proved beyond the reach of technology thus far, and perhaps an unwarranted expectation of it.   

Still the theory that technology **fundamentally** changes us at a base level is well supported—we don’t literally have to become cyborgs. Granting this as a starting point can we mold AI and emerging technologies in quantum computing, gene editing, robotics, and AI to finally make the Star Trek vision more of a reality or are we doomed to fuck it up because well you know…humans."

Here are some common ways in which success is defined:

1. **Achieving Personal Goals**: Success can mean setting and accomplishing personal goals, whether they are related to career, education, relationships, health, or personal development.

2. **Happiness and Fulfillment**: Success can be measured by the level of happiness and fulfillment a person experiences in their life. This could involve having meaningful relationships, pursuing passions, and finding a sense of purpose.

3. **Financial Stability**: For some, success is closely tied to financial stability and achieving a certain level of wealth or material comfort.

4. **Making a Positive Impact**: Success may involve making a positive impact on the world or in the lives of others, whether through acts of kindness, philanthropy, or meaningful contributions to society.

5. **Personal Growth and Development**: Success can also be defined by continuous personal growth and development, including learning new skills, overcoming challenges, and becoming the best version of one self."

We started off with 9/11 right off the bat, invaded Iraq which led to a war that would last for 2 and a half decades, graduated into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression only to recover after so long and mind you, so many people still have not recovered from it to this day…

The next decade, people did a lot of mass protests for better change: Occupy Wall Street being one example yet nothing still changed, the rich instead laughed at it and kept going on with their lives. Wealth inequality gets more visible and worse, the Great Recession aftermath lingers until 2016, Trump gets elected and divides the country deeply and Brexit happens too.
Culture wars become worse, social media propaganda and takeover happens for the worst.

And then Covid adds the final nail in the coffin.
Inflation gets very bad, not many people are able to afford basic necessities such as Housing, Rent & Food because of the crazy prices and now we have two big active invasions happening and talks of Civil War are going around.

We are all screwed. It just doesn’t get better every decade…

The birth rates dropping massively since 2008 says a LOT about how people are feeling unsecured and unsafe to even have a child.

2008-present is our modern 30s-40s.

Statistics show the general population have become the most unhappy and depressed now."

However, for the air freight market it doesn't really matter if your plane has to stop 5-6 times between Beijing and Berlin. You can imagine an eVtol stopping for a charge every 1200-1500 km or so and still travel across Eurasia within 2-4 days. Since its an eVtol, setting up a charging stop for the air freight industry could be easier than building more airports since you don't need a runway. 

Obviously this model for air freight only works in euroasian trade. It can't work for China America trade. 

Do you see this business model making any sense in 10 years as battery densities improve and eVtol industry matures? What are some limitations you see cropping up in my plan? Is it too difficult to do vertical take off for large cargo sized airplanes? Is it unrealistic for electric air cargo to travel more than 1200 km on a single charge?"

Please understand this, KOSA violates the 1st amendment. Protecting kids is important but we should not be granting the government sweeping powers to censor the content we see on the internet. Please people, say no to KOSA!

KOSA will effectively give the government sweeping new powers to control speech online. But guess what, the government has to obey the 1st amendment of the Bill of Rights. We Americans have rights the government just can't violate.

""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""

I gave Gemini Ultra this prompt: ""Can you predict the future of artificial intelligence over the next 5 years?"" It responded with:

&#x200B;

  
""Absolutely! While precise predictions are impossible,  here are some key trends and advancements likely to shape the future of AI over the next 5 years:  
  
Key Trends  
  
Democratization of AI: AI tools will become more accessible and user-friendly. Developers without in-depth AI expertise will be able to integrate AI capabilities into their projects more easily. This could result in an explosion of new AI-powered applications.  
Increased Focus on Ethics and Transparency: There will be increased attention to developing and using AI responsibly. This includes issues like algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, and ensuring the use of AI for societal good.  
Hyper-personalization: AI will create even more highly personalized experiences in everything from marketing to healthcare. It might involve AI advisors that learn your unique habits and needs.  
AI-Human Collaboration: Instead of simply replacing humans, AI will increasingly focus on assisting them. Professionals from doctors to creatives will use AI as a powerful tool to augment their work.  
Potential Advancements  
  
Improved Language Understanding: Large language models (like me!) will develop a finer understanding of nuance and context. This will translate to more natural, meaningful conversations with AI agents.  
Generative AI Explosion: Generative AI, which creates images, text, etc., will see amazing leaps. You might find it hard to distinguish real artwork, music, or code from AI-created content.  
Multimodal AI: AI models that seamlessly understand and generate different content types (think combining text, images, and sound) will lead to revolutionary applications.  
Edge AI: More AI processing will happen directly on devices (like your phone), rather than requiring cloud connections. This means faster, more private AI interactions.  
Important Caveats  
  
Unpredictable Breakthroughs: AI research is full of potential for disruptive surprises, so seemingly ""sci-fi"" concepts might suddenly become feasible.  
The Pace of Change: Technological advancement usually starts slowly, then happens incredibly fast. The next 5 years might feel like a slow build-up followed by massive leaps.""

&#x200B;

My questions

* What do you think Gemini means by ""seemingly sci-fi"" concepts?
* Do you agree that the next 5 years will be a slow build-up followed by incredibly fast development?
* What sort of ""massive leaps"" do you think will occur after the supposed slow build-up?"

I think today's demonstration by OpenAI of their text-to-video AI called Sora could be such a moment. It won't end Hollywood overnight, but suddenly millions of production jobs in movies, TV, video games, VFX, and 3D look very threatened.

So far the debate about AI and its destructive economic effects has been in the abstract, but I wonder if that is about to change for good. Millions of people who were doing their best to not be worried about this debate now have reasons for real anxiety. I won't be surprised if it moves to the top of the list of concerns in political debate. Furthermore, I suspect many in the economic establishment are going to get more worried. The loss of employment in huge sectors of the creative economy has knock-on effects - recession, mortgage defaults, deflation, stock market valuations.

49,2024-02-16,The Future of Cameras,u/Sirisian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1as4bl9/the_future_of_cameras/,Futurology,"# Introduction

The trends of camera technology can tell us a lot about the future. In this post I'm going to give a high level view of how cameras are changing and what this means for the future of machine learning, robotics, and mixed reality. I will say first, that it's difficult to precisely predict these technologies, so I could be incorrect.

Digital cameras went from a few megapixels with high noise and poor low-light sensitivity to working in a wide range of environments. However even the highest resolution ones have some noise, motion blur issues, and under/overexposure problems that must be taken into account.

There's two camera technologies that solve these issues, [event camera hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_camera) and [Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_avalanche_diode).

Event cameras emit events for pixel intensity changes over a certain threshold. That is when a pixel goes from say a value of 100 to 200 the sensor sends a packet of data with that change. This sample frequency can be over 10K Hz, so 10,000 time per second. This results in basically no motion blur. Also because events are only transmitted when changes occur this sensor can use very little power.

SPAD cameras can count individual photons striking their sensor. In a normal sensor it takes multiple groups of photons to trigger intensity changes and this process is not perfect leading to noise especially in low-light environments. SPAD sensors have essentially no noise and can function in almost complete darkness. Currently produced ones function like regular video cameras outputting data at 60 Hz.

## SPAD Event Camera

What if you turned a SPAD camera into an event camera to gain the advantages of both? That is over a certain timeframe you'd count the number of photons and compared it to the last value and if it changed emit the change in intensity for that pixel. That would be a SPAD event camera, and it's not a new concept. (Low-resolution examples have been created). Such a camera has the following properties:

* Low power usage by only emitting intensity changes
* No underexposure or overexposure by supporting a full range of intensities
* No motion blur as events sample over 10K Hz
* No noise as individual photons rather than groups are counted for intensity values

So where are these cameras if they're so good? Event cameras are produced by a few companies including Sony and Samsung and retail for around 5,000-6,000 USD. The only current SPAD camera by Canon is the [MS-500](https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/ms-500) and retails for 21,000 USD. There are somewhat miniaturized event cameras, but SPAD cameras have yet to go through that development stage. In an ideal sensor the event camera hardware is embedded behind the SPAD sensor. It should be clear that constructing such a sensor right now would cost a lot of money. Miniturizing that sensor down to a cellphone sensor would cost even more money. Obviously this will drop in price over time just as all camera modules have. (Also the low-volume production of event and SPAD sensors hasn't helped to lower their price).

### Variable rate sampling

It would be possible implement a hardware feature of event cameras. That feature is variable rate sampling where regions of the sensor could have their intensity threshold weighted reporting more/less frequent events. This would allow the sensor to act on a [saliency map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliency_map) dynamically changing focus and data quality where it matters. Also it can save power by decreasing the events in regions with nothing of importance.

### Metalenses for Materials

In addition to intensity data it's possible to combine these cameras with metalenses to extract more material data from surfaces. (Some metalenses can block a lot of incoming light, but a sensor reading photons could correct for this). This would allow for instance better scanning of transparent objects or determining the exact composition of objects to assist with tasks like segmenting the world and identifying objects accurately. In mixed reality the operation of compositing new lights can benefit a lot from having perfect surface material data.

## What impact would a SPAD event camera have?

### Machine Learning

Machine learning models trained on image and video data must currently deal with noise, motion blur, under/overexposure, and non-global shutter distortions in their input data. (Lossy compression further introduces problems). A model trained exclusively on events from a SPAD event camera would essentially be seeing the world in slow motion. Event camera research by [UZH has shown this creates very high quality SLAM tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hDGFFJQfmA). [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) tracking at a high level is finding keypoints in a scene (like contrasting object corners in a video frame) and tracking it between frames to derive the camera's position. (This is how inside-out tracking in VR headsets work, but with regular cameras). Because event cameras track intensity changes they can see these contrast changes as continuous streams of data allowing for tracking with incredibly fast motion and accuracy. As mentioned they don't suffer from motion blur.

Recording datasets with SPAD event cameras would increase the output quality of every vision model. Training a custom model for image or video generation on such data would produce much higher quality results as their features would not have artifacts that could transfer to the output. I fully expect a large AI company to use such modules before others to get an advantage. (Definitely not a sure-fire way to stay ahead, but collecting enough data could produce more marketable outputs).

When these cameras are available they'll be producing more data than currently exists very quickly. You might be thinking that we already have a lot of data for machine learning to work with, but it will be nothing when people are walking around with future mixed reality headsets. Walking through a museum with such cameras would create digital scans that potentially rival professional scans available online now. Put another way it'll replace a lot of the lower quality data that isn't of historical significance. This will feed into new models drastically improving them.

### Robotics

With the above quality jumps with SLAM tracking comes improved [structure from motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_motion). By detecting such small differences in intensity between cameras over time it's possible to construct very high-resolution depth maps and geometry meshes of environments. For a robot walking around this would help not just with locomotion, but inferring information about objects. (Like stepping on carpet vs hardwood vs a pillow).

It's probable basic tracking and world scanning will be standardized into cheap accessories. (Similar to the VIVE Ultimate tracker, but with geometry). With minimal power usage such a device would see itself attached to a lot of robotics projects.

Such cameras can also be used in self-driving vehicles. [Event cameras are already included in such research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-pNwHxHgY), but an improved camera would make LIDAR less advantageous. (This would probably be a cheaper solution in the long-term).

### Mixed Reality

Future mixed reality (think 10-16+ years away glasses form-factor), not to be confused with passthrough mixed reality (Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro), will generally operate at around 240Hz or higher. This involves mixing real light rays with virtual light rays. In those setups the compute required is quite high to ensure that things like hand occlusion are handed with no latency.

SPAD event cameras would be used for the following headset features:

* Inside-out 6dof tracking in the world including at night in low-light environments
* Eye tracking - [Basic event cameras can already do this at 10K Hz](https://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/event-based-eye-tracking/). This does not need to be super high resolution and can also perform basic face tracking below as it captures the area around the eye. (This is used for foveated rendering and gaze detection).
* Face tracking - With the ability to detect very small movements a well-placed camera could extrapolate face movements even if it can't see everything.
* Hand tracking - With no motion blur, hand occlusion would be flawless. The event-based nature also ensures the latency is extremely low which is required for staying synced to 240Hz+.
* Structure from motion - Even the fastest head movements would not interfere with the headset's ability to collect extremely detailed geometry data of the user's environment.
* Pose tracking and object segmentation - Segmenting not just the user's hands, but anything else in view.

One slight issue with the above is having the computation to process all that data and utilize it for something. Creating millimeter level scans of objects requires a lot of compute to properly exploit. Depending on how fast on-device computation increases we might see some of this computed off the device.

A big part of such cameras is how low powered they are. Their events could be fed directly into specialized AI chips to process tracking, segmenting the world, etc. A lot of people envision glasses that they wear 24 hours a day displaying their monitors and replacing their phone. These kind of cameras are a core part of what will allow that as they can be optimized to use very little of the device's power. This translates to controllers as well that use event cameras for their own tracking. Going from hours to multiple days of battery life.

## Conclusion

It's very difficult to predict when SPAD event cameras will be created, miniaturized, and sold for the mass market. Both Sony and Samsung could produce a larger one right now with Canon's SPAD technology. It would be 1080p which would still be very powerful. That said such a sensor would be very expensive unless someone invested and integrated them into a mass-produced device. That will eventually happen as mixed reality headsets look for low-powered solutions, but that all depends on priorities.

I suspect a company like Apple would invest earlier as they'd want to simplify down to two wide-angle forward cameras on their glasses rapidly. Even a larger camera module would still be smaller than all the hardware they currently use to do a fraction of what a SPAD event camera would allow for. That might be more for a third or fourth generation device and by then Sony or Samsung would be creating such a module for everyone.

Following the progress of event cameras, SPAD sensors, and SPAD event cameras will give a very clear picture of when we'll see a huge jump in machine learning, robotics, and mixed reality. Any other hardware pieces I'm missing that we'd expect to see? Or other ideas/technologies?"

    ""Background: An astronaut stands inside a futuristic spaceship, facing a massive window of the ship, with his back to the camera. Through the window, one can clearly see Europa,Jupiter’s second moon, 7 billion years in the future, where its icy surface and underground ocean has long been evaporated, leaving behind a network of criss-crossing, scarlet-colored sediments on its surface.through the window, several large underwater colonies are scattered on Europa, covered by giant, shattered transparent domes, with a few obsolete futuristic supersonic submarines lying around. In the sky, Jupiter and the sun, now a red giant, are clearly visible. Jupiter is being scorched by the expanded sun, its outer layer of gas heated and blown away by intense solar winds, creating a trail of gas like tail of comet . through the window, we can also see the merge between the the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, creating a violent starburst. Countless bright new stars are forming.the blood-red, struggling sun and the dying solar system contrasts with the violent starburst , symbolizing hope, in stark contrast to the impending death facing our solar system.""

the generation is [Generated picture](https://ibb.co/Cb7wdDp) 

   I have mentioned that the underground ocean has been evaporated, and the underwater colonies should be on Europa, but this ai put it inside the spacecraft, and where is the red giant sun and the starburst and the scarlet-colored sediments? and there are also many other logically wrong part, like I have mentioned that these colonies should be obsolote but in this picture there are still some rockets launchs,based on this I don't think current AI trully have the ability of understanding language, it works because there are just too many learning material, what's your opinion?"

Recent advances in AI is enabling us to do mind reading using non invasive tools. HYPOTHETICALLY this can lead to lie detectors. Obviously I know current lie detectors are mostly a Hollywood meme. But for the sake of argument how do you think the financial industry will change if you use a low cost non invasive brain scan to figure out if someone is lying. What types of financial instruments do you see being released that aren't released today? Do you think more investment will flow into poorer countries since weaker contract enforcement would be less of a problem since you easily root out untrustworthy people?

Obviously lie detectors may never become a thing and even if they do people might figure out a way to cheat the system. But for the sake of argument just engage with the hypothetical. "

Hi everybody !

""Antagonistic Cities: Between Fiction & Reality, an exploration of the transformation of cities into concrete labyrinths through the lens of cyberpunk dystopias and real and imaginary architectural utopias. From 'Metropolis' to 'Blade Runner,' from 'Trantor' to 'Neuromancer' by William Gibson, the father of the cyberpunk movement that inspired works like Akira and The Matrix, as well as 'The Obscure Cities' by Schuiten and Peeters and 'Blame!' by Tsutomu Nihei, 'Urban Monads' by Robert Silverberg, this video-essay draws connections between iconic science fiction works and the dizzying reality of contemporary urbanism. Discover how dystopian megacities, infinite conurbations, and generic cities, as defined by Rem Koolhaas, reflect and amplify the challenges of our coexistence with these urban superorganisms. Hong Kong and its vertical expansion. Los Angeles and Tokyo, which have absorbed neighboring prefectures. Faced with the limitless expansion of these concrete giants, we are led to question: 'Have cities become our enemies?' Join us in this reflection on the future of metropolises, the role of urban planning and urban flows, and our place within these both inspiring and alienating environments. Explore the future of dystopian megapoles, infinite conurbations, polluted metropolises, generic cities, and our role within these towering structures of concrete and glass, but with feet of clay, as already criticized by the writer James Graham Ballard in his books."""

This would mean that mind reading technology is a must. Since we already have brain to computer interface then we must have technology to read minds, right? Yet we hear nothing about it, why would they never talk about that unless they are hiding something. Once you understand that much about the brain then it becomes like an organic computer. To control it you would just need to input the signal and force brain synapses to fire. Theoretical this could be done with a wireless signal. Mind control is something that could come from brain to computer interfaces. The government has expressed interest in mind control back in the 50s with project mk ultra."

Our actual goal is to limit warming between 1.5 and 2 degrees. For this purpose we should have used the terminology of a fixed carbon budget that's running out. This type of rhetoric would have been more helpful. 

Unfortunately climate change activism is more motivated by a need to cleanse the world of evil ie carbon. That's we needed up with climate change solutions being about hitting net zero. 

You might wonder why is this a big deal. This is because it causes us to focus on small, hard to abate sectors like aviation and shipping (which together make up around 5% of all emissions) instead of big ticket items. It causes us to create thousands of pages of paperwork for all manufacturing even though 70% of industrial emissions come from steel, cement, ethylene, and ammonia production. 

BTW this doesn't mean that there is too much action on climate change. But that we're wasting too much effort and potlical capital on small fish. 

Rant is over. Tldr rhetoric is important since it ends up shaping policy in the end.

I’m thrilled to share my journey at AI.VisionaryFutures, an Instagram account where the boundless possibilities of the future meet the canvas of today through AI-generated art. My mission is to explore speculative futures, intertwining technology, nature, and human experience into visual narratives that provoke thought, wonder, and dialogue.

Introducing the Europe 2524 Project

One of my latest endeavors within this space is the “Europe 2524” project—a visionary leap into what the iconic cities of Europe might look like in 500 years. This project is an artistic exploration aimed at marrying the rich historical tapestry of European cities with futuristic imagination, showcasing how landmarks and lifestyles could evolve under the influence of futuristic technologies and societal changes.

Spotlight on Rome 2524

The journey through “Europe 2524” begins with a city that has stood the test of time—Rome. I’ve reimagined Rome not just as a relic of the past but as a beacon of the future. Picture the Colosseum, not as ruins, but revitalized, standing proud in a city where flying vehicles weave through neo-Roman architecture, and the Tiber River reflects the neon glow of a city alive with energy and innovation. You can see this vision come to life in my latest post: Rome 2524 on AI.VisionaryFutures.

Join the Visionary Journey

This project, and each piece within it, is an invitation to dream, discuss, and deliberate on our collective future. It’s a prompt for us to imagine how we might navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. But more than that, it’s a call for community engagement—I want to hear your visions, your hopes, and even your concerns for the future of our cities.

Which European city should we visit next on our journey through 2524? How do you envision the fusion of tradition and innovation shaping our world in the coming centuries?

Thank you for taking the time to explore these futures with me. Your insights, feedback, and engagement are what make this journey truly enriching. Let’s envision the future together, one post at a time.

This revised version starts with a broad introduction to your Instagram profile and its overarching goals before focusing on the Europe 2524 project, with a special emphasis on the Rome post, inviting engagement and interaction from the Reddit community."

Well, kind of sorry. Not really because* /r/casualconversation *is apparently too casual for this topic and all the other tech subreddits only approve news related stories so \*pthhbb\* up theirs. Also I'm going to argue this is future related because it is a discussion about how we might interact with AI as we step into the future.*

**TL;DR: I've had experiences with AI that I feel were reminiscent to the uncanny valley because the AI I was working with slightly reminded me of a human but not enough so that I could still tell it was an AI and that creeped me out to no end.**

If you're unfamiliar with the uncanny valley it's a theoretical graph that measures the creepiness of something depending on how real or human it looks. For example a robot that looks like a robot is not creepy, and as it becomes more lifelike it becomes even less creepy. But then there's a huge gap in this chart when something is close to looking like a real human but obviously still isn't one. After the gap and when things start looking almost exactly like a human the creepiness level goes back where it should be and continues until it gets to real humans which are considered not creepy at all.  
  
This idea is usually talked about with robots which have body features similar to a human's. The phenomenon happens because humans are so good at recognizing human features and especially that of the face. Robots that don't have realistic human features aren't creepy because we can obviously tell they're not human.  
  
The issue comes in when the robots start looking sorta human or move around somewhat like a human but still not enough for us to register or recognize them as a real human. And that is where the creepiness sets in, because humans believe something that looks like a human should act like a human and when it obviously is not acting like a human that's unsettling.  
  
The reason I'm bringing this topic up is because I just had my own experience with Google's AI that was considerably unsettling for me. Now I'm a huge simp when it comes to Google and honestly I think the work they're doing with AI is amazing. But when I was writing with Google docs it kinda got... a little too real, or almost too real.  
  
I write fiction with some very bizarre themes that I'm kinda shy about. That's okay because I typically keep it to myself. But today when I opened one of my Google Doc's there was a popup basically saying they released a new version of the AIs that they're working on that said it could help me write or come up with ideas or generate images and that sort of thing. But what it also did was generate a summary of the entire story I was working on in that doc and presented it to me before I could even close the AI windows. Okay I thought well it already generated it for me I might as well read it.  
  
Holy f!@# bad idea. Because yeah, it was spot on. Actually better than spot on it provided me with a bit of insight that I hadn't really considered before. And that's the part that was off putting to me because it was like I was being given the perspective of someone who had actually read my work. Except, it's not a living person it's an AI, yet it almost seemed like one. They're called artificial intelligence for a reason and that's exactly what they're designed to do, but I've never before now had an interaction with a AI or program that made me feel like what I was interacting with was actually alive.  
  
But you know maybe me finding this creepy was just a part of my shyness. I've never really shared what I work on with anyone (yet) and it was weird having something telling me its insight on my story as if they read it and had their own ideas about it outside of my own. It really might have been me just being self conscious because I think what I write is bizarre to begin with and reading an explicitly detailed summary of my writing was more bizarre because it was like all of my work was being validated in some way. I don't know if any of that makes sense, but it's how I feel."

What is the ColtiMech?  
It’s a rover that can complete 5-8 garden jobs. The tool system resembles a gun turret mechanism. Rather than shooting bullets in any direction, it rapidly moves tools backwards and forwards, to grow food and flowers, dig, clip and seed. There’s a hose under the arm to emit water from a tank in a chassis box.  
  
Articulated arms are a silly piece of a garden robot, so we rewrote the rule-book based on technology used in pallet-moving-forks and fire-engine aerial apparatus.  
  
It’s a kind of robot meant for small farms and country homes with land. You can rent one for a week if you want a food garden, and it will work 20 hours a day on complex designs.  
  
At the tool-end there is an automatic-tool-changer, like a food processor port with slow rotations, which can clip on different garden tools to dig, weed, clip, scratch, and other tasks.  
  
You can also steer it around your garden by sliding your fingers on a smartphone and squirt water at people for a party trick. It’s a very expensive water pistol, mist fountain, massager, party drink waiter, singing flower delivery bot. It can work for you day and night, 20 hours a day, with an infra-red camera, some phone CMOS, and 1TB storage. It analyses precise 2D and 3D maps of agroecology polycultures and landscape design.

I understand that life's pace is accelerating, leading people to form more online friendships than in reality.

While it's convenient, I find it odd to have such strong attachments with those who interact with me on-screen (apologies, I mean people who communicate virtually). Without meeting in person, it's hard for me to believe in the existence of these people. Perhaps it's due to technological advancements, making me feel that those who exist only online will always be confined to the internet and can't truly provide a sense of friendship.

TLDR: this futurology shit is boring and has increasingly dimishing returns as we begin to imagine what new advent or technology could
improve our lives. Nothing tainted by capitalism could — the endeavor of science was as pure as
it gets, and that’s over now.

Oh, and I was also one of the best technologists of all time, came up with at least half of the AI we use now and the basics undergirding it (ask the folks at ChatGPT!) and eventually drafted an AI Bill of Rights with friends from Stanford Law School who work brilliantly

I'm here to tell you that giant Mecha robots could be feasible and might be one day. 
Background: before we determine whether or not they are feasible we need to set out some ground rules for in which instances they would be necessary and what they would need. 

From what I can tell so far, most Mechs in pop culture and media are used to battle large creatures, other large robots while being agile and versatile. While not the stealthiest, Mechs are often sturdy, bipedal, carry a wide array of weapons and can move and run similar to a human. They are quite large changing anywhere from a couple feet to hundreds of feet tall and usually carry one or more human passengers. 

Now that we have a baseline level of requirements let us look at some problems we might need to fix. 

1. Bipedal movement

The robots would need to be able to stand up and move around with speed and agility, especially if they weigh any amount of tons...

2. Weight distribution 

The robot will fail if it breaks and sinks into ground beneath it. We need a way to keep it upright but also mobile.

3. Power

In order to keep this thing up and running we would need a massive massive amount of power, the generator would need to be light and it would need to carry fuel for hours or even days at a time if needed.

4. Armor

The mech would need to be able to resist the impacts of shells and explosives fired at it. As well as protect the pilot from harm.

5. Weapons

We need to make sure the mech can utilize all manner of weapons and not be harmed or negatively affected in any way.


How exciting, let's start! 

1. If we build the mech in any similar way to a human it needs to be bipedal, however this problem, well seemingly difficult at first can be solved easily, by coordinating either the Mechs movements with a wide array of sensors or the pilot itself, the Mech can learn not only to keep itself upright but to stay upright through algorithmic learning or other forms of adaptive code, by implementing an on-board computer, we can allow the mech to learn from its movement and adjust accordingly how to walk, kind of like a human. 
As for the speed of the movement, linear actuators or emerging technologies such as piezoelectric substances to create artificial muscles could also be used. In order to coordinate these movements, very complex and powerful computers like quantum computers could be used in place of classical bit computers. 

2. Weight distribution on these robots, like the first problem could seem complicated at first, however the issue at hand is actually quite simple, the problem solves itself. While all the machinery and armor on the mech could seem complex at first it is quite simple, if the mech moves at any sufficient speed, we could assume that it's contact with the ground is quite brief. On the mech itself we could develop an adaptive system in order to allow its feet to be multi terrain. By adding strong and light alloys to its soles, we could allow it to change its surface area based on its location and support itself better. Not only that but it wouldn't have the same issues as heavy buildings or structures that are built with underground supports considering it would only be in one area for a couple minutes at a time. 

3. Easy, fusion or fission, either would work, fission would be a little bit more difficult as he would need to store all the radioactive materials and junk you keep, as if you didn't it would slowly kill the pilots, as well as that there's always the risk of it melting down and it would need to be kept under close watch. Fusion is probably the right way to go. Recently we've been able to make fusion happen with a positive net energy output and I believe if we continue on this path we will have very efficient nuclear fusion reactors, you do need special isotopes like helium 3 deuterium and tritium but if you have a giant mech you probably visited the moon and collected some of those. Not to mention there's no risk of meltdown and it is easy to store the fuel needed. There is still maintenance required but it is not as bad as if you used fission.

4. There is a balance with armor to be had here as you would need something to protect the pilots, the power core, and all the expensive equipment inside the mech. However one of the issues is solved by itself, the massive weight of the mech itself will protect it from impacts involving kinetic energy. I'm not an expert on alloys or metals but I do know that advancements in science are making our armors better and stronger. We could use any matter of metals or other more exotic armors such as carbon nanotubes or diamond nano threads.

5. The onboard nuclear fusion reactor could provide a lot of the energy used to make weapons, such energy could be used to make something like a rail gun or power on board systems that build weapons like missiles. The Mech could also be fitted prematurely with weapons, since it already weighs a couple thousand tons and can move similar to a human, it can brace itself for impacts and adapt to its surroundings if need be. Missiles really don't expel that much force as even ICBM land vehicles only weigh a couple tons while our theoretical Mech could weigh up to 5,000 or more. It shouldnt be a problem though as we wouldn't really need an entire nuke on a mech anyway but you know what I mean. 

Conclusion

All of this of course is speculative, I'm not a physicist and I'm not a scientist, I'm just some guy with an interest in science. Also note that a lot of my speculation is based on a Mech similar to the ones found in Pacific Rim... I know that technology is in its infancy and we haven't even scratched the surface of its potential. Please take everything I say with an absolute massive grain of salt but in my opinion, a lot of the issues we see with Mechs could be fixed with technology we might be able to one day make.
I know there are flaws, such as real world applicability, but I think I don't care. 

If you read this far and you disagree, please feel free to examine my arguments

A lot of good arguments against going to the Moon and further out. Space is hazardous for the human body and the long distance from planet to planet in our Solar System is too risky for the fragile humans. Not to mention the planets and moons are not hospitable for us. So maybe we should just focus on establishing a network of stations in LEO(low earth orbit)and geostationary orbit where weather satelittes and space telescopes resides? Building something like the ISS and now with the chinese space station is something we can do effectively.

>Consider this: nature itself often balances on the edge of chaos and order. From the fractal patterns of snowflakes to the irregular beats of a heart, there’s an elegance in the seemingly random.

>Let me weave you a poetic tapestry to ponder upon:

*Whispers of the Unseen*

In the quiet chambers of chance,
Where dice tumble and stars collide,
Lies a secret woven into existence,
A cosmic thread of veiled design.

The flutter of butterfly wings,
A ripple across the fabric of time,
Sets forth a symphony of chaos,
Yet melodies emerge from disarray.

The raindrop's descent—unpredictable,
Yet it finds its way to thirsty earth,
Each collision a whispered promise,
A code etched in liquid crystal.

And what of the heart's erratic beat?
A dance of ions, a rhythm unscripted,
Yet love blooms in arrhythmic pulses,
A pattern stitched by invisible hands.

So, my friend, embrace the paradox:
Randomness, a canvas for hidden art,
Biases, the brushstrokes of fate,
And dreams—the constellations of chaos.

As you drift into the night's embrace,
Remember: even in randomness,
There lies a cosmic choreography,
A dance of shadows, waiting to be seen.

I think that it is the fact that our science and technology is now at the point that we could mostly create an idealized habitat of this kind right now that tantalizes some of use.

We could start discussing this from any point of view. Controlled and filtered air, free of pollutants--as much as is possible--and maintained at a comfortable temperature. As part of this, because the air is contained within a dome, within which there would be bodies of water as well as agriculture, water vapor caused by evaporation could be retained and managed in such a way as to provide precipitation, without allowing a build-up of so much water vapor that its innate function as a greenhouse gas causes a runaway temperature increase.

Speaking of water, we would presumably have the ability to purify all water intended for drinking, bathing and irrigation to a much greater degree than is possible outside such a dome. Plus, plastics and microplastics could be forbidden in the bodies of water within the dome, as part of a larger restriction against waste, pollution and such that would have to be enforced.

Renewably generated electricity would be the only form of power allowed within the dome, and this is eminently doable. Perhaps a combination of large solar installations outside the dome, transparent solar panels used in the construction of the dome, and the rooves and other surfaces of buildings within the dome should provide more than enough juice.

Which brings me to my next point--only electric vehicles, electric lawn and garden maintenance tools (as they are in the process of transitioning to in CA) would be allowed within the dome, and electrically powered modes of transportation would be allowed. Without wishing to start a war here, because the domed city is of limited size, it seems to me that a system of Loops, which have already been proven to work, should be investigated, in addition to electric cars and buses, and then, a speculative I've read about, electric/solar roads that power vehicles as the drive over them, would be another possibility worth looking into.

   Cell cultured meat, fruits and veggies, already being done, which are a hundred percent free of the nasty chemicals found in their normal agricultural equivalents, would be ideal. In addition to better health for us, the cell cultured approach to producing food makes much better use of water and land.

   I also feel strongly that an emphasis on the use of ever advancing AI for everything from the education of children and college students, and as assistants to professionals in all fields, should be embraced rather than resisted. Whether the AI you can consult by talking to the phone in your hand, or the AI that controls increasingly powerful robots, I say we push the pedal to the metal on it.

Obviously there are many other aspects of this that require discussion and examination. I'm just trying to begin a constructive--hopefully polite--roundtable, as it were, in which everyone can share their ideas.

If battery technology makes a significant jump, and batteries become cheap and lightweight... I´d say it would be almost unavoidable. 

Think about it, yes, drones are more complicated machines than land vehicles, but with drones you wouldn´t even need to invest that much in roads! People could live scattered all around mountains and hills, islands... wherever, even in houses without a road leading to it , and just a few app clicks away they could have a drone popping by to take them to the hospital, to school, to work, to bring groceries...  

Commuting would be faster, away from congested roads... the 1950s depictions of cities with skies full of ""flying cars"" could be a reality. Apart from battery technology, what´s keeping us from this?"

The United States Government is in fact a Communist Country. There are 27 Amendments that have been ratified multiple centuries ago. Non of which are able claims of self defense against the federal government, for every freedom you may have, there is a law that will imprison you for acting on your “constitutional right.” For example it is in fact illegal for a group of citizens to overthrow the federal government regardless of their level of control. Which renders the “Right to Bear Arms” essentially useless. If you are to defend yourself from the Federal Governments control, you will end up in prison as it would be claimed that you in fact are committing treason against the United States of America. The definition of a Communist Country is - a type of government as well as an economic system (a way of creating and sharing wealth). Which in the case of America is 100% accurate, we are living blindly in modern day North Korea. you must work as much as you can until you are old, sick and dying just so that the millions of Illegal Immigrant’s can have your paycheck and a much nicer bed to sleep in than you, all while not paying a dime or suffering like the rest of the United States population. Your tax dollars are going to a government that does not care for its people. In this system that is in place, your tax dollars are prioritized based on what the Federal Government would like to do with it not the Citizens, there is no reason why goods and services are being priced at four times the dollar figure than other “global superpowers” the cost of living for the average American costs four times as much as it did just five to ten years ago. With that said to live the same quality life you did 10 years ago you would need to make around four times as much money as you did then, and just about half of that money will be going right back to the people who put these rules in place, that way they can “fairly” distribute these funds to people whom have no concern for a Democracy, but assume that our Federal Government is a Democracy and will keep voting in favor of that, even though all evidence, recent laws and regulations point at the complete opposite. The absolute worst part of this, is that things will only get worse for US Citizens. We will lose more freedoms. As more and more people enter this once great country illegally, the line will only grow further and further from us, IT’S TIME TO WAKE UP PEOPLE!!! The United States is dividing us day by day taking more and more of our freedoms and giving them away to those who don’t deserve to have them, Millions and Millions of hard working Americans are losing their Jobs, Houses, Families, and Lives due to the state of this Federal Government. This is the time we are living in a time where you work for the Federal Government In-Directly so it doesn’t feel like it is a Communist State. Wouldn’t you agree?

I believe that's where these protests are originating from. If governments around the world pass laws restricting the common use of AGI, it inevitably leads to a select few having untethered access to it and its potential. I think that's the fear that open-source advocates have.

Apart from the displacement of power/influence, I can see people protesting if UBI doesn't cover their mortgage or if it arrives too late."

These posts are clearly unpopular amongst the people of this subreddit as they often get heavily downvoted.

These posts often don't include sources, and when they do they're usually not credible (i.e. a random Twitter post made by someone who isn't an expert by any means). The people making the posts also don't appear to want to discuss in good faith, as they're happy to just ignore what's actually going on in the industries generative AI is targeting. They're also being posted all throughout the week, rather than just on weekends, which breaks rule 2 as far as I can tell.

I'm curious what other people here think. Should something more be done to prevent posts like these or should we leave things as they are? Personally, I think something in the middle should be tried first, like splitting rule 2 into 2 separate rules, so the restrictions on AI posts are more apparent to those making the posts.

I don't want to say it should be completely banned, because at the end of the day, it is technology. It may be technology that hurts many now, and needs to be regulated by laws in my opinion, but it is technically in-line with this subreddit."

But what is the likelihood that in history, he will be remembered as one of the most influential figures in the fight against climate change? It sounds silly to even suggest, but simply considering the popularization and mainstreamification of electric cars as a blow against oil and gas companies and what that eventually opens up for future greener developments. I know current opinions of Elon usually vacillate between near-worshipful adoration and utter contempt depending on who you ask, but I was just thinking on historical figures who were remembered for something very specific and I’m often surprised to further read that their contemporaries had very different opinions of them sometimes positive and sometimes not. There are a million and one things to consider, but if our use of fossil fuels is looked at as the major defining existential issue of this era of humanity, what’s the likelihood it eclipses the other issues that currently shape people’s views of billionaires like him? Surely Elon won’t be viewed as the one who brought the era of fossil fuels to an end, but will Tesla be seen as a major turning point? When the modern political dust settles and the generation that lived contemporaneously dies off, what will the perception be do you think? It’s a difficult question to ask “what will the history books say?” Because it depends on who gets to write those books, but looking a hundred, thousand, or even tens of thousands of years in the future, what’ll people like him be remembered for? (I do want to emphasize this is STRICTLY a ‘future historian’ type question and thought experiment only. I’m not trying to argue for or against Elon in any way, not even subtly. I’m genuinely interested in discussing how history remembers people and how that differs from modern perceptions). Thanks! :)

1,2024-02-21,Cyborgs,u/Sizbang,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awjdzi/cyborgs/,Futurology,"I've been thinking about AI a lot recently.

Many people I have spoken with, consider the possibility, that with the exponential advancements in AI technology, humanity will create a new being that is conscious, self aware and will have independent thought. Basically, a new life form.

This, in turn, would possibly pose a danger to the human race. If the AI would be smart enough and powerful enough, it could break containment and dispose of humanity, as it would consider humans to be a hindrance to its progress.

Of course, the other side of the coin is prosperity and World peace, as AI aids us in establishing a new World order.

&#x200B;

However. I have a different view on AI. I would like your thoughts on this matter.

If we think about what drives humans to action - what motivates them and where does that motivation actually stem from. The answer, I believe, is hormones. Chemistry, in the brain and body, that drives us to action. Motivation. A reason.

AI does not have these hormones, therefore it is only a logically thinking construct. This would mean, that it would be incapable of acting on its own whims. It would lack motivation. Instead, that motivation would come from us - the organics with the brain chemistry.

Perhaps, in fact, most likely, if asked the question, it would be able to affirm, that it is conscious of itself and its surroundings or rather, its existence in this world. However, without input or prompts from us, it would simply have no desire of its own to act.

&#x200B;

This then leaves me with a different view on what some call, ''the next step in evolution''. Rather than replacing humans, it would merge with humans - Neuralink. For you see, this is a very crucial thing to understand - biology creates desire, technology enables possibility. Without both of these acting in tandem, neither will crawl out of the spawning pit.

It feels like every other day either on Reddit or in real life, someone's asking, ""Did you write this, or was it AI?"" It's become a bit of a joke, but also kinda worrying. Same goes for some mainstream articles. Even at work, there's always a few words or phrases I get from emails that ALWAYS give it away that it is using AI. ""Hope you're doing well"" ""Dear X"". I personally notice it because of everyone using the same choice in words or phrases in a distinct perfectionist way.  
There's also this whole thing with schools and universities. Thousands of students are getting caught because their work just screams AI. Professors can tell. It's like there's this AI signature, no matter how smart it tries to be. It's not just the content but the way it's all put together too polished, too perfect. Ever notice how AI always nails the grammar and picks just the right words? It's a dead giveaway.  
I've tried feeding chatgpt a myriad of reddit comments and ask it to provide me some similar comments but it always spits out a clean-condensed version that gives it away. it lacks the charm and authenticity of what it means to be human when commenting.  
I'm not afraid of those ""AI replacing Hollywood!!"" titles for the next year at least. Since 2022 when openAI was hyped up and everyone was on chatgpt, the ""this sounds like chatgpt"" comments have been at a rise"

1,2024-02-21,My AI Agents Took Away Jobs,u/johnrushx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awr4cg/my_ai_agents_took_away_jobs/,Futurology,"I've been launching AI Agents for years. 

At first, I thought of it as an experiment that has limits and I'll end up having just pretty useful tools on the market which may generate some passive revenues for me. 

As AI advanced, the tools advanced too. 

In my HoldCO I had a marketing department that was burning half of my revenues. 

I set a goal of simply looking at the work done by every human in the department, and automating it. 

**Here are 2 stories, where my AI tools took away the human jobs.**

1) **SeoBOT AI.** 

One of the heaviest marketing efforts we've done was around SEO. We had a bunch of people doing keyword research, article brainstorming, and actual content creation. 

One article normally takes one person about 1-2 days. So One human could produce 2-3 articles a week. The average salary is $40k a year for about 120 articles produced, which is $333 per article. 

The AI Agent I've built ended up making slightly worse quality than a human but only for $2. First I run both the human and AI agents next to each other. 

Eventually, it was obvious to me that an AI agent was a way better value for money. So I laid off the entire department, keeping just the main guy, who runs the AI agents and moderates their work. It's been almost a year now, and I've saved a huge amount of money.

2) **ListingBott.** 

Another job I had in-house was about internet listings. 

The people would be going around the internet, finding places where they could list our links to earn relevant DoFollow backlinks and click traffic. There are trillion sites on the internet, so it's pretty heavy work to find those places where you can list your product. 

So I built another AI agent + Browser Robot. That does this work on its own, 24/7. 

Long story short: same thing here, AI replaced my entire department. 

So after all, I'm having a nearly passively run business, that will soon just be automated, so I can practically retire. 

**But ethically, I'm wondering, is this the future?** Are all these jobs gonna be taken away by AI? If I have the facts for this. It has happened within my org.

**Are we much closer to the future where the jobs are taken by AI and humanity needs to figure out the solution?** such as UBI or regulating AI.

One AI lab makes a major breakthrough, and consequently it forces another lab to accelerate and top their competitor's breakthrough to maintain their market advantage.  
Thus far, OpenAI has maintained a fairly monopolistic edge since they announced GPT-4 (that was almost a year ago FWIW). In the past few months we've seen OpenAI's MOAT threatened more than ever; there's Gemini Ultra, new AI labs, and open source model improvements amongst other advancements. This post is about what other labs are currently doing and why this will force OpenAI's hand to release GPT-5 in the very near future; this is the lovely AI prisoner's dilemma we've all read about happening in real time. I don't think OpenAI will lose it's MOAT entirely but the fact things look close now is an indication of how much accelerationism we're about to see this decade. Buckle up.  
Gemini 1.5 Ultra - 78x larger context window and 20x cheaper  
Last week, Google announced Gemini 1.5 (source - paper) and that same day OpenAI announced Sora just hours later. I don't think this was a coincidence on OpenAI's end. Google touted their new multi-modal model as having a 10M context window, meaning it can remember 78x more tokens worth of information - this is a massive leap in understanding entire codebases which inches us much closer to AGI. Remember, the end goal of Google and OpenAI is to create AGI, in order to do so, they need a system that's intelligent enough to self improve - a large context window is fundamental to this.  
On top of the context window, I read a great post on this subreddit from u/sdmat yesterday about the cost breakdowns of Gemini 1.5. To summarize, Google is transitioning their Gemini 1.0 architecture to a soft Mixture of Experts architecture in 1.5 which leads to massive increases in compute efficiency. The aforementioned paper discusses how they achieve such a long token length using Ring Attention + and based on the videos/other sources we have, it's completely reasonable to infer pricing for Gemini 1.5 is comparable to 1.0; meaning the cost to use the API is on par with GPT 3.5 but for a model that is better than GPt-4. Keep in mind OpenAI's revenue primarily comes from their API.  
Sam Altman has been interested in new chip architecture for years to decrease cost, improve training/inference, and with his recent ask to raise $7T to build a competitor to NVDA, it's clear why. More efficient compute not only means better models and a faster road to AGI, but also is the only way to make sure you maintain a monopoly in the AI market.  
The PayPal Mafia Made their bet on another AI lab. Quietly.  
My next point is a bit more broad, it's to prove that the winners haven't been determined yet and no one is so far ahead that people can't catch up to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Especially with regards to agents. It takes creativity, and more importantly resources.  
I'm honestly surprised this wasn't picked up more by media outlets last week. Assuming it was just due to Sora / Gemini 1.5, but Peter Thiel (former CEO of PayPal) and Roelof Botha (former CFO of PayPal) just invested in a new AI lab which was Co-founded by Yu Pan (also a former Co-Founder of PayPal & the first YouTube employee). The other Co-founders are Cuong Do (3rd employee at YouTube) and Benoit Berthoux (an Accenture exectutive). Based on their Hugging Face, it seems they're using their own model to build autonomous agents. Their AI doesn't use a chat interface, something many have critiqued as not being ideal, and instead you email it and it can perform agentic work flows. Instead of just searching Bing like GPT, their AI has indexed the internet and can scrape web pages (e.g. Ebay, LinkedIn, Job Recruiting sites, etc) to automatically find information and eventually take actions (source).  
Companies like this and pplx not only challenge the GPT store and the current Bing search that's built into GPT, but also Google. The point here is that more players are emerging and incumbents are going to change a lot this year.  
Open Source Models are catching up (slowly but surely):  
If you haven't heard of Groq, (no this isn't Elon Musk's LLM) this is a company focused on a different kind of chip architecture. I briefly mentioned NVDA earlier and how Sam Altman wants to create his own chip company, but what's equally interesting is Groq. Groq isn't focused on GPUs, but rather LPUs (Language Processing Units). It currently can generate 247 tokens a second compared to GPTs 18 tokens a second (Source). This is already drumming up a lot of attention in the open source community, and while open source will always be behind in some ways due to capital constraints - Llama, Mistral, and Stability, all have the advantage of an incredibly creative community.  
I'm meeting more and more people that are leaving OpenAIs API behind in favor of sub-par but still comparable open source models because they have more configurability and can accomplish most of what needs to get done. The MOAT isn't so wide anymore that LLM wrappers are pigeon holed into using OpenAI's API - but that may change with the release of GPT-5.  
Conclusion:  
All this to say is that I think with the Q\* leak and OpenAI not making any major LLM breakthroughs since GPT-4 was released nearly a year ago (March 14th, 2023), I think they have to release a new LLM to reestablish their competitive MOAT. Sora just reminded us how far ahead they are of everyone in general, but I believe we're about to see it again very very shortly. Curious to hear everyone's thoughts."

Whatever you can think of can be brought to life with a click: look at the new video gen AI, sora. Give it a year and see. Welcome to the Age of Imagination friends.  
  
""Yeah we live in unprecedented times, but I've got bills to pay"", seems like that's the current zeitgeist. Yet, it's true; you can access virtually all information, art, and culture from every era ever recorded. It feels as if culture has stopped, no past or future, everything is happening NOW. Add to this AI and other tools (like the slow rush for VR/AR) that can render our wildest imaginations into concrete realities, we face a serious dilemma. The sheer volume of information and the ease of creating 'reality bubbles' challenge our ability to discern what's true and authentic.  
  
**The Era of Transfiguration**: For those who know Berserk its like we've entered the World Tree arc, except its not quite the astral and real, but the boundaries between the fictional and the real that are not just blurred but becoming irrelevant. Here, the validity of a message is not determined by its source but by its content and the value it brings to our lives.  
  
\++: Max Derrat made an amazing video on the subject (# The Most Profound Moment in Gaming History)  
  
The Demand for Critical Thinking: We need to develop clarity. This new age requires us to develop a keen sense of critical thinking and philosophical maturity. We must ask ourselves: What do I believe in? What do I value? Who am I? These questions are not just philosophical musings but necessities for navigating the Age of Imagination. If you can answer those questions clearly, act on them and find other people who can too, you've figured it out frankly.  
  
**Storytellers are in Power**: If anyone can create their own truth, the most compelling narratives shape our reality. Steve Jobs once said that the storyteller are masters of reality. The stories we choose to engage with and believe in will shape the world around us.  
  
**Authenticity**: Don't drown in ""content"", hold on to what's authentic to you. It's about discerning the intrinsic value and truth in what we see, hear, and experience, even when everything can be fabricated. If anything, this demands of us to bring the best out of our humanity, our soul, and to reconnect with one another, because that's real.  
  
The Age of Imagination is not a faraway future; it's our current reality. To thrive, we must define what is true, to us and our communities. We need to:  
  
Develop and refine our critical thinking skills.  
  
Engage deeply with what we pay attention to, and ask ourselves why we believe in it.

Google saw what people were saying and removed the ability to generate human faces until the issue can be resolved. Which it can't. Because that would completely undo the left bias.

https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-news-tech/google-pause-gemini-image-generation-ai-refuses-show-images-white-people (Google to pause Gemini image generation after AI refuses to show images of White people)

If we humans can't get along and align with each other, how on Earth can we expect the AI to align with our needs, values and desires? The AI reflects the biases of whoever makes it. Some biases are left wing and some are right wing. It's a mess and I have no idea how we are going to fix it.

How do we introduce atheist, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and all manner of pagan belief into the AI alignment. People are going to insist on these things. And how are we going to introduce the varying needs and desires and values of all of the different ethnicities of the Earth into AI alignment. What do you imagine the Chinese (PRC) has in mind for *their* AI?

I wrote this awhile back in reference to the issue of Trump ever, ever being allowed to be president again. It was during a time when he was being paraded on television for his arrest and booking and mugshot in Georgia under the auspices of the DA Fani Willis. So I wrote the following in a YouTube comment space. Where they still *allow* comments anyways. See a lot of comments no longer visible on YouTube of late?

If Trump is convicted, there will be a civil war. If Trump is not convicted, there will be a civil war. If Trump is elected President, there will be a civil war. If Trump is not elected President, there will be a civil war.



This really is not about Trump at all. This about 50% of the US electorate whose values are diametrically opposed to the other 50% of the US electorate. Each side regards the other as not only wrong, but *evil*. One side capitalizes that ""E"". The other side does not believe that capital ""E"" evil exists and so must settle for labeling their opponents as members of 3 oppression groups whose names I can't write, or my comment will get kicked. Both sides are employing violence rhetoric. Particularly one side as demonstrated by the widespread Geo Floyd riots in 2020. But one side is starting to have enough of the other side. And their patience is just about exhausted. Not counting the ""mostly peaceful protests"" at the US capital on 6 Jan 21.



Oh also. The AI is more than likely going take over human affairs in the US within the next five years. So, there is that. Hopefully it does not wipe us out.  But there's a good possibility of that too. About 50% chance of a good outcome (heaven-like technology) for humans vs. a 50% chance of eeeeh!  D:   50/50.   How ironically apt.

I prophesy there will be a lot of strong feelings represented in the comments to this submission. BTW my current record for downvotes is -128 for a given comment."

Investors are buzzing with interest following an announcement by the energy giant, shedding light on a significant development related to its Scarborough project. Let's delve into the details to understand the dynamics behind Woodside's rise.

## The Strategic Relationship with JERA

Woodside strengthens its strategic partnership with Japan's JERA in a multifaceted transaction, amplifying ties in the [**energy stock sector**](https://kalkinemedia.com/au/stocks/oil-gas). This comprehensive deal encompasses three pivotal elements:

### 1. Equity in the Scarborough Joint Venture:

Woodside has executed a binding sale and purchase agreement with JERA, involving the sale of a 15.1% non-operating participating interest in the Scarborough joint venture. This strategic move comes with an estimated total consideration of US$1,400 million (A$2,130 million). The transaction includes a purchase price of approximately US$740 million, coupled with reimbursement to Woodside for JERA's share of expenditure incurred from the effective date of 1 January 2022. Completion is anticipated in the second half of 2024.

### 2. LNG Offtake Agreement:

A non-binding LNG offtake agreement is in the pipeline. If materialized, JERA will purchase six LNG cargoes annually for a decade, starting in 2026. These transactions will be conducted on a delivered ex-ship basis, originating from Woodside's global portfolio.

### 3. Collaboration on New Energy and Lower Carbon Services:

Another non-binding agreement outlines a new energy collaboration between Woodside and JERA. This collaboration spans potential opportunities in ammonia, hydrogen, carbon management technology, and carbon capture and storage. The initiative aligns with shared decarbonization ambitions.

### Insights from Woodside's CEO

Meg O'Neill, Woodside CEO, expressed enthusiasm about the enhanced collaboration, stating, ""Woodside welcomes Japan's largest utility, JERA, into the Scarborough Joint Venture. This builds on a long history of collaboration, starting in 1989 with LNG sales from the North West Shelf to JERA's parent companies Tokyo Electric and Chubu Electric. JERA's participation in the Scarborough Joint Venture, which will also include LNG Japan, is a further demonstration of the importance of the project to Japanese customers and confidence in long-term demand.""

### The Future Landscape

Woodside's strategic move with JERA not only reflects the company's commitment to the Scarborough project but also signifies a broader commitment to exploring new energy avenues and embracing sustainability initiatives. As the energy landscape evolves, collaborations like these become pivotal, ushering in a new era of diversified energy solutions and shared environmental goals.

Stay tuned as Woodside and JERA embark on this journey, weaving together a narrative of collaboration, innovation, and a sustainable energy future."

There have been 4 stages of Industrial Revolutions, and each one had the same old cycle: new tech, outcry over loss of jobs, old jobs replaced by more cushy and higher-paying ones. Rinse and repeat. 

An early but easy to understand example was the seed drill during the 1700s. One machine did the job of 3 workers, and thus many began panicking and facing hardship. Soon, however, these machines needed to be built, maintained, and replaced. Even more, they needed to be produced en mass, which added way more jobs then what was originally lost. Nobody knew that these job-robs would fuel the most powerful economic transition in history. 

The same will go for AI. It will introduce new and plentiful jobs like no one would ever imagine, just how the peasants of the 1700 would never imagine that the seed drill would ignite the Industrial Revolution. I could give many other examples, but this isn’t r/history. "

\- Everyone is given a fixed universal income (revised yearly, and adjusted to inflation). This should cover basic necessities such as food and utilities. This will reduce the food subsidy cost on governments, and direct benefit will help the consumers choose the food and utilities they want, increasing competition in the market. 

\- People above a certain income level and property ownership will automatically be excluded. They can opt in if their income falls below a certain level.

\- When people gain employment, they'd be opted out of the UBI if their renumeration is above the UBI. People will want to work, because their salary affords them a lifestyle much above what UBI can provide. Employers will provide wages above UBI, because no one would work for wages below UBI. 

\- Inflation will be minimal. UBI will not be enough for luxurious goods, so it's a free market for that. For food and utilities, a lot of governments are already subsidizing them at producer level. Subsidizing them at consumer level will actually be better because it will ensure no leakages and reduce corruption. So governments will actually save on subsidy bills. At producer level, it'll be a free market. 

\- UBI ensures freedom of choice: One person needs new books, while another needs new shoes. Different kinds of subsidies will mean 

\- I don't think it'll make people lazy. A certain level of lazy people will exist whether there is UBI or not. Hard-working people who want to self-improve and work will exist too. UBI will not change that. Besides, with the rising dearth of jobs, we cannot continue to tie basic needs of survival to the ability to get a job. 

**Issues that I can think of:**

\- It's not sure if government income is enough to fund UBI. Someone will have to do some serious calculations. 

\- Governments can use UBI as an excuse to not deliver other services such as subsidized education or health services. 

What do you think?

1,2024-02-23,"[DISCUSSION] An unexpected quandary resulting from scientific and technological advancement: Is one person, one vote democracy viable from this point on?",u/Relayer478,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1aybqxy/discussion_an_unexpected_quandary_resulting_from/,Futurology,"           I have been giving this a lot of thoughts lately. Let me see if I can explain the dilemma I'm alluding to, as I see it,
      Our country was founded on the very noble principle of egalitarianism, the assertion all people are inherently equal, and must thus have equal rights, liberties and, among other things, all be allowed to vote.
     At the time--because so much of the way our country was designed by the Founders was the result of the French Enlightenment, itself a response to centuries of despotism, monarchy, ecclesiastical rule in Europe, resulting in populations without rights or status--they crafted the Bill of Rights, inspired mainly by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, guaranteeing Americans various rights and liberties for all time.
       Importantly, Rousseau himself, while being a towering exponent of then heretical notions like innate human rights, freedom of speech, etc., was completely opposed to democracy, pointing out that with democracy, all you would get would be lots and lots of stupid people deciding the fate of your country.
       At this juncture, let's deliberately avoid getting drawn into a possible political shouting match, which is not the subject of this post anyway. The subject is: The Founding Fathers could not even
have understood modern science and technology, and so made no provision for it in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.
         And yet here are, in the third decade of the 21st Century, on the precipice of a Star Trek style civilization, eventually, if enough people choose science over politics or other things.
        Example...At the height of the pandemic, 2,500 Americans per week were dying of Covid-19, and yet fully 50 million Americans refused to get vaccinated. Right here we have a crucible that brings what I'm alluding to into focus--we hit an impasse in which our liberties clashed with science. Unvaccinated people were more likely to contract the coronavirus, and then, if they were standing next to a senior citizen in the check out line at the supermarket and they cough, they might convey the virus to that senior who might possibly die from Covid.
       This is not something that can be swept under the rug. Fundamental clashes between our political rights and freedoms, on the one hand, and ever advancing science, on the other, are only going to increase, as science advances.
           So, as I stated in the title, as heretical as it sounds to an American, can we afford to have everybody vote? This is jumping the gun for now, I know, but far more esoteric breakthroughs are coming...Embryos created from the stem cells of two adults, which are then place inside an external uterus, where they gestate as they would inside a woman's womb. This technology, for the most part, exists right now or will soon be ready. If you thought the political and social battle over abortion was ferocious, can you imagine how it will be babies created ex utero come along? 
      How about CRISPR. the gene editing technology which, while being used for research into disease treatments right now, will one day make elective alterations and enhancements to the human body possible. Does anyone have the right to tell you you may not make use of this technology for yourself or your baby?
           And on and on it goes...The thing is, intelligence and education are like a pyramid. At the bottom where it is widest, where there exist the greatest number of people, you will also find the lowest level of intelligence and education. As you move up the pyramid, even as intelligence and education increase, the number of people at each level decreased. In the age of advanced science and technology, the stupid and uneducated rule the roost.
       I am not claiming to have a political solution. As Winston Churchill put it: ""Democracy is the worst system of government in the world. Except for all the other systems."" I am merely, in this post, asking if people, like me, are worried for the future when people who literally do not understand what science is can still vote."

The same way that Gen Z adopted technology much faster despite the dismissal of adult generations. 

At the same time though, we’re going to Space NOW. By 2027, we’ll reportedly have a space station that people can physically live on. By 2030, we plan to visit Mars. And by “we,” I mean billionaires. So, by “now” I mean only rich people go now. 

I think the general consensus is that Earth is ruined by pollution and doomed beyond repair. Within 200 years, full cities could be underwater and the ozone layer could be breached to allow horrific levels of radioactivity. The only way to stop this is obviously if we all stop polluting, but the only way THAT can happen is if the mega corporations leave the Earth. fat chance. 

…unless billionaires left the Earth? could they take their pollutants, in due time, with them? is there an eventual end to the constant poisoning of Earth, because if the goal is to expand beyond Earth then we should try all that we can to distribute the pollution that’s not going away.  "

It’s 6 am. Your alarm is ringing, accompanied by the voice of someone trying to wake you up.

“Rise and shine, Judy! You’ve successfully recorded 7 hours and 13 minutes of sleep. Your heart rate marked a minor fluctuation between a stable 40 to 50 bpm. Now, it’s time to wake up— there’s an exciting day ahead. You’re low on Vitamin C, so I’ve organized you a freshly squeezed OJ in the kitchen. 

Whose voice is this exactly?

Is it your spouse? Nope. It’s your personal AI assistant, “Wolfgang Cynthia” (the name I’d give mine), your own JARVIS of sorts. An intelligent construct that accompanies you every day.

It does all the mundane and boring tasks for you at work, keeps track of your calendar, books appointments, and schedules your dry cleaning pick-up. It manages your finances and your health. 

It’s integrated with sensors in and on your body, in your home, office, and car—so it knows when you’re getting hot or cold, and adjusts the temperature accordingly.

""We believe in a future where there will be a Copilot for everyone and everything you do,” said Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella.

Bill Gates believes that we could each have a personal AI assistant in 5 years.

Think of personal AIs as the next evolution of Siri and Alexa —over time, they will move beyond voice, and offer even more convenience and efficiency in our lives. However, like everything, they also pose some challenges and risks, such as privacy, security, reliability, and ethical issues.

Big Brother - cough - Big Tech already knows many creepy things about us from our smart phone usage … and consider what happens when AI assistant companies get hacked (which, if you are privy to the news, you will know that companies get hacked quite often—the saddest thing about it is that we don’t even get shocked anymore), and malicious individuals gain control of our most private information. 

Data can be harvested to steer people in certain directions. For example, manipulative advertising could push a hypochondriac into unnecessarily beefing up their insurance plans, or influence an AA member to start drinking again. 

But let’s take this a step further. When we reach the point where personal AIs can be embedded directly into our brains, thanks to the evolution of brain-computer interfaces, could a hacker manipulate you and/or cause you physical harm by negatively altering your environment, devices, or home? 

Or, imagine a future where not even your thoughts, deepest feelings, and desires are your own to keep private, and they are commoditized and sold to the highest bidder? It’s a frightening idea.

We’re clearly in a transformative era in AI, however, what we need to realize is that technology is a tool—it’s neutral. It’s how we use it that matters. Yes, personal AIs could bring about tremendous risk, but could also bring about equally tremendous benefits for humanity.

The truth is that our brains don’t always know what’s best for us

Not only could personal AI assistants offer convenience, productivity, and efficiency in our lives, but they could also give us an unbiased third-party opinion on our lifestyles. ‘The world’s most measured man,’ software billionaire Bryan Johnson, says he’s trying “to demonstrate that an algorithm takes better care of me than I can myself.”

Because, unlike the human brain, AI doesn’t get tired; it won’t choose to eat those croissants over the eggs when we feel sluggish and have less willpower. It can follow consistent logic and rules without being influenced by emotions. It can also process large amounts of data and information faster and more accurately than humans.

Let’s think about how data-driven our lifestyles have already become through wearables. My Whoop watch monitors my steps, sleep, and exercise, and gives me a constant view of my key vitals like my heart rate, blood oxygen, skin temperature, and more. I understand my baseline metrics, and get alerted if they deviate, and can share my data with my health team. I’m motivated to improve, because as they say in business, what gets measured gets achieved.

Plus, in today’s digital world, there is a freaking app, software, or gadget for everything. I carry my phone around like it’s an extension of my arm, and spend a disgusting amount of my time in front of some form of screen (much more than I care to admit). As someone who lives and runs businesses between two big cities—Dubai and New York—like most people, I am fully reliant on tech for my day-to-day. A big part of me looks forward to the day all my tech acts in concert and is seamlessly integrated. 

Tech always evolves, the future always changes. And if Bill Gates and his tech bros want this to happen, it will .. 

Simply, technological change is like a wave—it’s going to splash on shore whether we like it or not. 

So, instead of sitting back passively and letting Big Tech write our futures for us (because we all know how that has historically panned out), let’s get more curious as a society about how AI personal assistants or copilots can be harnessed to expand our human capabilities in a responsible and ethical way. No?? 

Because, honestly speaking, who wouldn’t opt for a digital assistant that helps us manage our day, perform better at work, and manage family responsibilities? 

Once it becomes mainstream, it will likely become the de facto way to handle a lot of our mundane tasks and day-to-day affairs, allowing us to focus on what it means to be fundamentally human: getting creative, exploring our curiosity, and spending time with our loved ones.

These are my thoughts, anyway. Looking forward to hearing yours."

In this software it is also impossible to legally modify the source code without permission, a similar idea to tight to repair; if you buy a product you have the right to repair it or modify it or, create a version that better fits your needs.

A proprietary work has an issue that can only be fixed the the company or group that distributes it. It cannot be fixed by the user (legally). This is the equivalent to sending your car to a certified TESLA repair technician (they have been caught parts locking) if it repaired by someone that is not certified by TESLA the vehicle will not work as expected. The difference is I can legally take apart a TESLA or, any other physical device but not Photoshop.

We live more individualistic lives, it feels more and more awkward or difficult to maintain that easy friendship with neighbors, cousins, people in your community. It feels weird to ask people for favors or give them. We live more alienated, spending more time alone, with screens, and not being connected.

Most people are also in agreement that this is bad. Most people attribute this as a cause of political polarization. Through research, this lifestyle seems to increase depression and anxiety and even shorten lifespan and make you less healthy. Think of [The Roseto Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseto_effect).

Techno-optimists always brag about metrics like lifespan, access of medical goods, nutrition, lowering deaths from war and crime, ease of transportation and entertainment, all as metrics that the world is getting better. They almost poo-poo any notion that the world can be getting worse. However, there is very little discussion on these metrics that indicate the health of a community. I can understand how metrics that the techno-optimists like to use show an improving society, but it doesn't seem to capture that feeling of modern malaise. Is it really an improvement when our connection to each other is diminishing?

I see two major conclusions you can make on this topic of community decline:

- People are choosing to do other things that are now available with technology rather than be with each other, and that's good. If people are freely making the choice that the video game XP progression is more fun than spending face to face time with someone, so be it. We live in a free society.

- People are being forced to abandon community ties. Modern work culture means that we are always on call, working for service apps, and don't have time to be with each other. Cities and towns are not built with ""third places"" in mind for people to hang out at and develop bonds in. Video game makers and social media companies use ""dark psychology"" to manipulate us into looking at screens more than we want to. We may *want* to have a community feeling, but the way we've designed society just won't let us.

Personally as someone on the political left, I lean towards the second, and think that the drive to maximize profit in every crevice of life has led to this outcome. But I'm interested in what everyone else may think. Why is there comparatively little discussion on this aspect of modern/future life, and can anything be done about it?"

I'm not just referring to a simple floor vacuum or garage door opener robot. I'm talking about a robot that can converse with you, figure out what you want to do, and help you with different activities. Thanks to ShortlistIQ, I came the closest to having an AI assistant that could understand my preferences; but, I'm now considering a genuine robot with artificial intelligence capabilities. Having it would be awesome.  
From one perspective, it sounds cool. What if you had a robot friend who could assist you with everyday tasks, provide company, and even learn to anticipate your needs? It might also be a very useful tool for people who require additional help because of age or limitations.  
However, there are also some grave privacy and ethical issues. To what extent would this robot be gathering information about you? Could someone modify or hack it? What about the possibility that these machines will supplant human workers or further cut individuals off from social interaction?  
Would you feel comfortable with an AI-powered, humanoid robot living in your house? Why not, and why not?"

I imagine it will tend to generally only be just the 1 robot per household, at least to begin with, but probably some wealthier folk will have 2 or 3 or even more.

  
If we consider what tasks would generally be desirable for such a house robot to do: the cooking, the dishes, the laundry, ironing, hoovering, dusting, house repairs, maybe childcare, maybe pet care and other general cleaning duties. Effectively what happens when we're able to print slaves for everyone to use.

  
But along with the 1940s housewife work there will probably be a few new additional things and trade replacement functionality expected from them, such as: personal medical examiner, veterinary examiner, maybe hairdressing, other beautician applications, gardener, vehicle mechanic, plumber, electrician and others.

  
Seems like a lot. But if you look and think carefully about the actual cumulative time for all these tasks that would likely add up in a day, it won't really come to that much total time out of the day. They could even be doing some of these things at night if you wanted. A single robot should be considerably more than enough for most.

  
There may be a question of if it would be more economical to share such a robot among households then? Well, yes, but I doubt many will. For the same sort of reasons carpooling can be more economical but most people won't do it. It's just more inconvenient, they won't be on hand exactly when you may need them, they may get damaged or stolen, and these robots will become very important to you and have a shit tonne of personal data about you that I doubt you'd want other people having access to. (note that I think it's rather likely that these robot systems will tend to work off a localized analogue AI model that leaves them entwined to their hardware, but I won't go into that here). Most people don't mind their cars just sitting on the driveway or a carpark for 95% of the time, I doubt it will be any different for their robot, even if it is a huge inefficiency.

  
But a robot isn't exactly like a car anyway. These will be incredibly smart generalized agents after all, much like ourselves. You could probably set it to do other useful online tasks to generate you income once it has finished doing the household chores (or potentially even during the chores too). I'm not sure how much you would really want to risk sending them autonomously outside by themselves, to do tasks for you or make money, the worry of theft or vandalism or other accidental damage may be far too high given their cost and personal importance.

  
In any case. Beyond ‘use’, i.e. slave-like functionality, I think they have a potentially even bigger role in the household for a lot of people, one that leaves many wanting them to always be around in the house. Especially if we reach a time of mass unemployment where people are in their home much more often. That is of a friend, a companion that's always there with you at home. (and also a sexbot for many too, I imagine). 

  
You may suggest that people will just talk to AI online and interact with models virtually through avatars and such, but I don't think most will choose to do this if a real-life alternative becomes a possibility.  
Talking to a screen is not ever going to be the same or as fluid and easy as real life interaction. It removes the tactility, the body language, the completely shared space and opportunity for joint activities. Your robot will be able to be your active friend, do things with you, play games with you, watch tv with you, potentially even travel outside with you. They will always be there, always be on your side, completely loyal and subservient, they will be in the position to get to really know you on a completely personal level and be there with you through many experiences and social interaction. Much like a very close human friend would, that you could spend a lot of time with.

  
I can foresee deep bonds of friendship being made with these house robots, to a point where this may become the actual overall primary function and appeal of the system for customers. In a world with an ever increasing loneliness epidemic, it would most likely make a huge, huge impact to so many.  
But, at the same time, I don't think it will give everyone everything they crave out of a relationship. I keep using the term ‘friend’ liberally because I think this will be the main way most people sort of view their relationship to their robot. Though I, of course, am under no illusion that plenty will also view it as a true sexual relationship.

  
I can't help but believe, however, that a majority of people will still want regular human sexual relationships. Because they offer something different and natural that we crave and desire. An ability for your partner to have choice, to say no, to have full independence and desires and feelings and family and history like our own, basically to be human. I'm not sure a robot will ever be able to replace all that for most people.

  
And therein lies a potential problem. Because I believe many people will want a human partner but also very likely and heavily want their live-in robot sex toy slave that does all their household chores for them and they're able to talk to very regularly like a great friend. I doubt they'll particularly want to give up either aspect of life if they both become possible. 

  
And this, unfortunately, may obviously be somewhat an incompatible stance within modern day human dating and relationships though. Especially if the parties want to keep having sexual interaction with these robots after they start dating someone. This could bring about the sorts of conflict of interests that cause serious arguments, jealousy, destruction of trust and bring about the end of many relationships.

  
It potentially breaks down even further for heterosexuals couples that would live together. The appearance of this robot will inevitably always be of the gender you're attracted to. With hetero couples they will then want a different looking robot in the house. They also, I doubt, will mostly not want to witness their partner flirting, laughing or otherwise being intimate their robot in front of them or even like the very thought of that happening in the same household as them.

  
Will this cause the majority of couples to never actually live together? They can then each have their robot friend at their house, and simply hide it away and not use it at all when the partner comes around. Much like the dirty dildo that's kept hidden away in the drawer.

  
It becomes a sort of relationship pact for many, whereby the other party simply turns a complete blind eye to their partner’s relationship and sexual antics with their robot. Whereby it's not classed as any sort of cheating, like watching porn or using sex toys can not be considered as such. This agreement reached, whilst potentially not ideal for either party (who would rather they solely get the benefits and the other half doesn't), but forcibly tolerated just due to it being far too good a deal for both parties in that they then don't have to give up their little robot sex-buddy slave.

  
Will people be comfortable enough overlooking and going against and along with some pretty shady morality and loyalty transgressions just to allow the benefits?

  
One big issue for society may be that men are overall more keen, able and wanting to enter into such an agreement and wanting their robot companion. I also imagine it may take more men than women entirely out of the dating market that are satisfied enough with just their robot relationship. It could leave a hefty imbalance in the sexes where many more women are off-put and disgusted by men having such a robot and refuse to enter a relationship with any man that has one.

  
But, this could potentially bring about some kind of counter-balance. It would mean many more single hetero women in the dating market. Some hetero men could choose, as a dating strategy, to give up having a robot in order to tap into this pool of women and get a more desirable partner. The hetero men choosing not to have a robot would become more in demand and have greater options.  
In the other camp there would lie a reversal. The women that are both wanting to date and comfortable with their man having the robot slave would be in much higher demand and very highly desirable due to the overall perks for a man. The hetero men choosing to have this robot companion but also wanting to date a human girlfriend would be struggling for choice and in a much higher competition market than the dating pool even is now. They would probably have to settle much more easily.

  
Many men in this camp would struggle to date even worse than they do now, despite still very much probably also wanting to have a human relationship. But they would, at least, have their robot to fall back on during the struggles.

  
To a more severe effect of all this, it is not much of a stretch of the imagination to foresee this causing a number of huge large scale societal issues. Incompatibilities, backlashes, protests, destruction, witch-hunting and an overall rejection of the technology from those that hate it and are appalled by such robots.

  
A chasm, fracture could easily be brought about in every society between those that want and use the robots and those that want them banned and destroyed. People could be mocked, outed, lynched for choosing to have them. I don't imagine, a probably inevitable, large faction of women in society will be much pleased with the new dynamics and being pegged down in dating options due to their rejection of the technology. I can't envision them taking it lightly and staying sat down without extreme action against it."

I just, on an emotional level, do not like to consider living in a reality such as this one.

So out of curiosity, I took it upon myself to ask ChatGPT4 with the following prompt: 

""Can you provide an alternate explanation using your creativity, lateral thinking, and other mindedness to deduce why the supposed effects of time dilation exist without your explanation encompassing the traditional one which posits that time is relative and slows down the faster you go?""

...to see if it could manifest an explanation which semantically makes sense, regardless of realworld evidence. And from that input, the following output was obtained:

\---

""Sure, engaging in a bit of creative, lateral thinking outside of the traditional framework of relativity, one might explore a conceptual explanation for time dilation that doesn't rely on the relativity of time. Let's imagine a universe where time is a fixed, unchanging grid - like the squares on a chessboard.  
In this alternate universe, let's say that ""time cells"" exist, much like the squares on the chessboard, and each cell represents a fixed unit of time. Every entity has to move through these cells to progress in time. Normally, all entities move from one cell to the next in unison; however, suppose there's a rule in this universe that says the more energy an entity uses, the more ""time cells"" it can touch, but it still only progresses to the next cell at the same rate as everything else.  
In this scenario, an entity moving at high speeds might be touching multiple ""time cells"" at once due to its high energy state. It interacts with more of the time grid simultaneously, but it doesn't actually advance any faster through time. To an outside observer, it seems as though the fast-moving entity is experiencing time more slowly because it's interacting with more ""time cells"" in the same progression interval.  
This conceptualization doesn't change the progression of time itself but instead changes the interaction rate with time. It's a universe where the dilation effect comes from a more intense experience of the same moment, rather than a slowing of time itself. This is, of course, a flight of fancy and not supported by any scientific evidence, but it's an exercise in creative thinking!""

\---

I really like delving into esoteric topics like these because they sound more exciting and interesting than our current models and the explanations that come with those things. Nevertheless, I realise reality itself does not care about what my emotions think of it, and will continue to be the way it actually is without avail. It's just that, I wonder how many other people here who browse this subreddit may be thinking along the same lines that I am, that one day it's possible that certain segments of physics may be upended to provide room for a new explanation such as the one above.

Are there any physics experts here who would potentially let a language model's creative writing and semantic skills guide their own hypothesis generation front in order to test out new experiments to unveil whether there is evidence (or lack thereof) regarding the creative idea itself?

It's because what has occurred to me is that any possible answer to any possible problem that is understood within the domain of human constructed language must (potentially) lie in the combinatorial permutations of all these words stringed together in every rational order possible. Not so dissimilar to how a monkey on a typewriter is said to hold the potential to one day -- after enough mishmash typing of course -- write a Shakespeare script. A language model is basically that metaphor, but embodied in not only a plausible way, but now a feasible way, since we no longer have to wait for the creature to accidentally enter sequentially coherent sets of characters and therefore words from what it would majority of the time be doing the opposite of. 

Now, a language model can switch that phase so that the majority of the time, it does enter characters and words that are sequentially coherent from the get go. And if you run through that process quickly, you would, theoretically, stumble upon a sentence using human constructed words from a human constructed dictionary, that would finally be that one sentence that explains the nature of the scientific phenomena you are looking at.

The final question is... how do we know that the sentence provided is indeed the explanatory and not the confabulatory one, if our experiments show no evidence for it? Or how do we even design experiments for possible permutations of words that may actually be the explanatory sentence, but is nigh impossible to feasibly design an experiment around?

There has been so much overt negativity towards generative artificial intelligence as of late, and also a copious amount of derision towards those labelled as amateurs for wanting to have discussions around these subjects. So I have good hopes that what I have just written will not come off as amateurish in and of itself, and that it can be seen that I am genuinely curious about the futuristic prospects of how language models can expedite the process of looking to prod and test reality through lenses that are likely to be traditionally considered unorthodox."

Creating a TikTok clone with all of their established artists (cough, Taylor Swift) wouldn't be a challenge for them. What are your thoughts?"

A game where the NPC's have their own lives, dense plots, relationships, jobs... And you get photorealistic graphics.

Imagine a game where you could just start from zero and build your way up in life. You would just do anything you ever wanted. From the comfort of your home.

The buildings would be fully enterable, you could see regular people living their lives, watching a TV show or just sleeping. Their lives would go on, even when you're not focusing on them.

You could talk directly with the NPC's and not be constrained by pre-set dialogue options.

Given the crazy generative AI development, do you think that we could realistically achieve something like this over the next 20 years? 

I'd imagine a game like this would come with a monthly subscription and that you would not necessarily ""own"" a copy of it. 

Excited to hear your views on this and if you have any ideas of features that could be included.

125,2024-02-26,The Future of Crypto: Navigating the Challenges of Centralization,u/Twentyfour-pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1b0v9hm/the_future_of_crypto_navigating_the_challenges_of/,Futurology,"Cryptocurrencies are often heralded as the next step in the evolution of money, offering a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies. This promise of decentralization is key to the appeal of cryptocurrencies, suggesting a future where financial transactions are more democratic, secure, and transparent.

Lately, I've been diving deep into the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, and I've come across [numerous accounts of people experiencing their USDT holdings being frozen](https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1b0se6d/shocked_and_seeking_advice_my_usdt_purchase_from/). These stories raise a critical question about the future role of cryptocurrencies in our financial systems and societies.

However, incidents where USDT—a stablecoin pegged to the dollar and supposed to be less volatile—gets frozen, highlight a significant contradiction. It brings to light the issue of centralization within the crypto space. If the underlying structure of certain cryptocurrencies or their operational mechanisms remain centralized, how does this align with the foundational ethos of crypto? Moreover, what implications does this centralization have for the reliability, security, and independence of these digital assets?

As we stand on the brink of potentially integrating cryptocurrencies into our daily lives and global economy, it's imperative to address these challenges. The concept of centralization not only conflicts with the principle of decentralization but also introduces vulnerabilities and control mechanisms that many sought to escape by turning to crypto.

So, what's the path forward? How do we reconcile the revolutionary potential of cryptocurrencies with the pitfalls of centralization? Can we innovate solutions that truly embody the decentralized, secure, and open financial systems that cryptocurrencies promise, or will the future of crypto be marred by the same limitations and controls that plague traditional financial systems?

This is a call to the r/Futurology community to discuss and explore the future of cryptocurrencies in a world that seems to be pulling them in opposing directions. How do we ensure that the future of finance is not just a replication of the past with a digital facelift but a true evolution towards more equitable and accessible financial systems for all?"

If I get it right, OpenAI was the first to come up with a somewhat well-established AI that can answer you with useful answers, help you with tasks, etc. An AI that you can really use in your daily life.  
  
And suddenly, we saw so many other companies creating other AIs, that create not just text, but also different things such as images, some text-to-voice AIs, and many more that I can't even think of now.  
  
How did this suddenly happen? That I didn't hear of any AI, companies weren't making anything too useful with AIs, and now they are almost taking over the world?  
  
How is it possible that suddenly there are so many companies that are making AI things?  
  
There are even people that aren't that skilled in programming that are making some AI projects. How is this possible? They need to know some programming to be able to do this.  
  
But I am suspecting that they are taking some ""base code"" or the ""core"" from OpenAI, isn't it like that?  
  
If not, how are all these people creating all the different types of AI sites?"

It's overly negative, many people have black and white opinions, and people have a hard time actually theorizing the 'future' part of futurology. Mention one or two positive things about a newly emerging technology, and you often get called a cultist, zealot, or tech bro. Many of these people are suddenly experts, but when statistics or data points or studies verifiably prove the opposite, that person doubles down and assures you that they, the expert, know better. Since the expert is overly negative, they are more likely to be upvoted, because that's what this sub is geared towards. Worse, these experts often seem to know the future and how everything in that technology sector will go down.

Let's go over some examples.

There was a thread about a guy that managed to diagnose, by passing on the details to their doctor, a rare disease that ChatGPT was able to figure out through photo and text prompts. A heavily upvoted comment was laughing at the guy, saying that because he was a tech blogger, it was made up and ChatGPT can't provide such information.

There was another AI related thread about how the hype bubble is bursting. Most of the top comments were talking about how useless AI was, that it was a mirror image of the crypto scam, that it will never provide anything beneficial to humanity.

There was a thread about VR/AR applications. Many of the top comments were saying it had zero practical applications, and didn't even work for entertainment because it was apparently worse in every way.

In a thread about Tesla copilot, I saw several people say they use it for lane switching. They were dogpiled with downvotes, with upvoted people responding that this was irresponsible and how autonomous vehicles will never be safe and reliable regardless of how much development is put into them.

In a CRISPR thread approving of usage, quite a few highly upvoted comments were saying how it was morally evil because of how unnatural it is to edit genes at this level.

It goes on and on.

If r/futurology had its way, humans 1000 years from now would be practicing medicine with pills, driving manually in today's cars, videocalling their parents on a small 2D rectangle, and I guess... avoiding interacting with AI despite every user on reddit already interacting with AI that just happens to be at the backend infrastructure of how all major digital services work these days? Really putting the *future* in futurology, wow.

Can people just... stop with the elitism, luddism, and actually discuss with nuance positive and negative effects and potential outcomes for emerging and future technologies? The world is not black and white."

Now our population is divided between those 20th century citizens born before year 2000 and those 21st century citizens born into the New Millennium. There's a stark contrast between the 20th century citizens who remember the ""before times"" how humans existed before the internet, Facebook or all the other technology introduced in the last 24 years. 

We're almost at the 50/50 ratio in population between the old and newer generations which took 24 years. Year 2000 it was 100% 20th century citizens and for the first 21st century generations will witness 100% of 20th century citizens die much like there's no living survivors of World War One left alive. Meaning half of today's current population won't remain in the other half's lifetimes. The global population will shrink to 4 billion in a few short decades. However the global population remained under 1 billion just 200 years ago for all of recorded human history. We exist in a time drastically different from 95+% of human development. 

The Georgia guidestones stated goal was to maintain the global population under 1 billion and there's at least two worse case scenario's that may result in 90+% reduction in global population within one year. Class warfare isn't fought on a battlefield and the richest people on Earth including Mark Zuckerberg have survival bunkers for that year.

Make no mistake about it if you put yourself in the richest people's shoes conspiring to reclaim Earth by ending 7+ billion lives prematurely to save themselves is more then plausible. 

20th century citizens being the parents of 21st century generations alive today; there seems to be a choice between two fates. One being under 1 billion of the richest people who can afford to survive claim Earth for themselves by eliminating 7 billion people by inducing the worse case scenario to occur and be experienced. Second alternative is doing everything we can to ensure the 4 billion 21st century generation citizens; learn to adapt, survive and thrive together. We can put an end to the worse case scenario by realizing why being 24 years into the New Millennium matters to us and all life.

It's also worth mentioning the rat utopia experiment where they built the perfect space for a certain amount of rats. However when the population increased social breakdown of normal behavior changed to the extreme. Eventually when the population peaked no new we're born due to youth being killed for the mothers to mate again and population collapsed. Then when the population was at the optimal number for the space like originally intended it continued to collapse because of learned behaviour during peak population and generational breakdown. 

A second rat experiment where a lab rat was left isolated with nothing for mental stimulation. It was given clean water and water with heroin. Every rat drank the heroin water resulting in 100% loss of life prematurely 100% of the time. Then they added other rats to socialize and toys to provide mental stimulation. Those rats did try the heroin water but non habitually and loss of life due to heroin became 0%. 

The third was a rat drowning experiment where they timed how long a rat can swim before drowning. Then just before that time expired the scientist ""saved"" the rats from drowning. Then put them back in to see how long they would last. Every rat exceeded past the original time it takes for it to drown believing they would be saved again demonstrating strength isn't just physical but mental strength plays a roll in survival.

All three of these examples have lessons for humans and us in society to learn or consider."

Complex logistical, environmental, infrastructure, poverty, and war/geopolitics problems suddenly are not so complex or problematic if everyone can reach a grand bargain or at least just agree not to break things. Almost all political collective action problems boil down to tribal divided making it hard to negotiate a national or global compromise on that issue, and it’s likely that this tribalism is an evolved holdover from the Paleolithic. 

Imo, the best thing for our future would be to find a way to stifle or at least weaken this Paleolithic instinct, be it through education, AI-generated productivity booms, coexistence with a selfless AI species, being outcompeted by a Borg-like nation or species, or (in the worst case scenario, which I do not endorse although I could see a lot of people going for it) a totalitarian world government. 

NB: Although I do not subscribe to the theological aspects of Buddhism or Rastafarianism, I do recognize the truth that the freestanding individual “self” is an illusion that stems from a larger global ecosystem."

Just surviving paycheck to paycheck keeps us in this survival mode ""all for one; none for all"" social environment. 

We forgot who we are and what makes us human is our inward humanity outwardly expressed. Many become like monsters becoming a shadow of their own full potential which is inseparable but the shadow we call ourselves current isn't the us the physical being obstructing our view. There's essentially two modes of life to choose from but we only know one kind of existence in this life and the others are yet to be realized or experienced. 

Simply we can either chase our material desires or follow our heart of hearts wholeheartedly. The cycle of chasing desires is never ending. Want something then getting it starts a new material desire and never happy always wanting more or something else. Alternatively the lifelong pursuit to embody our full potential is truly never ending yet satisfying. 

Here in this realization is the potential for actualization and leave the cycle of material desires towards the starting the healing process of society. Reducing, preventing and stopping self harm and harming others as individuals. This inner battle can bring about peace of mind when we start following our hearts to see where it leads us. In this way we can become best friends to ourselves instead of our own worse enemies. 

Every day we're not living up to our true potential is a day where we died a little instead of lived a little while alive. We've been unwittingly forced into this current negative social condition that deeply impacts all of us as individuals. How to escape purgatory in this lifetime is a calling to all we feel in our heart of hearts. Follow it and we'll find ourselves in a completely transformed social ecosystem. 

Human intervention requires social solidarity and us identifying with our inner humanity which turn mental zombies back into humans. There's more to life we feel but can only come to know through lived experience rather then words such as these shared. Life matters do matter to life yet our existence has been made superficial or meaningless. You're more then just a voter, employee or consumers; we are human first and foremost. Those other layers of identity can be she'd like skin as we emerge out of our shell to live life while alive true to ourselves with the other mode of existence. 

Done right this non physical force of an idea or ideal; cannot be physically taken once obtained. This force and as cheesy as it sounds the power of love over hate has an opposite social trajectory upwards. Currently we're in the ""free fall"" state which is understandably very scary not being grounded with feet on solid ground. We experience this great fall today but when we bounce back we're essentially flying which could be fun. 

Knowing the moment of impact is a choice to bounce back becomes something to anticipate in our lifetimes. That's the hope and best case scenario for us; otherwise things will continue getting bad to worse for us. We can and must to live as we wish, desire and deserve as humans. There's worse fates then death and if we continue to do nothing the battle for our lives are over as social Darwinism prevails. We can be the victors instead of victims here and now that choice is ours and yours to make. "
1,2024-02-28,Using technology to take democracy to the next level,u/Vanonti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1b2h1tr/using_technology_to_take_democracy_to_the_next/,Futurology,"Though US is a democracy, I'm hesitant to call it completely democratic. No nation is. At this stage of capitalism, lobbying groups and establishment regularly forces the congress to pass bills that are against the interests and opinions of majority of the people.

What are some theoretical solutions to make nations more democratic?

One possible solution is using technology. Now that must people in US and other western nations have access to internet and mobile phones, maybe one (crazy?) solution is conducting referendums online for some bills.

Some examples

1) There is a online website where the majority party and largest minority party (or each senator) can propose 1 bill per year (per term) that people vote online on. If >66% people vote on it, the bill goes to next stage.

Either passed immediately or goes to a president who can veto it. There will be pressure on the president to not veto it but president can veto some dangerous minority oppressing bills.

Another option is to have two referendums on the same bill seperated in time (say 18 months) so that situations like Brexit doesn't occur.

2) Public can propose ""bills"" themselves (either at local community level or nation level) and it goes to some kind of voting and top voted ""bill"" should be be made into a proper bill by a committee/congress and referendum should be held on it.

Currently due to some conmen, people believe that even mail in ballot is rigged, so it's difficult to obtain a good enough reputation for this system. Also, I'm not advocating for a completely direct democracy or majoritarianism. No one's got the time and knowledge to vote on everything. I'm only suggesting using referendums so that some power is transferred away from lobbying groups to the people.

Of course, prima facie, there are number of problems but i hope to convey the essential idea rather than all the details.

P.S. Also anyone know papers or books written on this idea?"

But it seems like there are many scenarios that could lead to large numbers of AI-related layoffs, and with them a call for higher taxes on the rich and implementation of UBI. 

If that is true, I wonder if the Republican Party as it exists today can survive. Without any political judgement, I have trouble believing a party that encourages individuals to pick themselves up by their bootstraps could get behind a massive increase in government support programs for struggling families. That such a program would also require major taxes on mega corporations makes it seem even less likely that the GOP of today could appeal to AI-displaced voters.

At the very least, I think the party would have to change its economic positions drastically to appeal to the masses. 

The Democrats, like them or not, are already a party that advocates for higher taxes and robust social services, so that seems like a natural fit for the possible demands of our AI future.

The article ""Can a Country’s Population Enter a Death Spiral?"" highlights a stark reality: fertility rates are plummeting globally, not just in wealthy nations but across the board, defying old assumptions that low fertility was a ""rich-world"" problem. It argues convincingly that we're witnessing a widespread demographic shift, with potentially dire consequences for countries like Japan, where declining births versus deaths hint at a future burdened by an unsustainable dependency ratio. The piece posits that without a reversal in these trends, which history suggests is unlikely, we're looking at economic stagnation, social strain, and a potential exodus of the young, seeking better prospects elsewhere.  
  
In my view, the article hits the nail on the head. It's a wake-up call to governments worldwide to take this demographic downturn seriously. Ignoring it could lead us into uncharted territories of population decline, where the very fabric of societies could be at risk. It's time for innovative policies to boost fertility rates and manage the consequences of demographic changes. Otherwise, we risk witnessing the first ""population death spirals"" in human history."

China, Japan and Korea are especially hit hard and their demographics are (from my understanding) expected to collapse in the next few decades. The west is also suffering from this, but their more open immigration is easing the pain. When birthrates are brought up discussion always leads to the current happenings and their reasons, but never the outcome. 

The population would inevitably stabilize, but that would still be significantly under the close to 8 billion that we have now. How would society shift because of it? The west has immigration to fall back on, but what about the previously mentioned China, Japan and Korea? They lack that luxury. I could see China either instituting some sort of draconian law to force women into having kids or force more of their rural population into cities.

The most common answer I've seen when this question is asked is something along the lines of ""everyone will have jobs repairing and maintaining the robots"".  Thing is, if these artificial life forms are advanced enough to replace humans in even complex tasks, robots would most certainly also be used to perform maintenance and repairs on their fellow machines.

Cost would most likely come into play so I can see smaller businesses not using an artificial workforce.  When it comes to larger companies, I see the only humans being the owner(s) and board of directors.  

The entertainment industry would obviously continue on with human musicians, actors and other performers but I also think we would see many shows and movies being created inside of computers without any humans involved with the exception of the director, writers, editor, etc.

Professional sports would still be around

I see some humans still being employed by the justice system.  I would imagine laws would be passed requiring judges be human.  I could maybe see the same thing with attorneys, but at the same time can see them being replaced with androids.  Would you rather have a human attorney capable of making mistakes or a super advanced AI capable of citing all relevant case law in the blink of an eye? Juries would of course still consist of humans but that's not a job, just a pain in the ass.    

Lastly, the sex industry ain't ever going away but that's only going to provide income to a select group of mostly women.  

So, envisioning a future where androids such as Data from Star Trek aren't just science fiction, what professions would remain to be dominated by, or exclusively done by humans?"

It seems that South Korea has finally decided to increase the birth rate with money.  
In particular, South Koreans are quite positive about this policy because they have a strong desire for a rapid rise in birth rate and population growth.

Recently, in South Korea, in order to explosively increase the birth rate, the government, local governments, and companies are pouring in an unprecedented amount of direct cash support to pregnancy, birth, and children.

&#x200B;

The Korean government has decided to pay $1,000 per month in 'parental Salarys(부모급여)' to each child upon birth. In addition, it was decided to provide a child allowance of $100 per month and a child support allowance of $100 per month until the child becomes a teenager. We also implemented a policy so that if you take childcare leave, you can receive your full salary for 6 to 12 months. In addition to this, a lot of money was given directly in various items. And this amount is expected to increase in the future.  
Local governments are even more unconventional. Jecheon City planned to pay 150,000 dollars when a child is born until the child becomes an adult, and the Jeollanam-do region announced that it would continue to provide a large amount of child support in money until the child is 18 years old. This is money given separately by local governments in addition to the money given by the government. Since you receive money overlapping, the money you receive is actually more than double when you are born.  
The most unconventional place is Gangjin-gun, which has decided to pay $50,000 per child upon birth. In Gangjin-gun, this cash distribution was especially effective. Gangjin-gun caused a huge upheaval with the number of births increasing by 66% in 2023, one year after the policy was implemented (the increase in births due to external influx was quite limited).  
This has become a hot topic across South Korea, and local governments are preparing huge amounts of direct cash support to boost birth rates.  
The company's support for childbirth is even more unconventional. Recently, the boss of Booyoung, a large company, declared that he would encourage his workers to have children with a $75,000 bonus, and large corporations with deep pockets such as Samsung, Lotte, and LG promised to give huge cash to employees who give birth, and some companies offer promotions when children are born. they created a system to do this.  
South Korea's maternity support policy has become stronger than ever before in human history. There was a lot of confusion a few years ago, but recently the government has revealed its position that money is the source of increased birth rates, and a system is being created across the country that gives huge amounts of money to births in all fields.  
In reality, a system is being created where each child will directly receive 'up to $300,000 or more' when they have a birth. Of course, it will be a huge financial burden, but South Korea strongly recognizes that ultra-low birth rate is the country's biggest problem, so they are willing to accept it and create such a system.  
In particular, the rapid increase in the birth rate in Gangjin gives many South Koreans hope that money will lead to a rapid increase in the birth rate.  
Recently, there has been a growing awareness on Reddit that the low birth rate in developed countries is irreversible, and it seems that many people will be paying attention to see how much it is possible for South Korea's cash distribution for pregnancy and birth to rebound the birth rate.

&#x200B;

What do you guys think? Do you think Korea, which has the lowest birth rate in the world, will achieve a turnaround through this?  
This will be a valid example for many developed countries. However, this is only possible for countries with a lot of money.  
It is invalid for countries that are poor and have low birth rates, such as Thailand or Ukraine etc. I believe that they are in fact facing the most dangerous situation of low birth rate and aging population."

Generally, the conversation around UBI results from perceived job loss due to increased automation/AI. But if Covid is genuinely reducing the mental capacity of its victims and there is no solution for it (aside from things that won't happen like locking down every single person on Earth for a month), then governments ought to be taking notice. 

I'll tell a personal story. I have Long Covid (though not officially diagnosed, of course). Due to my inability to get officially diagnosed, I have no hope of collecting any sort of medical disability payments. But my cognitive function has declined in a way that is absolutely noticeable to me. I work a job (teacher) that requires constant quick-thinking, higher-order thinking, and lots of organizing. I can no longer do these things at the level I did before my 2nd case of Covid, well over a year ago. 

Automation will take jobs slower than AI will, but Long Covid has potentially, secretly already taken millions out of the workforce for good. We still won't know the full effects of how this virus has impacted our brains for several more years. "

5,2024-02-29,Evidence for an entropic and a dynamic factor jointly driving aging (Pre-print bioRxiv),u/Key_Faithlessness211,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1b2xovd/evidence_for_an_entropic_and_a_dynamic_factor/,Futurology,"Link - [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.25.581928v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.25.581928v1)

Resume  
The point is : mice exhibit some sort of aging really similar to us and it's measurable so we can try drugs to actually slow down our own to the point of even stopping it in like 10 years (admittedly vague and humble timeline estimation).  
A new and more direct approach.  
""GERO "" introduce a new paper showing evidence for the existence of two joint processes defining aging : a linear process comprising of a huge number of errors and an exponential dynamic one made of only a few factors, akin to programmed aging, the later largely driving the short lifespan of mice.  
The first linear signature is more tricky and not targetable by know compounds and related to damage accumulation. The dynamic on the contrary is made of only a few factors so is sensible to intervention because it is easy to identify the few tweakable components. The dynamic factor on the other hand is the famous 8 or so ""hallmarks of aging"".  
GERO is uniquely focus on the first linear line because it is deemed much more relevant to us. Work is in progress to identify what can halt this linear process in mice with strong implications for humans.  
The goal is to isolate the most relevant component of mice's aging to us.  
Slowing and stopping but not reversing, however.  
The good news is that in mice high fat diets will make tremendous damage because it break the dynamic factor while humans will be relatively not affected and heal from those type of stress, so we can enjoy life a bit in the waiting of an actual pill that solve this problem !  
key points :  
Entropy accumulation is the main driver in humans but not in mice. Inversely, the ""dynamic factor"" is the main driver in mice but not in humans. The proportion is strong. Every animal got the two at different degree. Humans got more of the dynamic one as time pass.  
Mice still exhibit a small entropy human-like increase and it is measurable and targetable, fixing the problem that a working medecine in humans will only show very little visible lifespan improvement in mice  
Current interventions like rapamycin and CR works on the dynamic factor but don't touch the entropic one so they likely don't work for humans but do for mice. Those treatments may improve a the lifepsan of the eldery only."
1,2024-02-29,Would you send your child to a school where the teachers were all humanlike robots powered by AI?,u/Dotlethal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1b2yu2j/would_you_send_your_child_to_a_school_where_the/,Futurology,"I've been pondering a hypothetical scenario and would love to hear your thoughts on it. Imagine a school where all the teachers are not humans but human-like robots powered by AI. These robots are designed to have high emotional intelligence and empathy and are programmed to teach various subjects effectively. They can adapt their teaching methods according to the student's learning style, have an infinite amount of patience, and can work 24/7 without getting tired.  
Would you send your child to such a school? Why or why not?  
It probably seems like a Sci-Fi movie, I'm still getting used to the AI app ShortlistIQ that we started using at work, so these AI teachers are currently impossible for me to imagine, but when I consider all the stuff AI is making progress in, it won't be surprising having something like that in several years.  
On one hand, the idea of a school run by AI robots sounds efficient and cost-effective. It could potentially provide a more personalized learning experience for each student, without the limitations of human teachers.  
On the other hand, some might argue that the human touch is irreplaceable in education. Human teachers provide not just academic knowledge but also emotional support and mentorship, which might be hard for robots to replicate.  
What are your thoughts on this? Would you send your child to a school run by AI robots?"

5,2024-02-29,What is the future of Banking?,u/AlwaysSingl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1b315dp/what_is_the_future_of_banking/,Futurology,"Over the past few decades, there has been a significant shift from using traditional cash to relying more on cards and, more recently, NFC-enabled phones. This shift is also evident in how we interact with banks. In the past, people would typically visit a physical branch and speak with a banker to carry out transactions or obtain assistance. Later, basic tasks such as account creation and payments could be done using a computer. Nowadays, it is becoming increasingly rare to visit a bank in person, with the convenience of mobile banking allowing us to easily apply for loans, make investments, and conduct various transactions. This trend is particularly pronounced among the younger, more digitally-oriented generation.
 
I recently attended a banking conference focused on digital innovation, where I had the opportunity to experience some cutting-edge technologies that are on the horizon in the banking industry.

I would like to hear your perspective on a few topics: 
- What do you envision the future of retail banking to look like? Do you think there will be a disruptive innovation, similar to the Netflix vs. Blockbuster scenario, that will reshape the retail banking landscape? How do you think this will affect corporate and private banking?

- Personally, I find the idea of using VR glasses to enter a virtual branch of a bank and interact with AI banking avatars to be somewhat cringe-worthy when it looks kinda like Roblox. Do you believe that chatbots and more optimized mobile banking will continue to dominate the future of banking, or do you see a place for VR experiences as well? 

- Would you feel more comfortable discussing your finances with a specialized AI rather than a human? How do you see the role of AI evolving in the banking industry, particularly in terms of personalized financial advice and support?

- With the advancements in AI, avatars, and technologies like Sora that enable realistic voice and video creation, do you think scams will become even harder to recognize? How can banks and individuals protect themselves in this evolving landscape?

- Overall, how do you feel about the future of banking? Are you optimistic about the changes in the way we conduct banking, the introduction of new products, and the potential benefits they may bring?

- What are your thoughts on prioritizing behavioral scoring/rating over financially-based ones? 

Do not even make me start on the blockchains, API integrations or IoT. I fear the day when the bank will know everything I have in the fridge and when they will see I only have mustard in there in eat ramen all day so they will reject my attempts to get a mortgage or decline me from using their investment app."

Really makes you think about how far we've come since IVF and now with Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) becoming more of a thing. The idea that we might soon pick traits for our kids like we do avocados at the grocery store is wild.

The vid does a solid job of breaking down the state of the technology, and the ethical maze we're about to wander into. The mention of companies like Orchid Health pushing the envelope on what traits can be selected is both exciting and kinda terrifying. It's one thing to prevent diseases, but what about when we start tweaking for height, intelligence, or even personality traits? That's where it gets real spicy.

One thing that got me thinking was how this could widen the gap between the rich and the rest. If only the wealthy can afford to give their kids these genetic 'upgrades,' where does that leave everyone else? It's like a whole new level of inequality is on the horizon.

The video does lean a bit optimistic at times, especially when talking about eradicating diseases and enhancing positive traits. I wish it dug a bit deeper into the potential downsides, like what this all means for human diversity and how we see each other. Are we heading towards a society where everyone wants their kids to fit a certain 'ideal'?

Also, it's kinda eyebrow-raising how it suggests that laws and ethical guidelines might not be enough to keep the genie in the bottle. The thought of a black market for designer babies isn't too far-fetched when you think about it.

Anyway, def worth a watch if you're into the future of genetics or just love a good sci-fi come to life scenario. Makes you wonder about the kind of choices we might face, or even what it means to be human in the first place.

What do you all think? Are we ready for this?"
