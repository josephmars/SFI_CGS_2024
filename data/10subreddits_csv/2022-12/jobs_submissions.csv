Backstory: I applied to a Manager title job that matched my experience exactly. I received the standard automated rejection email and noticed it included the recruiters email so I decided to respond and ask why I was rejected when I have the exact experience required. 

She responds saying I was actually overqualified for the position with my 10 years of experience. Salary for job $165k.

She mentioned they have senior analyst level roles open that pay $140k but not sure id be interested due to the lower salary.

Well I was super interested given it’s still a $15k+ raise from my last job so I had her submit my resume, did phone interview with her, and had final interview with my would be manager on 11/21 and it went amazing. We clicked and had a great interview. 

11/22 recruiter contacts me via phone and verbally gives offer of $140k + $5k bonus. I was playing it cool and requested $150k + $5k or $140k + $10k bonus. She didn’t seem to miss a beat with that and said she would be back in touch. 

I hear nothing rest of week. I follow up with her 11/28 to ask about status and she says waiting to hear back from SVP on approval for slightly higher salary since I negotiated. And says she will let me know asap when she hears back. 

11/29 I get completely blindsided by an automated email from the company saying they appreciated my interview but are moving forward with other candidates. WTF!??

So I literally lost the job because I tried to negotiate for an extra $5k? How is that even possible?

I’ve also tried following up with the recruiter multiple names and she won’t respond to any emails or calls.

Was I really rejected for negotiating salary and is ghosting without letting me know personally normal behavior?

Side note: I would have happily taken the job at $140k so it really crushed me. Is it no longer acceptable to negotiate for even a 3% increase in compensation????

If the very slightly higher negotiation attempt wasn’t acceptable, why wouldn’t they just say your offer wasn’t approved. Would you consider the original?

I have a new child and this job would have been a solid stress reliever for the family as a whole. Super disappointing."

2,2022-11-30,"Starting a great new job, but dealing with an unexpected medical situation at the same time and could use some advice.",u/DangerActiveRobots,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z9ahlh/starting_a_great_new_job_but_dealing_with_an/,jobs,"(I'm going to categorize this as ""HR"" because I'm not sure what else to flair it as.)

Hey all,

So tomorrow I start a new job. It's a city government job with great pay and benefits. I'm thrilled, but unfortunately I have a medical situation going on right now. Without going into laborious detail, I've been experiencing pain and have to have an ultrasound on Tuesday to determine whether I might need surgery for something. I just found out about this today, I had no idea that this was going to happen. 

Since I just barely started this job, I have no sick leave or annual leave. If I find out that I need surgery, that means that I'll have to tell my new employer that I have to go have surgery and that I'll be out of work for at least a week.

I'm worried that they might fire me because of this.

However, I'm also trying to think about it in a balanced way. If I do need surgery, it's not like I would be out of work for an entire month or anything. It would be about a week, and then I would be right back to work. If they fired me, they would have to hire someone else to fill the role. Then they would have to drug test them, do all their paperwork, coordinate a day to start training them, and begin the training from square one.

The other option is to just give me leave without pay for a week or so, and then I can come right back to work.

It seems to me that it would be easier to just give me the leave for a week. But I'm still anxious, because I'm in a probationary/trial period as a new hire and they can dismiss me for any reason.

I feel like it's not much different than if I were to get that very famous bug that's been going around since 2020, and I was out of work for a week because of that. Like sometimes medical stuff happens to people and we have to deal with it. I feel like that's different than someone who keeps calling in sick every week and burns up all their sick time but then keeps trying to call in sick.

What should I do?

Obviously the first step is to find out if I even NEED surgery. I'm not going to say anything to my employer until then. If I do need surgery, though, I'm going to have to tell them because, well, I need the surgery.

Has anyone been through anything similar? I'm over the moon that I landed this job but I'm really concerned that having to take a short leave of absence so soon is going to be a problem.

I hope I'm just overthinking this. I hope they're just like ""oh okay, get your surgery and then come back."""

I am the only employee who has stayed here a full year.  I am never late and have only missed one day of work in the year. I also work the least-wanted shift and barely ever make a mistake. I fix other employees mistakes and I get good feedback from the customers. I deserve a raise.  (I'm not even getting any benefits here. Nobody does, except management.)

Now I still wouldn't like this, but I would be slightly more ok with it if nobody had gotten a raise... But just a few months ago a raise was given to another employee in my department when she asked for one (it was an ulimatum, really) and she hadn't even been here a year yet!  I know this, because she told me herself.

So it is ABSOLUTE BULLSH!T that I will not be getting a raise when I deserve one and someone else did.

Besides looking for another job (which I already am) what should I do/say? How should I handle this at my review?

Thanks in advance."

Is an employer allowed to tell you to submit your notice, and to specify what your last day will be, and to enforce a deadline to submit the notice to them (in my case, the day of)? 

When they asked why I wanted to switch to part time, I told them I wanted to get a part time job closer to home. So part time here, part time somewhere else. They asked if I started looking and I said yes a little bit. They replied with ""well you might as well quit if you've started looking"" and for me to ""at least submit a 2 weeks notice"" and for my last day to be 12/15. They also told me to submit the notice before the end of the day.

It feels like I've been fired, but without the safety net of unemployment. I wasn't gonna go on unemployment, but I still don't think its legal to block an employee from having that option. 

I was in shock of my bosses reaction to this request, so I didn't say anything and agreed to submit my notice before the end of the day. And then I did so. By submitting the notice, did I screw myself over? I also don't want them to be able to do this to anyone else. This is seriously messed up. 

They also said ""And frankly, I think we're cutting our losses."" Was this a personal insult on me to say that I'm not worth keeping at the company?"

I was supposed to intern in corporate finance with a mid sized company in 2020 but that was cancelled when the pandemic went into full force. So many of my classmates found themselves in the same boat and many of them went to grad school this year to get another shot. After a year of not being able to land a job as a financial analyst due to my lack of experience, I followed my friends to grad school.

It sort of worked because within a month of starting my masters program this Fall, I was able to land an internship in real estate where I'm learning how to do real estate financial analysis and I love it. However, due to current market conditions my company will not be giving anyone in my intern cohort full time offers. I will forever be grateful that they gave me a shot that I so desperately needed, but I'm tired of running this rat race. 

Despite the looming recession, I was able to get a couple of interviews here and there but I keep getting ghosted even after the interviews go well. The most recent company I spoke with had me go through 3 rounds of interviews and told me they wanted to invite me for an office visit after they coordinate with the rest of the team. I didn't hear anything for over a week so I followed up and was given the run around. Then radio silence again, and I finally received a rejection email this week. 

My internship ends tomorrow and I wish I was jumping into a full time role immediately so I could put my masters on pause and just finally live my adult life. My friends from undergrad are all now mid-twenties or pushing 30 and we still live like broke college kids depending on each other because we're not making decent salaries at our bs jobs. We've been trying for a year and a half now to land well paying jobs in our fields and it feels like we're getting nowhere. One of my friends/roommates put his dream of being a data scientist on hold and took up some job in marketing that pays him bs and it saddens me to see him resort to that, I want to see us all win. 

Are there any other covid-era grads out there still going through it? I feel like so many of us had the rug pulled out from underneath us and many recruiters don't want to give us a shot for entry level roles because they have the 2022 grads and upcoming 2023 grads to choose from now.

After a year of applying and not getting anything other than consultant jobs(that I couldn't even get in), I decided to pick up front end web dev(React). In a span of 4-5 months I got the hang of it. Created a few projects and a portfolio site(took a month, finished this Oct) and added it to my resume. I felt more confident in myself with a portfolio and started applying to jobs on LinkedIn. After my first few ""unfortunately, we decided to move on"" emails, I attached a Google analytics onto my portfolio to see if they're even looking at my portfolio. There hasn't been a single view on it since the beginning of November.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really demoralizing to see that I'm getting turned down without them even batting an eye. What's the point of filling these applications asking questions like ""tell us your proudest achievement"" if they're not even going to look at it, if our resume defines who we are? Should I sneak in ""an internship at Stark Industries"" onto my resume to help me ""stand out""?

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to just apply to retail for now and I cant even get a job there either. Am I just cursed with never finding a job, that I cant even get a min wage job? Turns out people have been talking about this for almost a decade. That you're overqualified and you'll use them as stepping stones. Yea but isn't that every job? I'm going from, can't get a job because I don't have a degree to can't get a job because I have a degree. What do I do? I'm so lost!

&amp;#x200B;

Side rant: are recruiters just paycheck stealing thieves? If the AI can filter out a majority of the applicants, what's the point of the recruiter? Surely they're not conducting interviews everyday from 9-5. Or copying and pasting existing job postings and then switching a few words around. It just feels like they have so much time in their hands and they're not using it to actually look at resumes. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* I did get an internship as an IT support but it was right before COVID. Start date was mid March and when mid March came around, the lockdown was announced. SO UNLUCKY!"

I graduated in IT field with specialization on computer graphics. Thing is, I don't think I have enough ""actual skills"". Sure, I've had c++ and sql courses, but I barely remember anything anymore. Sure, I know Illustrator, photoshop, zbrush and substance painter a bit, but don't have portfolio that I could show, nor can I really create anything decent.

I have issues with self worth, so you know how people can sell themselves well even if they're not that good? Can't do that even if I was actually good.

I feel like I should go somewhere to gain skills and expierience, but can't find any jobs. I'm mostly looking at linkedin and nofluffjobs, and mostly at internships or junior/entry level jobs.

At the same time I lack direction, I don't know whether I should try to go into art and grind courses, or maybe some programming language? I'm willing to invest time but I'm anxious that I'll invest a lot of it and still end up being parasite on my parents back. Also it feels like I don't have time anymore.

As for ""any"" job I am too weak(?) to do them. I tried Amazon warehouse and I couldn't last one shift, my legs and body was hurting so much. I'm in a bad physical shape let's say that. Still feel shame from that. I am based in central europe but tbh. I would be willing to travel if that meant having a job I can do. I feel like my degree isn't worth anything really, and I don't have enough skills to do any kind of job. Just feels like I'm not enough for anything. 

So yeah, I am looking for advice because entire situation is extremely stressing me out. I am behind a curve a LOT, and I don't have resourcefullnes to know what to do, how to go about it.

I know there are a jobs on production lane or mcdonalds or anything. I just can't stand for that long. Not strong enough to do basic jobs, not smart/skilled enough to do any ""desk"" job."

Something new happened to me and was hoping to have some insight from you!

I have applied to a couple of positions at a big company and shortly after I was contacted by one of their principal talent acquisition partners.

We hade a conversation in which they said to me that I have an interesting profile and they offered me to interview for a really interesting position that I was not considering before. They are also speeding up the process with the other applications at the company and sent me a follow up email for updating me on everything.

For background I am a scientist with cross-disciplinary research interests about to leave the Accademia.

It feels like good news but this never occurred to me before.

Is this a positive sign? Any advices on the matter?"

My company lets me WFH 2 days per week. My job can be fully done remotely BTW. I'm currently on vacation in Indonesia right now. I had 2 weeks PTO left but 2 weeks is a short time for travel from US to Indonesia so I actually booked the travel for 5 weeks instead but my boss doesn't know. I can continue working the same time zone as my boss for the extra 3 weeks so that's not a problem. The problem is that my boss won't allow it because then he'll probably have to allow it for everyone in the office. So basically I'm looking for an excuse to WFH for 3 extra weeks. Broke my ankle? COVID? 

And before someone starts getting mad at this, I want to reiterate that I will be working the same time zone and my job is measurable so I can't just get away with not working at all."
3,2022-12-01,Manager telling me I need to be more proactive but I don't really know how in this case,u/legolegolaslego,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z9l1nl/manager_telling_me_i_need_to_be_more_proactive/,jobs,"So a few weeks back I got a new side project at my company where my manager wants to send newsletters once every month to our colleagues. We both are not marketeers so this is definitely new for us. And the newsletters are mostly about this specific project of him where most of our colleagues, including me (however I know more than the average I think), don't know a lot about. 

He is writing almost all the articles on the website, sometimes about specific test cases he did with some people or new things happening etc.

My job is setting the newsletters up, putting the content pieces together, checking, adjusting images, writing text for the newsletter itself and then linking to the article he wrote. 

But the problem is that he is a really busy man and he is always so late with writing the content pieces or just straight up forgets it. I am sending e-mails once in a while if he has began writing or how far he is with it. This is not a really high priority for him even though it was his idea. So yeah, It's far from a well oiled machine. 

Last time he said that I need to be more proactive, that he feels like he is bringing stuff instead of me getting it and that I need to make it more my project than his. I subtly said that the content is coming pretty late and that can be a reason why it's not going so well. He got a little angry and said he feels a bit attacked and that he has 10 other projects going on while I have way less.

So I want to ask you guys what I can do to support him more. I feel like he is blaming me a little too much instead of himself but maybe I am wrong. 

It's pretty hard because I think if he just made more time somehow to write the pieces it would be way better. And I can't really write his pieces, maybe very broadly. So at this point we are just pointing fingers to each other.

I have spoken to a co-worker about this and he suggested me 1-2 things  I can do but I also wanted to hear your thoughts about this."

Or should I apply as if I am any other job applicant?

Background:

About a month ago I started working for a company that outsources people to fill temporary roles (4-6+ months usually) at mid- to large-size companies. Basically a temp agency, but at the $100K+/year level. I am a W-2 employee of this company.

They immediately sent me to work with one of their clients. They are having to rebuild a bunch of their departments from the ground up after a re-organization, and myself and another person from the same temp company are basically the entirety of the department until they can staff up on a more permanent basis.

My boss at the client company told us after a couple of weeks that she was in the process of getting headcount allocated to permanently staff this department, and she told me on a one-on-one phone call that she thought I was doing a great job; she obviously couldn't make promises but said she thought I would be a good fit for a permanent position in the future, if that is what I wanted.

Last week this company posted a job opening for the job I am doing now, and I want to apply. So far I have had zero contact with anyone at HR, because all the HR, benefits, etc. are handled by the temp company. I'm not sure what to put in my cover letter; obviously my current boss will be one of (if not the) decision-makers in deciding who to hire, but it feels weird to write a cover letter and say ""as you know I have already been doing this job for a month now,"" etc.

What's the best approach?"

My university provides us with a graduation letter with all the details about when I started and when I finished, my name,etc excluding the grades and the cgpa and I have attached this instead of the transcripts and diploma(s) cerificates.

3,2022-12-01,"Regret turning down a job, but not sure if it's because of 'what-if' or a genuine sign",u/dunmerza,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/z9tyiz/regret_turning_down_a_job_but_not_sure_if_its/,jobs,"**Turned down job that could be better, but lower pay over time, to stay in one that is good, and higher pay over time. Having regrets - standard anxiety of making the choice, or a sign of a bad move?**

I've (22f) been working at Private Company A for over a year, and was very happy there - good salary, great team. So I was content until almost a year in, where my role was changed. Because of a load of external factors, I ended up without much to do - I couldn't take on more work because I wasn't experienced in the new role, but I also wasn't getting trained in it. Plus I had a lot less contact with coworkers - which all culminated in becoming really unhappy. 

So I started looking for another job, and found one that seemed super interesting - Public Company B. It was a different kind of position, but involved using my degree (which I hadn't done previously), and the new sector was really interesting to me. 

It was my first application and interview, and while I didn't get the role I'd gone for (definitely under-qualified), they offered me another - which they weren't hiring for. It was also better pay than Company A. So it felt meant to be, and I (informally) accepted.

I had some cold feet about leaving Company A, because it was a good industry with high earning potential, but I didn't think I could develop from where I was - so made my resignation without objections.

Fast-forward to just before I left, and I got a last-minute offer from Company A to stay in a new role (like my old one) + contract, with an even higher salary. B matched this.

I still wanted to leave, because I'd been so dissatisfied with A and was excited about B. But, the logical part of me - plus family, friends and SO - all said the same thing: A would be better paid over the years, and solved the issues that made me unhappy before - developing and learning more, taking on more work, same good work environment.

I really agonised over the choice for a while, feeling like B would be more fun and interesting, but I would still be content at A, and the new role was something I'd been interested in before - I just hadn't thought it attainable. Plus, would B actually be that great? I had no contacts working there or way of knowing for sure, while I knew A was a good place to work. 

After driving myself crazy for too long, I finally made the decision to rescind my acceptance of B, because A had improved a lot and would be more financially secure over time. But since communicating this to B, I've had the worst anxiety that I've got it wrong, and overwhelming desire to call and say it was a mistake. 

What I'm not sure about is whether this is a genuine gut feeling of doing the wrong thing, or I'm just anxious because a choice was finally made. 

Is this normal, or a real sign I've made the wrong choice? I may not be able to go back on it now anyway, because I told B last-minute and they'd set things in motion for me, so it would be a dick move and maybe not possible. But I'm going crazy (again) with the 'what-if's."

I am 27 year old bachelor engineer of IT. I am currently working as a System Engineer in company A, I have to travel to work biweekly (but I have no problem of working on-site all the time), so that means that every other week I work from home/remotely. I earn around 1500€ net per month but I have passive duty 2 weeks a month that pays around 300-350€ a month, so my base salary is around 1150€-1200€. I have paid OT hours but I am feeling like changing a company because I think I could learn some new technologies or get a better paying job at least. 

So, at the start of November, I started looking for a job. I sent 9 CVs and got respond form 8 companies, and I manage to get in the final round of interviews in 4-5 of them. I got an offer to work for a company B for 1700€ (base salary, 40 hours a week), I need to work on-site all the time, and position is System Administrator. I am currently waiting for other offers (or rejections) but I doubt that anyone will offer me this kind of money. All the managers that are interviewing me are trying to lower my salary. I need to mention also that company B wants me to come to their HQ first few days for onboarding, but I need to use my personal vehicle and need to pay accommodation on my expense. They said they would refund me all the money for gas/accommodation. 

Should I accept this offer? 

Just for the context, Company B is located in my country, but the HQ are located in a neighbor country."

Just some background, I joined the company a year and a half ago as tech support for a small product. The other support consultant is getting on and is looking to retire in a year or two. We also  just lost our only professional services consultant (Got poached to be a product manager).

Now there is this much larger product that had a huge structural reorganisation, combined with covid and people taking early retirement means that alot of the product knowledge has left.

Fast forward to today and the new director of customer service called me in and basically said he really likes how far I've progressed and he can see a long career here for me, all feedback has been brilliant.

Then he mentioned about doing some bits for this bigger product (still as support but maybe doing g a day or two there aswell as what I do now) or maybe moving into professional services and taking up that roll.

I just don't know where to go  my immediate line mananger has said to me the director is looking to do this and the line manager reckons I should stick with the small product so I can take over support when my opposite number retires.

So, what does reddit think? Go do support for the other product?  look at professional services? Or stay where I am?"

I graduated 3 months ago and have been actively applying to jobs for around six months. I would say I have applied to more than 1000. At first, my goal was to do quality assurance/software testing, but I have not had much luck in interviews. I always made it past the recruiter, past the initial interview, and sometimes a second interview. 

Throughout undergrad, I took two digital marketing courses covering search engine and digital marketing. In my internship, I was a website development intern that was also involved in optimizing content with links and keywords, performed keyword research, optimized on page content, used google analytics and screaming frog. 

On my resume, I have my web development/seo/quality assurance experience from my internship, as well as projects covering website development and optimization. Another project I have covers web automated testing, and I wonder if I should replace that with something more relevant (content/seo audit?).

I don’t know if it is right to change my career path to marketing just because I feel burnt out from applying to qa positions, but I also enjoy learning about search engine optimization. I just don’t know if my background and lack of experience is a major drawback for me. 

I’ve had my resume reviewed various times by professionals, college staff, family and friends, and I’ve gotten mostly positive feedback. 

I’ve had about 15 phone interviews, and only got to the next round of 3-4 of those. Never made it to the final round. I bombed some interviews, but others went well and I answered technical questions thoroughly. I could work on my interviewing skills. I also have a child’s voice and I feel like recruiters think they’re talking to a child the second they hear it. I send thank you emails to everyone I speak to. 

I get 10+ rejections a day and I don’t know how much longer it will take for me to land any type of job. I apply to anything relevant now. Is this normal?

Moving closer is not an option. Also I had a job closer to home before and I hated the job, environment was toxic and it took a huge mental toll on me.

I have not received any offers yets, but I am being pursued by two companies with benefits that are similar, yet different enough that I'm curious about what others might think. I'm 30, single with no kids, and I'm coming off a job making $67,000 + annual bonus equivalent to roughly 1.5 months gross pay. I'm in the financial services industry and have 3-4 years experience.

I'm somewhat more inclined to go with Company B because the benefits are more laid out and are more specific, but it's hard to gauge without having a better idea about the bonus, This is especially true if they come in with a base salary a little lower than Company A.

My goal is negotiate either company to a base of $75,000 and let the bonus from Company B guide my  final choice. Culture is also important to me and I like the fact that Company B has an all expenses paid annual retreat. Total compensation for both companies seems like it will be similar +/- $5,000, so it's hard to decide. It may come down to meeting each team and going with my gut.

What say you, reddit? Any thoughts?

\- Company A:

* $70,000 Base + Bonus Compensation Structure **(Was told during my Zoom interview that the last bonus was $3,500; bonuses are paid quarterly)**
* Health Insurance
* 401(k)
* Professional Development Allowance
* Paid Vacation &amp; Paid Sick Leave

\- Company B:

* $60,000-70,000 Range **(Was advised by recruiter that I'd likely be at the top of the range givn my credentials and that salary was negotiable)**
* Bonus structure that is tied to company gross revenue **(no further guidance on this)**
* Hybrid office/virtual working model
* 401(k) plan with 6% employer match
* Employer funded Health Reimbursement Arrangement of at least $3,600 annually
* Company paid CFP® review materials, test expenses, annual designation fees, continuing education and one conference and travel each year
* All expenses paid annual company retreat
* Personal tax preparation annually
* Financial Tune-Up by internal advisor annually
* Three week paid vacation in addition to common holidays
* Parental Leave Plan in place"

1,2022-12-01,New Hiring Process?,u/Wysteiria,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/za1lzx/new_hiring_process/,jobs,"In the past week or two I've rather undergone an... ""odd"" job hiring process, so to speak. So I wanted to see what some people's thoughts were on this matter.

**This story will be long, so you have been warned. If you don't feel like reading it all, feel free to look at the question listed down below.**

**Preface:**

I'll start off by stating that this is the typical hiring process I'm used to, when it comes to online job applications. You find a job description &gt; tailor your Resume &amp; CL &gt; apply &gt; get response back from employer to hold interview &gt; wait for their response back to see for next steps (aka if you go through to next round or not get selected).

**Job Description Situation:**

On LinkedIn I applied for a job online. First thing I noticed was that the company hiring for this position was labelled ***\[X Employment Services\]***. While on the actual job description itself was the posting from the hiring company itself, in first-person wording, but without an actual name to the company listed on the ad. The only information stated on the job ad was what they were looking for in a candidate, ideal salary range, and location of the company. All of which I fit the bill or was fine with.

**Hiring Process:**

A few days after I applied online, I get a call from **\[Person Z\]** representing ***\[X Employment Services\]***. It was only after me asking the question that I finally get the name of their client, and scheduling an interview time with the hiring company themselves in person. Even at this stage there was a bit of communication errors here, since the first time the guy called his phone number didn't have a caller ID, making me intentionally miss his first call and yada yada yada. All that is important is that **\[Person Z\]** mentioned that when I come in for the interview, I should ask for **\[Person B\]**.

**Interview Day:**

The day of the interview is here a few days later. I tried entering in the company, which was locked. After having being let in by **\[Person A\]**, before I even get the chance to say hi or whatnot, **\[Person A\]** asks if I'm here for an interview. I say yes, introduce myself, and right away **\[Person A\]** takes charge of the whole interview herself. She then proceeds with talking about what the job I applied for would entail. And after what it seems like to be a great interview, near towards the end **\[Person A\]** says this;

*""If you're interested in this position, why don't you contact* **\[Person C\].** *Let her know, and the next time we meet we'll get straight away into training. Since we really need someone right now.""*

Now this was the part where I got confused by. Apparently **\[Person A\]** thought that I was introduced to this role through the company directly, meaning that I already had prior contact with this store branch's owner, **\[Person C\]**. So after having asked repeated questions, **\[Person A\]** only then realized that I was actually introduced to the company through **\[X Employment Services\].** So she replied that if that was the case, any questions I had regarding next steps I had to ask **\[Person Z\]** so that they would contact the client on my behalf.

**Interview Follow-Up:**

So I did. Since I had virtually not directly contacted any of the owners **\[Person B\]** or **\[Person C\]** before, and during the interview process there was no mention of compensation/HR talk whatsoever.

It wasn't until I heard a reply back from **\[Person Z\]** that the person I talked to that day, **\[Person A\]**, was not the owner **\[Person B\]** whom I assumed to be, but she was just a Manager at the company. In which at this stage, I was still net yet aware that the person named **\[Person B\]** was an owner. And since **\[Person A\]** took charge of the entire interview process, I assumed that she was the person I needed to talk to, where during the conversation she even mentioned that her direct boss/owner, **\[Person C\]** was not in office today. Thus leaving me to further assume that apart from her fellow co-workers, no one above her position wise was even at the office that day.

In any case, I then get a notice from the Employment Services agency that the owner **\[Person C\]** would like to talk to me directly over phone the next day. Since after they asked, it turns out that contrary to what **\[Person A\]** said during the interview about wanting me to come in for training, the owners themselves were still in deliberation as to who to hire for the job I applied for. So the guy from the agency then proceeds to give me a time, as well as the phone number for **\[Person C\]**.

**Next Day/Phone Call:**

The next day comes, and at the appointed time I call the owner **\[Person C\]** to try to get in contact with them. But for some reason, at the last minute it turned out that **\[Person C\]** was in a conference call, so while I was trying to call **\[Person C\],** I get a random several calls from someone whose caller ID picks up in the United States.

I applied for a position in Canada by the way, since that's where I live in. So naturally I assumed it was spam and rejected the call from the US several times while I tried to leave a voicemail for **\[Person C\]**, but failed to since well, iPhone.

So it wasn't until I got a text message from **\[Person C\]** stating that she was busy, and informed me that the number from the US that was trying to call me was actually the owner **\[Person B\]'s** phone number, and that I should call her instead. So hurriedly I call the US number back, where after a brief 5 minute call it ended and leaving me with more questions than answers. For reference, this was the detail of the call:

* How far where I lived from their company, which is understandable.
* What my current work situation was, and what days specifically I currently worked for them. What? And why is that relevant to this position?
* When I mentioned how the interview situation turned out, the owner **\[Person B\]** passively aggressively stated ""oh, there were other people who wanted to meet you that day during the interview"" like it was my fault for not having met with the correct people then?

After the call ended I felt highly irritated at this entire process. I lived with toxic family all my life, so I can easily tell when someone is being passive aggressive. Near towards the end of the call **Owner B** acted as if she was irritated at ME for not picking up her calls when she called, and as well as it being my fault for not having met with her at the interview then.

I'm sorry, nobody informed me about your phone number in the first place. And I DID happen to hear from the manager, **\[Person A\]**, as to how that day there were no owners in office? So it didn't occur me to ask for you, **\[Person B\]** specifically since I all I hear from her was her direct boss and second owner, **\[Person C\]** wasn't even in office that day?

Anyways, that was it. Without asking me about my qualifications for this job, discussing/negotiating and pay range, etc, the call abruptly ended. Without me even getting a chance to ask when I would be hearing back from them about their decision for this position.

**Conclusion:**

That's about it for my rant/story. Where right now I emailed the Employment Services rep to have them let me know about the client's decision. Apart from that brief negative meeting with **\[Person B\],** I was told by the rep that the manager **\[Person A\]** had a rather favorable opinion of me. So I'm hoping to get a favorable reply. For despite having to be wary of the future bosses and their disorganized company structure, I did find the job and what it does to be very interesting potential experience for me.

**My Question of the Day: || --------------------**\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Are there hiring processes these days where employers would screen out candidates by having them intentionally meet a person of a lower position instead? Where if they failed to meet certain directions or ""keywords"", such as meeting with the big boss directly, that would act as a decision factor in the hiring process?***

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In any case, yikes. Talk about several red flags being raised in my mind during this entire weird hiring process."

I just got what feels like a “first job” to me.
First one in a while.
My career life has been extremely disappointing.
I spent five years in college, worked odd jobs to get through it, and finally graduated with my bachelors in economics.
Then, lacking direction or care, I took a front desk job at a non profit randomly because it was the first thing that came up and it paid $15 an hour (which seemed like a lot to me at the time)

Then after a couple years I quit to stay home with my kids for five years.

Now, I’m starting out again, in my third month, as a bank teller.

I feel like such a loser and I hate being in direct customer service fakey “I have to be nice to you” jobs. 
I feel like I made a mistake with this job.

But honestly I don’t remember any technical skills I learned in college and feel unprepared and unqualified to apply for better positions.

Im not saying this is a bad job,
I think it’s great for someone who enjoys customer service or who is just starting out in life.
(My coworkers are all freshly adults)
Im 32. Spent (wasted?) 5 years of my life busting my butt for a degree.

And I’m here, basically being talked down to by haughty old customers like I’m a kid!!!

Am I just being full of myself or did I sell myself short?
I don’t want to work here anymore but I don’t know where to go.
Im considering going back to school but I need work experience. 
But I don’t have any serious work experience so I hesitate to apply for more impactful jobs.
I don’t think I have any marketable skills, but I’m definitely not learning any here.

I feel like Im spinning in circles.
Idek what I want to do anymore."

Met with one of the local cancer hospital’s recruiters and was very well prepared.  Even had reference numbers for positions I had scouted out on their website.

For context, my resume has been reviewed by multiple corporate professionals and my wife who is an HR manager.  All have offered tweaks to make it great and approved the final version.  I’m 41 and voluntarily left a high paying job in O&amp;G for healthcare, so I’m not some kid who doesn’t understand how the world works and has no experience.

This recruiter proceeded to critique my resume and inform me that I should’ve made multiple versions for each type of job I’m applying for instead of discussing what is available.  I retorted (as un sarcastic as possible) that I didn’t think it made sense to bring multiple versions to a job fair, especially since I don’t want to pigeon hole myself into a few career tracks; which I knew as soon as I said it was a bad move.  She then told me I needed something to make me stand out.  I really wanted to tell her the fact that I dressed in my best suit, drove an hour, was sincere with my promise to work hard, and thoroughly prepped should stand out from those who didn’t bother.  I knew I better stop before losing my cool so I didn’t.

Of course I was rejected by her a couple hours later for a job she posted and referred me to.

Enough so that I don’t want to do anything that would hurt my chances or how they view me.  Therein lies my dilemma.  I’ve heard you’re supposed to call and follow up after an interview after it has been so long and I followed the first interview by calling 10 days later.  I got a machine and just left a brief message stating who I was, that I’d interviewed and I was thankful at the opportunity to interview with them for the position.  They returned it Monday (I called Friday) and I got an in person interview.  Well that’s in the books as of Monday and so now, I need help.  We weren’t taught in school what to do after a second job interview.  This was the second 2nd interview I’ve ever had and thankfully, it went leaps and bounds better.  They said on the way out after giving me a tour of the facility that they would be in touch.  That could go a few ways.  I would like to know what I should do now.

I want to take my job to the lawyers for their treatment of me and their lack of duty of safety (they've told me to ingore workplace health &amp; safety laws, cause the workplace excuse is ""this is how things have been for the past 30 years."" )

Now..I've spoken to my doctor and she says ""DONT!!!"" She claims that the company lawyers will need access to all my medical history including my families medical history and claims that my work can say ""well..none of this was caused by work but rather the trauma you went through before starting here.."" . My doctor has also said ""this can blackball you from future employment."" As well as noting that it could cost me a fortune to sue my job and time that I may not have. 

I have emailed advice from a few different lawyers but some say ""we need the company name due to conflict of interest may rise."" But I didn't feel confident giving them the work place info while I'm asking for advice while the other lawyers say ""we aren't a workplace lawyer."" 

So..is it true?

Those who have sued their jobs for bullying. Is it true that your employer can use your/your families medical history against you? Is is it true you can be blackballed from future potential jobs? 

I'd appreciate any advice...even if it's generic-ish. 

Thanks."

I am unhappy at my current job and have been spam applying to different job postings related to my field (I work in tech). The job I am interviewing for has the salary range as 140k-250k. That range seems like a bit of a red flag but I did not notice the huge range when I was spam applying. To add, salaries MUST be included on job postings where I live however for this job they also expressed that actual salaries ***will*** vary DOE (bullshit, I know). They didn't even say may vary, they are letting me know that range is not accurate. Now I did more research on the company and it seems like their employees genuinely enjoy working there. I also looked them up on H1B and it does seem that they pay above market range but I am still skeptical. I have not gone on many job interviews and I am wondering if it is a bad idea to kindly ask why the range is so broad. I am somewhat desperate to leave my current job, but I know my worth and do not want to waste my time or theirs. I need some advice!"

• I live for clearly scheduled workloads and crystal clear expectations.
• I love being a student — I’m in college now, and love everything from the reading to the essays to the tests. 
• I’d like to work in an office.
• I’m a creative thinker.

I didn't expect much but they even failed at that. I spent weeks arguing about a share code for work - I don't have or need one as I have Indefinite Leave to Remain which is a stamped visa in my passport. This was provided with all my other documents and clear proof I have the right to work.

All the other checks including enhanced DBS, background checks and health checks cleared within hours. 

I've finally reached the finish line and the contract they've put forth is less than half the wage for the offer originally accepted in writing.

I'm hoping this is a typo, it has to be because it works out to below minimum wage but part of me thinks they're actually trying to underpay me significantly.

I've emailed asking for clarification but... Don't really know where to go from here?

Any advice? I'm not particularly keen on working for this place now but I'd still like to know what my rights are.

Will this be a dealbreaker for bank/lawfirm/consulting firm when hiring, even though one was not guilty?

They're quite aware of how short those shifts are with how some of those shifts on my rostering app having the shift completion time set to 10:30am. 
A few days ago before starting my week's shifts my roster was changed to less shifts but given a 9 hour shift of 8am to 5pm (which'll be tomorrow). 
I'm really suspicious of it, considering nobody else except the manager and second in charge get 9 hour shifts, especially more so with the explanation of what'll be given from my boss being ""you'll do the usual cleaning. Then after 10:30 you'll have an hour break which after that you'll be learning some bar work with me.""
Theres not only the weird, poor explanation of what the shift'll be &amp; the strange length of it, but the fact its come about after only 1 6 hour shift (which was finally bar work) and 9 1 and a half hour shifts over the last month. I have a big feeling the shift is actually an 8-10:30 shift disguised to be something else for some reason (keeping me motivated to stay there?).
Idk, either way, i'm quitting the job after the end of this week (due to the main boss being quite abusive and immature to say the least, being ripped off with these small useless shifts and the awful pay, both those things i can discuss on in the comments)"

I’ve applied to dozens of jobs. Every single company that has called me in for an “in person” interview has offered me a position. I have received and signed 6 offer letters and have been going through the motions of drug screenings, background checks, etc. with each in hopes that at least one will come back and not mind my charges (motor vehicle accident that is not related to drugs or alcohol). 

I have a college degree and am a very experienced electrician who has worked for  multiple companies over the last 15 years. My experience along with the demand for jobs was something I knew would work out in my favor, but what I didn’t know was the amount of companies who wouldn’t rescind their offer due to my background check, or companies who simply didn’t care. 

I will be working for a company that I’ve wanted from the beginning, the one I was really hoping to get over the others but now I have the horrible task of telling 5 other companies no after I’ve already signed everything and got start dates. 

I understand for a typical person this is a backwards approach to looking for a job but in my mind I knew I couldn’t turn down a single job offer because there’s always that chance that THAT one would of been my ONLY one. I figured most would take back their offer after running a full background check. 

I just feel like a complete A-hole writing emails to these other places telling them I’ve accepted another job offer. Has anyone  experienced anything similar? What is the best approach? Obviously my emails will be respectful but I wanted to get other people’s thoughts on my whole approach to this situation and if I should of done anything different."

There are a litany of issues which I won't detail here, but suffice to say they are not reconcilable. I am confident that I will be miserable at this company for as long as I remain here, and as such have decided to give notice. 

I have had several conversations with my boss about the issues, and she understands the impact that they are having on my performance and mental health. So I don't think this will be entirely a surprise to her, but I'm still struggling with how to approach this conversation. This is a boss who I have a long and very successful working relationship with, and who has always supported me at every turn. 

Any tips or guidance for framing this conversation?"
2,2022-12-02,"Leaving a low paying, easy job for a higher paying job?",u/IIIIIIIIDidIt,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zan99q/leaving_a_low_paying_easy_job_for_a_higher_paying/,jobs,"My current job is easy, not stressful, very laid back, and has a great work-life balance. The workload is light most of the time and it allows me to do chores around the house during working hours so I can just relax on my days off which are Friday-Sunday. I can take time off whenever and I can easily move my hours around if needed for appointments. If I want to take Monday off instead of Friday, I can. If I need to leave a few hours early one day, I can and make up the hours another day or just put in time off. If I wake up early and can’t go back to sleep, I can clock in early and finish my day early. I go about my day without having to interact with anyone. The only downside is that the pay is low. $15/hr. 

I have been browsing through for other jobs and I did receive an offer. This new position’s pay would be about an additional $12,000 a year. There are also set hours, weekends and holidays required, shift bidding, and schedule adherence. There isn’t any leeway for moving hours around. I would be working every Saturday with a day off during the week and if, for any reason, I would need to switch my day off, I would either have to have time off approved or swap schedules with someone.

Now, I’m not in need of extra money (my partner makes enough to pay for most but i still chip in) but when it comes down to it, I don’t even like discussing how much money I make. I have a bachelor’s degree and only make $15/hr. I’ve been content with it seeing how my job doesn’t stress me out at all and the grass won’t always be greener on the other side. The job I have now is just that, a job. This new job would be the start of a career but I would have to keep it up for at least a year before potentially moving up, not a guarantee. 

I’m not quite sure if it is worth it to leave my stress free job for something that might stress me out and give me less freedom but higher pay. 

Any advice or tips?"
2,2022-12-02,I feel like giving up,u/Amzy123,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zan9sh/i_feel_like_giving_up/,jobs,"I keep getting rejected for every single role I interview for and the feedback is always somehow positive so they never have a clear answer for why they reject me. This week I had an interview for a role that was paying significantly less than what I’m usually used to applying for and I did so well they they asked how soon I can start and got me in with the director within minutes I spoke to him and we discussed next steps and today I wake up to a rejection “because I didn’t answer the questions well” I asked how can that be when I passed the first stage interview. If I didn’t answer them well I wouldn’t have even gotten to speak to the director. I hate to say it but I have a feeling it’s because of my hijab. 

I’ve had others reject me and I can tell as soon as they see me their demeanour changes. I have a whole masters degree and an internship with extensive experience so I’m honestly lost for words. I feel like giving up. Just had a breakdown that has been pending for a year due to all the rejections. I know I need to be strong and suck it up but when you keep getting rejected without a valid reason it stings even more. I’m a black woman that also wears the hijab so I probs won’t be the first pick of the bunch anyway but it still hurts

I've never had a job before, so I apologize for my ignorant question, but it's just as the title says. I'm having surgery and I won't be able to do any lifting or crouching for about 4-6 weeks. As a barista, I have to do a lot of that with stocking/cleaning, so I don't think I would be able to work. I am able to work on slow days where I basically don't have to do anything, but my schedule at the moment is all the days where we have 500+ orders and you're rushing and whipping around for 7 hours. I am planning to talk to my boss about scheduling me for the slow days during that 4 week period, but I'm not sure how that would go. If I ask for this time off or a change in schedule, can that get me fired? This job is all I have to support myself and I don't want to risk losing it.

Thank you in advance."

I asked to speak with him on next shift and he said he would call me into the office. He never did, and I just watched him walk out once his shift had finished. 
Thing is, after that I for whatever reason had multiple chances to catch him again and I never did. I am an extremely nervous person, but even that’s no excuse lol.. it’s now got to this. 
So I look at my rota and I’ve (of course..) been added for 23rd AND the 24th. I’m going to have to tell him I can’t work, but I honestly can’t figure out how on earth I’m going to do it. I am terrible with words. I’m preparing to be yelled at as I’m typing this.. it’s an extremely busy time, and I feel like I’ve just let my whole store down at this point.

So, for months now, I want to leave my job and not look back at it ever again. While on the job, I also have to fight this illness that's been with me for a year now. It's not like it affects my work performance in any wayn(for now), I feel great and I could continue to work. I've come up with a plan for some side hustles, and I work on my side projects for months now, building and growing an audience. However these plans are nowhere close to being finished, I need to 6 more months to finally open my business to the public. Like I said it's a few projects, so, hell with it, I'd be happy if I manage to pull 100$ a month without working my ass off from these incomes, until I manage to grow my audience in the months to come. I thought to continue working till September next year, open my business up around June, and I would juggle two balls at once for 3-4 months, until I resignbfrom my job. And I like this plan, that's how I planned it and I totally would like this to happen. But, I'm afraid the illness will catch up to me before I manage to open the online business, so I'm thinking of quitting and relaxing, but then again I can't quit and relax if I have no income. I'm fuming at work right now, mad that this illness is getting in my way of plans. I also don't want to rush my projects, I want everything to be perfect. 

What would you do in this situation?

P.S The illness is not life threatening, and there's no cure.

Edit: It's not mental health."

0,2022-12-02,Job Interview had to be rescheduled last minute by interviewer. Red flag?,u/AstraBlaze,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zapa12/job_interview_had_to_be_rescheduled_last_minute/,jobs,"I had a job interview lined up last night. I arrived about 10 minutes early, but was told by another manager that the person who interviewed me had to leave early and the interview had to be rescheduled for next week. I told my brother about it and he's telling me that I shouldn't take the job if the interviewer had to reschedule last minute and not have me informed until I arrived, but it's for a job that I think I'll enjoy at a place that seems really good from what I've researched. I also don't know if I'd get any better opportunities to get my feet wet in this career for some time if I turn this job down.

I'm not sure if I should give this place a second shot since the other employees that were there were very helpful and friendly, but I'm unsure because my brother is telling me it's a bad sign that I wasn't told about it despite the situation changing so close to the scheduled interview time. I wanted to get some more opinions on it while waiting for the new interview next week. Thank you.

Edit: thanks for the advice everyone. I was really weirded out by my brother immediately assuming the worst and that this was the company ""showing how they actually are"" and that I shouldn't trust them, so I wanted to make sure."

I really prepared for this interview, I spoke to my manager, HR, etc and they were all supportive and gave me tips. I did mock interviews,  a job shadow so I really knew what kind of role I was getting into and knew it would be a good fit. I felt like I nailed the interview and even reassured them that I did my research and this was the job for me. 

A week later I'm told I didn't get the job. I have a meeting for interview feedback within the next two weeks but now I'm just dwelling on the fact I didn't get the job that I really wanted for multiple reasons and I'm stuck in a job that's affecting me and making me feel hopeless. 

As most people know, it's hard to even get to the interview stage so I really thought I had a good chance since I did my research and I was already with the company.

They informed us that they were “restructuring” the business following some “tough business decisions” and we were not “affected.” We then had a larger meeting telling the entire site that certain areas of the business were “affected.” 

I work for a large medical device company, that I can’t name, and just last week some big wigs came and took tours of our facility and even bought the entire site In n Out food truck lunch. They informed us that our output was great and we’re doing an amazing job and the following week…. Layoffs.

She did get there around lunch, but brought her sick kid in with her. Her daughter will often roam the office, so I shut and locked my door. I shot supervisors a note why and was told I should grab some Lysol first.

I can hear her kid openly coughing down the hall behind my closed office door. She's coughing all over that area of the office, which includes the break room where all of us have our meals.

When did it become okay to bring a sick kid into the office, when we've come to a place as a culture when it's no longer appropriate to come to work ill yourself?"

Over the summer I was randomly looking through linkedin on a sunday morning and, saw a job opening for a remote role. It was a one of those 'easy click' applications. Said 'why not' and applied, and forgot about it.  Got to work on Monday and shit hit the fan, worked nonstop for a few weeks and in the scurry I realized I missed an email from theses guys asking for an interview. Whoops, missed my chance. no biggy wasnt actively looking anyways. I move on.

Move to today, while this was all happening my GF has been applying to medical schools. I have been planning to follow her wherever she goes. Shes 95% sure she wants to go to this place in Kansas City, which lets just say, isnt a great place or my line of work. After digging, theres one major corp in my field thats in that area...The same company I ghosted. Theyre actively hiring for another role I would be interested in, but now its in person (which I prefer).

Would it be inappropriate for me to apply again? Maybe change the email? Maybe just say 'oopsy this went to my spam'?"

Finding it more difficult than usual getting employed. 

Assets wise, not much lol. I have a Nintendo switch that, I bought impulsively after my best friend passesd last year (he introduced me to gaming on the ps2) and my ps4 that is quite run down. My electric foldable bike is a little rough but it's also my only form of transport. 

I've not got any savings, student debt and overdraft. Interest is nott allowed to me religiously. 


I'm thinking I sell my switch as it's coming up Christmas time, it does have sentimental meaning but my friend's memory doesn't rely on a gadget I know. So I probably will do that. 

Any practical and creative ways to make a quick buck when in between work.

 I'm motivated and not feeling sorry for myself. No more pity parties I'm here to fight for a better life. 

I'm living with parents (culturally very normal) so I'm OK for food and shelter thankfully. 

I live in Britain, graduated from a good uni, there is some government help which helped me for phone bills and gym etc which tbh I couldve cut on a lot of things.

I had my second interview today (out of 3) and at the end one of the questions I asked was whether if I got the role, whether my current position as part of the team would be backfilled.

The interviewer seemed taken aback and the answer was not immediately; that there would be multiple players involved for that decision.

This would leave our already short-staffed team even further short-staffed which is why I asked - as I want to set the team up for success with proper resourcing.  

I also don’t know that I can succeed in doing my current role -and- a management role at the same time.  Our current manager wasn’t able to and they had years and years of experience.

Did I shoot myself in the foot?  Was this a poor question to ask?"

At the beginning of the year, I will be starting pilot schooling.

The program is only 7 months for all the certificates but with the school requiring a minimum of 5 days a week and 40 hours a week for school work l, the job I have right now isn’t going to work with my schedule. I plan on quitting by the end of the year but the thought of not working for 7 months and living off my savings for those 7 months kills me. 

I live in the Queen Creek/Florence area of Arizona and I just wanna know if anyone knows of any jobs that are available in this area that have extremely flexible schedules. To the point to where I can make my own schedule. 

My days off also consistently change with the school. One week I can have Monday Tuesday off. The next week I can have Thursday Friday off. And the week after that I can only get Sunday off. It’s constantly changing. I just loath the thought of not working for 7 months and some change. Anything advice or information would be greatly appreciated."

I had my SECOND interview for a company and I was so happy. I felt like this opportunity was made for me and really felt like my experience matched with the position. 

My second interview lasted for 2 1/2 hours. I did something so vulnerable and conducted a presentation in front of the CEO, CTO, AND CFO for 30 MINUTES!!!! Then got grilled with questions. Oh, let’s not talk about how I prepared for this position. I spent an entire week focusing on this presentation and creating a bunch of mock interview questions. All of this just to be told  they picked someone else who meets their needs better. 

NGL, I shed a few tears. I keep looking at myself in the mirror and I point at myself and say “at least you tried. You put yourself out there.”"

I was thinking then and there I probably won’t be in tomorrow and although I’ve woke up today coughing a lot more my voice is there but I called in anyway because it will probably get worse if I go in.

2,2022-12-03,Seeking advice on career change,u/Dangerous-Ad3495,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zbee8k/seeking_advice_on_career_change/,jobs,"I’m new to this sub after seeing some high quality responses to a recent post. 

I just had a wild year: 
• Present- Late 10.22: 
+ At the pre-licensing stage of an offer to become an insurance agency owner after being recruited on LinkedIn by the person who will mentor me. High ranked vetted company. Mentor has been in role 18 months, has a small team she’s building with a five-year plan to retirement. Told me the company allows folks in my role to retire in 5 years. Will require hard work but can make same annual income as most recent job. When I pass pre-licensing (either 12.14.22 or before 1.14.23) I will start a 3 month paid internship of $4000/month. If I pass, I get a $5000 signing bonus. 

+ Bought/enrolled in a short-term, nationally accredited certification program for the practice I want to do as a side business the rest of my life (coaching) 

+ Bought &amp; enrolled in HealthCare.gov health care - will cost $700/month

+ Took out a personal loan to pay all bills + mortgage until 12.22

• 10.14.22 - 2.14.22: Quit a high stress job that almost doubled my previous salary. Slight career change/impact. Big hit in my confidence &amp; sense of self. But, saw this as an opportunity to go for the life I think I want at this stage of my life. 

• Jan 2022 - Aug 2021: as I entered the 8th year of a job role I built from the ground up &amp; had a clear team/scope of work, I realized I don’t have any savings &amp; I will never make enough in this role due to org policy. Had an opportunity to ask for a new position to be created with appropriate pay - was told idea was fully supported but there is no guarantee. Can’t retire for 11 years minimum (I am 49F). 

+Colleague said I needed professional help for emotional support (Aug 2021). Took 6 week FMLA 8.21-10.21: found psychiatrist, psychologist, new GYN &amp; got them all on board with my PCP. Affirmed both burnout &amp; perimenopause with severe symptoms. Late Oct 2021: another colleague appointed to a state cabinet position asked me to apply for her job (same org, different field). Was offered position over 50 applicants, finalist with internal candidate. Left job 1 Jan 2021 to start job 2 a month later. 

Summary: I am a mid-to-late career professional (29 years). I’m burnout &amp; have been since 2008, seeking refreshment, support, direction &amp; appropriate value. I may be entering a new stage of life as I head into becoming 50 years old where I own 2 businesses that allow me to work from home, earn my worth, save + invest, and rebuild my reputation &amp; self-value based off of the best of the last 8 years (relationships that can be connected to for one of the two businesses). 

I think I can create a five-year plan where as I plan to retire in 5 years from the insurance business, I establish the coaching business and create a work/life balance foundation for the first time in my life. 

QUESTIONS: 

• Have any of you done something like this at this age or know someone who has? 

• If so, what is their quality of life: do you/they really have a true focus on their personal relationships? Do you see them as who they are &amp; not someone who works all the time? 

Thanks in advance."

It isn’t my first job and i’ve been working since i was 13 (now 18, working part time as im a university student) in smaller kitchen environments, much less fast paced than this. 

It’s only my second training shift today, 6 hours long so not too bad, but i get this overwhelming sense of anxiety the whole day leading up to the shift. 

I feel like i’m leaving slower than the other trainees and because it’s so fast paced at this particular branch it’s easy to fall behind. I normally don’t really get anxious for much and can just deal with it but this is really difficult. 

I know it’s only mcdonald’s but i think it’s the environment and how busy it is.

I have a vast of experience in SysAdmin and IT Support both internally and to customers.   


Everything seemed fine, and I did a total of 3 full interviews and an Assessment with the company and all seemed like they liked me. ( 1 Interview with the HR, 1 Interview with the Team Lead, and 1 Interview with one L2 Employee and Head of Department). After my last Interview I waited 2 days and sent an email to the HR that was handling my application, and asked that I was excited and liked the role etc, and was eager to get an update. 

2/3 days later, I got a very upsetting email with ""We believe you are overqualified for the position given you do have a wealth of experience in Tech Support - above an L1 level."" I really felt awful and would prefer if I just received an automated email as a no..   


I'm so confused as, 1) They could see if I'm overqualified or not in my CV not after doing 3 whole Interviews + an Assessment before the 2nd Interview. And we also talked in 2 Interviews, and I explained clearly that I have a gap in my cv cause I want a more customer oriented role where I can grow as maybe a lead or just teach other new ones. So I don't get the point..   


Now I'm really upset cause I don't know what to do, and I don't really wanna go back to SysAdmin and continue studying for more certs or more depth in my career."

She was married to my dad for 20+ years and didn’t have to work, she was a stay at home mom for the most part. She kept a part time bartending job during this time. 
Before they were married she had a cosmetology license doing hair and had a small business making cakes, the combo of these have given her pretty bad arthritis. 

They divorced in 2013 and she had a decent gig as a general manager at the bar she had been tending. She had a falling out with the owners due to poor treatment and left after 6 years.

Since leaving the GM position, we were in the midst of covid and she was unemployed for nearly 8 months. When the unemployment ran out, she got hired working a very high stress, and very physical retail job (working the truck line at a very big chain.) This job has visually taken 10 years off of her life. She hobbles around and her knees are swollen and her fingers barely work anymore. Her blood pressure is through the roof, and she is constantly stressed about this job. They’ve refused to put her in a less physically demanding position without a large pay cut. She has a mortgage and bills so she feels she has to continue with the higher paying role. 

She’s applied to many different office type jobs, customer service, admin, etc, however she lives in a small town with rare opportunities and after doing interview after interview she’s lost hope. She’s sure that she’ll be working her current job til it kills her. She even mentioned getting her financials in order because she’s afraid she’s going to die. Watching her health decline so rapidly is extremely hard.

She’s unsure if a work from home job is right for her, she’s always been someone to be on her feet, keeping busy. Her computer skills aren’t great, and she doesn’t have any college. Regardless, shes moldable and a crazy hard worker.

My questions is - where the hell do we go from here?

TLDR: my 52 year old mom is working a physically demanding retail job and it’s killing her body, but is struggling to get hired anywhere else."

Job 1: Public University, Salary Range $37k-$43k. When asked what I wanted I stated $41k. After they completed their rounds of interviewing, they contacted me and said they loved me, but they could not do $41k because the range was the salary for the entire position, not a starting salary. They said they wanted to figure some things out and would contact me in a few months if they got approval for increasing the salary for this position. 

Job 2: Private Company, Salary Range was $44-46k. I got the job and they hired me. I’ve been working there for 2 months for $46k.

Currently:
2 weeks ago Job 1 contacted me offering the job at $41k. I declined because I make more at Job 2 &amp; due to this salary I moved out of my living situation into a better one. I told Job 1 if they could match or increase my salary I would accept. They said that was not something they could do and wished me well in my current role. 

Earlier this week, Job 1 contacted me again and offered me $45k, they stated that was the absolute highest they could go at the moment and would really like me to consider. 

I am considering but I don’t know if the benefits outweigh the earning potential.

Job 2
Pros: I love my job, I love what I do and I enjoy doing it every day, maybe more earning potential (rumor coworker got a $10k raise after 6 months)
Cons: Terrible benefits, 1.5hr commute each way, 5 days a week, 10 days PTO a year that do not rollover, no sick leave, 6 paid holidays, cubicles from lower level to CEO, high insurance, no 401k or retirement, just company stock

Job 1
Pros: Better benefits, PTO rolls over, better insurance options, better maternity leave, paid tuition, 45 minute commute each way, two days remote weekly, 13 paid holidays, week of paid during christmas, own office, view of the city
Cons: Have never worked in this field, might hate the job, requires local travel sometimes during the week, already taking a $1000 pay cut, earning potential may be limited as they struggled to get me $45k

And tell you at the firing to come back in 3 Months and they will REHIRE YOU. Clearly this is to prevent paying benefits. What was worse was I had been working mandatoy overtime and we were about to get $1800 bonus for peak season. They let me go just before that and it went to new hires that never did mandatory OT. The reason I was given was safety, they wouldn't elaborate other than the 3 ""injuries"" I supposedly had which were just little cuts in my hands. Which they tell you report or they will fire you for not reporting and they watch us all on camera literally like hawks. I filed a complaint with the EEOC bc I believe that my disability was the real reason they had for firing me. There is a ton more about that too. Harassment for being in recovery, constant  manager micro management that noone else got. Ect.

I’m living with my boyfriend and he’s working extra hours to help make ends meet. I’m applying for unemployment and going to start applying for retail/food service jobs and try freelancing. My typical job is marketing/instructional design. I’ve done both in my fairly short career. I have about 2 years of experience with instructional design and 1.5 years of experience with marketing. I also used to run my own photography and videography business. I helped develop a marketing program from the ground up and transform multiple training programs. I have a ton of writing experience, a ton of experience with photography, and a good amount of experience with Lightroom and Premiere Pro. I’ve also worked with Wordpress and Sharepoint, Adobe Illustrator and programs like Articulate 360. I have a fairly good portfolio too… it’s not complete, but you can definitely see a lot of my work. I’ve applied to maybe 300+ jobs.. but only interviewed for a few.. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I know my experience may be limited but I can learn quickly!! The job I really want is a branding and social media content development job where I help with marketing strategy and do photos, videos, blogs, graphics, some web updates, and make branding materials. Jobs like this have also been hard to find… so I’ve been applying to anything related to it and still nothing.. someone please help."

1,2022-12-03,Should I do a MBA after finishing my Software Engineering degree ?,u/Vil-Da-Bil,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zbkrdu/should_i_do_a_mba_after_finishing_my_software/,jobs," Hi Everyone! I am from Sri Lanka, and I am 18 years old. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering. I am doing a British degree here in Sri Lanka. I am currently in my second year, and I have another year left. I am also doing the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination.

*""The Sri Lankan Advanced Level (A-level) is a* *General Certificate of Education* *(GCE) qualification exam in* *Sri Lanka*\*, similar to the\* *British* *Advanced Level*\*, conducted annually by the\* *Department of Examinations* *of the* *Ministry of Education*\*. It is usually taken by students during the optional final two years of\* *collegiate level* *(grades 12 and 13) or by external (non-school) candidates after they have completed GCE O/L exams.* ***The qualification also serves as an entrance requirement for Sri Lankan state universities.****""*

As you can see, Sri Lankan students have to first finish the A/L exam to get into a university, but I got a scholarship to a degree before I even finished my A/L's. I am doing accounting, business studies, and ICT for my A/L. My long-term goal is to build a company. I love businesses more than anything; I love to do research on them, I love to read and analyze different branding and marketing strategies, etc. I am also interested in the stock market. Actually, one of my goals is to build a company like Berkshire Hathaway. So as a career, I would like to become an investment banker rather than a software engineer. I like programming, but **I love finance**. The **most important goal** of mine currently is to migrate to the USA. I believe that the USA has so many opportunities, and I like their culture. But due to the ongoing crisis in our country, the visa success rate is pretty low for Sri Lanka, and the cost is extremely high.

On the other hand, our country's higher education is totally free (at state universities), but it takes at least another 5–6 years to graduate. What should I do? I am thinking about doing an MBA transfer program in the USA right after finishing my A/Ls and SE degree. I really need your expertise and your guidance. I appreciate everyone taking the time to read this.

Stay Safe!"

I want to leave on good terms and I was going to offer 2-3 weeks to maintain responsibilities and train any replacements - and also make myself available for any questions they may have after my departure. (I don't want to burn any bridges). But do I mention anything about PTO? Given that their policy on this changed in 2020 and frankly I wouldn't put it past them to withhold that PTO reimbursement payment (because they know that I, as an individual, would loath having to deal with a lawsuit--so they may just not pay).

I wanted to ask what i can do in this situation... i applied for a company (no job listing but i dropped off my resume then for any future openings) early this year. I got an interview around June but i didn't hear anything back so i thought they proceeded with someone else. I got contacted in Nov. again and said they would like me to join their team... i did my thorough due diligence and i found it ideal to proceed with them. It is a US company, i am based in Canada and therefore was to be hired as an independent contractor. They asked me when i can start and i made it clear that i needed 2 week notice so i can quit my current job and start.. and that is what happened. I put in my 2 week notice and left my job. I was advised that they started my onboarding but didn't hear any updates.
Didn't think anything of it since i have the offer letter signed by me as well as the owner of the business. The day before i started i contacted them to inquire about the onboarding and to make sure everything is going accordingly but i didn't hear back, first day came and i still didn't hear anything so i tried to schedule sometime with the founder to follow up. An on boarding form was then sent to me i filled it up and sent it back within an hour of receipt... didn't hear anything back although i was following up. I received an email yesterday saying they unfortunately had to freeze their hiring due to corporate restructure. I am out of a job and i cannot go back to my old one... how do you think i should go about this, is there anyway i can report this behaviour???"

Ps: I found the link for the job on LinkedIn and the company asked for someone with 4 to 5 years experience and willing to work 9 to 10 hours which is fine to me.

Any Help?,u/LegendsLiveForever,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zbta4i/job_is_asking_for_precise_start_end_dates_of_all/,jobs,"I have the last 6-7 years within 1-3 months accurate, before that, I barely have start dates. I've had multiple PC's since then, redone my resume dozens of times, lost files. The job also wants every single month of unemployement accounted for in the last 10 years, and a reference (co-worker or friend) to confirm it. I'm a bit stressed out. I'm really bad with dates, and if the dates don't match up exactly, I could get my acceptance for the job rescinded. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried the IRS website, different records, but it didn't have precise end dates. I can check my emails (search for names/companies) to find start dates. But i'm more than a bit worried about this. Any suggestions? Should I just email every single company's human resources? One went bankrupt, and the other is a small business that's traded hands multiple times. Suggestions?"

I am trying to make the transition to a less physically intensive job. The company I work for now is trash, but as I'm a higher paid apprentice, the wages are holding me back from just going into something simple and less streneous or dealing with less ridiculousness.  I have some college, but when I took the apprenticeship, my associates took a back burner temporarily. I've been learning coding on my own, so my familiarity with tech has greatly increased. I mention this because I applied for a position at Liberty Mutual as an Associate Tech Support Agent. They say they want at least an associates degree. Anyone have any insight into the company if they hold true to that? Does anyone have any contacts internally that I may be able to get into contact with?

I have worked for 2 years out of high school, as I only lasted one semester in college before dropping out due to mental problems, (specifically PTSD, I had RAD as a child). My therapist has encouraged me to work only 4 days a week at my current job, but even that is hard, and nearly every week I am dead set on quitting because of how I am treated by customers and management. At both jobs I had, I was commended for my excellent customer service and interpersonal skills,  but internally I am crumbling, and even working 4 hour shifts part-time leaves me completely in distress when I get home.

I have no college degree, but I did graduate high school. I know how to code HTML and CSS for the most part, learning both of them on my own. I am looking for job ideas I could reasonably manage, as I do not want to stay in food service and would like to get a more career-oriented job or at least a job that has less customer interaction. I am interested in writing and coding, and if anyone has job ideas or certificate programs they could recommend that would be great. I am open to nearly everything that does not have a lot of negotiation, selling, or customer service aspects."

The title says it all.

Hi. I'm 25 and I'm a tenured employee for the first time. I've been working for my my current company for almost 7 months now. Before this, I've been freelancing since college. Actually, I'm still doing some freelance work on the side cos my day job doesn't pay a livable wage. 

Perks: WFH. It's something I'm already used to and comfortable with. Plus, it's less costly compared to working on site. This is the biggest and main reason why I took the job. This and health insurance (which hasn't kicked in yet).

I'll cut the story short and give you a gist of how things are currently. There were changes recently made by management that favored the company. Surprise, surprise. But the thing is, even before then, the baseline was already pretty bad. With the amount of work to be done in a day, I normally have to clock in early or keep working past 5. We don't get paid OT. They have incentive pay for those who produce beyond the quote, but the quota itself is already a struggle to reach. 

I'm tired and disheartened. There were other things along the way na naka discourage but I just brushed them off. I know that every job has it's downside. That's just reality. But I feel undervalued and exploited now.

The original plan was to resign next year, mid-year. I just wanted to learn and upskill by working here. I've been learning a lot and for that I'm grateful. But I want to quit before my one-year anniversary here. Would that look bad on my résumé? I've never been in a regular job before. Let alone being in one for at least a year. I'm scared that if I jump ship now, it'll look bad for my work history. 

I just know that I'm gonna be valued more and compensated well somewhere else."

Also my username has nothing to do with who I am it’s randomly generated. I am in the US. 

To get straight to the point I am looking for advice on what type of jobs or keywords I should be searching for related to my background and interests as explained below. Bonus points for remote/hybrid types of jobs.

I graduated with a BS related to biology about 1.5 years ago and have since been working as a lab tech. Well it turns out I really don’t enjoy wet lab work. I do enjoy the computational side of my job and have acquired skills related to Python, high performance computing, Linux, data vis, basic understanding of machine learning algorithms and so on all in the context of bioinformatics. I think I may be disinterested in basic science in general as I find the work very isolating and not clearly useful to society. Right now I mostly work alone, but I have realized that I am very motivated by working collaboratively and on a project that has a clear timeline and goals. 

My other demonstrated interests/experiences are mostly related to outdoor recreation/sports.

Vaguely interested but not particularly knowledgeable about public utilities, agriculture, and renewable energy.

Based on my skills, what type of roles, keywords, companies should I be looking for in my job search? I am unfamiliar with the general workforce outside of academic science. Any help/thoughts about how I can leverage the skills I have or new skills development suggestions would be much appreciated. Open to any type of work that I might be qualified for. Thanks."

Coincidentally, the day before I started work I was experiencing some bad pain in my lower abdomen, so I went to the urgent care to get it checked out.

The doctor thinks it's probably a hernia, and I have an ultrasound on Tuesday to confirm. If it is a hernia, surgery is the only solution, and the sooner the better because hernias tend to get larger and more dangerous the longer you let them go on.

I'm still in training at this job, and I have no idea how to even bring this up to my employer. I'm going to wait until after the ultrasound of course, to make sure that I even know for sure what the problem is.

Since I'm new I have no sick time or vacation, and the surgery will have me out of work for about a week.

Part of me is worried that they're just going to fire me, but the other part of me thinks- ""hey, they hired me because they want me in this role. Having to have surgery was an unforeseen thing that I have no control over, and I'll only be gone about a week, after which I can come back and keep on working indefinitely.""

Am I just overthinking it? The timing on this is atrocious, but I figure that it will take a few weeks to actually get my surgery, which gives them time to train me properly. I don't see why they would train me for several weeks and then just fire me because I have to take a week off of work to have surgery. Then they'd have to hire someone else and train them all over again.

I want to be transparent with them and emphasize that this is something that I have to have done whether I like it or not, but it shouldn't be a recurrent thing and I can come right back to work as soon as I recover."

1,2022-12-04,So the wage range really isn't the wage range? Company claims wages for positions go from X to Y. FALSE!,u/moldyjim,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zcs3a5/so_the_wage_range_really_isnt_the_wage_range/,jobs,"Back at the turn of the century, I worked at a barcode scanner company that posted a wage range bracket for (most) all of the positions in the company. 

Say an assembler 1 would get paid between $10 to $15 per hour. An assembler 2 was $12 - $17  etc. Area manager got between $18-$24 ph.

Pretty clear huh?

Not if you dig into the actual usage of the brackets. If you were a good employee and they liked you, you might creep up to halfway between the brackets. Unless you transferred or got a promotion you could realistically be stuck at the midpoint forever. No one was allowed to pass the midpoint in pay unless it was a very special circumstance. IE; blackmail or really, really good at brown nosing. 

I was reaching the midpoint after 5 years, and expected a raise. That's when the ""You can't exceed the midpoint"" part was brought up. To get more I would have to be promoted. 

At that point I was senior tech and topped out in my department, the only promotion I could have would be into manager, or supervisor type position. (I shudder at the thought!)

I thought about it for a couple of days and requested a meeting with my boss and HR.
Believe it or not,  my boss was actually trying to do good by me. His hands were tied though.

It was not appreciated by HR when I brought up the fact that if no one could exceed the midpoint, the midpoint was the actual top pay on the scale, not the theoretical end of the pay range.

Why advertise $20 to a possible $25 pay scale when in reality it was actually limited to $22.50 at the maximum? Seemed bullshit to me.

Of course they came up with some lame excuses and justifications that didn't hold water.
That's when things started going downhill for me. Suddenly the guy who was getting 4s 
and fives on his reviews, being awarded bonuses for innovations and problem solving was not meeting expectations. Put on a PIP, verbal warnings etc.

I even got in trouble for finishing a job too quickly. I had estimated it would take 5 days to make a certain part. Once started I figured out a better and faster way to do it. Got in trouble for cutting the time and cost in half. WTF?

Received my 5 year bonus award, got laid off the next week. Two weeks later 9/11 hit and the job market went to shit.

Sadly it was up until the end a really good job for me. I enjoyed working there. An American company with solid products and a great highly skilled workforce. One of the original scanner companies and built some of the first self checkout systems.

But in the end karma came back to bite them. Within a couple of years they went bankrupt  because of shitty executive decisions. Seems that when you hire and fire three different CEOs over four years, paying each one a couple million $ in severance pay, you run your company into the toilet.

It got bought out by a European conglomerate and ended up sending the manufacturing to China, kept a token office in the states but is really totally foreign owned now.

I struggled for most of the 2000s to get a decent job, but finally got lucky in 2010.

We will see what happens next."

Hi all,

I am infinitely curious on what people do for a living, and I’d like to know about your job. Most of the reason why I’m asking is info gathering for a possible career change. 

I would prefer if you do not share the specific company you work for (unless you feel comfortable and it’s relevant).

Required questions:
What, generally, do you do for your current job?

How long have you been at this job?

What made you want to go into this field?

What about this job do you find most (and least) fulfilling, enjoyable, or satisfying?

Optional questions:
In what ways do you feel adequately prepared for this job? (education, experience, aptitude, personality, etc.)

What do you wish you'd known about this job before you started?

Any answers are appreciated."

I've been everything from a server, host, to-go person, assistant manager, dishwasher, you name it. Restaurants is all I've ever done, but at 30 years old, I'm looking for something new. I was offered a position in a completely different field and I took the job. It's a sales position, which some could say is in my field because being a server is constant sales, but this is a whole new category.

The closer my first day gets, the more anxious I'm getting. I've been saying that I want something new and that I want a new challenge because the service industry is no longer challenging for me. But I can't help but feel so much anxiety over this. I normally go with my gut feeling, but I ignored it this time. My original gut feeling was nahhh, not going to take the job, but at the same time, I just kind of felt like ""What do I have to lose? If it doesn't work out, then I go back to restaurants.""

Maybe I'm feeling so anxious because it's so far outside my comfort zone, but I don't know. My first day is starting in the morning and I want so badly to back out. I'm not going to, but I can't get over this anxiety. My stomach is in knots. I haven't felt like this in a long time."

However, chasing that feeling often times comes at odds with the end result you actually want. At work, if I’m working in a new surface area, I naturally want to prove to myself that I can figure out a problem without needing to ask someone because it’d feel sooo good if I can figure it out by myself. I had to stop that years ago. When I first started working, I’d be stuck on something for two days and then hesitantly ask someone for help.  Many time, the answer they gave was simple and could’ve saved me a day and a half worth banging my head against the wall. Be careful with your ego because it can be the enemy. The end result should always be to complete the task on time and correctly. Not to complete the task by yourself to validate your intelligence."

The school is half the distance from my current job and its $3 more an hour. So i decided to apply, a couple days ago i get a call during my lunch break from the Director of IT at the school district.  


I've spoken to him a couple of times in the past and me and him are on good terms with each other. He's also an adjunct at the university i work at go figure lol. He called to see if im still interested and would like to schedule an interview. However im out of PTO time, so i wouldnt be able to take time off to do the interview.  


So then he offers to come to the university and do the interview at the university, during my lunch break. So i do the interview, and it feels very casual. Like he gave me examples after my some of answers almost like trying to help me. And asked me follow up questions with some of the answers i gave. And then he starts talking about benefits for this position. Which i feel is a good sign.  


And then at the end of the interview he asked me to send him an email of some troubleshooting documentation ive created and sent to people. I guess to gauge how i write documentation.   


So what do you guys think have you ever heard of an interviewer coming to your workplace to do the interview? And do you think my chances are good based on what ive said?"

1,2022-12-04,Insanely nervous about a rather lengthy first interview post grad school,u/linkfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zcu487/insanely_nervous_about_a_rather_lengthy_first/,jobs,"Hi, I recently graduated from a machine learning/NLP MSc program this summer. I've had a hard time landing interviews (dozens of rejections including one for a Best Buy decision scientist or something that occurred in less than 12 hours - a new record for me). Anyway, a recruiter for a startup reached out and scheduled a video interview. The thing is, the interview is for 50 minutes. I haven't been on an interview in some years and I doubt most have taken longer than 15-20 minutes and I've even had a few 5 minute interviews (I'm not great at interviews). I've been working on things, but I'm just insanely nervous given how long the interview might be. The salary range is something I'd be extremely content with (110K-225K depending on experience and other factors). Given that my work experience is a bit lacking and my background is mostly educational/research, I'd certainly expect to be on the lower end, but that seems to be quite competitive with what some of my fellow alums are making. According to director of the graduate program, the median salary is 119K and the mean is 112K for about 200 alums who shared such information.

But anyway, yeah, does anybody have tips for such a potentially long interview? I have maybe 2 or 3 stories from my grad studies that relate to the job (speech recognition type stuff), but is it considered poor taste to pad the time that way? If anything, I guess it will be a good learning experience as I try to get myself out there again now that I'm finally done with grad school."

I've asked another coworker and he thinks it's weird since he's never on his floor.

Do I ask him what the problem is? If I'm doing something wrong ?

I was hoping for some advice, I've recently exhausted myself in trying to accomplish my dream job of being a comic book artist. I tried to break into the industry for 15 years and was never able to really hit. I've been published multiple times and done a couple of self-published works but nothing could get me an in. I was wondering what jobs or maybe positions,  my experience and skill as a comic book artist could translate to best.  
 .  
 

If it helps, I also have two degrees, an art and an associate, and ive worked in a comic book shop as an assistant manager for about 11 years.  
 

I would like something that pays well of course, and has benefits, but can maybe use my experience with art along with my experience with customer service. What careers do these skills best translate to? Any ideas would be great.

At my job I’ve been having some issues between myself and a coworker. The coworker who is at the same level as me is very bossy and tries to micromanage me. I’ve gone to my director about this multiple times, but my director is one of those people that tells you what you want to hear and does nothing. The bossy coworker also brown noses our director so he does not see anything wrong with the bossy coworker. This issues has been going on for months and my coworker and I have had multiple arguments. 

One reoccurring issue is bossy coworker and director claim I’m not findable during the day. They have been mad when I have taken a bathroom break or gone to get water and could not find me. This standard is not enforced on coworkers that will go missing for half a day. 

I‘ve been searching for a new job for months and intend to leave ASAP, but things are slowing down as we get closer to Christmas. What can I do to fix these issues in the meantime?"

2,2022-12-04,Does your company allow you to work from home if you do not live near a physical office?,u/raisedbynarcs123,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zcx4a5/does_your_company_allow_you_to_work_from_home_if/,jobs,"I work in am immigration law firm in San Francisco as a paralegal assistant and I like the job, but I do not like being in an office every day or having to commute into a big city for work every day when I live on the East Bay and plus I am a suburbanite. My job is completely onsite, because we assist the paralegals by using the printers at work since the immigration services only accepts things by paper. 

My team was invented because of the paralegals and the people above who want to work from home. My workplace mandates hybrid (3 days at home, 2 days in office) for those who can work from home. My workplace wants the paralegals (or whoever works for an attorney) to report to their attorney, but it is pointless when my team does the entire paper work. There are meetings in the conference room a lot, but that is only a fraction of the meetings that take place in the office, in fact, majority of the meetings are on Webex even though there are people in the office. 

I have good news that my boss gave me the green light that I can transfer to a team above mine when a position opens up. He had a particular position in mind, but since it is the end of the year, the team is still budgeting for next year and I probably will not get promoted to it next year. 

I understand you guys don't know what company that I work at, so you guys cannot really answer this, but do you think my company would allow me to live somewhere that does not have a physical office?

The reason why I question this is because I really want to move out of the Bay Area back to the East Coast so badly. My workplace has an office in a Pittsburgh suburb, but I do not have that area in mind, I have a different part of Pennsylvania in mind and I want to live somewhere semi-rural and I do not want to wait until I am old and retired just to live somewhere that I want and I do not want to commute into a large city every day. My workplace has a high turnover, so transferring from team or location is very easy and the bosses are lenient about it and trust me, I know the culture of my company well. I have asked one paralegal in my workplace on Webex if she is remote and she said she is completely remote since she resides in San Diego  where there is no office close by. One attorney lives in Las Vegas and only came to the office to visit a couple of times, there is no office in Las Vegas. 

I am 24M, trying to look for a new job, but I am taking a break from job applying since there is no luck due to the recession throughout almost all of 2022."

I've never been late to work (usually 20+ mins early to each shift), I always say yes when asked to stay back, and I always try to walk quickly, work fast and keep a positive attitude.

But unfortunately, despite my best efforts, a few of the supervisors have been yelling at me for things I've done wrong. For example:

- *""I told you to do X but you did Y instead. You need to listen to the instructions you're given!""*

- *""Why did you let this problem happen?""*

- *""You're not helping! Just go to X instead, I'll take care of this mess myself.""*

It hurts me so much to get yelled at when I'm doing my best. I never argue or answer back. I try to learn for next time. But something always happens which leads to me getting yelled at again.

Is it still possible for me to get promoted to supervisor, when my current supervisors are yelling at me like this?"

* A short cover letter that basically highlights my skills/etc
* My resume

Cover letter &amp; resume has been proof read, reviewed, and edited by three people

* First by a friend who is a hiring manager for my career field 
* Second is by another friend who is a senior manager in my career field
* Third is my wife who is an English teacher

My friends really helped me fine tune my resume and cover letter and my wife made sure my resume &amp; cover reads well. 

Cover letter is sweet and straight to the point. Resume is as sweet &amp; straight to the point as possible.

Since graduating in 2018 I've had 4 jobs. 3 of the 4 jobs have been almost identical in nature in that the role does not fit a focused business purpose, but instead is treated as a swiss army knife; complete any work that can't be done by their dedicated teams due to capacity constraints, and do it as quickly as possible. I'm finding that, much like a swiss army knife, I can't do the jobs as well as a dedicated tool. I want to feel like I'm good at what I do and after 4-5 years of doing the same type of work, I honestly cannot say I am. I'm mediocre at best and it's eating away at my confidence and self-worth. I have been getting this feeling that I'm digging myself into a deeper and deeper hole that will become increasingly more difficult to get out of because I'm not progressing in any one business area/niche. The leaders in business I respect the most are those that have a deep knowledge in their field of expertise and can guide and empower those under them to make impactful business decisions and progress in their own careers.

In addition to the above, I'm also having trouble finding any job (that can support me and my family) that interest me. I start browsing for jobs within my field and can't find a company or a role that interests me. Every now and then I do stumble across something that catches my interest, but either I am or feel that I am underqualified because of how shallow my knowledge is, even with 4 years of experience. This leads me to look for ""Jr."" or ""entry level"" roles again which pay 30-50% less than what I get paid now and who is to say my role at those companies doesnt end up getting me into the same exact mess?


**Where do I go from here?**

I'm feeling incredibly lost and hope that someone out there has some advice for me. Ultimately, my goal is to find a job where I can become an ""expert"" by growing in a very specific area of business. A huge plus is if I could find a job where I am directly helping people or the community, or the company is focused on making the world a better place somehow and not just focused on their bottom lines. I have a bachelor's degree in math and masters degree in applied math. I like working with data and I like programming (even though im not very good at it). I'm willing to make a career change, but need to be able to support my wife and child while doing so. Any advice or comments are appreciated."

It had been an interview but very informal and I am a person who uses humor in my day to day life either as a coping measure or just to break tension and awkwardness if the situation. This time was no different so fast forward to last week I had an interview at another agency which went well from follow up and personal feelings (other than having laryngitis) today I receive an email for the interviewer asking about statements made at this earlier interview as he had spoke to the interviewer of the other agency. I had made a joke about getting similar pay with half the of the stress (this position was lower level than I am certified but paid similar with good benefits) Now I feel my joke is hurting my chance for this part time position 2 months later as it seems like it wasn’t interpreted as lighthearted.  It’s hard to think that I’d have to change who I am just to get a job.

I have also completed a masters of science in biomedical sciences, and am now currently halfway through year 3 of a PhD in microbiology and immunology. Lately I have really been affected by burnout (been in school 10 of last 11 years), and am also just downright miserable in this program. I feel for the amount of work I do I am grossly underpaid, and receive little to no attention/ support/encouragement from my mentor. I also had some issues during my first year and as a result will probably need another 3 years before I can graduate. That being said, I was wondering given my background if there are any potential careers out there that would be worth it financially if I jump ship from this current program? I am 29 now and want to just be done with school, get a job, and settle down.
I'm tired of the toxic environment that is academia and want to start being compensated what I am worth. Over the last few years I have felt a VERY steep decline in my mental health and want nothing more than to get out of this, but don't know if there are any safe alternatives out there in terms of pay or job security.

Job 1: Public University, Salary Range $37k-$43k. When asked what I wanted I stated $41k. After they completed their rounds of interviewing, they contacted me and said they loved me, but they could not do $41k because the range was the salary for the entire position, not a starting salary. They said they wanted to figure some things out and would contact me in a few months if they got approval for increasing the salary for this position. 

Job 2: Private Company, Salary Range was $44-46k. I got the job and they hired me. I’ve been working there for 2 months for $46k.

Currently:
2 weeks ago Job 1 contacted me offering the job at $41k. I declined because I make more at Job 2 &amp; due to this salary I moved out of my living situation into a better one. I told Job 1 if they could match or increase my salary I would accept. They said that was not something they could do and wished me well in my current role. 

Earlier this week, Job 1 contacted me again and offered me $45k, they stated that was the absolute highest they could go at the moment and would really like me to consider. 

I am considering but I don’t know if the benefits outweigh the earning potential.

Job 2
Pros: I love my job, I love what I do and I enjoy doing it every day, maybe more earning potential (rumor coworker got a $10k raise after 6 months)
Cons: Terrible benefits, 1.5hr commute each way, 5 days a week, 10 days PTO a year that do not rollover, no sick leave, 6 paid holidays, cubicles from lower level to CEO, high insurance, no 401k or retirement, just company stock

Job 1
Pros: Better benefits, PTO rolls over, better insurance options, better maternity leave, paid tuition, 45 minute commute each way, two days remote weekly, 13 paid holidays, week of paid during christmas, own office, view of the city
Cons: Have never worked in this field, might hate the job, requires local travel sometimes during the week, already taking a $1000 pay cut, earning potential may be limited as they struggled to get me $45k

The thing is, the pay seems suspiciously high ($28.75/hr) for Data Entry. And according to LinkedIn that contact person hasn't worked for the company in 4 months.

It wasn’t really an isolated incident either - he’s “jokingly” told me off for not having my work phone charged in one of our morning briefs before and has also told me off for talking before (while I’m by no means a dosser, I took this on the chin as I could see how this looked from his perspective). 

We’re both well liked within the company - this makes me reluctant to talk about this to anyone as I don’t think it’s wise to go against long standing members of the company - and I get along really well with my department so I don’t understand where this anger comes from. We’ve talked thing over and we’re “okay” now but I don’t really understand what his problem is with me, he doesn’t make much of an effort to talk to me so it seems to be personal.

1. Monday\_\_The talent recruitment manager contacted me about my resume, spoke, and then set me up to talk with the director of the team I would be working with. 
2. Tuesday\_\_I spoke with the director, and everything went well. She then wanted to schedule two interviews with managers in the same department but run different teams. 
3. Spoke with both managers—one on Thursday and the Second on Friday. The conversations were good and engaging. 
4. Before the two interviews, the talent recruitment manager informed me that if everything went well with the interview on Friday, she could provide me with an offer letter by Friday (12/02/22) at the earliest. 

It is now Monday. Does this mean I didn't get the job, or are they still deciding? I was a finalist for the position. I left a voicemail with the talent recruitment specialist on Friday. Maybe I am overreacting..."

I am still under the same organization, just under a different manager.

1) Is there a battle I can fight to increase my salary?
2) Would I speak to my current manager or my previous about it?
3) Are there any rules/laws that prevent me from knowing what he was offered?
4) Any other thoughts?

I'll be asking for a raise soon and I would like it to account for a huge increase in cost of living over the last year. I'm just not sure how to determine what exactly that number is.

I understand the Consumer Price Index is the typical measure of inflation, but it also fluctuates on a monthly basis. For example let's say in August it was 8% and this month it's 6%. What does this mean exactly? Prices surely aren't decreasing, only the rate, but how do I turn this into percentage proposal for a raise? To keep it even simpler, let's say I signed my contract exactly a year ago, how do I go about turning the 6% or 8% monthly numbers into a measure of annual cost of living increases. Would I just average out the last 12 monthly CPI percentages?

Thanks!"

I’m a PhD student, was contacted a few weeks ago by a recruiter who said there’s a good role for me. 

Last Monday (28 Nov) I interviewed with the firm for an entry level role. I’m a PhD student but entry level yeah sure. Interview went well because they called me back to meet with them on Thursday (1 Dec). This was supposed to be an hour meeting with an analyst and manager but turned into a 2+ hour meeting because they both wanted me to meet the partner. Things were looking good. 

Two hours after the interview, recruiter contacts me and asks for my reference and passport. Things are looking really good. 

Today (5 Dec), recruiter phones me a said they’re not interested. 

I literally don’t get it, why take my reference and passport if you’re just going to reject me. Why waste everyone’s time, especially my reference’s. 

My reference (only wanted one) is my PhD supervisor, he’s honestly a top guy and we have a good relationship. I do good work. And he’s very happy with my work. I’m sure the reference was full of praise. 

What shall I make of this? Is it just one of those things?"

The company I work for— I’m proud to work for.  It’s why I kept chasing and even though the initial role I applied for and work in now (CS at a tech form) is awesome, it still makes me sad.

I did three full interview processes (2 for this same role and one in between for an HR role that one of the HR employees thought I may be a good fit for and invited me to apply).  This was three separate interviews each.  I was rejected after the first two entire interview processes after so much studying and trying.  The third process was the exact same as the first one — except I was replacing one of my original interviewers.

The other one I was denied for, the employee had been laid off for since I started for and the other one that was hired over me said she never even wrote a cover letter and got accepted.  I felt like I had to fight for this job and it kind has be feeling bummed for how hard I worked and how easy it was for everyone else on my team to be accepted.  Like why did I not stand out to them initially but 3 full interview processes later, I did?

I know I’m fit for the role and I do well in it because I’ve already gotten a few ovations and an award during our last company wide meeting, but I still feel major imposter syndrome and that it’s always been hard for me to get to where others are when they put little effort in and easily get these types of things.  And now I want to do bigger things because the role itself is just something I don’t see myself doing for a long time— another reason being that growth and lateral change in the company happens often and CS is often a starting point.

Have you ever been in a situation like this and how did you let go when the resentment built?"

I’ve been with this company for around 8 months now. The position had been posted for a few months but sounded really interesting. Basically I’m a product/project manager. When I first started there were a handful of people that were turning over since they had recently restructured the area. One guy (same title as me) quit right after I was hired and they just filled his job. Another person told me that I was going to have to teach myself everything as she quit. I took initially as a disgruntled employee leaving. My main point of contact at the vendor I work with had his job eliminated and now I have a new point of contact. 

Occasionally I’ll get in front of groups and present my product. Most of the time it goes well. However, there’s been 2 instances where it went completely wrong. One client basically had a competitor on the call and wanted to merge both our products. Which made no sense. Meanwhile she was constantly interrupting my presentation forcing me to jump around the slides which had no flow. All in all I looked like an idiot. Another call recently happened with a vp. I was intended to talk about something that was happening which he requested me to discuss. He jump in and basically starts asking for an overview. It caught me off guard since I didn’t have that prepared. He asked a couple layup questions but I was caught off guard and said I’d follow up with him since I wasn’t sure where he was going with this. Again, looking back probably should’ve just dealt with it. Also wfh as well. 

I had a 1 on 1 with my boss. I saw on her calendar that my bosses boss was joining the call. I’ve been working on things for them but had a feeling something was coming. Basically they told me I need to fully understand my products. They’ve had a couple people call them about me saying several others don’t think I understand it. Said not to take this as a negative but as a “time out” and use it/them as a successful path forward. I really consider it a verbal but I didn’t have to sign anything. 

Truth is I don’t feel very knowledgeable about my product at all. I feel handicapped in the help I’m getting. Don’t know what to ask until it happens. There are things that pop up that I fumble my way through since I’m learning as I go. Am I screwed here? What do I do? How would you take this conversation and go from here?"

Now that things are seemingly back to normal, we've both had countless issues finding any decent work, especially after losing our car. We've been job searching endlessly, on top of looking for an apartment to rent, but it seems that any jobs we hear anything back from seem to pay way less than what we would need to afford even a one bedroom apt. We're going to need to move soon as my parents split and the house is being sold and I've taken a job making very little full time as a cook at a restaurant and she has been interviewing and has prospects but even if she gets hired we still wouldn't be able to afford even the cheaper end of apartments. On top of all of that, getting a car so that traveling to potentially better options was our first thought but cars seem to have skyrocketed in price and acquiring one seems next to impossible. I just don't know what to do or how to get out of this situation and any advice would be greatly appreciated.


Also, why is it that in a first world country like the USA, are businesses not required to pay enough to cover the cost of living in the area they're located? This seems totally wrong and I've found myself wanting to address it to employers but haven't because it obviously wouldn't change anything. I just feel like if someone is working full time at any job I feel like they should be able to afford at least the bare minimum necessities to live in the area they're employed. I'm not in LA or NYC or anything crazy, I'm literally in a small town 30 minutes outside Louisville KY, I don't understand how it can be this bad."

The hiring manager responded saying “Likewise, it has been a pleasure getting to know you.  Looks like HR will be reaching out tomorrow.  Thanks for your investment and patience in the process.”

Unsure if this is a neutral way of saying I didn’t get the job or if it means they can’t say anything until HR has officially sent out an email about the decision. 

Any insight is appreciated!"

Manager I report to has been pushing to hire me full time in the new year as the company is getting overloaded with client work. Largely it seems like projects that were oversold and there is an internal skills gap.

Today I learned one of the execs that scouted me was laid off. They were part of an acquisition about 18months ago. I also knew coming in that management turn over was high, including the CEO being replaced about a month ago.

I have two thoughts on this:

-“laid off” actually means conflicts higher up/restructuring. Employment length in non-exec roles seems to be fine (much of the design team seems to have stuck around over 2 years despite some of the disorganization).

-company is actually struggling and might not bother with me come the new year. Realize they bit off more than they could chew in scaling up and just hire subcontractors to plug the holes…noticed they are late on filling my November invoice.

Taking bets on which is more likely. Input?"

I work very closely with my boss and we have a great rapport, she’s also been extremely supportive and helpful. I know my departure will be frustrating and disruptive for her and the company but I got an offer I can’t refuse.  

A public job I interviewed for previously reached out to me recently and offered me the position, it pays significantly more and is a better fit for my interests, so I accepted. But the hiring process is extremely slow.  So I’ve just been pretending to be a team player with my boss who is always talking about the future and training me while I’m secretly fretting about when and how to break the news. 

Should I tell her now even though I may not start the other job for another month or just wait until I know it’s 2 weeks? What should I say? This whole situation gives me anxiety. 

I’ll add that we work so closely, the space is so small that there’s no privacy, even during lunch, that I’ve had a very hard time communicating with HR from the new job since they seem to be allergic to email. It seems like working together after I tell her I’m leaving will be intolerable."

They can't discriminate and fire me cuz I attend therapy, but they sure as hell can write me up for the dumbest things just to gather enough information to terminate me. 

I always get to work early and leave on time. I keep my head down. But lately some of my new coworkers have started coming over to my desk to talk about dumb shit for over 20-30 minutes- once even for an hour.

We're woefully understaffed (boo!) But we finally got a new girl last week (yay!), my issue is this new girl has next to no training in retail and I think I'm supposed to be training her and showing her the ropes? She hasn't been trained elsewhere prior so it's essentially up to me.

Being understaffed even WITH her there is a tricky situation, it's pulling me from the other 2 people's worth of a job that I'm doing to explain things and show her certain aspects of the job that she needs to know (it's a field where you need to know how certain things fit people and why). 
Should I be asking my boss for compensation for that? And if yes, how should I go about that without getting shut down on it? 

I've never had to ask for a raise before and I'm getting really stressed with everything I'm doing, getting an award retail rate doesn't match up to the work I'm doing.

For a long time my pride and the fact that I **know** that I'm telling the truth has kept me from applying again

But now, they are one of the highest paying options that I have left. I wrote All That to ask, how do you guys think I should respond if they ask about the situation in an interview? If the application asks about it, what should I type?

So I’m currently interning for a marketing agency and it’s coming to an end as the semester ends. I’ve enjoyed working for them and even asked to continue but pointed out that I wouldn’t be able to receive anymore school credit and asked if there was a possibility to shift to a paid internship


Well…the founder said that they are willing to keep me on as a paid intern to help out with blog writing and social media management etc. I am being offered compensation of 12 bucks an hour, but it was never really about the money for me. It was more about continuing with them and to keep learning and growing and building my resume

The issue I have come across tho…the agency is located on the east coast and I work remotely on the west coast. That compensation is under minimum wage where i live and I don’t really know the legality of all of this

Any advice for how to move forward? I feel weird now and don’t know how I’d even respond to the offer. I don’t want anyone, especially myself, to get in trouble for doing something wrong

Thanks"

This online coding bootcamp is interested in me for a part-time position as a virtual Mentor to students and they want references, one of which has to be from a manager I've worked under or currently work under. My previous company has a weird policy which prevents my previous manager from giving references, except for if the person is applying to grad school. I was thinking of asking my current manager to a be a reference, but I wonder if this is a bad move since there's always the chance that it might give the impression that I will get distracted and neglect my work at my full-time job. On the other hand, since I don't have a different manager to reach out too, I'll probably have to turn down this gig unless I ask my current manager.

This mentoring job seems to be flexible &amp; accommodating to my schedule, and I only plan to work a few hours a week in the evenings and maybe a little on the weekends, outside of my full-time job's core hours. I'll also be sure to only use my personal laptop for this gig when interacting with students.

I have been surviving off of savings, but it's almost all gone.  I have been applying like crazy and have been offered jobs at a total of 3 places, but get extreme anxiety and don't end up going.  The reason I am having anxiety is because I am having the hardest time comprehending information &amp; learning.  I have a horrible memory and when someone is talking to me, I only retain some of what they're saying.  I'm slow, I'm not efficient, not a critical thinker, can't problem solve, and do not thrive in a fast paced environment. I'm not trying to negative self talk, but I am dumb. Since high school the longest lasting job I had was at a vape shop, but quit after two years because my identity of being dumb was coming out and I could no longer hide it. 

I got a job as a takeout person at a restaurant but quit after 3 days because the girl training me was going too fast and there was so many things I had to learn, I couldn't keep up.  Then I got another job as a busser and just did 3 days of it.  I like it but my bosses are Asian and its even harder to understand them because their accents are so strong and I know they don't like me because I'm slow. 

I'm also starting a second job on Thursday at a dog boarding facility but I'm afraid its going to end like the other jobs where I just quit because I can't just keep hiding in the shadows and putting the work on my coworkers.  I want to work so badly and I want to comprehend and believe me I am actively listening to intructions and asking questions, I'm just not RETAINING it all. They throw so much information at you and expect you to remember it all and I just can't. I remember like 40% of it. 

I'm so self conscious and embarrassed because my mind is supposed to be sharp and bright, yet I am the dumbest person I know.  I don't want to be homeless, but that's where I'm headed. Oh and to make matters worse, I have a criminal record and a currently on probation for a deferred felony and misdemeanor.  I harassed and threatened a guy over text and social media over the course of 3 months and got charged with a deferred stalking charge and violation of a protection order.  So I also find it hard to explain the charge because it had to due with severe undiagnosed and untreated mental illness.  Since then I have gotten treatment, but am struggling with cognitive issues due to medications.  

I am wanting to stay at this bussing job and really want to work at the dog boarding place but I think I'm just going to end up quitting both jobs because of my inability to advocate for myself.  I also think I am undeserving of asking for help because I'm a criminal and deserve this hell. How do I tell employers about me being dumb/being a criminal? The sad part is I am really nice and have good customer service skills, I'm just stupid and can't think critically."

I apply for the internship i hit it off REALLY well with the HR guy and then even better with the interviewer. The interviewer said that they will either ask for another interview, send me an offer right away OR just decline me. They called me back a few days later and made an offer. tell me WHY and HOW they can offer me $14 an hour raised me $16 then $18 during the first negotiation with me? like that all really low right? this company is located in arcadia and Glassdoor says the average is $69,976. 

I told them basically that’s not fair pay at all and the HR dude said he’ll talk to the manager and come back to me. but just like HOW is this possible? they said that they still need to run a business and all that and they’ll raise me if they want to keep me at the end of the internship but if they’re acting like they can’t afford to pay me fairly as an intern how can i trust they’ll pay fair as a permanent?"

Even the most basic entry level positions require years of experience, a masters I do not have yet, or a crazy application window. I’m currently pursuing my masters degree in national Security studies but the time commitment leaves room for a full time job, one that I need to get a head start on my new student loans. Any advice on what else to look into? I’m really struggling and will take any advice."

1,2022-12-06,How should I tell another job i want to postpone onboarding? (to wait for another offer) + other questions,u/throwaway02132020,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ze0ajj/how_should_i_tell_another_job_i_want_to_postpone/,jobs,"sorry if this is a long read, there’s specific issues i have. I am expecting downvotes because how wishy washy or spineless I sound. Thank you to everyone in advance.

context:
(previously unemployed) After an interview at one place (Job 1), they were pretty quick to offer me the position which I accepted hastily because I have been looking for a job for a while and applied to many places with no success. However this position is 60-90 min away one-way. The background checks took a while, and i was hoping it would take longer, but they just told me my onboarding will be this coming monday. (a month ago they checked if i would be traveling and if that onboarding date range was ok and i approved.)
2 weeks ago, I had an interview with another place (Job 2), a more manageable 30-60 min away, and the admin lady and an hr person from this department called to let me know I am a top candidate and they want to hire me. I prefer working at Job 2 because of the shorter travel time, and as a new driver I am actually afraid to drive on those freeway routes and for such a long time and every day no less. Benefits seem to be about equal between the two.

I have been a wreck because of this situation. I have no idea what to do. I know it was an asshole move to even apply and accept Job 1 because they may have told the other candidates they were not selected, also time and resources wasted. I was advised to not tell Job 1 anything until I get Job 2 offer letter (also see background check issue next paragraph)

My concerns/questions:
Is there any way I can ask for an offer letter or confirmation from Job 2? I already asked the office admin when I can expect to hear the hiring decision, and she said she’s not sure but it should be faster than before due to them decentralizing the HR. She also said they’re happy to have me and not to go anywhere. Should i try asking HR? and even then I’m not 100% sure i’ll pass Job 2’s background check because my university’s program is still a new program working on accreditation, and this accreditation was a requirement on the job announcement.

What should I tell Job 1? at the onboarding on monday I’ll be signing up for insurance for me and my spouse. I would honestly hate to just work at Job 1 for a few weeks while I wait for Job 2 and then resign (will it show up on future background checks?).
I also don’t want to lie to them, because that won’t turn out well I think.

TL;DR: Accepted one job set to start next week and want to postpone it to wait for another job’s expected offer"

I’m expecting to graduate in the spring of 2023, and then I’ll be off into the real world again.

Right now, I have two nagging questions floating in my mind:

1) Is it too early to start applying for jobs? I’ve heard from folks who applied in the fall and were offered part-time positions that will lead up to full-time jobs once they graduate, but have also heard of most people getting their jobs just a little before graduation.

2) Do employers look at grad school transcripts?

I also have decided to switch my career from working in the interior, architecture and exhibit design field due to various reasons. I am relatively creative, good at 3D modeling / rendering and Adobe Creative Suite and want to try and shift into XR development (currently with Unity) to use my creative background in a new way - this will take a long time to get my foot in the door to earn a wage.

In the meanwhile, I am open to any position and any wage to simply sustain myself for the next bit so am open to any suggestions. I have enough savings to ride myself till September 2023 after which I’m not sure what I’ll do and will be in some what of a crisis mode. My hope is to secure a steady source of income much before that.

The one shift I work with the supervisor, they are pulling a double (16 hours). They often come late to work and leave early because of the many hours they work. Before,  I just ignored it because telling management about my supervisor seemed kind of excessive, especially since them leaving early was their own choice and not mine. However, we now have a punch in system that has replaced the paper time sheet. I don’t feel comfortable punching out for the supervisor because it is against company policy to do so and I really can’t lose this job if management catches wind of what is happening.

My job description sounds amazing, but the reality of the job (working evening hours, working most weekends, the fact that there I have very little responsibilities) makes me feel both bored and tired. My contract only lasts a year, I'm 4 months in.

A friend advised me to go to a job interview for a government job in admin, with better pay, much better hours, more responsibilities and a contract without an end date. I went to the first round of interviews, and got through. 

I did not tell my colleagues yet, but I did tell them that I'm not enjoying the job anymore. They informed my boss, who came to the office on his day off to talk to me. He was very kind and understanding, but I still want to quit.

What would you do? Can I leave my colleagues behind? They'll probably have to work even more when I'm gone, and I feel very guilty... on the other hand, the government job sounds like a dream to me."

I soon realized the company is a disorganized mess with a structural system that is designed to make its employees fail. You are consistently reliant on other people to get their work done to get your work done, and since it is a client facing job, my specific role takes the brunt of other people not doing their job and I end up getting in trouble with the clients. I hate it, and this is far from a dream for me now.

Anyways, I have been working my butt off, had a terrible mid year review and my mental health and physical health (I have to work a schedule that is not natural to my sleep cycles and I cannot get used to it) have deteriorated. I need this job for health insurance, otherwise I would have quit a long time ago. Despite thinking I worked hard to improve since my mid year, and thought it paid off, I have apparently made not a single improvement (there has been no continuous feedback since) and I am being put on a PIP. I need to get out of here, but I realized I don't want to work in this field anymore. I hate it, it is not what I thought it was, but it is very much my identity and a passion turned career.

I am on the job hunt so I can try and get out of here before I am fired, but I don't even know how to change my industry and career paths that fast. I am in a niche industry, so openings are few and far between anyways. I don't even know what I want to do, and since my confidence is shot and I feel worthless, I cannot imagine anyone would be willing to take a chance on me :(

Has anyone been able to pull something similar off? What are ways to sell yourself when you obviously have transferrable skills, but they are just specific to one industry? Any advice about situations like this would be so much appreciated. I am so tired, and between trying to survive a PIP and work extra hard to find a new job, I just want to run away from it all."

I actually have no idea how many jobs I've applied to, but it's probably in the 100 range. All I keep getting is rejection after rejection after rejection from employers telling me just how worthless I am. And whenever there is a company that says that they're interested in me and my skills, they just ghost me. And then a month after ghosting, they decide to show me the courtesy of sending me a rejection email telling me just how much I suck.

I got a degree in Computer Science 1.5 years ago and have been applying to Software Engineering jobs. I've started branching out to other roles such as project/application analyst and IT consultation and I still keep getting nothing. I am trying to aim for some entry level jobs but even these entry level jobs require years of experience. My mom paid someone $200 to spoof up my resume and its done nothing for me. In fact, I actually got more interviews and interest from employers with my ugly old resume before someone made it all ""nice and fancy"".

I've started responding to these rejection emails asking exactly why I was rejected and so far, only one has responded with the fact that I have no industry experience. They believe me when I say that I know the languages I listed, they just don't trust that I know how to use them. I honestly do think that's reasonable, but I just need someone to take a chance! I don't know what I'm doing wrong and I'm getting really close to just giving up and going back to retail. I'm tired of being unemployed and feeling so damn worthless."

Boss works from home. She came in the First two weeks I was here, but we didn’t interact much. I will text or email her notifying her of things or even asking questions and most times she doesn’t even respond. Its starting to feel pretty ridiculous, like wtf. I don’t know how Im doing, where I stand, and it doesn’t feel like she gives a shit if Im here or not.

Background: we work for a legal cannabis company with 5 locations. I know she is stressed because the communication between executives/the owner and the rest of us is pretty non-existent. Most people are hybrid and not here in the office. We all have to use our personal cell phones for calling vendors, scanner apps, etc. Yeah, they don’t even have a fucking printer with scanning capability here, I have to use an app on my phone. Its a shitshow.

The benefits are pretty good though. Kinda just needed to vent because it feels crappy but on the other hand no one really bothers me all day. I just dk how long I can stay here. I like living on the fringe and being individual/not super corporate, but I also have standards and desire a certain level of professionalism. Who knows, maybe she’s on her way out. On my first day she took it upon herself to tell me there’s nepotism here and that she feels like she got catfishes when she got hired herself. 

So I need to say something to her, right? What do I even say? Hey could you at least fucking act like you got my text/email? At the very least when I do go there’s no connection or loyalty being cultivated, so fuck them I guess."

Is the solution to keep applying and hope that by luck my resume will make it past screening and be seen? I’ve done the tailored resume thing but it’s had no success.

I am torn on what I should do, while the obvious answer seems to be take the offer, I know government jobs are stable, have great benefits and there is always the chance to move on to bigger jobs in government a few years down the line.

1,2022-12-06,Is my job going to close down? (UK),u/Russian_doll49,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zejcqc/is_my_job_going_to_close_down_uk/,jobs,"So last year I was made redundent from my old job, we’ll call it job A. In job A we slowly had less work to do and management would call random meetings to tell us how well the buisness was doing or not. I was made redundant after they announced closure just after October in 2021.

I started in job B in November the following month where I started working in a warehouse. From November to January we were so busy you could hardly move in the warehouse. 

Around a year of being there I've noticed several staff turn overs, many people on sick. The buisness has lost contracts with customers to the point we only had one.

However this year there isn't a lot of work. Last year, we would work a full nine to five shift and barely finish any of our work. This year, we've finished everything two hours from walking in, with no other work arriving.  It's dead at our busiest period. 

A meeting was held by upper management a week ago to tell us that the buisness had lost profits, but they'd gained potential contracts. Apparently, they opened another warehouse in the south of the country. They told us they couldn't pay us more due to the cost of living. However, my boss is walking around in designer clothes in a warehouse full of dust and oil. 

I tried to talk to my coworkers about the possibility of my workplace closing down because of the red flags that I saw in job A that I now see in job B. They told me, ""No, this place will never close down"", but that's  what they said at my old job. 

I'm not alone in my thoughts on this. Many other people are thinking the same way I am. Do you think it may close?"

It's my first job outside of school (currently still in school but working remote) and I've been working here for a year.  My day-to-day is working with SQL and company products to create processes for WMS.  In short, I have developed a decent understanding of SQL but SQL only.

In school, we primarily learned in Java and Python so I do have a blanket understanding of the two, however, I haven't worked with them in a while.

My question is: am I limited in my job search with my SQL background and if so, how limited?  

I had a professor at a school recommend looking at AWS jobs (specifically cloud architecture) as he said those jobs tend to be more transition-based (i.e. people don't start as cloud architects typically but use previous job experience to move into the field).

I don't necessarily have to code in SQL for my next job either.  I'm willing to learn new languages/jobs, however, my biggest concern is downgrading in position meaning taking a big pay hit.

What do ya'll think I could pursue in terms of career path if I wanted to get out of the WMS area?"

2,2022-12-06,Has LinkedIn been worth it for you?,u/thro0away12,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zelsr7/has_linkedin_been_worth_it_for_you/,jobs," I got LinkedIn a long time ago while I was a college student. I never filled out much related to work experience and schooling honestly because it felt a little weird to publicize so much information about myself online as well as that I was very unhappy in my career for some time and didn't even want to put it out there. Also, the cringe posts that are on there was very off-putting. So I basically just had a profile to lurk and occasionally reach out to people whose jobs I found cool and that's about it.

I have a lot of tech skills however and have found it hard to break into the jobs I want, so I figured LinkedIn may be an important tool in that respect. I filled out my profile piece by piece and wrote a little bit about myself (especially because I went through a career change and needed to explain that in the summary). I recently have done some projects that I have been sharing on Twitter for the past few months. On Twitter, I got 100+ likes, but on LinkedIn I only had 16 people like my posts. I used hashtags, wrote a bit about the project. I've wondered if LinkedIn is even worth it at the end after that? The posts that seem to get so much visibility are ones that seem (to me) mildly unprofessional oversharing (personal life stories, sharing wedding photos/childbirth photos) or people posting an essay with a selfie of themselves lol. I'd rather just not use LinkedIn and have companies evaluate me on my resume if that's the case, but would not having a LinkedIn be a limitation? I've seen some people be able to get jobs through LinkedIn so I was wondering what others' experience is like"

"" As a small business with less than 10 employees, we are not legally required to do the big-business standard ""15 min breaks/30 min lunch"" (ie: clocking out for lunch/breaks and clocking back in when you return), as it's often just not possible. Instead, you are paid through these periods and you eat or rest on the clock, as you're able or need.""

I work 11am to 7:30pm each work day, and I've been working through all breaks, including lunch. That means I'm always on call and need to be available to help the (very needy) customers who come through. This often means my food gets cold before I can finish it, or I'm not able to sit down at any point while eating. Many days I'm the only one in the store and nobody is available to take over for 10 to 30 mins if I need a break. It's not an empty, slow store. It gets pretty busy and I'm almost always standing all day.

I haven't been able to find anything online about small businesses with less than 10 employees being exempt from this break rule. Does anybody have info I could have missed about this?

I don't really know what to do. I like the job but certainly don't \*need\* it. If they're breaking laws, I think I need to do something about it. Otherwise it'll keep happening to others. 

If this IS legal and okay, someone please let me know! Thanks!"

It said I had 3 days to sign. I signed it at 3 days, but thought it was strange that nobody reached out to me to talk through the offer or negotiate with me (even though I know what the position/job is). 

My boss asked me a week later if I had received an offer (via phone call). I said I did and that was that. He explained to me there was some miscommunication about when the offer was going out and they weren’t told when it was sent (even though they verbally said they were going to hire me). Strange but whatever.

Basically I had no way to negotiate a higher salary. The salary at company A is not bad, but i deserve more. This is especially true after working a full-time, 6 month co-op while finishing my last course to graduate. I know how things how things work at company A and deserve a better offer.

Company A took a long time to offer me a position (with the economy kind of shaky) so I applied elsewhere just in case. I got an interview at company B, hit it out of the park and got a quick offer. I didn’t expect an offer from company B after interviewing with them so fast.

Then i’m offered a great job at company B. All the benefits and a salary fits my experience (better base salary, opportunity for paid overtime, sign on bonus, etc.). This is the offer I deserved from company A, but because HR and my boss botched giving me the offer together, my opportunity to get the salary I deserved from company A seems lost. 

Its a difference of 10-20k with OT, but the way it happened sits with me weird and I ended up with a lower than expected offer. Idk what to do, if I leave company A i’d be burning a bridge too then. I want a higher base pay from company A but dont know how to approach that.

I'm not new to this stuff, but I feel very anxious. I know MANY things could be happening (lots of work, leave/vacation, agenda issues...or just plainly no interest eventually) but the suspense is killing me.

I'm hoping to get another job to supplement my 2 current jobs in the hopes that it can help me afford her care... and keep us fed and housed. 

I'd love to hear if anyone has any tips for finding side jobs that are flexible and remote? My 2 jobs are remote and I'm already working 12+ hrs a day during the week 6a-6p so trying to find something that can just be done whenever, not necessarily at a certain time every day. 

Ideally, would be great to find something that could just become passive income but I can't be picky. :/

Has anyone found anything they've had success with that fits this bill? I know someone who found a pretty lucrative business helping salon owners book and schedule their appointments. She said it pays well and is only a few hours a week, but she's not looking to add anyone on at this time. 

If it helps, most of my experience is with social media: channel management, audience growth, data &amp; analytics, data entry, copywriting for social media, etc. 

I also do a lot of work with animals and have worked at humane societies, as a dog trainer/walker/sitter, etc.

Any suggestions are appreciated! TIA"

They let me know that they left the interview feeling very good, and they expected to deliver an offer to me the Friday before Thanksgiving. Friday came and went, so on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving I emailed the HR rep who said they got bogged down with other work and to certainly expect it after the break. It's been 2 weeks of radio silence since then and still no offer. I really want to work for this company, and they made it seem like they really wanted me to accept their offer, but it's making me anxious that I'm not hearing anything on their end.

Should I send another email? I don't want to risk coming off as annoying or pesky."

1,2022-12-06,"Is my job crap, or am I just unused to a working environment?",u/ClearlyClarity,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zer8e8/is_my_job_crap_or_am_i_just_unused_to_a_working/,jobs,"I’m currently working at a family accounting firm, started back in August, which was two months after I graduated with a Bachelors (major unrelated to accounting). It’s my first “real” full-time, M-F 40 hour workweek job, and I only got it because my parents are my boss’s clients and she’s told me she often trains her friends’ kids at her firm as a favor to them. I had zero experience in accounting and tax preparation before I took on this job, and, frankly, zero experience in a professional environment in general (outside of school). My resume consisted mainly of unpaid volunteer work or internships.  

All this is to show that I’m about as much of a fresh college graduate hatchling as one can be, so I’m looking for some advice on whether my job has some red flags and I should search for greener pastures — or if I’m simply inexperienced in a working environment and am paid exactly how I deserve for what I offer and should just get the fuck over myself and adapt.  

The facts: 

\- currently paid $18/hr with no benefits, started at minimum wage and got a raise three months in after a coworker got laid off 

\- less than 10 employees — 3, including myself, have all worked for less than a year. Staff accountants have worked for longer than a year, the longest 4 years, firm is 3 decades old 

\- I’m not actually sure what my job title is. Fresh hires usually just process payroll and bookkeep, some auditing, etc. so I guess I’d qualify as a tax associate? 

\- I’m the only one I know of with zero accounting experience period — everyone else had a degree and/or worked in tax filing in the past 

\- haven’t worked in tax season, but most days I work 8 hours while the higher ups usually stay an hour longer

Some things I consider red flags: 

\- the systems are pretty disorganized, or at least the electronic systems are. Chart of accounts has multiple duplicates, some companies use bank reconciliation and others we have to input manually into Excel, etc.  

\- basically no real training. After doing some research it seems pretty typical of this field, but I and other juniors have been lost and afraid to ask questions because my coworkers would just tell us to go figure it out ourselves through previous years’ work and they’re too busy, stop bothering them. Then, when a mistake inevitably happens, they get mad about it even when it’s not intuitive and we’d have no way of knowing about it beforehand. We’ve often had to just figure shit out on our own, which is also time-consuming AND gets us scolded at anyway - my boss frequently yells at a couple of work scapegoats — namely the juniors, such as my coworker who got laid off and another coworker whom everyone seems to blame whenever something goes wrong. (Everyone’s more lenient with me, possibly because they don’t want to lose my parents as clients lol) 

\- conversation at work is limited to a professional capacity only — it’s pretty much entirely quiet except when someone needs something from someone. There’s zero warmth or camaraderie despite the size of our staff. While I believe in keeping work and private lives separate, it… actually feels pretty shitty to spend most of your waking hours in a cold, clinical office environment surrounded by people who don’t give a shit about you, who only talk to you about an assignment they want done 

\- no benefits; I get taxes taken out of my paycheck but nothing like health insurance or sick days. I pretty much wasn’t ever told information about what job I was supposed to do, no contract or anything, was just sat down at the desk and told to do such and such, with only one lunch break allowed to break up otherwise sitting at a desk for 8 hours straight

I've pretty much disliked every minute I worked here since day 1: awful coworkers and boss, poor pay, nonexistent benefits, ass work. The only positive thing I can say is the very short commute, which can't really be attributed to the company itself. However, I also fully recognize that I'm lucky to have a job at all with the experience and skillset I've got, but I also want some advice from you all: should I consider a job search, or deal with what I have now for the moment?"

After I did my bachelors, I took a break for 5 years where I just pursued personal interests and travelling. I also wanted to switch to another career but didn't know what. Then after those 5 years, I studied again and got into IT. I am now ready for IT but I have no work experience.

Obviously this doesn't look good on my resume. I struggle to find jobs. I'm guessing whover is looking at my resume is doing the math and seeing these gaps as a huge red flag and immediately diregarding me.

One of my applications did get accepted for a back-end engineering role.........and the guy who accepted it did not see my resume (because I did not upload a resume). I just uploaded my cover letter and a link to one of my applications. Did not make it through all the rounds though.

So do you think I should hide my history when applying for jobs or is it pointless because they'll eventually find out?

Even in cases where someone does not see my resume, they can still find my linkedin profile and see my education history there and find out the time gaps. Should I deactivate my linkedin or is that pointless as well?"

Recently, I was terminated from my current company, and I found a job opening within the same company that I qualify for as I am searching for a new job.

During my brief tenure with this company, I was told that I was not meeting expectations. During my short tenure, I was not subjected to any disciplinary measures and all my projects met expectations and were delivered on time. Since we are considered ""at will"" employees, HR was unable to help since my manager did not violate any protected termination rights that would constitute discrimination on the basis of race, age, or gender.

Upon leaving, I was given the option of quitting in lieu of termination and received a severance package. HR also stated that details of my departure will not be included in the system, and the most it will mention is that I am rehirable.

If I'm selected to interview for these new positions, what should I tell the recruiter about my reasons for leaving?"

Throwaway account because too many people on my main. 

I am from India and have a natural science PhD from Germany (graduated earlier this year). Unfortunately, while living in Germany, my mental health deteriorated and I had a year of severe depression. I took a couple month break after finishing my degree and moved in with my parents (in India). 
I started working as a guest lecturer (I quite enjoy teaching) and my boss is soon going to be announcing permanent positions as Assistant Professor for which he has assured me that I have a very good chance. 
The no 1 problem I have with teaching is being stagnated and not being able to pursue research further. 

On the other hand, I just got an offer from a start up company in NYC, USA. They are offering a 6-month position for starters and then continue on the basis of performance. The position is not permanent and of course I’ve heard that unlike Europe, US companies have a knack for laying off people at a minute’s notice. But I know I’ll be doing some good research and it can be a jumping-off point for me to get into companies.

Just putting this out there, i have graduated from high school not long ago, and am feeling a bit lost at the moment with what to do with myself since there is no longer a need for me to focus my energy on studying (for now at least) and i’m used to having people around me but now i’m all alone at home with not much motivation and overall just feel there’s better things that i can be doing with my time rather than wasting it. so i went job hunting but with my lack of experience it was a bit hard to land a job, and so when i applied for the overnight shift at a local supermarket i wasn’t thinking too much about it so when i was accepted i was obviously excited. So i guess i kinda set myself up there, but regardless, i’m still happy that i have a job and something to do to keep me busy. 

anyways i’ll get to the point of this post, do you guys have any tips on how to work an overnight shift? and if there are things that i should keep an eye out for? as well as how to stay awake for the first few days while my body gets used to the change? 

Thanks :))"

With flu/Covid/RSV and everything  else going around I don't want to get sick. 

I 'm still masking when I leave the house. Meanwhile, my friends and relatives are getting sick. One friend just got over having the flu and pneumonia at the same time. Had an oxygen tank at home, it was bad.
I think I'm the only one at work still masking but I don't care. People don't seem to care about illnesses anymore and spreading them which I find concerning. 

Anyway, in virtually meetings everyone are all excited about various get togethers going on and all I do is cringe. I know the optics of not going but I don't think ppl should be expected to go.

How do I manage this situation? I've already been expected to go to the company x-mas party and feel I can't miss that. I've begged off a get together this week. Went to a luncheon last week. I feel like everything has been forgotten and getting ppl together in huge groups is the way to go again. Anyone else feel the same way and how do you deal with it?"

I haven't finished college and do not currently have any certifications (such as CompTIA A+) so they asked me to submit additional documents such as code I wrote during and after college as well as papers I wrote while in college.

Is it a discriminatory practice for them to ask me for those things if they aren't asking other candidates for that same information?

I already know that certifications are very important for IT but when I applied the person who referred me implied that it would be basic troubleshooting and setup and they would teach me anything else I might need while I worked on my certifications. When I went to do the interview, the people conducting it implied a whole different level of data and software management skills not listed in the responsibilities for the position.

TL;DR: Can they ask me for documents they aren't asking other applicants for? Can they disqualify me for not having skills that aren't required for scale of the listed responsibilities?"

I absolutely LOVE my work, my bosses, and everything about what I do. The only problem is that I make $14.50 an hour.

To me, it's fine. In the height of the season, I'll be bringing home a little over 1k every 2 weeks after taxes, slow time about 350 biweekly. Not a lot, but I live with my boyfriend, and we have no trouble paying bills regularly.

Even tho I get a yearly .50-1.00 raise, tips, and regular cash bonuses, my family is convinced my wasting my life. It's not like I haven't looked for extra work, it's just that 1) I don't have a car (I walk to work. It's not that big of a deal, because I consider it part of my daily workout) and 2) No where is willing to hire me at more than $12 an hour. After 7 interviews, and 40+ job applications, you think my family would get off my back, but they've only been drilling more into me that I'm not trying hard enough, and my job is a dead end place to be.

It's weighing on me and I need to know what other people think that are searching for jobs. Should I stay or should I go?"

It's a good job, 100% remote and pays well. I was really excited when I started. I got a lot of positive feedback at first. The person that hired me was promoted and now I have a new boss. In October she came to me and said that my performance wasn't what they expected and that I needed to improve. I started really pushing myself, taking classes, doing everything she asked ASAP. The real issue seems to be that they hired someone without the experience necessary to do this job. Without giving too much away they really should have hired a project manager instead of someone who was just a manager before. So in mid November she told me that I had improved but unless I really changed from a manager to a project manager in a month, I was fired. 
This has been the worst month of my life. Every decision, every email I agonize over wondering if it's good enough. I've set up some job interviews but my husband owns his own business and we're thinking I could just work for him and we'd find another way to get benefits. It would mean a pretty significant pay cut for us but I feel like I can't take this much longer. On the other hand, maybe they won't fire me? I'm torn about whether I should quit or wait and see what happens.

Edit: Since I am still technically in the ""Onboarding"" phase, apparently they don't need to put me on an official PIP.

UPDATE: They surprised me and pulled the trigger a week early. So problem solved (kinda). I have an interview tomorrow I can now focus on preparing for. I really appreciate everyone's input and advice. The internet can be a good place sometimes."

Does some of you have any experience in changing your career path in IT?

I'm specifically thinking of changing my career from mid level Information Systems Analyst to Junior Quality Assurance Tester,  Junior Automation QA Tester or Junior Quality Assurance Engineer.

My plan would be to take courses of automation testing in specific/legit coding school located in my country and then try to get  *ISTQB* certificate.

I'm a little bit scared to begin my career from new and start as entry level specialist. As per my current researches I would get about 30-40 percent less of what I earn now. Also, courses and certificate wouldn't guarantee that I would get a job in QA field.

Does anyone has similar experiences about changing career path? Does someone have any additional tips or suggestions before trying to change career path and leave a well paying job?"

Deliverables that I have been given at work - some have clear deadlines, some don’t. The deliverables that do have deadlines I always make it on time.

Every time I deliver, my boss is concerned why it took so long. I sit there like “wasn’t the due date x?” (Mind you I do deliver some thing early)

I also never really turn things in the “right” way as there’s always critical feedback given until the end of time (projects have been dropped because he keeps pushing them back)

He openly admitted that there needs to be “pressure” due to an organization restructure. I won’t be mad if I lost my job, but there are so many open roles in the company (including that my bosses boss resigned) so I’m not sure where the pressure comes from.

Now he’s not the most friendliest/best person to work with/talk to, and every time I get looped with someone else to work on a project with him they disappear lol.

What should I be aware of? Is this toxicity? Where are the motivations coming from?"

I'm not here to be roasted about it though, I'm just trying to make ends meet and I'm having far more trouble getting a day job than I anticipated.

&amp;#x200B;

So far I have retail and restaurant experience. Not ideal but at least I currently hold a job and have work experience in general, but this isn't enough? A lot of these positions mention ""HS diploma required, BS degree preferred"" so I should have an edge, right?

&amp;#x200B;

But in my last interview for a reception position, it seemed my degree actually ruined my chance of getting the job. They asked about my music degree, then they asked what my dream job would be, so I explained I wanted to be a film composer etc. They never reached out to me afterward. I think it gave them the impression that I didn't want to work with them, but what else am I supposed to say to their question? There's a record that I went to school for music, so of course everyone is gonna ask about it now. I have to be honest, don't I?

&amp;#x200B;

It's one thing to have difficulty landing a good film score position, it's another to be seemingly shunned by employers when it comes to basic office positions (not to mention the nightmare of everyone saying ""must have 3 to 5 years experience""). I understand the admin assistant position isn't an easy one, but it seems like my music degree is actually hurting my chances at getting jobs where a degree should be a benefit, **especially since nobody is asking for a degree in something specific like law, business, etc.**

What do I need to do to have a real chance at getting an admin job with no related experience? What should I say in interviews to boost my credibility regarding my history? ^((By the way, I'm a male going into what looks like a female dominated role... I wonder if that has anything to do with it.))

Today, she brought it up again! I’m the closest to the entrance door and we often deal with people who doing know where to go. After I helped someone find their way, she said “You’re in the hot seat since you have to deal with people being lost all the time…although you have the biggest office.” She brings it up randomly at times and it gets in my nerves.

Lateral move or wait for something better?,u/whopperdave,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zf9o4q/i_want_to_leave_my_easy_job_lateral_move_or_wait/,jobs,"I recently moved to a new state and started a new job that I don't like very much. I originally planned to stay for a year and get experience for my resume, but I'm feeling antsy and decided it wouldn't hurt to keep my options open. I think it's starting to sink in that this may be my ""last chance"" to apply while leaving off the new (3 months in) job on my resume. If I wait much longer, the gap will start to look too large, and I only have six months of prior relevant work experience.

My question is not so much  ""should I leave?"" but ""how picky can I afford to be?""

Pros of current job:
- Low stress, low expectations
- I'm off at 4:30 pm every day without exception
- I get 6 paid Jewish holidays off in addition to Federal holidays each year

Cons of current job:
- I only get five days of paid vacation time off each year for two years. I have to be employed by the company for at least six months before I can take any time off. Additionally, I cannot schedule my PTO around our paid holidays (time off is granted by seniority).
- The company is small and old-fashioned. All of the staff are boomers. My supervisor treats me like an hourly employee and I have to clock in and out. Leaving for lunch is strongly discouraged, and if I do I have to clock out and only have 30 minutes.
- Travel is required for a week at a time, about 4x per year. I'm a mom of a two-year-old so I'm not terribly fond of this.
- I am learning absolutely nothing and there are days I am required to be in the office for 8 hours with nothing to do. 
- My degree is in mechanical engineering, and current job is sales admin for an apparel distributor (slightly worried about being pigeonholed in a sales career)

So, I am trying to decide under what circumstances I should leave. Is an easy job worth holding onto until I can find something that offers a higher salary? Or should I solely focus on better growth opportunities and goal alignment and accept a job with equal or lower pay? For info, I am at the beginning of my career making 54k per year presently."

A) Do I chase after a very niche job that I absolutely loved? or 

B) Just do anything else

&amp;#x200B;

Let me elaborate. 

&amp;#x200B;

The most interesting thing to me that I've ever done in my career has been IT Asset Management and Disposition. It's a security-based function for things like internal data for companies and proprietary stuff. 

I used to work for a company that would send teams to various onsite data centers or corporate offices to audit, pack, and transport end-of-life IT assets. 

For example, we'd head to a financial institution's data center, scan and compare 1500 hard drives, secure 'em, and shred them onsite with our on-board shredder on a truck. Sometimes we'd go to a G-Mobile or Horizon Wireless corporate building, and pack up 200-500 PCs, tablets, laptops, monitors, etc. that are either obsolete or replaced by newer tech. We'd then either process them ourselves or send them downstream to separate the gold from the boards and piece things out to different resellers. We'd travel sometimes by truck, sometimes by air, and seeing new places and finding the odd brand new MacBook Air was cool. 

I liked the job because I did something new every day. The pay wasn't fantastic, but I wasn't management either. Later in my career, I realized that I'd LOVE to be involved in something like that, perhaps on an operations management level. The current issue here is, though there is undoubtedly a need for every tech company to have Asset Management (as I'm sure most do), it's quite a niche market. I feel like I may as well be a lizard counselor or wall watcher. 

I suppose this is part rant, part question. What are some lateral types of positions that someone with this experience can get into? And for a person who this experience covers a third of their overall CV, how can I *find* these kinds of positions? A lot of what I run into in ""Asset Management"" comes from financial institutions, and not exactly what I'm looking for. A lot of places I've been to have asset tags on their tech, so I know the systems are in place. I suppose I'm frustrated looking for my dream job and not finding it. I've tried LinkedIn, Indeed, and the usual suspects. 

Sometimes I wish there was like, a career genie, who could look at me and tell me exactly where I'm supposed to be so I can just start applying there and not wasting anymore of my life. 

Thanks for readin'."

3,2022-12-07,Looking for some advice...,u/Zealousideal_Ad3860,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zfb3is/looking_for_some_advice/,jobs,"Hello all,

I am in a bit of a situation and was looking for some advice. I was considering fudging some information on my resume. Not about my experience,  but changing dates and omitting some jobs. Back story follows...

I have not been employed in almost 3 years. I have been telling people that I am self employed which technically I am but most of what I do is questionable legally so can't include that.

The job before that I decided just not to go back one day because my boss was disrespectful and rude. At the time they were taking payments from my check for a purchase I made from them which I never finished paying for. So not only did I leave without notice but I also technically stole from them. I was there for a year but can't include that. 

For reference I purchased a vehicle for $3800. I paid $2400 and owed $1400. Purchase price was never in writing and no lean on the title and we lied about the amount for the sales tax purposes, bosses idea on amount. When he came asking about it I basically said prove it and sue me. Worked out for me but I did a little more than burn that bridge.

Before that I was fired for reporting hours not worked. Not on purpose. I didn't like the job so I was late most of time. Never more than 5 minutes. Instead of punching in I just entered the time I was supposed to be there. Managers watched me do it without saying a word. When they asked me I admitted it because I wasn't concerned about keeping the job. I was there for almost a year but can't include that.

Before that my resume was already three pages long so at best I look like a job hopper which most employers don't want who hasn't worked in five years if I omit the last two jobs I had. 

I hate working for other people but my mom passed away last month and left me with a boat load of debt. She retired six days before she died which ended her life insurance from her work and she purchased another policy but hadn't paid on it yet. I was banking on that to get me by until I could make some investments so I didn't have to work.

I do have a business degree and worked as an office administrator and payroll administrator for years. I only lasted there because I was offered flex schedule and could come and go as I pleased. That company went out of business and I was laid off. Trucking industry took a hit under Trump and our business disappeared.

So if I am honest, I haven't worked in three years, walked out of the job prior, was fired from the one prior to that and probably have 10 or so jobs prior to that I quit with some or full notice.

If I omit the last 5 years then I have to to explain why I haven't worked in 5 years. Or I omit the last 5 years fudge the dates from the other jobs which a lot of the companies are closed now so no way to verify and any that aren't I just say they can't contact.

I feel like my chances of getting anything are slim to none. Any advice for someone like me?

Sidenote the job I just didn't go back to was at a gas station.  I refuse to work at another station or any type of retail job. Hate them. Would rather lose everything then go back to that type of work. I am a 31 year old male just for reference. Also Grub Hub and Door Dash turned me down because of a speeding ticket in 2019.

Please no judgement. I realize I dug a hole. If burning bridges was a career I would be set for life."

Should I reconsider my plan to leave my current employer on bad terms? I'll try to keep this short but informational. 

Shortly after I started my role as a program manager here, my boss was pulled into some large l, off the rails critical project that took up her whole time. The decision was made for her direct reports to roll up to her superior, the VP of operations and infrastructure. 

Over the 9 months I've worked here, I've been informed of two issues. One was a misunderstanding with the VP on a direction to start a project. I took it on the shoulder, did my time with no WFH. Chalked it up as an opportunity for me to improve on communications with that level of leadership. The second one though, was an issue with target completion dates in a quarterly meeting with our CIO. I was berated by my VP on how I could possibly overlook this. He took away my WFH for at least 2 months so I could be mentored in person by my sr PMs. 

The problem? The Sr PMs are the ones I followed lead on for target dates. Literally every person on our team had them listed this way. And I confirmed that I was the only one he even mentioned it to. He never talked to the sr PMs about mentoring like he said he would. He hasn't met with me for our weekly 1:1 for over a month (I've had vacation/illness for a couple during this time too).  No communication. Just me driving to office every day. 

After our last meeting in late October, I decided to hear out a company that had been reaching out to me, and I know the workers there. I left those interviews very excited, and am supposed to get an offer letter Friday/next Monday. 

Then today I found out that the big project I've been slated for, and just waiting on contracts to be signed for months, is going to another member of the team. There could be justifiable reasons for this - it's a big project and might need a Sr PM. But it wasn't discussed with me at all by the project team or the VP. I found out from the PM, and then heard that there's Kickoff calls happening within the next week. I consider this a sign they are gearing up to fire me. 

Even though I'm leaving the company anyways, I'm angry. If I was still trying to make it here, I'd be utterly defeated and in my mind disrespected. What I'm thinking is that I'm going to leave my badge and laptop in my drawers when I leave tomorrow (I have pto Friday and monday). If I get my offer letter while I'm out, I'll just go ahead and resign with no notice..burn the bridge and say fuck it.  If something happens and I don't get the offer, I can go in office, get a temp badge because I ""forgot"" mine, and continue like nothing happened until I get out/get fired."

ive done a lot for the company and have made a doc of all these accomplishments that i plan to discuss when i bring up a raise. my manager already told me he rated my performance as “exceeds expectations” which is the second highest level rating you can give. 

apparently, since my job is remote (i still live in New York), location will not be taken into consideration when talking about a raise which i find extremely unfair. 

they also had a team restructuring a couple of months ago where they changed our job titles so instead of seo analyst, i was changed to seo associate. i know bringing up market value is important when discussing a raise but when i was looked up at average salary for an seo associate, it was significantly lower than an seo analyst. this is extremely frustrating because i am doing a lot more work than when i was an seo analyst. we have also had extreme turnover rate the last year so in result, the current employees have had to take over a lot more work/overwhelmed. 

best case scenario, i would like to jump from 65k to 72-75k (i know this is asking for a lot) but i truly believe the work I’ve done at this company reflects this. if not, i would like to get at least 70k. how do i make my case stronger? 

i also plan to talk about inflation rates/cost of living."

I was in the military and left because I couldn't stand the isolation, which made me depressed to the point where I puked every day during my service; I left about 4 months ago. Because I quit, I decided to take a gap year and participate in volunteer programs all over the world, but first I took a month off, participated in some programs but I didn't feel that spark of joy that I expected to have and so I began to learn programming, specifically front-end development.

Time passed and I have learned the basics of front end development, html and css and wordpress. And so I somehow managed to land a coder's dream job, well its actually a one month intern and then begin with a contract since I have no previous work experience. However, it's really a dream job; you have flexible schedule of your choosing: 9-5:30, 10-6:30 and 11-7:30, all you need is to have 7.30 hours of effective daily work, it's a friendly environment where everyone is like a family, an empathic boss who actually cares for his staff but needs to be tough since he doesn't want his workers to be spoiled and neglect work, you have a pool table to play anytime you want, a chill room with a ps4 and a 55 inch screen TV if you want to play in, you decide when to have your 1 hour break and also a free gym membership and a 25% off a nearby restaurant. 

Ps. A cousin of mine whom I didn't know about happens to work there as well as my best friend who I grew up with works there. Since today was my first day at work I had to be under my best friends command and no, none of them intervened in having me work there, I wanted to be there myself. 

However, I go to work today and start to feel the exact same sickness that I had in the military, I felt like vomiting in the morning, and I kept being doubtful and asking myself ""wtf am I doing here? I don't want to work for anyone and I want to be financially independent, I can start trading and eventually become financially independent."" 

I feel like I don't fit in there, basically everyone does their job, my team is very supportive even though I'm nowhere near their level and I don't have any pressure whatsoever, at least for now, everyone is just okay. However, after lunch I started settling and feeling like I could do this but, the moment I went home for some reason I just hated the idea of having to work and I felt sick of it. I just don't want to work but I know that it's better than staying home all day and doing nothing and if leave my family will be all over my head. 

It's interesting to think that I managed to get a job that will help me advance in career and that pays decently, while someone has to do 3-4 years of college to be where I am now and I don't go to college. 

The problem with me is that I don't care what people think, I live my life how I see fit, but I feel like not caring at all will make me lost at some point in my life. I feel like I'm a little spoiled since I haven't had a real job before and I want to ask you guys what do you think about it?

I'm 18 btw and I'm very serious about this. 

Thanks in advance."

7 months ago I landed a good job at a bank and moved to a new city for work. It's been a pretty difficult few months of learning but I finally feel like I am getting the grasp of things and I have been getting some great feedback from my hiring manager.

The situation is as follows, my team is a small team of four people and we manage and investment portfolio. It is demanding work and even with the four people and we are often non stop during our work hours.

This week my manager (who i a director level position) announced that as of January he will be leaving the bank to move to another one. Likewise, my other senior coworker announced he was taking a leave for family reasons and said that he is unlikely to return anytime soon or ever for that matter.

I'm 7 months in and this is my first time working in this field and I feel like everything is collapsing. These people are my mentors, and they are really wonderful coworkers who I have no problem even calling friends.

I simply feel lost without them. Even if I was a super experienced in business and financial management, this would still be a behemoth task for me to manage this workload. It simply is not even realistic to even consider this plausible.

I'm really concerned. I was thinking about voicing my concerns to the senior directors. But the only issue is that my director hasn't told them yet either that he is leaving so I'm still stuck.

Does anyone have any advice. I'm feeling a lot of anxiety and worry."

I recently received a very exciting job offer and just started the background / reference checks. My current role’s notice period is technically 3 months but HR said it could be reduced to 1 month pending my manager’s approval. My offer for this new role was made on the basis that the period would be reduced and they are not flexible on this.

Given that I would want to give as much notice as possible to my manager / am afraid of getting blocked for the new role - when do you think the best time is to hand in my notice (given background checks are not completed and nothing has been signed)? And how would you approach this conversation with my manager?

I’m afraid of getting dragged into long-term projects in the meantime + I really do appreciate my team and don’t want them to feel like I do not respect them.

Any advice appreciated - thanks!

I thought everything was great with the rate they supplied me with. However, just before starting I was just curious about the parking situation at the campus and asked. I was informed that they will not be providing parking on site and I would have to find other means to park/get to the office. I thought this wasn't fair and yes I understand I'm not getting the same FTE's benefits however its parking its not PTO lol. I went straight back to the recruiter and requested the rate to be increased with this being a weekly out of pocket expense thats going to add up. I thought this was fairly justifiable given having to be at the office and the recruiter leaving this detail out. I'm not trying to be difficult but with expenses eating into my rate that is not fair when I have to pay out of pocket for something as simple as a parking spot. Would you have done the same thing or am I being hard? "

I am 23 and relatively new to the corporate world. I got my first big girl job last year but it was hourly and since then I got a new job in which I’m salary now. 

I’ve been at this job for a few months now and when I interviewed I remember asking how often employees stayed after “normal work hours” or worked on the weekends. Manager assured me that staying after works was crazy and rarely ever happened unless customer demands were urgent “which they hardly are”. 

Now that Ive been on the job, there’s always “urgent customer demands”. My particular role in the company happens to be the last part in the process. So there’s a billion people that need to complete their parts before handing the work off to me. I’m pretty much the last person needed to complete the puzzle and then our work gets submitted. Problem with this is, that because i’m at the end of the food chain, others before me typically take their time and then rush me to complete my work to meet deadlines often leaving me to work after hours. I’ve mentioned this to my manager and asked if there’s any way we can hold other before me accountable to ensure i have a reasonable amount of time to finish my work during normal business hours and not at 11pm and he just replied “ you can try to rush the ones before you but that’s not going to change anything. this just comes with the job” 

At first i didn’t really mind and instead i was grateful that I’ve secured a legit job after graduating but now i’m beginning to dread it. 90% of the time, Im working til 11pm, i’ve stayed past 1AM at times to meet customer demands. An example of this will be : person before me gets their work in to me at 5:30 pm (which is when i log off) and they expect it done and in their inbox next morning which means i have to work the evenings to get it done. if this was a rare occurrence, i feel i wouldn’t mind however this is happening pretty much all the time and i’m now left with no life. i don’t even have time to meal prep for the next day. is this normal in salaried jobs??? 

i’ll admit sometimes there’s nothing to do during the day until i get work at 5pm but i feel that, that’s not my problem if the people before me didn’t work fast enough to get me stuff during normal business hours. in that case, i should get the day off and be hired for the evening no? lol. jk but yeah i don’t know. id like advice since i’m so new to the corporate world. 

thanks!"

So far ive been told that they worry I may not last at thr positions ive applied for because im over qualified. Then when I applied for positions I am qualified for they went with some one with less experience because it was an internal application. I did get one job that did not work out due to saftey life issues, had to quit that as well. Franklin I regret quitting my job I had with a company for 6 years. Theres no going back now.

I just got a job offer for a large company with potentially more growth opportunities but with a bit more money. The new job will take more time and perhour would probably be worse off for me. I just went to hand in my resignation at my current role for the new job but they quite desperately said if we can get you to stay what would it look like, we walked down that conversation and now my boss is speaking to HR. 

Old job: know everyone and everything, easy to do, takes less than my obligated hours to complete work and compensation is quite good. Low local growth opportunities.

New job: but more money but way more overtime expected. More growth opportunities. Have a holiday booked in the next 6 months that I'm not sure they are happy about. 

If you were in my position, what would it take to keep you around? What would you do? Any general advice"

Boss has been pushing me upward and got me promoted but I don't feel qualified (actually, I don't even have the right degree). I work in a very technical job and honestly, I feel like my immediate coworkers don't trust me to do important/hard technical work. They give me low hanging fruit tasks (aka ""clean up/do this according my exact instructions"") while the other much more experience engineers do the very technical and much tougher work. I strongly feel that I don't deserve this because I don't have the right technical background to do the more important tasks and meet his expectations (his expectations are high). I honestly don't know what to do at this point...

 I'm literally getting pushed up but I don't actually deserve it."

2,2022-12-08,Didn't negotiate after a 3.5% raise in this crazy inflation,u/SteveJobsIdiotCousin,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zft7b4/didnt_negotiate_after_a_35_raise_in_this_crazy/,jobs,"I'm a software engineer and I unexpectedly got my annual review/raise during my manager 1 on 1 today. It came out to about 3.5% increase. So essentially with all this inflation, I'm taking a pay cut. I'm usually good at negotiating but this caught me completely off guard and I sheepishly/stunned thanked my manager and left the meeting. In reality I should have said something. If you were me, would you message him after the fact with your concerns? Or should I just be happy with 3.5%? I know a lot of other companies right now who are firing rather than giving *any* COL wage increases. Of note is that I'm currently being paid well, solidly above market rate, incredible benefits, flexibility, ideal tech stack, and I've only been at this company for 3/4 of a year. Also got a small RSU refresher along w/ the 'raise', but that's standard stuff for my contract and vests over years so it's basically imaginary $$ right now. And damn, my rent is about to increase $400-$600/month in a few months for the same place, I'd guess.

I'm thinking about pinging him the following message tomorrow. Any suggestions or advice?

*Hey xxx, the annual review yesterday caught me a bit off guard. I appreciate the merit increase of 3.5% but am disappointed in the number. Is there any wiggle room to get me closer to 5%?*"

I live in a country where public schools range from converted shipping containers, to technology hubs, and have widely differing types of management depending on the school. 

I teach at one that is closer to the technology hub end of the scale. 

As with most jobs, those in management are always the brunt of people's complaints. Everyone always has an opinion on how they could run things better, and honestly, it's no different in our school. The Principal and her two deputies face a lot of criticism from the staff. Generally, our staff body is pretty negative about the school in general and complain about EVERYTHING. Things like how money got spent on fixing the school bathrooms, or that all teachers had to help out when our school hosted a HUGE sports tournament. 

There are things that could improve, but that could be said of any job where people work together. 

This last week especially I have been absolutely blown away by the things our management have done for us. Paid for our staff year-end party, including a bus to get us there. Organised a really helpful workshop on best practices for setting tests and exams (which everyone poo-pooed afterwards as a waste of time because they all just like to take an old test and switch the questions around and call it a day). Today, we had another brilliant workshop on how to use the e-learning platform, and why we can't still be teaching the same way we did 30 years ago. They want us to be the best teachers we can be, and are offering us the tools to get there. I feel so empowered and excited to be a teacher, and I'm looking forward to using the skills I have been provided. 

(In case you are wondering where the students are - it's the end of the school year here, and so the kids stop coming to school after exams have been completed). 

Besides these activities, the Principal and her deputies, as well as my HOD (I guess like a line manager?), have helped me out a lot as I navigate my career as a newbie. My Principal came to my aid one day when my classroom got way out of my control. She didn't scold me or berate me for what happened, but encouraged me to look for alternate methods of working with that class. The Academic Vice principal has been amazing, and always answered my questions, and helped me when the other teachers in my department left me to fend for myself (they don't believe in doing anything to help anyone else, and get huffy when I ask for help). The Discipline Vice principal has also been a great help, and supported me when I had a kid lose his mind over a discipline issue. My HOD has also been helpful when it comes to navigating life as a teacher (and it helps she is in the classroom next door). 

I am so grateful for them. I want to write a card and maybe offer them a chocolate as a small thanks for what they are doing. However, I'm worried this will come across as ""brown nosing"". I plan to approach each person privately and offer them my token of thanks, I don't want to make it public. 

Should I do it? Any suggestions from those who have more experience working with others?"

I interviewed for a pretty big consulting firm through a connection with a senior partner a couple of months ago, which led to two further interviews (both in-person) and a written test. In sum, I met 8 of the team intentionally. All the feedback I received was great: high scores on the written test and interviewer comments that were all very positive. All those stages happened fairly quickly, and communication was efficient. I always knew this would be a role starting early in the new year.

I last had a phone interview with HR 17 days ago, where I was asked about salary expectations, possible starting availability (I said early January), and time to leave my current role. They told me I should hear back on final decisions pretty soon, likely end of the week. Great, I thought. After 9 days without word, I reached out to HR for updates, who responded quickly and apologised for the delay because that particular manager (who I had dealt with since the beginning) was leaving, and CC'ed in the new manager. I responded, thanking them and offering to provide anything else needed. 8 days later, no response. 

I get it's a busy time, and I have been applying for other roles, but this is my first choice. Over three weeks out since the last formal interview I've had no decision, and I'm struggling to plan my post-holiday arrangements without knowing if I'll start a new job on the timeline I originally suggested. 

At this point, what's the best course of action? Do I reach out to the senior partner who first brought me in (and I was told would make final decisions)? Reach out to the new HR again? Or just sit on my hands a little longer? Thank you for your thoughts!"

The company sent the weekday server to another facility for the weekend. The weekday cook is covering for her (this cook is working multiple doubles and Saturday and Sunday would be her only days off). The weekend server has been sick (but still coming in). The other cooks aren't trained as servers.

My manager told me if I can't find someone to cover my shift I have to come in and don't try calling off because she is NOT coming in for me.

What would you do? Help!

Sorry...that was so long lol

UPDATE: Walked into a neighboring facility and got a new job. It's an overnight shift, but with differentials I'll end up making more. My old job can suck a fart out of my ass fr"

I teach at an alternative school for troubled kids, I had no issues with administration that were communicated to me. I'm at a loss, and I feel really disappointed. This is the first real job I've ever had. Principal just walked in a bit before class and told me to pack my things. I will have to come back tomorrow to get my other stuff. I made a post in Google classroom saying goodbye to the students, it said the following:

""Hey kids, I have some unfortunate news. My employment at the school is over, I feel each of you is owed a goodbye. I sincerely enjoyed working with all of you, our class projects and activities are something that I hope you learned something from. If any of you took away some real world skills from the carpentry, chemistry, cooking, and mechanics we did, then I hope you take those skills and use them in a way to better yourselves and those around you. As I’ve come to know each of you and hear your stories, I have also come to know some of the troubles facing a segment of our population that often goes unheard. Many of you face circumstances and situations that I myself would not be able to face; the strength and resilience many of you show is inspiring. If I was placed in many of your shoes at your age, I wouldn’t be able to do what you’re doing. I wouldn’t be in school, I wouldn’t be trying in class, I wouldn’t be navigating the difficulties of a confusing world made even harder by what many of you are going through. All of you should be enormously proud of yourselves for being able to keep going in spite of factors out of your control that stand in the way.

 I know you guys are getting the short end of the stick with different staff trying to provide you an education, and not having a consistent teacher, but just continue to try and do your best. You all have the potential to go on and graduate if you apply yourself and keep pushing hard. Each of us walks different paths in life, and even if folks are all trying to reach the same destination, often those paths are wildly different. For many of you, the path you take will be much longer and more difficult than others. You may have to worry about and deal with things other students simply do not, this is through no fault of your own, but rather where the world and circumstance has placed you. Keep walking along that path, keep pushing towards a goal you have on the horizon, the road may be hard, and you might feel like you’re lost along the way, but just trust yourselves and keep working hard.


It was a pleasure working with you all.""


The kids commented all saying they loved me as a teacher and they will miss me. I'm having a hard time not crying, I feel like I let all these kids down. I mentioned carpentry and stuff, I taught math and science and was applying everything I could to real world skills while still getting through curriculum. In geometry we did stuff with carpentry for trigonomic relations and pathagorian theorem, in algebra we adjusted the timing chain to a generator to see how the voltage changes and then related it all to a function we could graph out, etc etc. I just feel like shit right now"

1,2022-12-08,Endless Interviews - Need advice,u/Mau4_20,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zg4794/endless_interviews_need_advice/,jobs,"Hello, 

I've been in the process of finding a new job. Currently I've been with the same company for almost 7 years, have been promoted multiple times, and am im a very comfortable situation but have been looking to start my next chapter somewhere new. 

Back in May I was contacted by this company's HR director about an Account manager position. We set up an interview and everything went great. A few weeks went by and she had informed me there was restructuring at the executive level and they hired a new VP of sales and account management so they were holding off on hiring for the position. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was then contacted last month by her letting me know they opening the position up again and wanted to schedule a interview for me with the HR hiring manager. I met with her, everything was great and she scheduled me an interview with the VP of sales and account management, everything again went well and she scheduled me a meeting with the director that I would be reporting to.

This is where things went awry. Firstly she was having some tech issues and she would regularly freeze on our zoom call. At one point she had asked if I had time to look at their website and asked for my explanation on what service they provide. I was maybe only 10 seconds into my answer when she interrupted me and went on to finish what I was saying. In my previous interviews everyone I spoke with said how collaboration was a huge core for them and this interaction did not reflect that at all. 

The whole interview just left me with a really bad vibe and very discouraged. Now I got an email this morning from her asking me to create a presentation on my findings of a particular subject. I'm very skeptical of sharing my IP with someone who hasn't hired me. I'm already working a full time job and am behind because I've been taking time off to meet with this company. I feel after 4 interviews its time to shit or get off the pot. I don't know if this is common practice at this company or if they're trying to test my skills but I feel like if they are really interested in me they are just going to need to take the chance on me just like I would be taking the chance on them in leaving my nice stable job that actually pays significantly more than this position. 

I haven't responded to their emails yet and don't know what to say so any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!"

The article recommended it's own foundational certification in GDPR, and then a follow up certification, costing £595 and £2,395 respectively. While I could afford this, and they are well reviewed, it is a lot of money. Are there better/worse courses around? Is it unrealistic to assume I could get a job with these certifications without any prior office or administrative experience?

It was tough, but ultimately I started applying before the lay off so it wasn’t the end of the world. 

After a month and a half, I got a job! It paid a bit more than the last, was at a private college and looked really good at first. Only hangup, it was a two hour commute one way. Brutal. 

Then within a week I realized this was one of the most toxic workplaces I’ve ever seen. Their business practices were so unethical there’s an entire documentary made about them ripping people off. Employees openly discuss hoping their coworkers get fired. 

One of the lead HR people talked about how she has a physical book she calls her “shitlist” of people she just doesn’t like, then she finds ways she could get them fired and works on doing it. I was actively bullied and called an idiot by my manager. My manager went on “personal leave” after 3 weeks of me being there and they begged me to stick it out. I was told I would take on her duties, plus mine, no change in pay or title and they’ll see after a while if I actually need any help. The entire marketing department was me now, and I did not sign up for that or feel qualified for that. 

I dreamt every day of my bus crashing on the way to work. If it crashed and I die, my mind said at least I wouldn’t have to be there another day. Obviously my mental health was shot and I needed out. 

A different workplace that was close to home, paid better and was in the industry I actually wanted to get in wanted to interview me. I called in sick, did the interview and waited. They wanted a second interview the same week I was told about my changing duties and structure. I talked to my partner and we agreed she would be comfortable covering us for a bit as long as I got out of that school and took care of myself. So I quit. 

The second interview was great, they checked my references a few days later and sent my offer yesterday. This is my dream job and I got it. 

I still recommend waiting to quit until something else is lined up, but I bet on myself and it paid off. Some situations are simply not worth sticking out especially if your mental health is at risk because of the workplace."

Uh, I’d kinda like all of it?

Honestly, this company is super disorganized and after only a month Im already over it. Probably should reach out more about the pay issue but the lack of communication and structure is enough of a red flag. Turnover is very high and getting a vibe my contract is going to be terminated January due to how hands off others on my team have been with me. Will raise the pay issue with…someone in HR, but in the meantime going to start the job search process again and ignore any actual work assigned. Bit pissed and embarrassed as I turned down another offer at a much more stable company, albeit much lower pay.

Never had this problem before. Any advice moving forward?"
1,2022-12-08,Job or More Schooling?,u/AlfredBorden99,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zg7ts6/job_or_more_schooling/,jobs,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a Spring 2022 graduate with a marketing major and since the completion of college I have been kind of lost with what to do about my future. I was aggressively applying to jobs this summer and fall and while I got interviews and made it to the final round of some jobs nothing has worked out on that front. I recently got rejected from a job I really wanted that I made the final round of and I kind of viewed that as the inflection point to try something else if I didnt get it. To add extra context my parents are wanting me to move out in about two months and I currently have a temp clerical job at a university in my hometown. For reference, my town is medium-sized so not a ton of job opportunities in my chosen field. Since I'm going to have to commit to somewhere soon anyway, and as of yesterday I dont have any big leads for a job, I was wondering what I should do now

&amp;#x200B;

My current thoughts are that I should pursue work in my hometown for about a year or so, probably the permanent version of my current job (even though it isnt that related to my major and wont be particularly high paying), and then aim for either law, which I have had interest for a while but tabled due to other factors, or an MBA, probably in business analytics since I have been wanting that to be my concentration. I wanted to do something in market research and that was the field I just missed out in but quite frankly I dont have a ton of experience in it, in part because I didnt know I wanted to do it until near the end of college so getting an MBA might allow me to get more of a concentration in that. I have just been feeling really lost the past few months and would like to hear your thoughts"

I was told that she just assumed I wasn't coming back when I left, and that she just fired me the day I left. I had multiple conversations weeks out letting her know of my military leave and I also gave her 100% of the documentation. The best thing HR told me to do was submit another application for the job, but every application now gets denied. I am really unsure as to what I can do and I am having difficulty finding another job. I tried to go into the messages to get my proof of my military leave, but they already shut down my Microsoft teams email.

It's been fine. I don't love it but it's not the worst job I've ever worked either.

Last week, a place I interviewed with back in MARCH contacted me for a potential job opening. It didn't work out in March because they ended up not bringing the client they were hiring for on board, hence why I continued my search. I've done three interviews so far, and I just got made an offer.

**Current gig:**

* $68K - underpaid for what I do
* Fully remote with limited travel
* Numerous benefits but they aren't quality ones - for example, my health insurance is fully paid but no one accepts it in my town. Submitting claims after the fact has to be done by MAIL. It's frustrating.
* I've had very little training, and the NPO is incredibly disorganized. I want to pull my hair out trying to get things done because there's no role clarity or ownership over certain tasks, so I spend a lot of time asking people who to contact for something. After six months, I STILL don't know processes for certain things.
* My work is spread across multiple clients, so with a recession looming this gives me some job security since they would need someone to help with all three.
* I love two of my clients, but one drives me nuts.
* My boss is great, but she never checks in or has time to meet because she's so busy. She acknowledges this but makes no attempt to improve it. I'm literally just winging it.
* Most of my colleagues are really nice and willing to help.
* She has long-term advancement plans for me which sound great, but you know how that goes.
* I'd be leaving them in a real lurch - they've had turnover (probably for the aforementioned reasons). My predecessor also left after six months, so this will really suck for the department, although that's not my problem.

**New gig:**

* $85K - more in line with what I should be making, although still just a hair under some of my peers.
* Hybrid, with one day in the office each week. I live about 15-20 minutes from the office.
* I would argue better benefits coverage. I have to pay part of my health insurance but it's accepted by all my providers.
* This seems like a more structured environment, although it's working with one client and I'd be the sole team member, so I'd be responsible for everything getting done for them. This isn't unlike what I do now, but it's spread across three clients instead of one. The industry, however, seems stable.
* Everyone says the client is really laid back.
* I have friends that work here with different clients and they all seem to like it.
* I don't know how much shared learning among team members there is - I might be on an island figuring it out alone.
* There's no upward mobility here - I'd essentially be the chief staff officer.
* There's an inherent risk to leave for something new!

So it's leave a comfortable enough job for more money and a gamble. What would you do, given these factors?"

I’m an employee at a fully remote global company with teams in the US, UK, and Europe. Somewhere down the line, I would love to relocate to the UK or Europe and work for the same company, just on a different team. I have US citizenship but not EU or UK citizenship.

I’d like to eventually propose this to my employer, but I know this can obviously be burdensome for the company to sponsor my work visa and deal with taxes. I was wondering if I could get advice from anyone who has done this or knows more about this because I can’t find much online about exactly what the company would have to do and how it would cost them. If this information helps it’s a company under 100 employees and I’d consider myself a ‘highly skilled worker’.

Basically I just want to know if my dream of living in Europe for a few years is possible or if this would be too much of an ask from my employer. Also if my salary would stay the same or reduce because of the costs of the move? I’ve also considered a digital nomad visa but I don’t know much about it or the difference between a normal employee sponsored work visa vs digital nomad visa. Any help is appreciated!"

1,2022-12-08,Got fired from my job. What now?,u/Medical_Price8780,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zgba1c/got_fired_from_my_job_what_now/,jobs,"Hello, a little context. My name is A, I'm 19 and I worked as an Amazon warehouse associate for almost a year. I've been hired in January, and as of today, December 8th, I received an email that I was laid off due to me clocking out virtually as I was leaving the building since I'd never had enough time to clock out through the time clock. HR categorized this as ""time theft"" and since it was reoccurring, they decided to terminate me since they do not tolerate this. 

I'm also going to Job Corps, for those who don't know, Job Corps is a government issued program to help low poverty americans get free education ranging from ages 16-24, male and female, and to get another chance. Unfortunately the program starts in January of next year due to the hold they have on accepting applications because of the holidays. 

But I'd still like to get items I need. I urgently need to stock up on some products for hygiene since I'm pretty sensitive to products I'm not used to using (E.g. soap, lotion, deodorant).

I'd expressed to my mother this, but since we're poor, I can't really ask her to help me a bunch. I have no friends, so that's crossed off. My only option is to go seasonal. So I'd also appreciate seasonal positions, may it be retail or grocery. It doesn't matter. 

To answer future questions, no this will not be on my ""record"" for future employment. Amazon is just eliminating those who violate their policy. No, I am NOT willing to reapply to apply to Amazon. I honestly didn't like working there because I was overworked. It was also super expensive to travel to and from there since my job is a warehouse and I live in an urban area, in a different city,  hence making it a bother to get there and get back since I paid for ride share."

I've been t my current position for less than a yesr and am already reaching the stage where I can't stand the thought of being here. At least when I worked food service, there was a freezer I could go scream in. 

The problem is usually boredom from repetitive work. I do the same motions, recite the same scripts, and it soon feels like if I have to do it one more time I'll scream or burst into tears. I intend to start a new job near the end of the month but I worry the same will happen there.

Some problems though: I'm not creative or smart. I'm an hourly worker whose only really fit for these kinds of mindless jobs, unless there's a field I'm not considering. I'm also older. So I'm not sure how much is a discipline problem or a poor job fit problem."

The thing is I’m going back and forth about submitting my transcripts. I have a decent gpa 3.1 but there was a period where I was making hella C’s mainly due to the pandemic and having burn out. The job doesn’t require It but I’m sure they would like to know if I actually went to college. I have a good resume and cover letter even references from staff members on my campus. I’m just insecure about sending them that raggedy looking transcript lollll what do you guys think I should do?
14,2022-12-08,Accepting a role I don’t want due to interview burn out.,u/smsussma,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zgbkpg/accepting_a_role_i_dont_want_due_to_interview/,jobs,"Hi all!

I’ve been at my current company for 10 months and am on a PIP for not hitting target. I’ve had 5 upsells this quarter but have about 15k more revenue dollars to go before Dec 31st and I don’t see it happening. I am more than likely getting fired.

I have been job searching since end of September and it has been a terribly draining experience. Doing the song and dance for recruiters, the repetitive phone screenings, the back to back interviews, investing so much time and energy into researching every company, spending so much time rehearsing and interview prepping, asking insightful questions, making it to the last round interview just to get rejected and getting no helpful feedback from the recruiters on why I was rejected.

Well I finally secured an offer that is $8k less than I want. I have to give a final decision by end of day. However, when I received the offer I was being interviewed by another company that I was really excited about, had the exact salary I was looking for, was a quick process, and I got incredible feedback from the whole team. 

Finished my final round interview on Tuesday and informed them at the beginning of the process that today was my deadline for giving the other opp a final decision. But I was just told over email  that the recruiter is still finding more ppl to interview before giving a final decision…

To say I’m heartbroken and mentally exhausted is an understatement.

So I either reject the other offer I already have on the table, hope and pray that I get the offer from the company I want and continue interviewing in the meantime. OR take the job offer I have but am not as excited about for $8k less than I wanted…

I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I’m not confident that this other company will even offer me anymore because I feel like if they were truly impressed they would’ve just given me the offer, despite saying they were “excited about me.” And the thought of continuing the job search/ interview process genuinely makes me want to cry.

It also seems IMPOSSIBLE to get a job offer these days so even though I’ll be paid under what I want  at this other company, at least I’ll have a job secured. 

I don’t want to low ball and accepting a job with a salary that I don’t want makes me equally as sad as continuing to job search….to make things worse, I don’t have much time either because I’m literally about to get fired EOM.

What should I do?"

1,2022-12-08,Need a reality check,u/AvailableProgram667,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zgd5ys/need_a_reality_check/,jobs,"Let me break down my situation. Went to A&amp;P school, and currently trying to get my A&amp;P. My family is in the process of buying a house in the Mediterranean. I wanna be an A&amp;P, but I have EDSa and if I end up like my dad, it'll catch up to me. So my plan is to get flight training while working as an A&amp;P. 3 hours a day for 2 years would easily put me into qualifying territory for commercial (of course it's more complicated, but I'm simplifying so I'm not typing for hours). According to my calculations, if I use 30% of my income for rent, use my current old car, with all expenses paid I would have about $2400 left over. Invest 10%, down to $2000. 

Will probably need to recoup for a while before starting flight school because that shit is very expensive. But once I do, that's 2 additional years before I get my commercial license. After I switch careers (assuming I don't change my mind), I'll work 3 days and have 4 days off with flight benifits. At that point I can save for a while, or pull a loan and buy a beater house and fix it up and make it look nice on my time off, using my flight benifits to reduce the costs of travel. Maybe I'll start fixing up a rental house, rent it, and have some passive income. I'll go there to clean it when I have days off, or when I can't make it, I'll pay a maid to clean. 

So my goal is to work as a pilot 3 days a week, and fix up and rent out apartments in my own apartment complex or condo building. That's a long ways way. Assuming everything goes right and I can get my ass to study for my A&amp;P, what should I consider that I'm not already considering, besides working towards my goals now instead of brainstorming what will happen in the next 15-20 years"

Plus my coworkers are really happy to have me here. I don't really want to stay but I don't want to leave everyone else floundering either.

Despite this, most employees (at least in my department (IT)) don’t come in the office at all. 

I joined as a full-time staff in October 2022 and was following the hybrid schedule for the first month or so. After that I came in maybe once a week. My boss doesn’t ask me whether I’m in the office and doesn’t say anything to me if I’m not in the office when I’m supposed to be. It’s not like they don’t know because they can clearly see on my timesheet how many days I’m in the office. On the other hand, my boss is hassling a coworker on my team about being in the office. 

I’ve been at the company for 5+ years (as a contractor) and my boss knows me and my work pretty well. Maybe I’m getting special treatment because of this?

It is very apparent that most employees don’t want to be in the office. When I run into other employees at work, they look miserable and sometimes don’t even speak when I greet them.  

How is hybrid work at your company? Is it strictly enforced? Does your boss track your whereabouts? Any consequences for not following the hybrid schedule? 
I don’t think in-office operations will ever get back to pre-pandemic levels."

Have been on a salary doing [mortgage] originations and processing/underwriting for six months, on a W2. Just got promoted to a full commission originations role which is a 1099 role. I’ve expressed thoughts to my boss in previous months about how staying on a W2 would result in lower taxes, greater ease regarding social security deductions, and make me more qualified for a mortgage in the coming years. He said if I wanted to keep the w2 I could. 

Fast forward to my promotion. My role changed 3-4 weeks ago but I’m just now getting an official offer letter and a request for my bank info, SSN, since they’re moving me to a 1099. I asked if I could remain a W2 employee but was heavily discouraged. Boss told me I’d have to sign an NDA and non-compete agreement in that case, which seems arbitrary to me.

It just doesn’t make sense to me. I’m not an independent contractor. I have to be in office 9-5, 3x per week. I have business cards with the company name. I’m an employee. 

Can anyone shed light as to why I’d need to sign a NDA/non compete on a W2? If that’s the case, I’d need to consider the 1099 as I would like to stay in this industry but don’t see myself at this company for terribly long. I just feel slightly taken advantage of seeing as it’s typically less expensive for companies to have 1099 employees, and I get stuck with extra tax/finance burdens. 

Would love to hear from some redditors instead of trying to have this conversation with my co workers. TY"

I followed a passion and got my masters in clinical social work. I've been in the field for a while, but not long enough to get independent licensure to make even semi-decent money.  I'm burnt out. The regulations are ever-changing and impossible to keep up with and most of the time it feels like I'm doing therapy for the insurance and not the actual client. I dread going to work every day and don't feel like I'm doing meaningful work in the way I used to.

All of my job experience is in the mental health field and I have NO idea how to transition out of it. 

How do I find a job that will accept no relevant experience, but maybe adjacent experience? I have research experience, customer service experience, advocacy work, and I taught a lecture hall class in college as a TA. My resume is filled with therapy and client work, but I truly want to focus on macro-level social work nd advocacy. Something like diversity and inclusion in the corporate sector but no one seems to be hiring for that below director level. 

I know I'll come back to it one day, but I feel like I need a break. I'd love to get a work-from-home position to take some time and be able to recover from my compassion fatigue and severe burnout.

When I saw the job posting on Jobstreet, I'm sure that it is within the 110,000 salary range though not explicitly indicated. I requested 100,000 but the HR said that the cap is 67,000. Moving forward, I got the job at 67. I'm now at my 3rd month and doing well on the job. 

Point of contention:
On my 6th month, which is after my regularization, I intend to tell the VP (the one hired me) to raise my base pay based on my original offer of 100,000 due to non monetary benefits that was given by my previous company and I think that I was low balled on my original offer. I just accepted their ""cap offer"" just because I really want to leave my previous job


If not given, I'll tell the VP that I will start to look for another job and will not resign until I found one.

8,2022-12-09,I finally got a job! Here's what I learned in the 7 month process,u/lordotnemicsan,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zgq3vi/i_finally_got_a_job_heres_what_i_learned_in_the_7/,jobs,"A little backstory: Recent college grad in 2 degrees (one marketable, one not so marketable). Decent experience. Interest and experience mostly in data, research, economics, public policy, so looking for something in that area. I should also say that I spent a few months in this period doing an internship. So here are some things that worked, and what didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

What worked: 

\-Tracking everything I applied for. I started a spreadsheet, where I tracked the name of the employer, position, date applied, method of application (on their website, via Linkedin, etc.), sector, and status. This allowed me to draw trends and see what was getting the most replies.

\-If you can find a sector that ""likes"" you, meaning they tended to reach out to you more (even if it's for a rejection), go ham on that. Look up everything you can about companies, positions, find their subreddit, etc. Once I found mine I went all in and almost all of my applications since that discovery have been in that one sector, including for the job I ended up getting.

\-Cold emails. This is huge. It actually works a lot better than you think. Here are my interview rates for applications using the various methods:

\*LinkedIn apply (31 apps): 12.9%

\*Direct website (54): 5.5%

\*Requested email (6): 16.7%

\*Cold email (20): 20.0%

As you can see, cold emails perform the best. If you're not doing cold emails, you should be. Target them to specific companies that you think would fit really well and may have a place for you. Look at their staff page and pick out who might be in charge of hiring. Don't write a unique one either; make a template of a couple sentences and swap out a few phrases to fit with the company. Include your resume and cover letter. This strategy works because A) it shows interest and research skills that you were able to find them, B) Saves them time in sending out postings and reviewing mountains of useless resumes, C) They may not be interested in hiring you right now, but it will usually get their attention and they may contact you later (although this hasn't happened to me yet). I should say that I got my current job via Linkedin, not cold emails. 

&amp;#x200B;

What didn't work:

\-Spending hours a day applying. In a long session of applications, you may find yourself applying for things that aren't as relevant by the end in a desperation to get as much out there. You're wasting your time. Instead, let the well recharge. Every day there are new listings; sip the best stuff each day and your time will be used much more efficiently. 

\-Be afraid to find an interim position. I did this, although I can't say for sure if it helped secure a main position. But it certainly kept me busy while I kept looking. Just make sure to stay a reasonable amount of time (in my case, 3 or more months), before deciding to start applying again so it at least looks good on your resume.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, wishing everyone the best of luck!"

i’m in need of your advice. 

about three weeks ago, i had an interview with a local grocery store and started my training about two weeks ago.

the thing is, during the interview, i’ve had the owner stated that nobody is in one designated zone throughout their entire shift, meaning that i’ll have to cover 1/3 of my shift in deli, the other 1/3 in cashier and the final 1/3 in stock. 

however, with all these duties as well as information, it has overwhelmed me, it’s a lot to remember and know right now on my end. 

i’ve had friends tell me i’ll get better with time when it comes to these roles, but i just feel slower to learn all this, in contrast to my coworkers despite them being there longer than i have."

For the context, this was the timeline of the process :

• 24/07 : application date

• 27/07 : HR phone screening

• 04/08 : first interview with N+1. Went very well.

• 30/08 : HR sent a mail to schedule next interview

• 07/09 : second interview with another N+1 from an adjacent team. Went extra well.

• 21/09 : HR sent a mail to schedule next interview

• 06/10 : 3rd interview with N+1 and another team member. Presentation of a case study. Went very well.

• 26/10 : HR sent a mail to schedule next interview

• 02/11 : 4th and final interview with N+2. Went awful.

• 10/11 : I asked for a follow up on my application as I had another offer to consider. They never responded to my follow up. I ended up not taking the other offer for different reasons and forgot about this one.

• 09/12 : HR sent a mail to schedule next interview without acknowledging my follow up mail.

&amp;#x200B;

The first 3 interviews went very well, the last one however was a complete disaster. 

What is this last mail about ?

HR mails have always been the exact same template ""we would like to continue with you application, when will you be available for a quick phone call to schedule next interview ?"". The thing is, they told me it was a 4 interviews process, with the interview with the N+2 being final, so it wouldn't really make sense to schedule another interview, especially after all this time and them ghosting me my follow up mail.

The processing time in between interview with them has been excrutiating long, but tbf, they did mention on their career site that their process usually last between 2-4 months.

The position in itself is very interesting, and the salary is competitive, so I might consider pursuing it, but how do I even recover from my follow up ? I told them I had another offer in hand, which was true, but I would have love to consider their offer if they decided to make one. It's now a month later and I'm still at my current job, didn't take any offer."

I started working for a big consultancy firm just over a year ago - this was my dream move and into a role that I love doing. We are a small team and initially, things were great until my work colleague started to show her true colours and always get out of work, not come into the office to work from home instead. My manager seems to not know how to deal with her and he lets her get away with all of this and it seems like any of the work that she wont pick up, falls on me and adds to my already hectic workload. We just had our mid year review and I expressed with my work quality and additional responsibilities, that I am hoping for a greater pay increase at the end of the year. My colleague has recently refused to manage anyone or conduct interviews which have now fallen on me to conduct and there have been no repercussions on her lack of work and taking extended sick leave. I have got to the point that this unfairness, whether intentional or not, is really bringing me down! She gets paid more than me for doing half the work and just when we are required to be in the office, decided they have doctors appointment and gets out of it which leaves me as the sole person in! I have been somewhat ill for the past couple of weeks and have still worked and been in the office and have expressed to my manager that I do not want to come in as I need rest. 
I have had other companies approach me and I was not sure what or how I should approach this with my manager……..I was thinking of saying I’m not happy and other companies have approached me and I have decided to talk to them to see where this can go. I hate being in an environment where I feel negative and negative towards my colleague, especially when they are getting away with so much and it then falls on me. What do I do? Is it ok to say I am thinking of leaving?"

As I do with any meeting request, I asked for the details. He said since the team is remote, he wants us all to get together in each morning for 15 minutes to say hi and then leave - just to kick off our day with some team comradery.  We don't need one on Monday because we have our weekly team meeting. In addition to each business unit having its own meeting with him on their respective days of the week. 

I absolutely LOATHE this concept. It's not like its a pre-shift meeting or anything like that - there's no daily task assignments. And I highly doubt its only going to be 15 minutes we can't even have our team weekly meeting without going on tangents or running over. 

I told him that this is really not something I want to do, and that daily meetings like this with no agenda and no real goal does nothing to ""Set my day right."" -- But he thinks that seeing everyone's face and saying hi and checking in be a good thing. And he even confirmed its not for accountability or making sure everyone's ""on task"" -- its literally just to say hi to each other. 

I just can't see it. Maybe because I come from a history with a boss that was very hands off. This just seems painful. Granted, I am a 1099, so I can and will 100% bill my minimum 1 hour for this. But it still just seems so stupid."

The thing is though, it all feels so out of context? Like what do I actually do now? Learn a new software and bam somehow I'm qualified to make more money somewhere else? Learn generic business practices and hope that's somehow applicable later? I don't actually know how to be anything more than what my roll asks, and honestly not even sure where I want to be?

I was made an offer and accepted it around thanksgiving and initially was very excited. But after speaking with the company more during the onboarding process I’m starting to think this may be more stress than I can handle while still in school.

They keep reiterating to me how hectic and busy the company is, they’ve admitted to having end of day meetings that run past employees set work hours, and have asked that I be available for communication outside of my set hours, basically at any given time. On top of that, it would be a 40 minute commute and they’d want me physically in the office most days. This would be doable if it were my only priority, but I’m also a full time student (which they know — I have night classes) and I need a job that allows space for that. I communicated that to them during the interview process but they’re just now revealing the true nature of the work environment. 

My first official start date is supposed to be Monday, the 12th but part of me is wondering if I should just rescind my acceptance now or if I should give it a trial run for the month of December while I’m on break from my classes. It’d probably be easier to just leave now but I’m not sure how to communicate or initiate that conversation and I also feel bad because the recruiting agency worked very hard to help me get this role.

One of them is off, the next couple Tuesdays. I saw there was a 2hr gap in there schedule because this person is off-I was the one who pointed out there was a gap in their schedule to be helpful, no to cover it 

There’s been times they step out on break or call out and I’ve been forced to cover them, but I hate talking on the phone and the people at other labs who call us are so rude. 

Boss emailed me, “Can you cover the next 2 Tuesdays at 5 to 1am? So I don’t have to change the dispatch schedule”

That’s 2 hours earlier than my normal shift to cover someone else’s job. Funny thing is there is a dispatcher coming at 7-move her up not me

How do I politely reply no? I struggle with not sending passive aggressive during emails. Sometimes I need to calm down before I send emails I’ll regret"

What should i do?,u/Maximum-Bid-1689,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zh15ey/my_boss_doesnt_trust_in_me_what_should_i_do/,jobs,"- Well i’ve felt discontent with my boss since the day he offered my job. He hired for a full-time role but he got me to do part-time instead (you guys can scroll down on my profile a bit and you’ll see). I accepted the offer bc as a foreigner it’s really hard to get a job. This is the first job ever in my life and i’m not a native English speaker. 
- At first my role was an inbound call centre. The training is to sit with other employees and see how they do. On the 4th day my boss got me to do my job. I understood what the customers said but i was still confused with the system so it took me 5-7 mins per call. I’d already told him that i was still confused but he said ‘just do it, nothing is difficult’. 
- After that day, my manager (not the same person as my boss) got me to check and update the data &amp; status of old customers. Today i’d done with all of them so the manager wanted me to take inbound calls. But my boss refused it, he said he thought i couldn’t speak English very well. I don’t understand why he thinks that, maybe the thing that happened on the 4th day that i took inbound calls for the first time??? 
- The even more desperate thing was that my boss let one of my colleagues that speaks the same native language as me translate what he said to me (but i understood what he said in English)."
0,2022-12-09,I heckin quit!,u/sexcrazyinaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zh16r6/i_heckin_quit/,jobs,"Started Oct 2021, everything was fine even though the work environment was pretty toxic, I can deal. Lots of ass kissing to one person who will flip her shit if anything doesn't go her way. This includes her manager, human resources, and literally the whole company. Fine. Lots of immaturity and vulgarity. They gave me a vibrator for Christmas. I just go along with it. 

I try and work very hard and take on all new customers and clear up old problems left behind from others. I am always helpful and take on extra duties that my boss is willing to hand over. 

My work load is 30 customers compared to my coworkers 3. I help launch new software and systems and help to make some of our biggest sales goals.  Run errands and clean as well because others won't help. 

We have a company wide meeting and they award my coworkers a monetary gift. They give me nothing! When I asked they say they can't award everyone in the office because it will look bad to the people who work in the plant. They awarded everyone but me? My boss says I'm important and that she could do my coworkers job with her arm tied behind her back but not mine. (I can do both our jobs and have!) So now I'm demoralized. I try to hold it together but leave for a little while just to collect myself and come back and work hard. 

The next day is my deceased father's birthday. I'm a little down about that and what happened but I go to work and try my best. Boss starts piling on extra tasks that she has never asked me to do with little communication and then getting irritated with me for not nailing it first try. Day goes along we get a Christmas gift and open it all together and we talk and chit chat. 

The next day they ask me if I have ordered cups which was not part of my original job duties and the old intern did it. They told me the new intern would eventually do it, however, she has yet to start even though she has been there for months. I ask when she might be able to take over the task and my boss doesn't like this. Says every since the ""awards"" we're handed out I have been acting different and not talking and that I'm acting too good to run errands. No but I'd like if we could take turns etc. She's upset saying that the other employees couldn't even be happy about their awards bc I was upset. I recognize that and I wasn't being upset on purpose but my feelings were very hurt! I tell her I'm starting to think it's not a good place for me to be. She asked if Im quitting and (I honestly don't have much of a choice) I say yes. She asks if I mean right now and I said well, yes I'm going to go ahead and go. 

It's sucks but I still can't believe that a group of managers sat down and made that decision to give an award to everyone but me, and then proceed to treat me like that. Were they trying to push me out?"

0,2022-12-09,Am I wrong to be annoyed with my supervisor?,u/spitfiry_peach,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zh1to2/am_i_wrong_to_be_annoyed_with_my_supervisor/,jobs,"This is a long post so bear with me. I made a major career change at the beginning of the year. I had basic experience but it was basically agreed upon my hiring I'd need major training for my role, but my boss and supervisor were more concerned about hiring a good personality fit for the team and taking the time for extra training. Looking back I think this was a mistake.

My team is unbelievably busy. Projects are constantly late or behind, and even senior employees are rushing work to the point they're missing important details of projects. Almost everyone takes work home and isn't paid extra for it (I refuse to do this, especially since I'm hourly).

I had consistent training for about a month. Without going into too many details I'm basically the admin for 3 of our company-wide programs, and am the lone person that is responsible for troubleshooting with employees and training new ones. I love this part of my job, but it's been hard being thrown into learning something completely new and basically being in charge of it. That wasn't an expectation when I was hired.

I constantly would ask my supervisor for feedback the first few months. It was always positive, with your normal critiques as a new person. Our one-on-ones went from weekly to maybe monthly if at all. Her reason was ""I don't have time to manage you all."" This was something she said verbatim to my face. I was on my own most of the time with the exception of coworkers helping me with small things, and scheduling time with my supervisor as I could. I quickly noticed she was easily annoyed with questions depending on the day, so I started to ask them less (this was probably wrong on my part).

Once my trial phase was over I was told I passed with flying colors, got a raise, etc. I was happy about it!

Two weeks later my boss schedules a meeting for us and she tells me she's disappointed with my lack of progress and she needs more from me. I felt completely blind sided. At this point she began scheduling 3 one on ones for us per week, two of which are where she goes through my calendar and alters my time frames for projects/etc. She's suddenly a lot more critical as well.

I wish would have done this from the beginning, especially if she has felt like I'm not managing my time properly for this long. I'm taking it in stride and am trying to prove I'm doing my best with the resources (or lack there of) I was given during my 'training'. 

Am I just being too sensitive? I guess it sucks to feel like I was doing great for so long and then just get the rug pulled out from under me."

206,2022-12-09,I went from $28k -&gt; $120k in Under a Year &amp; You Can Too!!,u/thatsnotnorml,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zh4eb3/i_went_from_28k_120k_in_under_a_year_you_can_too/,jobs,"Hello Internet People,

tl;dr: I more than 4x’ed my salary over a period of 10 months. This post outlines the journey, and provides insight to those looking for similar results.

Monday is my first day as a software engineer for a Fortune 200 company with a six-figure salary. I owe a lot of that success to tutorials and testimonials I’ve read online. I was a little hesitant to make this post because I know there are people struggling, but I hope that this will serve to give insight and inspiration to those who are trying to do something similar to me.

Here’s a little about myself, for context. I’m 30 years old, and I grew up in a very poor part of the US. There was a lot of unemployment, which lead to a mindset of taking what ever job was offered to you. I worked a lot of different physical labor jobs from the time I was 17-27. I never made more than $36k a year from any of them. So I decided to make a risky decision and get a lower paying job that involved doing what I loved.

Background:

&amp;#x200B;

* Spent first 10 years of adulthood working physical labor jobs
* Highschool dropout, with no college degree
* Felony on my criminal record for possession of marijuana
* Love of technology
* Strong work ethic
* Zero friends with tech careers
* Above average people skills

At 25 years old I knew that I was not enjoying my current career as a warehouse worker, even if it was paying my bills. I was stuck in a position where I worked too much overtime to be able to go to my local community college, but I still really wanted to learn to code. I swear I would look up job postings on indeed, and just stare at the requirements. I was too anxious and underqualified to even apply to them.

## What You’ll Need to Begin

&amp;#x200B;

* Strong work ethic / self-discipline
   * If you are going the self-taught route, there are no parents or teachers that will be grading your work or following up on missed assignments. Every success and failure is dependent on your ambition to DO THE THING
* Desire and ability to learn new things
* A computer
   * Doesn’t matter the operating system or specs, but something that will run your code and a browser is preferred
* Internet
* Ability to change careers
   * This seems to be the biggest blocker for most people I know. They have already established a job that will pay their bills and have people that depend on them to do so. I was in the same boat. The hard truth is, if you continue to do what you’ve always done, you’ll get the same results you’ve always gotten.

## Process

## Learn ($0)

On my 25th birthday, I found freecodecamp. There are many online tutorial sites you can use, but that’s the one I found and stuck with. In four months, I ran through all of the courses available at the time, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you haven’t gone to university, you will NEED some type of self-teaching platform. It does not need to be the same as me, as long as you are consistent. I should also note that while freecodecamp was the platform I spent the most time on, there were also others I used in combination, like YouTube, Code Academy, etc.

## Apply Knowledge ($0)

I was lucky enough to have a friend who owned a business. This friend was great at his craft, but knew nothing of coding and had no website. I told him I had been learning to code, and offered to build him a website for just the cost of hosting.

A lot of people discourage working at a discounted or free rate when you’re starting out, but I disagree.. at least if you’re coming from a background similar to mine. I built his website for $100 which included the cost of a logo design from a freelancer, and hosting fees. I made MAYBE $40 on this project.

A lot of people pay a lot of money to go to school, and some people even take unpaid internships towards the end or right after school. I saw myself as someone who was learning for free, but needed real world applications to refine myself and gain experience. This turned out to be a catalyst for a lot of change.

That project, and the discounted projects I took over the next year served as experience, and exposure. I worked my full time warehouse job, and when I would come home I would work on these sites on my time frame. They were free after all. I learned what business owners cared about (cost, aesthetics, conversions), and I overcame the blockers that freecodecamp didn’t prepare me for (documentation hell, cheap cloud hosting, clients who didn’t actually know what they wanted).

During this time I also just started building things that I found useful, which is a habit that I have kept with me. Again, you’re doing this to learn. It’s not enough to take a course and say you know a language like javascript if you’ve never used it. I guarantee things will not go as planned from what ever tutorial you read, and you will be forced to.

To find projects if you don’t have anyone in your life that needs a website.. hit Google maps. I would look up businesses in my area (but they didn’t need to be local), and I would find ones with crappy unresponsive web pages, or no website at all.

I would build a skeleton site for them before even calling, and then show up at the business and ask for a manager. I would tell them that I was trying to learn more, and had noticed they had an outdated website. I would tell them that I had already done most of the work to gain experience, and then offer to sell and host the website for them for a heavy discount.

You would be surprised at the amount of people that even after telling them that I was happy to do it for the experience thought that I was trying to scam them. But, thankfully there were enough business owners that saw the value in what I was offering to keep me going. DON’T GIVE UP!

## Make the Jump into a Tech Career ($36k → $23.4k)

For me, this was the most daunting task of all. I had been making roughly $22/hr as a warehouse worker, and had become accustomed to the lifestyle that pay afforded me. Now for some people, they will be able to find a job right away making at LEAST that much. With my criminal background and lack of education, this proved to be very difficult.I didn’t really care what I was doing, I just knew that I wanted to sit at a desk, and work on a computer.

I found a job as a front-line Tech Support Agent for a very popular retail store. Call centers are a great place to use as your first stepping stone in tech. The reason for this is, there is ALWAYS a high turn over as the job isn’t glamorous. You get a lot of people yelling at you for things that are not your fault. The second reason is, there is ALWAYS some technology that is running the place. If you can stick it out for a few months as a front line agent, you can find which positions are available to do more technical work.

The job was HORRIBLE. They started me at $11.25/hr (literally half of my warehouse pay). But the job was pretty simple. Take in phone calls from distressed PC customers and walk them through the resolution of their issues.

There was very little training on how to actually solve the issues, and this is where I first learned that no one knows everything, and that we all use Google, even in a corporate world. This job taught me how to document all of my work, and really upped my soft skills. If you can talk a 78-year-old woman through troubleshooting her 2-year-old printer over the phone… you know what I mean.

## Demonstrate Your Value ($23.4k → $28k)

September 2020

After 7 months, I was offered a promotion to data analyst with a $4/hr raise.

The data analyst job was the first place that I could actually use my skills. There were a lot of reports to run using an Oracle DB, and a TON of manual tasks that were being distributed across our seven person team.

My boss was the worst. Think a chain-smoking, not-as-nice Minerva McGonagall. She was all about policy and procedure, and micro-managing everything that was being done. I attempted to automate a tedious process, and when I presented my work I was told that not only was I being written up for working outside of the tasks I was assigned, but I was also warned that automation meant loss of work for the team, which would lead to lay-offs.

That really sucked. I was discouraged, but still felt like I could use this job to learn and grow. I started automating EVERYTHING behind my managers back. I turned 40 hours of tedious work into 4-6 hours of tedious work. My manager had no complaints because the work was accurate, and always on time.

## Leaving the Nest ($28k → $60k)

December 2021

A year into my Data Analyst position, my manager approached me and told me that COVID was over and they were sending a percentage of employees back into the office to work.

I had no idea what I was going to do. I had barely been able to afford to pay my bills as it was, without commuting to an office an hour away five times a week. She told me that I was chosen to come back because I was the newest on the team, and she was letting tenured employees stay home.

I made it two days in the office. On my second day, I realized that automating my work at home translated to not having a thing to do if I were forced to be in the office. This was not going to work.

I spent the next two weeks applying to jobs, like that was the only thing I was paid to do. I applied EXCLUSIVELY on LinkedIn because I had made friends in tech who told me that’s where they got the most engagement with recruiters.

I applied to 147 different positions. I built my resume around the work I had been doing as a freelancer, as well as the work I had been doing as a Data Analyst. Out of 147, only 4 recruiters ever responded to me. Out of those 4, I had two people tell me that I wasn’t a good fit in the initial interview, 1 give me a coding challenge that I failed, and finally, the company that hired me.

I ended up getting hired as a “Technical Support Analyst” for a mid-size software company focused on K-12 School District Administration.

Here’s what I learned about the applying/interviewing phase that I think would be valuable to people that are in my previous position:

&amp;#x200B;

* It is 100% a numbers game. That whole every no is closer to a yes could not be more accurate. I don’t see how I would have made it through this without having that mentality. It used to take me days of research to find a company that I thought I was qualified to work for. I would write an extensive cover letter, and then apply. When I didn’t hear anything back, I would get discouraged and tell myself I was never going to get a job. THIS MINDSET DID NOTHING TO HELP ME GET HIRED, and it wasn’t until I was able to shift my perspective did I have the energy to apply to dozens of positions a day.
* Your attitude matters. The company that hired me told me that me, telling them how excited I was to work for a software company really won them over. Companies understand that it is near impossible to find a candidate that is familiar with EVERY piece of their technology stack. The important thing is that the candidate is willing and able to learn new things. What I didn’t know was that most candidates didn’t want to do that. They learned a language ten years ago, and fully planned to use that technology the rest of their careers (don’t do that).
* Initiative matters. I would have never had anything to show for myself if I had waited to be hired to make something. Do it because you want to, not because you have to.

## Finding Your Niche ($60k)

January 2022

Depending on the company you are working for, your job title may or may not have a rigid job description and responsibilities. The reality is most companies do not, and because of this you will often find people wearing many hats and gaining skills in fields other than the ones they are originally hired for.

There’s two different ways to look at this:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I’m not getting paid enough for this, I have had no training on this, and I have no interest in doing work outside of my title.
2. I get the opportunity to gain professional experience in a job that I am not qualified for, and learn on the job skills that can translate into a higher paid position down the road.

If you’ve made it this far into the post, I am assuming that you see the value in the 2nd perspective.

Upon getting hired by my first software company, it was clear that the job I was hired for was just a small part of what needed to be done. So, I just started doing all the things that looked fun to me.

A little background about me, is that I found my love of tech at eleven years old in a game called RuneScape. For those who have never heard of it, it is a browser-based RPG that requires many hours of pointing and clicking the same objects in a repetitive manner. I learned to automate the game by writing PERL based scripts. I would sell in game items at lunch time in middle school that I gained from the scripts I wrote. This really installed a love of automation that I carry with me to this day.

## Rising to the Occasion

So at my new job, I just started automating everything that I could. This time, the bosses loved it. Within three months at this company, I was retitled from “Technical Support Analyst” to “Site Reliability Engineer”. Unfortunately, that did not come with a pay raise.. but that was a mis-step on their part more than it was a failure on my negotiation skills. I would like to state that I hold no ill-will towards this company, and I am forever grateful that they gave me the opportunity.

I have heard before that tech careers are T shaped, meaning that there are many low paid entry level positions, but the highest paying are those that specialize in something (think T upside down). This is absolutely correct.

Upon my retitling, I began researching the responsibilities and job descriptions that I could find. I got lucky because the job title was created by Google, and they were kind enough to write an entire book on it.

Over the next 7 months, I did my best to embody all that a Site Reliability Engineer offers to an organization. For my position that included converting our cloud infrastructure into Infrastructure as Code, setting up monitoring and alerts, and automating all of the tedious tasks that our team had across our applications.

## Recognizing Your Value

June 2022

During this time, it became very clear that I was definitely being underpaid. I added my new responsibilities and skills to LinkedIn, utilized my company’s reimbursement for certifications, and got a couple of popular certifications that were relevant to my title.

You will know if you’ve found a good niche, because recruiters will begin sliding into your LinkedIn inbox like you’re a female on Facebook who just changed their relationship status to single.

I started interviewing regularly, while things were still going great at my job. This was counterintuitive to many of those around me.. but the truth is, things don’t need to be going bad for you to move on. It allows you to get a realistic idea of what the market is offering for your skills, and also takes away the stress of having to find a job to pay your bills.

During this period, I experienced a lot of disappointment, and a lot of surprises, mostly because of my background. In July I was offered a position working on Federal Government contracts for the FDIC, but the offer was rescinded because of the felony on my record.

This ultimately worked out in the end, with other companies happy to take on an ambitious newbie who had a lot of progress to show for themselves in a short time.

My advice for anyone at this point in their journey is to just remember that no one but yourself can decide your value. 100 no’s and a yes, is still a yes.

Also, tell your recruiters to do their own paperwork. I spent hours filling out questionnaires, following up on emails, and reaching out to prospects only to find out that most of the interview requests I was answering were automated and not even being read.

## Reaching Six Figures ($60k → $120k)

December 2022

After opening myself to work on LinkedIn and speaking with dozens of recruiters, I found myself deciding between multiple offers for well known companies. For the first time in my life, I did not need to apply to any positions, and people were willing to bid on my talent. This has been an incredibly gratifying and validating experience.

During a quarterly review I let my manager know that I was actively interviewing for other positions. I had previously asked for raises and was told that there was a pay-scale re-org in the works, but that had never come about. I was offered a $20k raise to $80k when I told them how far along the process I was, but by that time I was already being offered $120k which they were unable to match.

I was lucky enough that there were no hard feelings, with both co-workers and managers congratulating me, asking how I did it, and offering references. I hope that who ever is reading this is also lucky in this regard. Although, if you find yourself in a position where other people can not be happy for your success, just remember that this is a reflection of themselves and has very little to do with you.

## Reflection ($120k)

So, this is where I am now. A few people told me that I should have gone the over-employed route and kept both jobs for a total salary of $180k. That sounds nice, but the reality is that I would have most likely been lying to both companies to get out of meetings, and not been able to maintain the same level of productivity if I had to spread efforts across two jobs.

If there is any other advice I can give, it would be to find a good work life balance. In my early working years, I was taught that only millionaires had a right to rest. This led to me burning out, and not enjoying my work. When I took a step back to begin enjoying myself, things that would stress me out on Monday mornings would start to just roll off my shoulders. I cannot stress enough how much of a noticeable change this made in both my attitude and quality of work.

Also, I know that this post is outlined in terms of compensation… but the truth is that money is merely a shadow of value. If you can provide value, it truly does not matter where you live, what your currency is, or standard of living is… you will be wealthy.

So that’s it for me. I hope that this post will help people, and not come off as me stroking my own ego. I see myself as someone who still has a long way to go. My career goal is oriented towards software architecture, which is not where I currently am. I plan on using my new job to further refine my current skills and learn new ones.

I’m happy to answer any questions about my process and provide feedback on your own from my perspective.

Hope this helps!!"

My wife works for an EMT company. She really liked the company, they invited her to company parties, gave her a work vehicle, and paid above average rates. She liked it so much that she wanted to take the professional courtesy and give them a 2 week notice (actually a 19 day notice) before the winter semester starts. She gets a call from her boss’s boss who says they want her to quit over a week early on the 15th for “pay roll reasons”. Bullshit. This fat cat doesn’t want to pay her Christmas pay but also doesn’t want her to qualify for unemployment benefits. My wife told them to pound sand and that she will resign in the 29th, if they want to terminate her on the 15th that’s their prerogative. Heed my warning: no matter how good the company is, no matter how chummy they are with you, no matter how many company parties and perks they give, they are only self interested and the do not care about you.

Edit: A lot of people are saying “you should still give two weeks, that’s bad advice, you’ll burn bridges”. Generally yes, however the fact that it is okay for an employer to terminate an employee or pressure one into resigning before your two weeks is up is ridiculous. That is a clear double standard. Employees have to respect the two weeks but companies don’t?"

I got cut from a position I had with a temp company at a local factory. I was given no reason why and when I asked the temp agency to find the ""why"" to my job ended the temp agency basically told me to bleep off.  They also told me to NOT contact the factory I worked for.

Is there a reason why I am not supposed to contact the factory I worked with? Why would they not tell me why I got cut? I do live in at will state if that changes anything.

Edit: Add on. The day before i got cut, the supervisor at the factory told me to come two days later. The next day then I was told by the temp agency my time there ended. After I found this out from the temp agency, I texted my supervisor asking him if i should come in still the day he told me. He never replied, but the temp agency told me a day after i texted time to NOT have any contact with the former company.  As of now, the temp agency has not lined up any replacement for me yet, and they do not seem to be in a hurry either.

Edit: I applied for this factory on my own 5 years ago, but got rejected. Could the factory let me go because of this? They also found out I can't drive forklift (which is sector they are short on) because of medical condition.  The main hesitation I have to asking the factory is what the temp agency could do to me.

Edit: What bugs me the most with this is the lack of truth they are telling me. If I was cut because of what I did, I want to know so I don't mess up again at a future placement. Or if it was truly production slow down, why cant they tell me that and that I could return again. In my emails with them, they didn't really answer either question."

Within the finance department there are several divisions (e.g financial reporting, general accounting, accounts payable). 

I have been fortunate enough to work under the financial reporting division and I am learning a lot. However, the general issue with moving up the ladder internally in government is (or at least my local government), you don’t get promoted based on your performance. Rather, the most efficient way to move up within, is to wait for higher level positions to open up and apply for them like you would do for any external job (which fucking blows).

Anyways, my manager recently informed me that him and our assistant controller are very impressed by my work ethic and initiative this past year. Therefore, they really want to try and speak with Human Resources to convince them to promote me without having to go through the normal process. The issue is HR is very strict and typically goes by the books, so it’s uncertain if they will allow it. My division is also set by budget, which also limits my managers ability to get this passed.

My dilemma is that the position he wants to promote me to, is currently open for application in another division under our Finance Department. I am really appreciative of his attempt at rewarding my hard work and trying to keep me, but there is no guarantee. The application for the higher position at the other division closes next Monday. 

Should I apply and should I inform my manager?"

I like company B, and they pay twice of what my internship at company A pays me.

If I get an offer for this position, I will have to start working in February, meaning I will have to quit my internship after one month in.

The job is incredibly intense and my boss sucks. She doesn’t care that we need to work however long it takes to meet deadlines, even if it means working Saturday and Sunday sometimes. 

The work environment feels like someone has a gun to my head while I’m slaying away from 6-6 every day trying to meet deadlines with a quality finished product, all while multiple directors provide input to try to take the project on a new direction at the last minute…

I went to my boss multiple times to talk workload and feasibility and am told to suck it up. Not to mention I always get stuck with objectively hard projects despite being a lower level than everyone else. But this is my “new normal” and we have to do “more with less” as we’re a small team. Unfortunately I feel I’m not the only person in corporate who has had a job like this.

No wonder places are having such a difficult time getting and keeping employees.

Virtually EVERYTHING about working absolutely sucks now, and is such bullshit, unless you are very lucky, connected or already at a certain level.

I like my job and am happy because I feel valued and get to do interesting work. However, the company is extremely disorganized and is running out of money. I'm no expert, but I would estimate I and the company have a few months left unless we get more funding (which I doubt). Market rate for what I do is typically 75-95k at my experience level (in CA), I think, but I make 105k at my current position.

Because the company's stability has not been looking good, I started looking for new positions and applied to about 15 roles in the past two months. I know I am currently ""overpaid,"" and so I am willing to take somewhat of a pay cut when I leave. I have been having a really good hit rate and already received 2 offers. One was for 90k and seemed like a very good company, but I unfortunately turned it down due to ethical concerns. 

The other offer, which I have in hand now, seems decent and I think I'd like the work, but the offer is for less than 80k base, which is less than the bottom of range we had agreed on previously.  I tried communicating that I will not take such a large pay cut but they are not willing to negotiate because they say it is based on market research. I already feel undervalued by this company. I've had four offers between my last job search and the current one which all exceeded this base salary by at least 10k, so this doesn't seem right, but maybe I was just very lucky before

Does it make sense to leave my current position for an offer I am not happy with, or should I hold out to see if I can get a better offer elsewhere?"

I'm the type of person to give full or good effort and nothing short of it ever, but I also like to relax and don't want to have to apply for jobs only right after I finish my cup of coffee on Saturday morning, I would rather spend an hour after work every day of the week applying for jobs. However, after work, I am always less mentally fresh than after a cup of coffee in the morning. Not so much that I couldn't write, because I tend to be pretty good at formal writing, but this state is more akin to half-assing it than if I had just drank coffee (and it keeps me up so won't drink it during or after work). 

I'm concerned that if I go the half-ass route and a year later I still don't have a job, that enough companies will have my mediocre cover letter for reference or will have decided already that they don't want to hire me that getting a job will have been made harder. Is this a realistic perspective? Do companies keep tabs on who applies and reapplies later? Are my half-ass cover letters, mediocre credentials, and potential lack of apparent effort (compared to ivy league kids maybe) in my writing going to work against me getting a job because I end up applying to 50% of companies in every field I'm interested in for example? Looking on Indeed seems to indicate jobs are scarce, even for something as versatile as a biology degree. I would hate to ruin my opportunities for the sake of better time management.

I could probably spend 10 hours/week applying for jobs if I did it after work every day, but more like 5 hours if I spent the early half of a Saturday, so I'm really torn between which is better. So is it worth it to write cover letters and adjust my resume for jobs after work when I'm not my sharpest, but still sharper than most? or should I be on my absolute Ps and Qs and really watch how I present myself when writing in the application process (because not doing so may affect my capacity to get hired later on due to some fact only someone with experience would know)?"

I have an ongoing background check and they asked me the reason for separation. 

My answer was like I was suspended because I was told I will either be called back in later or to be terminated (which is true) due to below reasons:

1. Arrangement was not made as promised during the interview process (arrangement = WFH. I worked on site only and finally asked them to lay me off, but didn't mention this to the verifier who questioned me)
2. Not enough exposure to the tasks I needed for my designation

And now he's asking me these two (I didn't answer them yet):

* Elaborate on the reason I was suspended 

I asked my previous employer to terminate my employment so that I can apply for an EI which I did. I also got a severance package from them but the Termination Letter &amp; Release And Indemnity forms specify that I cannot disclose the details to others unless it's my spouse or law enforcement

* Reason the employer gave me termination

Because I asked them to.

Any advises please on how I should reply to the above? 

A couple of positions on my resume have 2 to 6 months of discrepancies, but the org &amp; job title are correct. I was once fired due to performance, but I put contract for reasoning. I suppose they would've found out, but don't know if they're gonna ask me about it or not. 

Any tips will be appreciated, thanks!"

I was also told I’d be at the main location or the one close by my home. I told the GM I didn’t feel comfortable traveling to any of the locations far out. The schedules were supposed to be emailed to us days ago but I didn’t get mine until I went in today. Today the training was at one of the further locations but I figured it was only since I was training. 

When she gives me my schedule I’m between 2 different locations and one of them is a far out location that I specifically said I didn’t want. Not to mention I only had 23 hours total. I had the lowest amount of hours, even less than the part time employees. The GM said she had no where else to put me but if someone doesn’t work out I could have their spot. My thing is I wouldn’t mind being a floater as long as I was getting full time hours. Literally some days I only work for 2 hours, that’s not what I signed up for. I really need the money. My question is what should I do ? 23 hours a week is nothing and quite frankly I feel disrespected. Any advice ?

Edit: I’d like to mention that the 23 hours is spread across 6 days so I only have 1 day off. Starting the week after next they want me to work 4 hours on that day as well, so no days off basically."

I started looking because I work in a tech-adjacent industry, and my company was hit by a round of layoffs. While I survived, our overall staff has been reduced by half, and shortly after the (very sudden) layoffs, I talked to HR about my own position.

This is a small company, and I've been here a while--I'm in a pretty decent mid-level role. However, this is my only job that stands out on my resume; everything else is short-term temp work, and I only was promoted to mid-level about a year ago. With this in mind, I leveled with our HR person: ""if I lose this job, I'm toast. Please, for the love of God, give me as much heads up as possible."" I also asked if my job was safe until the end of 2022. Our HR person (who I know fairly well) was candid and said that it probably was, and that they'd try to give as much notice as possible, but that promises were financially impossible to make at the time.

To the grindstone I went. Resume revising, cover letter writing, Indeed assessment taking. Day after day after day and click after click after click. Nothing. I loathe Indeed.

Fairly recently, though, I was called by a recruiter. They didn't give much insight into the salary/benefits, so I assumed it was a garbage role--I figured it'd be fine to take the screening call as practice. Wound up getting an interview and acing it because, in a way, I was detached from it, and expecting it to be peanuts.

Well, they made an offer today, and the salary is...bonkers. Almost double my current earnings. My eyes popped out of my head when I read the number.

The benefits suck, though. Health coverage doesn't kick in for 60 days (thanks, guess I'll be uninsured again--seriously, I get that employers don't want to waste money on an employee that rapidly exits, but 60 days is extreme IMO). The commute is an hour one way, and the require a few months in office before you get two remote days a week (not Monday, not Friday, and the role is something that could easily be remote after onboarding). And the PTO? That's the worst part. *0* days for the first year. That's right--you have to work there a full year before you accrue 7 PTO days.

This is generally indicative of the company culture, from what I can tell. Very ""old school."" I'd be the youngest person in the office by at least 20 years. The salary is still very high for a mid-level position, but damn. Just...damn. The office absolutely bombed on the vibe check, and the work itself would be waaay more isolated and solitary than my current duties. I'm fairly extroverted--as long as it isn't sales, I love talking to people.

I wound up talking to HR at my current company and asked what the future of my role looked like (i.e., are more layoffs approaching). HR told me that all current positions company-wide are safe indefinitely--we're still not doing as well as we were a few months ago, but things have stabilized.

I have until Monday evening to decide, but the more I think about it...the more I feel like I can't accept this job offer. It KILLS me, because a) the salary would solve a lot of my financial problems and b) this is the only company that's even interviewed me so far, but...ugh. My current benefits are pretty damn good (generous PTO and amazing healthcare), and while I know people will tell me to take my employer's word with a grain of salt...I don't know. I really, really want to trust them, and they've been true to their word thus far.

I don't want to seem ungrateful. But I feel like there are some red flags (the PTO, the company culture) that are too big to ignore. I guess I'm trying to justify it to myself--money isn't everything. Don't get me wrong, I *am* broke 70% of the time, and the offered job would fix that, but...at a high price.

To my fellow job seekers and working people of the world--solidarity forever. If nothing else, my story is a reminder that you genuinely never know what's going to happen. Two weeks ago, I'd never heard of this company, and today they made an offer. It may not suit me (and I may be agonizing over it), but if it happened to me--a true-blue Joe-Schmoe--it can happen to you, too.

Wish me luck, and please tell me I'm not an idiot if I decline this offer..."
0,2022-12-10,I just got promoted at work but I don't deserve it but people keep telling me otherwise...,u/throwawaylifeat30,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zhkim5/i_just_got_promoted_at_work_but_i_dont_deserve_it/,jobs,"TL;DR: Its my first job. Been with company for 2 years. Boss promoted me. I do not deserve it tbh because I failed to complete any task on a previous important project (that tech lead left the company) and I also severely lack critical technical knowledge to do my job competently (my degree isn't even related to my field and everything I've contributed to, so far was learned on the job). I feel that I severely lack critical information to make important decisions and competently contribute to technical discussions (I'm always silent/quiet during meetings). To be honest, many coworkers have already seen my incompetence and that has shaped into them mistreating or being condescending towards me. Example: one of the principle engineers doesn't even give me technical tasks. She tells me to do stuff like ""come into office today so you can meet with me at the IT center and show them how my laptop can't install this one program but your laptop can"". And her body language towards me is always very negative/condescending. When I talk to her about some technical stuff, she scowls at me while ""listening"". But with anyone else, shes very nice. My tech lead (another principle engineer) will only give me bug fix tasks to do and almost always give me the answer. He ignores my opinion and expects me to do exactly as he says. Other engineers (coworkers) treat me condescendingly...(i get the sense they don't acknowledge or respect me at all...)

But when it comes to my boss, hes like ""I really like how sincere you are and how much hard work you put in. You're responsible for this important task. You're going to do X,Y,Z tasks. A couple of months from now, you're going to be responsible for this large project. I want to see you speak up in meetings. I want you to show me that you can go beyond just doing the work you're assigned (which you're already doing well). Once I see that, I can start assigning you much bigger tasks that you will be responsible for.""

To be honest, I don't know what to do. He has big expectations of me. Honestly, its a huge challenge and I don't know if I can meet it with my current technical knowledge and skills. Like, I need a couple of years to catch up to everyone else cause i'm the one who lacks technical knowledge and experience the most. And I can't even contribute to these important discussions because I don't know sometimes what people are talking about and why they chose a certain design (what were the other choices?). Maybe I can possibly measure up if I were to devote all my time to learning all this stuff in and outside of work.

Feels like this whole situation will eventually blow up in my face. What do i do..."

How do I search successfully and actually get interviews?",u/TwistedViper007,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zhm8u3/laid_off_from_last_job_doing_horribly_with/,jobs,"I am running out of steam and hope and don't know how to help myself at this point. I could really use some words of advice, even just job titles to help.

Tl;Dr 33 year old US resident who used to teach, burnt out. Found a great job in Chicago, laid off due to lack of funding. Lost on what job titles to look for, can't get interviews for jobs I'm interested in despite a professionally revised resume, running out of steam and hope and probably unemployment. Any suggestions on what jobs to find that are similar to Data Analyst?

So way back forever ago I got my degree in Education K-12  cause I am a pushover and everyone says I would be great at it. Long story short, got so burnt out that I almost had to be hospitalized so no more of that hot mess. Jumped to good service gig at hospital in late 2019 and those following years were a HOT mess for obvious reasons. Got a remote job in Chicago as a Relationship Manager for a company that helps clients to get their students, faculty, staff, etc. with different forms of covid testing in 2021 (being vague due to HIPPA). There were phone calls (ugh) but I flourished behind the scenes as support for my clothes, including making a database with up to date information about procedures, resources, etc., made for sheets and reference sheets from scratch, amongst other things. Sadly they had to shrink down the department due to lower funding from the CDC and, sadly, I didn't make the cut. They were fantastic enough that they essentially paid me two months to do almost nothing but job hunt. 

Now it's December, three months into unemployment, and I've had a grand total of three interviews that didn't pan out and several person's throwing offers at me in education despite my saying I'm never going into that field again. I am *definitely* not managerial or leadership material. I've had my resume looked at and revised by a professional and a reliable HR representative. At this point I'm so lost in how to make my situation better, and for how to find what I'm looking for in a job. I know someone is going to say that I shouldn't be picky, and I'm really trying not to be. I just cannot do education anymore. Customer service actually disabled me with arthritis so I can't be on my feet without a cane anymore. I don't have a car and definitely can't afford one.

I apologize for the ramble, I hope that it's providing at least some context for the issues that are blocking me. The listings that I've seen (and was passed over for with a job just this morning) was of a remote position for Senior Data Analyst; essentially a background support person in pharmaceuticals who input data into specific areas, gathered and compiled information, and so on. (edit: I was asked to apply for this interview, I don't otherwise go for this high a position)

I just like working with information and helping my team out; I don't need or want anything glamorous, I just need a job where I can pay my bills and be at least a little comfortable. I'm just exhausted at this point.

Can anyone at least make suggestions on what kind of job titles I should try looking for? Any tips on how to look for what I need? I need help and I don't know how to ask for it or what to do. Again I apologies if this is long winded and not helpful, I'm just at the end of my rope here. I'm more than happy to answer any questions."

Instead, the manager said I could start on the 4th January, if I want to so I can have time to return to the UK.

But now I see there's going to be a strike at some UK airports (including the one I have a layover) and my airline warned for severe delays and even the possibility to change flights for later. Should I ask the employer to change the offer date for a few days later, after they've changed it once before?"

Turnover is incredibly high and even more so now, due to our latest supervisor being ridiculously toxic. She doesn't actually know how to do the job, badmouths employees, micromanages everything, and never offers praise for a job well done. Just generally kicks her employees down and sucks the life and motivation out of everyone. 
Anyway- I've been dealing with a lot of mental health issues for the last few years, and have finally found a treatment plan that's working for me. I just returned to work, but have been on a different crew/shift temporarily. I've loved every second of the work day on that crew, and have felt so at ease, and competent and PROUD of the work I've done. 
So I've realized just how detrimental my regular crew/shift and supervisor is to my mental health.

The Office used to seem absurd but now it seems like a barely exaggerated documentary.

I've now been part of three outwardly reputable organizations, and each time it's been the same shit from a different bull; stilted interactions, brown nosing, humble bragging, power tripping, schadenfreude ... everything is strategic everything is unnatural...it makes me sick... I feel like grabbing certain colleagues by their thick skulls and screaming 'Wipe the plastic smile off your unctuous face and be real. Just for once. Stop trying to subtly sabotage me, grow up and tell me what your problem is so we can work through it like intelligent adults'. I understand many (perhaps most) people are probably feeling the same way, and yet we play along in this corporate farce.

I suppose the recipe for this urinal cake was there all along;

1. Take an assemblage of glorified apes who aren't exactly friends - in many cases competitors - and shut them in an unnatural environment for half of their waking life
2. Add stress, exhaustion, frustration, disappointment, indignation etc corollary of any job
3. Add all the foibles, stupidities, vices, shortcomings, mental illnesses etc of the individuals
4. Throw in a pinch of shameless groveling, nepotism &amp; cronyism, and proverbial though sometimes literal dick-sucking
5. Mix some putrid innate cravings for drama, politics and power
6. Strain it through a colander of hypocritical pseudo-professionalism

And there you have it. Best served with a side of therapy and SSRIs

At 27 I feel too young to be this bitter but surely some of you must feel the same way?

Edit: I'm working in an outdoor job at the moment which drags when there's inclement weather but at least I'm either by myself or with a small team of likeminded people and its far less soul destroying than working in a corporate office.

I'm sure there this doesn't apply to all organizations, at least I hope not

I've recently landed a very sought-after job in what I could only say is a ""Dream Company"" for me, but in a Student Position. I'm a B.A Graduate, and I decided to pursue M.A to land a job.

I'm in the Social Sciences field, where the concept of ""employment"" is often unreachable.

The Company I work for is known for hiring students for Business and Administrative positions quite frequently, and some are even promoted to Full-Time after a few  years.

I was thinking about the concept of a ""Perma-Student"" until I get a full-time job at the Company, and would like to know your thoughts about this - would that be feasible? Do you know of anyone who does something like that?

Universities in my area offer Academic Programs that can spread over 5 or more years, and I'm thinking about taking those offers just so I could stay inside the company until the offer for a Full-Time position comes along.

I'm traumatized from the Government Sector, where, in my Country, a student can only be employed for 4-5 years max. My current employer, however, doesn't seem to have that limit.

What do you say?"

It was 1 mile of walking plus 2 1/2 hours on the bus each way. So it was HARD. I stayed dedicated, and pushed through the first 90 days. Also they told me average people in my position bonus out 2k a month on top of the base pay. I was so excited! Well, none of it was true. Pretty much nobody in my department bonuses at all, and if they do it’s $200, maybe. I was like okay that’s fine, at least it’s work from home. 

Well it FINALLY comes time for me to work from home, I get set up, and perform better at home. I am happy! Then, a week later I get a call from my boss saying they are raising the metrics we have to hit to stay work from home. It went from 50% of our goal (which was totally attainable if you work hard enough) to 75%. That was fine, it would be hard but I thought I could hit that. But no. They also RAISED our goal higher. So now to get wfh I had to be basically hitting what my full commission goal was before. They cited “we want our company culture back! Pizza parties and donuts in the break room!!” 

Ugh it just makes me feel so upset. I finished my month there but I found another job. I’m really hoping this one stays wfh. 

Idk why companies think employees want pizza parties. I would rather wfh and be happy and comfortable. Idc about pizza and I doubt anybody else does either.  I won’t lie after they told me all that I just gave up on the job. I feel so lied to and duped. I put in all that dedication for nothing."

2,2022-12-10,How to handle micromanaging project manager who ignores my boss and even the president,u/lilyxxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zhydwo/how_to_handle_micromanaging_project_manager_who/,jobs,"I am a manager. At my company we have a set of deliverables we need to meet based on a contract with our clients. My team and I have quickly done our work, save for one last item. It was agreed upon by the client and project management that we’d do the last deliverable the third week of January because we are so understaffed that my team is being pulled to help other more urgent projects.

One of the project managers is all of a sudden not happy that we can’t do the task until January. She told me it looks bad that we worked so fast and won’t be doing anything for weeks until middle of next month. I brought her concern up with my boss (the director of my department) and the president (the owner of the company). They shut me down and told me that my team needed to help the other teams, and that the last task is not urgent. I let the project manager know, and she just can’t accept it.

I asked her if it was because of a billing schedule, as in if we hit this milestone we can collect the next check. She said no.

I asked her if it was because the client is asking for it. She said no, the client is fine with the timing. But she’s not.

I asked her if there was any other reason why she needed this to be done the first or second week of January. And she just kept repeating that it looks bad we finished the work so fast. She’s complaining that now she has to “trickle” the deliverables to make it look like we’re constantly doing the work.

For nearly two weeks now, she has personally asked me and sent junior PMs and another director from a different department to ask me when I can do the last task. I’ve repeated multiple times that my boss and the PRESIDENT want my staff to work on other things. I’ve asked my boss and the president to talk to this PM, and they have. But guess what? I’m still being approached daily about this last task. It feels like borderline harassment at this point. I’ve expressed to my boss that I’ve become exasperated.

It came to a point where I asked the project manager point blank if I was too efficient with getting the work done. She quickly told me that my team is doing great and such a good job. She just doesn’t want to “look bad” that we won’t be doing this last task EVEN THOUGH the client is ok with the third week of January.

I almost want to go to HR to tell them I’m being harassed. If my boss and the president of our company can’t stop this woman, what do I even do?"

I was the only person that coul do anything for the first 8 months, so I completed 12 projects by october and the other two hires hadnt done much anything. One guy had only completed 1 project.

This resulted in my boss putting me on all the projects.  I didnt not mind this at first, but we got behind on one project and my boss promised the client daily updates and the person who was supposed to send me the data to put the together the daily updates would not send it to me until 5pm at which point id normally work to 8 or 9 and would not be doing half the things that we really should be doing.

It went on for two months.  The other guy dissapeared for 3 days. And then on thursday at 4pm. My boss tried to send me the entire backlog of work.  And i pretty much said this is bs, i want hr involved.

&amp;#x200B;

Theyve put me on another better project and have said the right things. but i worry i was labeled as a problem employee.  But, considering i did so much more work than the other new hires, I think they would be undersanting.

Also, we had a project recap and my boss each time blamed it the issues on the other people and was direct about it.

&amp;#x200B;

but i wasnt flawless but i was a workhorse this year. the removal from the staffing sheet is worrisome though like hiding my work on projects maybe?.thoughts?"

Just wondering, are “programs” worth it career-wise? I genuinely don’t know anything about the field and the title/insight I could learn would be very good. I’ve also spoken to people who did the program who ended up moving up in the company or just moving elsewhere.

How would it work if I wanted to leave though? Let’s say after a year or so I decided I don’t want to stay in the role or if I wanted to move would I be able to quit or am I bound to the program? And if I’m bound…what’s stopping me from just not showing up/underperforming and getting fired (i know the risks of burning bridges)

Except now I would have a ChemicalTruck2000 (cleaning cart) alongside with me. I would also have my own scrub office where I could plug in a small TV and chill during breaks. I would also be some kind of ”Keymaster” that could access the darkest of dungeons in the building.

Lastly I could listen to music with headphones while working, which is great since I get things done faster with music. Can’t really do that as a cashier which I work as right now.

I currently work in an MRO facility working as what apparently is a ""Production Engineer"" but I feel like anything but one.

To keep the rant short but informative.. I am developing severe anxiety from my 1:1's with my manager. Not because the work environment is toxic or he's not a great manager... but because I'm developing loathing for my work but have no clue what my options are in my career in terms of where I can land and the type of work I could be doing. I still think it'd be a total waste to abandon what I thought was a valued engineering degree but I'm noticing others with BA's somehow getting tech oriented roles that I would kill for.

This role told me I would be working with CAD design and tech drawings but I have yet to do so, haven't even been provided a cad license yet, and am mostly working on KPI's and coding reports. I even told them how much I hate coding.

Funny thing is I had mentioned this in my interview and yet I'm still finding myself doing it. It's making me anxious everyday because now I slowly feel like my work is being measure on my coding/software engineering ability but I don't know how to get out of it. Furthermore, this opportunity I was hoping to prove myself to be able to request more money come my evalutation 2 mo from now.. But apart from my ""KPI tasks"" I only do random offset tasks that feel outside of engineering work. So now I don't even have a leg to stand on for negotiating because either i negotiate in regards to my ""coding work"" or on the work that feels like anybody else can do.

&amp;#x200B;

I want out from a job that isn't motivating, fulfilling, or educational... workload is high, and the pay is really low as an engineer."

My (now ex) husband came along and swept me off my feet. I won’t waste time on the details, but basically he convinced me I’d find a great job in his country and I moved overseas to be with him. We got married…and suddenly I was forbidden from having a job. Or my own friends. Or any activity that took me away from him for an extended amount of time. If I disagreed with him he’d get belligerent and sometimes worse. The best I could get was him allowing me to go to grad school. Please don’t give me a hard time for being an idiot, I’m already kicking myself as it is. 

I finally left him and returned home. But now I’m trying to get back into the workforce, and my heart is breaking. No one will hire someone with a 3 year gap on their resume, will they. And how do I even begin to explain myself? “I followed a man overseas and thanks to my bad judgment I’m now unemployed.” 

How can I tackle this? How do hiring managers look at someone like me? Please don’t tell me I’m a lost cause, I’m already feeling a bit broken.

ETA: Thanks so much for the suggestions and kind words. I was always told that employment gaps were death for a career, and hence I never had one before. I’m feeling much more reassured reading all the replies, sorry I can’t respond to every one but know that I appreciate all of them."

I have recently been promoted to title Investigator 2 at my state Department of Labor, HR Division. I conduct EEO and Ethics compliance investigations. Before this job, I was working as a field investigator for the Wage and Hour Division within my state Department of Labor (three years of experience). 

Besides having a bachelor's degree in criminal justice, I also have some certificates such as Certificate of Completion for Basic Training as a Wage and Hour Investigator, MD-110 Compliance Training - Chapter 6, and Certificate of Completion: The Law Against Discrimination Training. I have started my master's degree in public administration this year, as well. I am interested in becoming either an Affirmative Action Officer or an Affirmative Action Specialist.

So here’s the story, after an eye opening evaluation with my company, I decided it was time to see what else is out there. To my surprise, I got several interviews right away (work in tech). My first choice job fell through and honestly, I think it was for the best simply because it wasn’t something I knew well and I’d be very overwhelmed at first. So after being sad for a few hours, I focused on my second choice job that I was set to have my second interview with in a few days time. That interview went amazing and after a weekend full of anxiety, I got the email inviting me for the final interview request. That interview went just as well and when I was given a salary number, I countered. And I countered high just hoping I’d be meet somewhere in the middle. So after another two days of nail-bitting anxiety (omg I countered too high, they’re going to rescind the offer, they offered it to someone else) I got my actual offer and it was for the entire amount I asked for. So after I cried for a good 30 mins and called my spouse, I accepted. 

I still cannot believe it’s real! I’m going to be putting in my resignation soon and I’m not excited about that part, but it is what it is. 

My spouse and I have been busy getting my work from office together. I cannot wait for my new adventure 

Moral of the story, you’re worth the higher pay point! Counter and negotiate! 

Oh and just to add, my second choice is now 100% my first choice and I’m very happy with how the cards landed"
1,2022-12-10,Background Check,u/dankuin,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zi9ebn/background_check/,jobs,"Hi All,

I have an ongoing background check and they asked me the reason for separation.

My answer was like I was suspended because I was told I will either be called back in later or to be terminated (which is true) due to below reasons:

1. Arrangement was not made as promised during the interview process (arrangement = WFH. I worked on site only and finally asked them to lay me off, but didn't mention this to the verifier who questioned me)
2. Not enough exposure to the tasks I needed for my designation

And now he's asking me these two (I didn't answer them yet):

* Elaborate on the reason I was suspended

I asked my previous employer to terminate my employment so that I can apply for an EI which I did. I also got a severance package from them but the Termination Letter &amp; Release And Indemnity forms specify that I cannot disclose the details to others unless it's my spouse or law enforcement

* Reason the employer gave me termination

Because I asked them to.

Any advises please on how I should reply to the above?

A couple of positions on my resume have 2 to 6 months of discrepancies, but the org &amp; job title are correct. I was once fired due to performance, but I put contract for reasoning. I suppose they would've found out, but don't know if they're gonna ask me about it or not.

Any tips will be appreciated, thanks!"

In the meantime I found a different job because I wasn’t sure if they would give me an offer or when I would hear back from them. For context, I have only been working at my current job for a few months so I’m still fairly new if that matters. 

The new job wants me to start the week of the 20th and I was already told I had a 5 day window to report to my new job. I didn’t have time to put in 2 weeks at my current job, so I was wondering how do I resign on such short notice? Should I explain why I’m giving short notice or should I just tell them my last day will be at the end of the week and leave it at that?"

I’ve been here about a year and was promoted after 3 months to a supervisor position because I caught on quickly and was able to train new hires efficiently as well as problem solve and figure things out on my own. I work in billing for American Airlines for their credit card team. The operations manager had gotten promoted to an account director position and I interviewed for it. I thought my interview went great. Afterwards they tell me they went with an outside hire due to her having more experience than me. Okay. She starts and SHE SUCKS. She probably only came to work a total of 3 times in her first 2 weeks. She puts no effort in to learn the job and just forwards all of her emails to me to deal with for her. I brought this up to my boss and he said I just don’t like her. Which is not true, I have no problem with her as a person. I have a problem with her pushing off all the work on me, never showing up and her making an extra 25k more than me. I brought this all up to my boss and he said I am very young (I am 23 but I really catch on to things quickly and do a great job as well as have near perfect attendance) and when he listens to me he puts his head in his hands in such a patronizing way. I really had plans to grow with this company and I feel like performance and leading by example is the way you should choose leadership and they do no agree apparently. Is this a normal view?

Another note, this is a nonprofit, so they don’t have a Fortune 500 type budget. 

As for the current offer, what follow up questions are appropriate? The healthcare plan is fine but I want to know who the provider is and would honestly like to see a full detail of the health benefits, is that okay to ask for?

I also want to know more details about the PTO, sick leave, and paid holidays. Like what are the parameters for using sick leave vs PTO? Are the paid holidays flexible? (Aka I’m Jewish and don’t do Christmas). Are these valid questions to ask?

Circle back to now and I've had a good job for nearly 5 years but I've been passively looking at other positions. Ive interviewed well with 5 employers already, coming to a 2nd round with two of them. But then I get the email about being passed over.

No indication of background check was mentioned but if you Google my name the front page includes old articles about the incident. 

I've done all I can with being active on other social networks but I've been unable to bury this content. 

Has anyone had any luck reaching out to newspapers or other media outlets about these types of articles? I'm not asking to delete the content but rather hope to get a ""no index"" on the article so it doesn't appear on search results pages.

I’m only at the restaurant 2 days a week.

My one coworker, is constantly treating me like garbage. She slams plates in front of me. When she gets a dinner order for me to cook, she throws it on the table, instead of hanging it up, like she does for everyone else. If it’s my turn to wash dishes, she will purposely leave the dishes pile up in the back room, but would never do that to anyone else. She glares at me from across the room. 

I have absolutely no idea what I did to her. I mind my own business. I haven’t done anything to that crazy woman. Certainly nothing that could cause this terrible treatment. Other coworkers see the way she treats me. They’ll say “Oh my god why is she looking at you like that?” Or if she slams a plate on the counter for me to wash they’ll say “Don’t let her treat you like that”

Now here comes my problem…after the dinner rush is over, she will try SO hard to be friends with me. Today, she took an order for me to cook, leaves it on the back table, doesn’t say a word, but yells when I don’t cook the food. She would NEVER do that to anyone else. I was Stern and told her “You bring it to me, or it’s not getting made. I’m not paid to read minds”….THEN when the dinner rush is over, she walks up to me, smiling, and says “what a crazy dinner rush”. I just walked away. The behavior is only towards me, and I have no idea why. 

I then got reprimanded by my boss saying “You can’t just ignore coworkers. You know she’s going through a lot.” That’s not my problem or concern. I’m there to do my job. I would NEVER bring my problems to work, and treat others poorly. 

I understand you’re supposed to treat people with love and compassion, but that’s hard when you’re getting glared at from across the room. It’s hard when you’re singled out From an entire group of people, by one single person

Her attitude and behavior is pushing me to the point to where I just want to quit and be done. I don’t know what else to do other than ignore her, yet stand up for myself when needed. 

What do I do in this situation?"

The injury was a broken ankle that never healed properly due to working through it and it gets hard to stand or walk sometimes.

Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated."

In the first call with HR, they told me the pay would be £50k to £55k a year. After I had 7 interviews in total, with 6 different people, and one in person to see the office, I got the call from the recruiter to congratulate me on getting the job. However, when we started talking numbers, the pay went down to £42k a year! Not even close to what we initially discussed, and I have mentioned it over the phone and also followed up on email.

I was told he will TRY to get me the best offer possible. How is that even legal for them to do? I went into all these interviews, prepped for all of them, stayed late since 3 of them were calling from California, with the mindset that the pay is what they initially said…

Anyway. What do you all think it’s the best course of action in this case? How should I approach this in terms of negotiation?"

Having a discussion with my partner about a job they got an interview for. The job is for a non profit and they are asking as the first interview that he run one of their events for 5 hours, unpaid. This would then be followed by a sit down interview. 

I personally think it’s very odd that they would want him to run a 5 hour event as the first interview before event sitting down with him. To me, this seems like a an easy way for them to have continuous free work by “interviewing” people year round and then passing on them after the free 5 hours of work. If he had a sit down interview first and then they expressed interest in hiring him but wanted to see him “on the job” as a test, I wouldn’t be so suspicious of it. He isn’t sure if he should pass on the interview or not. The pay different between current job and this job isn’t life changing. 

So, would you take this interview without a guarantee that they’re even interested in offering you a position? Or do you think it’s a scam just to get free work??"

I turned the offer down the first time because I wasn’t really looking to totally move away from the job I had previously but I wanted options. And then worst case scenario happened and I needed to move quickly. I was apprehensive but I needed a job and it was fine so I took it, but this company is not a good fit for me and I’m miserable. It’s a small company so it’s very clicky I’m not getting the workflow very well and I think I need to look for other options. But I have been friends with the person I recommended this company to me for a long time and I don’t know if they’re gonna be totally understanding. My mental health has taken a really big downturn (not that a ton of people can tell I don’t think), and it’s really affecting me. on top of this possibly ruining a friendship I feel really weird about moving to a different job that I started so soon. I wouldn’t be leaving them in a bad position I mean I don’t really do much anyway. I feel like I’m more of a liability at this point than anything. and they’re bringing somebody else and really soon that’s worked there for a long time and is just moving positions. I just have a feeling this could get really messy and I don’t know how I should handle this.

I have family telling me kind of different things but there biased obviously. I would just like some outside opinions maybe I’m being too hasty looking for a new job maybe there’s a better way to handle this I don’t know."

There are four of us, not including my boss. One lady put her 2 weeks in last Monday and I just found out friday that I got the position that I applied for elsewhere. This leaves only two people left.

My boss is going on a vacation for two weeks in January and I feel so guilty because I won't be there to help work court with the other two employees. 

I don't like this job. My boss is not a nice person and she has caused a headache for everyone in this office. She is very conniving and rude and people that work here don't last very long here. 

She plays favorites and if you are not her favorite, you're screwed. This job also doesn't pay very well for the amount of work that I do. 

Once court is done, me and another co worker process all of the files. Well, this co worker is friends with our boss, so she gets out of helping a lot. 

Another thing I hate about this job is the evaluations my boss gives out. You can do an amazing job, but she will find many negatives and give out low scores. 

She also doesn't like that me and another co worker are friends. She told me last week, that ""she can't control who I am friends with outside of the office, but she can control who I am friends with inside of the office."" 

The new job pay significantly better and from what I am told, the environment of the office is the complete opposite of what my current office situation is. 

Even with all of these negatives, I can't let go of the guilt that I am holding. I'm giving my 2 weeks on Wednesday because that's when my boss will be in. I feel like that I am letting everyone down and I feel like a terrible person."

I doubt I will hear back from either interview before I start this job. But I guess my question is purely hypothetical -  if one of these jobs gives me an offer after I start this position, how unprofessional would it be of me to abruptly quit after starting? Would it come back to bite me? I’m not sure if I should just cancel the interviews or still go through with them. 

Any advice is appreciated."
0,2022-12-11,I was blindsided by a PIP,u/art2690,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zizh5q/i_was_blindsided_by_a_pip/,jobs,"Hi. I want to share my story to the group to potentially help others get out on top from bad employers.

I used to work at a local government job for 2 years. I was happy with the pay and benefits and had every intention to stay until I retire. I also want to point out that I have mild autism spectrum disorder but am also high functioning. I always did my work well and never neglected any duties. One day I got blindsided and put on a PIP by complete surprise. I was told that I didn’t have enough attention to detail and had to improve on that which now I realize is a subjective matter. A PIP is short for Performance Improvement Plan for those who don’t know. 

So essentially it was an ultimatum to improve my work within 30 days or potentially get fired. Maybe my autism spectrum disorder took me longer than average to realize they were just wanting me gone, but I was naive and sincerely believed that if I worked harder it would make them happy. I spent the next 30 days busting my butt to work harder and be even better. Each week I had meetings and was criticized about something different each time, many of which were subjective matters. Looking back, they never had anything good to say to me, which should’ve been another red flag that I now realize but at the time my autism spectrum hindered me from detecting that. When I reached the end of the PIP, I was completely devastated and felt betrayed when I was told I still did not the requirements of the PIP and that further disciplinary action would be taken up to and including termination. I outright asked my manager what the disciplinary action would be and he was vague and said he would have a meeting with upper level management and HR. 

At that point I felt very threatened because I have a wife and 2 kids and a mortgage and many bills to pay. To put things bluntly I may be in the autism spectrum but I’m far from stupid. I knew then I needed to start looking for other jobs but I was acting too late and needed to buy time. I know it’s a long post but keep reading as there will be a light at the end of the tunnel.

Although the autism made me more naive from catching signs that I needed to leave, I decided to use it to my advantage. I immediately went to HR first thing in the morning, explained the situation, and told them about my autism. At that point that threw a hurdle in front of them as now they had to figure out reasonable accommodations to remain compliant with the ADA and not get sued for discrimination. A few days later HR told me that the next step would be for them to figure out the reasonable accommodations and then put me on another PIP with those accommodations in place. Okay, at that point I knew that all this was doing was buying me time. They would’ve done that just to say that they tried to make it work and avoid a lawsuit. I applied and interviewed for different jobs.

One month later, my boss gave me a formal write up over a subjective matter. He was definitely trying to work his way over the ADA hurdle to eventually fire me. Since I had already gotten rejected by some jobs I interviewed for I was afraid I’d be stuck longer with the organization. So to protect myself, I filed a formal harassment and discrimination complaint with HR against my boss. From a little research I knew that HR would be obligated to conduct a formal investigation, and even if they took my boss’s side in the end that would’ve at least held him back from doing anything else to me for some time or that would be considered retaliation. 

Funny thing is, two days after the write up I actually got another job offer for a better salary somewhere else and then I put in my two weeks notice. I was friends with my coworkers so they were all in the loop the whole time of what I was going through. They ended up finding other jobs too and leaving at about the same time I did, some shortly after. A few weeks after I left I found out from my coworker still there that my former boss had gotten demoted after the conclusion of the HR investigation. While I know that revenge never solves anything it felt very satisfying that although he tried to screw me over, I was at a better job while he got demoted.

A lesson for all you people reading this, if you’re blindsided by a PIP just take that as an advanced notice that you will get fired and look for another job. If you need to buy time, think of anything you have whether it’s autism, heart condition, diabetes, ADHD, etc. Anything that the company would not want to risk being accused of discrimination.

The position in question that I'm attracted to is in another department, requires a 2-15 Life &amp; Health Insurance certificate, and is a meaningful bump in compensation from my current position.

I have already reached out to our head of HR and contacted the recruiter about details on what they specifically need from candidates. As far as the certificate, I was discouraged from obtaining it before getting the offer. My company does reimburse continuing education courses and certificates.

I've never made a lateral move within a company, so I'm not sure what I need to be aware of as far as etiquette, protocol, what I can leverage as a current employee, etc.

711,2022-12-11,I'm leaving an emotionally abusive relationship... do I notify my boss and HR?,u/stixy_stixy,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zj0lip/im_leaving_an_emotionally_abusive_relationship_do/,jobs,"I have only been at this job for three months. I broke up with my emotionally abusive ex at the beginning of December. We are living together until the end of December because I needed to give notice and find a new place to live, plus he has nowhere to go (no family support, no friends, no money). I supported us financially for the entirety of our five-year relationship, so he has nothing.

Things were amicable-enough at first but now he's panicking and it's getting worse. If his bad behavior continues, I am afraid my work will be impacted until I move out. I don't want to risk my job over this. I work remotely, if that matters.

For example, he woke me up screaming this morning. Saying he hopes I get lit on fire. He hates me. He wants me to die. I've taken everything from him. I've ruined his life. He wants me to die a horrible death. I'm the worst. 

Then he said he is going to drown our cats and kill our dog. Then he said he is going to kill himself. It is so much to take, even though I know it's only temporary. 

His words and behaviour leave me emotionally drained and crying. I fear I won't be able to perform at my best at work.

My boss knows we broke up and that I am moving, but he does not know that it is an emotionally abusive situation.

What do I do?

--------------------------------

*UPDATE*: I didn't reply to comments because he fell asleep and then so did I. His mom texted me in secret and said, ""He doesn't know I'm texting you. From your point of view, how bad was today?"" I don't know what he told her, but I told her what happened and ended it with, ""If you're going to tell him I told you this, please tell me first so I can get out of here."" I plan on leaving this week - I'll be staying with my family. My mom is renting a truck so the big things can be moved tomorrow. But she did say, ""The most important thing in there is you."" My childhood babysitter was murdered by her ex husband when she left him, and I keep thinking about her. I don't believe my ex boyfriend would hurt me. But it's not like he's going to announce it, right? I even asked him if he's planning on killing me and he got angry and mad and said, ""That's what you think of me?"" My brain is all over the fucking place. How did I get myself in this situation? The thing is, once I move one thing... everything has to go. And I think police need to be here, because if he is going to hurt me at any time, it's when I'm leaving. Thank you to everyone for opening my eyes to the fact this is more about my safety than it is about my job. I've gotten so used to his abuse that everything he said this morning simply hurt my feelings, it didn't set off alarm bells. And that, folks, is why I believe people stay."

I am now back in a position where I am able to go back and finally finish my graphic design degree. I applied for over 40 jobs and only one called back, but while doing the skills test at their office, the owner who does the interview needed to leave due to a family emergency. I passed the skills test but as the owner left no one could do the interview and was told they would call me when she gets back. That was a month ago now and safe to assume I did not get that job.    


Is there anything I can do to stand out more? I have a portfolio, and my college's career center looked at my resume and helped me make it better.

My idea was since I only work 160 days out of the year, off by 2pm each day, no weekends and in a place in my career where I do not bring much of my work home, is getting a remote job where I can work asynchronously in the afternoons, evenings and weekends. My question is, is that a reasonable expectation? I see that most remote jobs I find require you to be logged on at certain times. Nothing I find really fits either full time or part time. 

I have a bachelor's degree, 2 master's degrees, and experience in business management outside of education if that helps. I know a lot of people suggest sales or ad making. I just do not have experience there. Thank you in advance for any guidance."

Need job advice.,u/NoLeather2174,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zj8xqu/help_need_job_advice/,jobs,"So I just started a new job at a company and that company just acquired its biggest competitor. We had a meeting with the senior management team and while in the meeting they spoke about the merger of both companies and how it was going to go. 

They said that there was definitely overlap in terms of jobs and that in 6 months' time the company would be conducting individual evaluations of each person in each role and ""keep whoever was performing better and is the best fit"" and whoever they did not choose would ""move on to their next challenge"".

I am freaking out because I just started this job a month ago and they are already talking about layoffs. I am trying my best but there is a learning curve to starting a new job and I can't help but be scared that they are going to keep the person who is doing my job at the other company because they have been there longer.

I have been laid off before and it was one of the worst times in my life, and one of the reasons why I took this job was because when I interviewed with the hiring manager and VP I got the sense that this was a role that was relatively 'safe'. Now I really don't feel secure at this company. I also feel misled because this was not information that they shared with me in the interviews. (My coworkers who are also new to the team have the same fears that I do.)

Why would they hire a team of brand new people if they may end up having to lay them off in a few months' time? Am I overreacting? Should I look for other jobs? I really don't know what to do! All I know is that I don't want to find myself jobless in 6 months."

I had been at that last job for four months. Before that my prior job ended *last year* and I had to take a lot of time off due to health reasons. I'm afraid of looking unreliable or like a job-hopper, and I'm not sure if I should even list my most recent job on my resume.

So I’m not too sure if I’m supposed to post here about this but I’m going to go ahead. When I got into high school I was ridiculed by the principle and counsellors for some reason they didn’t like me, I had a lot of health problems so I was bullied not by students but by the staff, life sucked from grade 8-12 I had little to no motivation and missed a lot of school that I could have probably showed up for, not because I’m lazy but because it was ruining my life. I played tier 1 soccer for all of it and was really into sports but I still had no motivation, maybe I could have been somewhere if I pushed myself but I didn’t know how. My family are the most amazing supportive people but even they were tormented by consistent calls to child services it’s like they tried to break apart my family or just ruin my life. They wouldn’t let me go on field trips or anything even with decent grades. Grade 12 came around and I actually early graduated with honours and with some of the highest grades in the province but as I decided to do online school through the school, the councillor would still make my life a living hell through the grade and I was promised I’d get to graduate with all my friends even though I did the online school, in the end that was a lie. At graduation I was embarrassed in front of everyone not aloud to actually go do the festivities, the principle yelled at my mom for no reason and she started to cry because we were assured if I did the online school I’d be aloud to graduate with my friends. It seriously tore me apart dealing with all that in high school. I’m 25 now I’ve worked odd jobs in construction through BC, Canada but ever since high school I don’t have any passion, I have gone through severe anxiety and depression and have gotten help but I still feel scared to look forward to things and find aspirations… I’m here now because of that reason, how do I find something I’d be interested in? I’m scared to go back to school because I was going through torture in high school… my biggest question is what do I do? How do I find a career path."

That area has to be cleaned and redone.

We've been closed since Tuesday and we're not going to open back up until the 19th.

There is another cafeteria but there's no openings down there since they're overstaffed.

They're giving us the option to either take time off without pay, put our PTO into the negatives, borrow time, of if they can find any openings in the cafeteria they'll let us know.

I honestly think they should give us some type of incentive or hazard pay since this was not our fault.

3. Determine how reliably I can get or from to the location in nontraditional hours, on the off chance I have to work overtime

My friend says, ""get a job, then worry about how to get there after the fact."" Another issue at play is that if he's rented out the room I would be staying in if I got the job. So if I accepted the job, I'd be sleeping on his couch for weeks... which doesn't afford me any privacy.

Things got kinda desperate and I had to recently accept a job offer for a shockingly low pay. I just graduated a few months ago and I just need a job to cover rent, honestly. I’m really holding out for those other positions though. Is it worth checking in with those other two companies that had rejected me?

1,2022-12-11,How to ask for promotion now that team has grown significantly?,u/maythefifth,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zje7ad/how_to_ask_for_promotion_now_that_team_has_grown/,jobs,"Hey y’all

I joined my current job at a small tech startup right out of grad school (it is my first real job) and within a few months, I was made Engineering Manager. Back then I had a team of 3 junior engineers. Now, roughly two years on, the team has grown to \~ 20, with more than a few PhD level engineers. I am also managing four staff engineers (in my company staff engineers and engineering managers are technically at the same “level”)

Over the last two years, my responsibilities have drastically increased in complexity as well (if not scope) due to the much larger team. I feel like I should be promoted to reflect this change. Why I was made a manager with so little experience is beyond me. I guess I am good at corralling people towards accomplishing a task, setting clear objectives, and connecting disparate threads, although my methods can be a little rough around the edges. 

I guess I am wondering what is the best way to ask for a promotion in my case? I am not super confident arguing that I have grown a lot as a manager or my performance has improved significantly, as I still have a lot to learn. I was hoping to argue that a promotion would allow me to comfortably delegate more responsibilities to the staff engineers and focus more on our long-term strategic priorities. 

Any specific or general advice would be very much appreciated.

I was reviewing my company's policy for Covid-19 sick leave, and I'm a bit puzzled by something. The policy states that they don't accept at-home testing, but the testing sites in my area ask patients to provide self-administered swabs. What is the difference with doing a Covid-19 test at home versus self-administering a sample at a testing site? Are the tests at the sites more accurate than the at-home tests, hence the reason why my company won't accept at-home tests?"

I don't do anything in my job description and I do gopher tasks instead. I've been trying to get out for awhile but I had several failed interviews this year and no calls for employment outside of my employer despite my efforts. 

I just recently got a new supervisor who sat down with me and heard my concerns and now wants me to do the work in my job description on top of some of what I still consider my gopher tasks. I just explained that there are some hard days and that I wasn't very happy with what I was doing, but I never out right expressed I'm trying to leave. There's been several people in the building who have come up to me and acted excited that I would finally be doing what I got hired to do. But I have an interview tomorrow for the first time in months for a role at another building, but now I'm afraid if I get the job it would be poor timing/reflect poorly on me. I'm about to go on a short break all the way through new year's and if I get this new job there's a chance I'd go to the new building after the break instead. 

I know I need to think of myself first and do what's best for me because I don't think I'll be happy no matter what (the commute sucks, the hours suck, etc). I can just only hope they forget about me real fast. If you were in my shoes would you just not care and continue pursuing an exit? I feel like I missed my opportunity to tell the supervisor I didn't like being there at all and it's going to be whiplash if they get an e-mail saying that I've moved on.

Thanks for reading."

Read on if you need context, but my main question is this: how to negotiate a large salary jump before receiving an offer letter from another company? Or is that just unavoidable?

This past year, due to inflation, I’ve seen quite a big jump for territory managers in my region salary wise, not sure if any commissions have changed. I have read everywhere that if you are in the same job for 3 years, you’re probably underpaid. 

Other territory managers that also work for this company have varied salaries. Some much lower than others, mine is higher than theirs, even though I haven’t been there as long.

This new job could be a 15-20k salary jump potentially, with the same commission pay.

If it was all about the money, no brainer. But the new gig has its drawbacks, that are somewhat dealbreakers for me.

I haven’t asked, but figured it is tougher to request that large of a salary jump without anything to stand on? Other than obviously your current sales results. I am worried this potentially ruins a good relationship with my boss potentially by going this route also?

Wanted to hear anyone experiences, thank you!"

He's 63 and I'm 22 we are both men. We work in the pizza department. He makes AWFUL pizza. I would rather eat frozen. I'm serious.


He micromanages the crap out of me when he's not even a manager. He has to know everywhere I go, what I'm doing, who I'm talking to, who's on the phone. I can't interact with a single customer without him walking up to me and talking to the customer whether it's to ask a weird question to the customer or to tell the customer something about his life they never asked. He sometimes will shout accross the department at the customer. I just wanna make their salad or warm up their slice and let them be on their way. Like why does he have to make everything so annoying? He always tries telling me what to do. He always acts like the boss. Like last night, we normally close at 8 and it was quiet so he wanted to leave early. So he said he wanted to ask the store manager if he can shut it down early but he knows I wanted to stay until 8 and he said ""I don't wanna cut your hours"". I was like, bro just go home. He's so annoying. I try to ignore him and be nice to him every day. But when you're working with this guy EVERY SINGLE DAY for 8 - 12 HOURS and forced to because it's basically just me and him running the department, it can be a tiny bit stressful. I tried saying something to HR, they don't seem to care. My boss doesn't like him either but my boss is a non confrontational guy so he doesn't do anything. No one really seems to care, I been there longer than him. I worked in 7 different departments in that store and next month will be a year I been there. Yet this is what I have to deal with. I almost wanna just walk out and quit during rush when I'm the only one there. I hate working with him so much. He does nothing right and gets mad when you try to tell him a certain way to do things. It's his way or the highway. 

How do I deal with a person like this?"

I started out very excited and wanting to learn as much as I could, and normally I give 110% to my work. This is the first time I've worked in a sales position, so I have the potential to earn more $ the harder I work and they just gave me some accounts to earn more $.

I haven't had a single commission since they changed the quota structure to be based on weekly vs monthly now even with accounts I'm not hitting it.

I was told I basically do the most client communication in our entire department, and also got glowing reviews in my annual review but they eliminated annual raises for my department, so I've basically just been working my ass off for nothing. 

I'm trying really hard to get myself to care about this job. I'm still in school and care a lot about that, and care about everything else. I've stopped working outside my work hours, which isn't great since communication with clients is important.  I don't care about learning the ins and outs of the company, which could make me more effective but I honestly have no motivation to. I literally never get upset or frustrated by difficulties at this job bc I don't care about any of it. 

I've thought about asking to switch to a different role w/ less stress and less pay but not sure. I normally am in very dynamic hands-on jobs and this role of basically just repeating the same thing every conversation for trying to get someone to  use the service is driving me crazy.

I've started looking for new jobs but I wonder if this feeling will pass or maybe everyone feels like this at some point with sales? Just not sure if this is normal"

The day after, my direct supervisor called me saying that she thinks it was a mistake to let me go and that she'll speak with senior management to try to bring me back. Just a few hours ago, she informed me that the company is willing to bring me back, but as a contractor instead of a full-time employee. I'll be getting further details tomorrow. 

My head's spinning because I'm not sure what to do. It seems like I have two options:

Option 1: Accept the offer and return to a company that just showed me the door. Will likely be awkward, and I won't receive any benefits due to being a contractor. Also, the environment was kind of toxic. However, I'll still have a somewhat steady stream of income.    
Option 2: Reject the offer, take the 6 weeks of severance, and go all out in finding a full-time opportunity. I also have a side hustle that's providing me with a fairly small stipend. The obvious downside is that I won't have a steady stream of income, but it's not like being a contractor brings job security. I can easily get let go again in a couple of months. This time with no severance

Would appreciate any detailed insights on what I should do or how I should make this decision."

This company is really big and I thought I'm going to meet my team and get a brief of onboarding so I can grasp what should I do on the first place.

When I join the microsoft teams call, I thought I was going to be with handful of people (maybe 3 or more). But there's is only 1 person inside this call. She welcome me to the company and I was thinking ""oh maybe this is just some random call about welcoming me into this company""...

Shockingly, Without any onboarding process.. she told me that I'm the only one with the UI/UX role in this company. She start instruct me to open an existing company website that work in fishing industry.

She told me that ""this is your project"" and I thought ""aah.. I'm going to fix this website interface"" but.. I'm wrong, she wants me to make a dashboard full of something that I don't even know.. And the worst part it.. She told me to make it in 2 days, the worst part it.. When I started to ask about the concept.. she just briefly told me ""its up to you to think"". I'm no fisherman so I don't even know about fishing industry..

I'm so dumbfounded right now, In my last job.. There were 5 people in the division.. we create to concept together through UX Research discoveries and brainstorming... But right now, it just spontanious and she asked me to finish this in 2 days..

I say this, because part of my current role is to write up test summaries (what I tested, how I tested it, evidence of this, outcome etc) per ticket - perhaps too detailed for the liking of my Sprint Manager - which as part of my role I do actually enjoy. 

Unfortunately, I don’t know anyone irl who has worked as a technical author so I don’t know the positives or negatives of said role and the future career opportunities available following some experience under the belt.    

Could anyone who’s currently working as a technical author or has experience of previously working as one please advise on the role and what they do/do not enjoy about it and the possible career opportunities available. 

I understand opinions on any role are obviously subjective per person, but any advice and or guidance would be most welcomed. Thank you"

The problem is that I don't know what to choose, I have so many interests in life. For example, when I was a little boy at the age of 6 I really liked planes, every time my family flew I always read about the type of plane and how it works so I thought of becoming a pilot and two years ago I really got into the matter of computers and how they work. And at school last year I did a course on medicine and anatomy and it also really attracted me. So how do I choose, or rather what are the criteria for the field you would like to work in for the rest of your life?"

When I look at the jobs market for similar im getting paid well for my skills.  


Anyway i've now been promoted to a semi managerial role.  


I wouldve wanted a 20% pay rise but they offered only 10% with a review in 6months.  
The wording used was - we have spoken to hr and can only offer 10% with review in 6months.  


I said i'd think about it and would get back.  


So TLDR :  
Been given a 10% pay rise while I dont feel im amazing BUT also I' told to always ask/negotiate for more and meet in the middle.  
 Is it worth the friction/ monetary pressure of high pay to ask for more here?

I’ll make this brief. 

I have now worked for an engineering firm for roughly 5 years. 
I was recently promoted and went from hourly to salary. 
I was told the wage change was to take place at the beginning of next year. 
However, the wage change went into effect this last pay period. I feel this is a huge burden because my last two weeks have been a huge push with 30 hours overtime. The huge push was me trying to clear my plate before next Friday. Me and my wife are expecting our first child next Friday and I had multiple deadlines set for last Friday. Which happens to be the end of the pay period. So I can’t help feeling shorted a week prior to my first kiddo and one of the last pay periods of the year. 

Am I wrong here? 
Is this normal? 
Should I have done something different?

I feel like I asked the correct questions regarding when the transition would take place. It seems I was asking the wrong individual. When you have 4 bosses how do you decipher which one knows what? Lol. 
The difference in my hourly check compared to my salary check would’ve been $1,800.00."

It's a good job, pretty comfortable and decently well-paying considering it's my first job, but it's nothing out of the ordinary, and it's in a line of work that I don't really love (I'm a lawyer, and this is corporate law. While I'm not killing manatees or anything it's not what I want to be doing the rest of my life). 

A professor at my old school recommended me for a job a very long time back (about six months) and it's, by all means, a lot better than my current job. It's focused towards human rights and public law, which is the area I liked best in college; it's a lot better paying than my current job; and, while there's a lot less options for wfh or virtual work, I think it's an acceptable tradeoff. I also know a lot of the team working there and it's an amazing work team, while right now my team is pretty small and not that great. Therefore, it would seem like switching jobs is a no-brainer.

However, what I'm running into a wall with is that I don't know how to notify my current employer. This came out of left field so it's not something I could be leading up to or suggesting. Furthermore, my current boss is leaving his current position for one on an international scale, which means that, were I to leave the company right now, it would essentially have no legal department until a replacement could be found. My boss is a very nice person and an amazing boss, and while I know that us leaving is neither my problem nor his, I'd feel bad knowing I'm making the transition harder.

I know I can't put my happiness on the backburner for a company that can and will replace me in the blink of an eye, but I feel a bit bad leaving the company with a mess in their hands. What should I do or tell them in order to best manage this situation?"

I’ve only been here a month and don’t even have it on my resume because it doesn’t relate to any of the positions I am applying for (still training). But if they ask if I’m currently employed, I can’t say no because if they run a background check they will see it. 

I have an interview Thursday and like I mentioned previously, I left my current place off of my resume because it doesn’t relate to anything I want to do/doesn’t add any necessary skills for this position, and I’ve been there a month.

I’m in a specialized major and there’s not much salary information online regarding my major, especially the country I live in (Canada). I just graduated and started working in a major company 

When they asked me what salary I expected, I said a low salary and they offered me that amount. It isn’t until now, when I realized how difficult the job itself is, I was able to meet other alumni in similar companies and roles, who’s starting wages were 5-6k higher. 

Obviously I can’t ask for a higher wage now, but I think this company has really good benefits + work life balance, plus co workers seem really cool.

However, I’m wondering if it’ll be appropriate to negotiate a higher wage when it comes to the one year mark or my performance review? I don’t know the best way to do this… I’m very new to the corporate world."

I've told my boss this and he's very understanding/supportive (this amount of notice is common in my type of role). This role has very generous PTO so I have not used all of it and some amount of it has accrued. I'm quite content with the PTO I have planned to take off in the next three months, but I would end up with a decent chunk of PTO remaining. When I asked about the cash-out option when leaving, he told me it was more beneficial for me to use it before I leave. 

I'm confused, if I'm happy with the PTO I have planned to take off between now and then (several weeks off), why would it not be beneficial for me to have some extra money before starting my next role? I would end with \~82 hours of PTO, wouldn't that essentially mean I'd be paid for an extra two weeks of work that I didn't do? Am I missing something? Does my boss just want to save money and not have to pay me that extra salary?"

They will bring me on full time salaried for a bit more money than I am making now. I am debating on taking this position if I am offered it because of the current job I am in. I work through a temp agency for a much larger food science company and have been doing so for about two years. My boss has been fighting hard to get me a permanent position but the company is in a strict hiring freeze and are not even filling vacant positions. I have received two significant raises during my time here and have a good chance of being hired in a company reorganization in January as my boss will be forming a new team and taking on more accounts. My dilemma is that I could really use the bump in pay and benefits of the new permanent position but am wondering if it is a mistake to potentially lose a start at my current company that could offer more professional growth in the future. My brother is adamant that the permanent position is better as I can just apply back to my current company the next time I am searching for a job. Thoughts?

Issue: I now got a job here and in my resume I didn’t specify where I work location wise, just the company and the title (and they never asked me to confirm so I didn’t lie, just left it open to interpretation). What I did lie about is my salary because I wanted more négociation power, as salaries in country Y are low in comparison (but high for that country, think Eastern Europe vs western). I don’t know how this would affect my application as I was already given the offer and signed it. Do I provide my actual payslips and edit the amount to make it look like the amount I said, but then they would see the country and maybe that opens me up to other questions? How bad is my situation? Would they care if it’s another country or it’s okay as long as I prove I worked there? My friends are conflicted they say that these background check companies only care about proof of employment to where you worked and don’t really care about where it was but I’m not so sure. Obviously it looks more I guess prestigious if I would work for a major hub in a big European town rather than a smaller office in a smaller town which is what I currently do.

I (M25) have been working with my current company for a little over 2 years now.  Small physician-owned laboratory doing STD testing.  I have recently been interviewing for a few larger companies.  I have made it to the 3rd round of interviews for a Quality Assurance position that I think I would really enjoy.  Also, I have a shoo-in position at a local hospital that has basically already been offered to me.  Here is my dilemma: 

The hospital job is 2nd shift and they are going to offer it to me next week sometime.  If for some reason I turn down the 2nd shift job and don't get the QA position then I will still be at my current job.  My current job is pretty nice I get weekends/holidays off, it's 1st shift, and I have a lot of pull.  I really enjoy my current schedule, but the job is pretty basic and I feel like I am never going to really develop professionally here.

I am terrible at making decisions especially when it comes to my career.  Would taking the second shift job just to get more access to professional development be worth it?  Should I just stick it out at my current job in hopes that a promotion is on the horizon?  Should I just hope for the best with this QA position and say screw working 2nd? How should I handle the interview process knowing that I will most likely need an offer from them next week?

PS I have a great relationship with my current partner and she just got on a M-F 9-5 schedule.  Would taking a second shift now be like a middle finger to her and our relationship?  How would you all handle this?"

It is an upholstery internship and I was hoping for an awesome experience, like I had in February at an internship that was paid. Now this woman invited me because she needed someone and she makes nice things, so why not.

But it isn’t as awesome as I had hoped. Three weeks have passed by and haven’t really been able to develop my skills. She basically lets me do the dirty jobs. Pick up things from the postal office, let’s me do dishes, but doesn’t do any herself ( to the point I need to do it because it’s all fuckin dirty ), doesn’t clean after herself, but gets all aggressive when I don’t do it 3 seconds after I’ve finished. Basically just treats me as het butler; after that you can pick up that. Do this. She doesn’t really instruct me well or makes sure I understand it, doesn’t check me and gives no feedback.  She just gives me a task, explains it in her chaotic way of explaining, gets mad if I don’t understand me; why are you making it so difficult for yourself, just make it easy for yourself; look; bla bla bla. She doesn’t make sure I do it well or understands it. And during work, THEN she criticises me, AND THEN come the handy tips. Neither does she compliment me afterwards, just no feedback and no compliments or whatever that could give me some type of enforcement to better myself or any reward.

Sometimes in the middle of the conversation she literally makes me wait to talk back to her because she decided to go on her phone. Like wtf?

I’m normally someone who doesn’t mind being exploited if the person is an awesome teacher that truly wants me to develop my skills and does things for me too ( it’s giving and taking ). But this woman can only complain and says she doesn’t feel like doing certain tasks, but then makes me do all the shit she doesn’t feel like and I get zero out of it. For example; she says often she’s too lazy to remodel foam rubber. She needs to do it, because it is perishing. She’s just kinda negative &amp; there’s nothing really that makes me excited to be there for free. I’m really feeling like I’m just being used, so she can do all the fun stuff, and I can do all the dirty shit without any compliments, feedback or reward. She does receive money from two stools that I reupholstered. Why is she acting like a Anna wintour that is too broke for giving compensation? 

How can I be more assertive and not afraid to refuse tasks to let her know to stop exploiting me? Thanks a lot, I’m really frustrated on what to do. Unpaid internships are btw legal in the country I’m in, but I feel like being exploited shouldn’t be a part of it. Particularly with a grumpy whining mentor that doesn’t do shit."

They didn’t post my position until late October. 

The first week of November I told them that Nov 30 would be my last day. I was asked to stay through a large event I was responsible for the first week of Dec. and I eventually agreed to that.

They waited a long time to get someone in to interview and with a new hire’s open start date, etc. that person wouldn’t be available until after my last day.

They’ve asked me to put together a proposal to come back and train my replacement. My former job was demanding of my time and emotional state and I went though a lot of loss in the last year and needed to get out of that environment. I’m annoyed that they didn’t put effort into finding a replacement earlier and are now scrambling for help, but I also feel that I put so much effort into building my departments and I want someone new to have a chance of succeeding, especially because I know how difficult that job is with zero training/support. Plus, I still care about my old coworkers and want to help ease a messy transition.

So I’m willing to help out(paid of course) but don’t know what info/parameters I should put into a proposal to train someone? This would likely be considered contract work and I’d get 1099’d. I am taking some time off before a new job so doing this wouldn’t jeopardize a new position or anything."

Long story short I'm a civil engineer with 1 year working experience and I want to do something else with my life. I know that engineers can usually work other jobs in very different fields and still be somewhat desirable because of the degree but I'm not sure exactly what. If anyone has any experience, what are examples of different careers and jobs I can look into that I would have the chance of getting hired in as a civil engineer. Things I would value in a job are it being fairly social with a good amount of teamwork and collaboration, something exciting and fast paced and potentially spending some time not in an office or on a computer (I know this is gonna be hard to find). Also, preferably I wouldn't like to go to grad school to get another degree.

Y being an MSP provides staff to a Financial Firm IT Dept who needs me on team next year as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Anything i can do to negotiate Y to pay 26 under fulltime ?

&amp;#x200B;

PS- First IT and contract position so no clue about this stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank You"

I'm  currently working as a Logistics coordinator in a warehouse for 1.5 year. Feeling a little bit stuck and need an advice on how to move on. Summary below is the job description.

SUMMARY:

Utilizing Warehouse Management System (WMS) best practices, the OSC coordinates order allocation, replenishment, and the flow of inbound and outbound freight throughout the warehouse with a focus on accuracy, quality, and efficiency.

I applied to position A back in November and before I got an interview or anything of the sorts, the recruiter and I were exchanging emails and they told me the budget is $45k. I had to accept that number before I could proceed with an interview and I tried to negotiate via email but they were firm and said that is what is budgeted, so I declined.

Fast forward now that the NYC Pay Transparency law is in effect, I recently saw two new opportunities at this company for the same position A title with a salary range of $45-65k. I reached out to this same recruiter to note my interest and would love the opp to be considered and they emailed back stating that both of the roles’ salary is $45k.

How do I proceed from this? What’s the whole point of putting the range for salary if they’re going to keep that $45k number? I want to negotiate but I can’t even get that or an interview unless I accept that I’m ok with 45k. Any advice would be great, thanks!"

Please help me nail this upcoming interview I have. I am in a weird situation jobwise. Sorry for the long post. I will gift you a potato at the end.

I worked at a company (Company A) for about 6 years, but left due to high turnover, high stress, no help, and I was basically doing 3 people's worth of jobs. The work environment was toxic, and towards the end I started feeling like I would rather be anywhere in the world than here. I could also sense that Company A was a sinking ship, so I looked for another job - same level, same position, but it seemed liked this company (Company B) had its shit together. 

First three weeks at the new job went fantastic, and I thought I was making progress, and then BOOM! I get the news that my old boss has been let go from Company A due to ""difference of opinion with corporate"" - whatever that means.

Can you guess where he got his new job? At Company B! My old boss is my new boss! All the stress and toxicity came with him. Not only that, he brought with him, other employees from Company A, a few of which were the prime reasons for me leaving. He has already made changes so he can run a tight ship. For example, everyone at Company B usually has lunches together in the breakroom, and chill for a little bit. But he has put a curb to that. There are other changes he is making on how the jobs are run, and I can see that the work culture here is going to turn into the same one as the old company.

I have been at Company B for about 4 months now, and I don't think I can take this shit anymore. This was supposed to be my chance to build my own relationships. But it's the same stale old shit.

So naturally, I began to look for jobs elsewhere. I found one, and the phone screen and personal interviews are scheduled for next week. I really like this job description, even though it is at a lower level than my current one. I feel like this will help me stress out less, and I am also in a position to take a slight pay cut. But I figure that the recruiters may have the following big concerns;

1. I am applying for a job at a lower level than what I currently do
2. Just four months at the new job might not reflect very well.

How do I put a positive spin to the answers to those questions without telling them the sob story I just told you?

Thank you for reading. Here's the promised potato 🥔"
2,2022-12-12,I hate my job and I can't wait to quit soon.,u/throwaway18someday,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zkbgep/i_hate_my_job_and_i_cant_wait_to_quit_soon/,jobs,"The place is understaffed and they barely train before expecting the same level of productivity as workers that have been there for years. 

The manager is a lady that's been there for ten years. She was supposed to train me but it wasn't even two hours before she told me to quit following her in the nicest way possible and left me to do busy work. That was the way it was for three more days, then they left me the keys and told me to call them if I needed anything. I had no idea I was closing and told them I didn't want to, but they assured me I'd be fine and they took off. Since then, I've only ever done the basics I've been shown. I'm always left alone, even when they assure me someone will be coming in later. 

Last night, the busiest night of the week, the manager drops everything as soon as her shift ends and says the girl that was supposed to close with me last night isn't coming tonight either. But that some guy that helps her sometimes is coming to help me close. I'm skeptical, so I tell her I'm not doing additional work until he gets there. She hears it, but assures me again he would be there and to get everything done. Oh, and that it's his first day. I tell her I'm in no position to train and she assures me I won't have to.

I call the owner and ask when the guy is coming because of how busy it is. I say I'm not ok doing the additional work alone. He says not to worry about it. He says he'll call the guy. I accuse my boss of lying to me about closing alone all of the three weeks I've worked there. He says it's not intentional, promises it won't happen again, and asks me to please give him the phone number of the guy he'd just assured me he called earlier to check when he was coming. I'm still getting in additional orders and start putting them aside for the next day.

The boss calls a little later and says the guy isn't coming but someone else is, a nice lady I work with that can't speak any English. Great! She gets there and I understand her to say to leave the additional work for her and the manager today. We talk mostly through Google translate, but I ask again if we should do any orders and she says no. I ask if we should clean and she says no. So, we close up and that's that. 

I'm off today but I went in for my check. My manager is mad I didn't do the additional work. I told her the boss said not to because the guy *she* said was coming never showed up! She says he couldn't have said that! She said she's done ten orders by herself and that I should've been able to too. I tell her to talk to the boss about it and leave. Not only that, the boss says he hired someone new so I won't close alone anymore. I'll probably have to train her. GREAT!

I'm quitting ASAP. My coworker who bailed on all of us did what I was going to do, she just beat me to it. Now I'll have to spend however long stressed out about this job and I just don't want to deal with anything or anyone anymore."

I reached out to my contact and asked what was up and he told me I accepted an interview, did not show up, and HR could not contact me to inquire.

I never received a 4th interview email, did not accept, and no missed calls from HR. I went through my phone log and email. I was checking religiously daily.

When I mentioned to ex-co-worker he said “Sorry man, I don’t know what to tell you. Check your SPAM folder ” Maybe email my Manager and show her proof and explain your situation.

Am I wrong to be angry at old friend/former co-worker?  I know if it was my referral and that happened I would have checked on the person to see what happened. I would have gone to my boss and explained for him. I’m not asking to give me the job just professional courtesy.

thanks for indulging my curiosity! I am a 30(M) with a bachelors degree in Human Kinetics, I got laid off due to covid when it started and since then I started working as a Forest Fire Fighter in the mean time to help me get back on my feet quickly!  


I'd like to branch off and find a more stable career in an other field but i am at a loss when it comes to finding what field my skill set could be utilized. I have 9 years of Personal training/strength coach experience on top of that.

Has anyone ever transitioned from the fitness field into other field if so how did you go about it? if any one has some ideas for me I would welcome it openly! I am getting a bit overwhelmed as to where i should be putting my focus!"

The job itself seems only so-so (accounts receivable specialist) and the salary negotiations revealed a bit about how they do business. Add to that a less-than-stellar benefits and PTO package and this job has “Mid” written all over it. However, I’m exhausted and there’s no good news in the job market. It feels like it’s just going to get worse. I also want to quit my current food service job like you wouldn’t believe.

I figure that maybe some sort of apprenticeship or training program that guarantees a job afterwards (so long as you pass etc etc) might be a good idea since then you also get skills. The issue is, I’m not entirely sure where to look.

I cannot do hard physical labor on a regular basis. I’m not too disabled to work but I am too disabled for my body to be able to handle that on a regular basis without being in extreme agony barely able to move for weeks after. If a job needs me to do some physical stuff here or there, it’s no problem— it just can’t be a major and unavoidable component of a job. Otherwise, I am truly open to apprenticeship or training programs in anything. I’ve found a few in tech and sales, but they’ve got very mixed to negative reviews. So basically I am not sure where to start looking for these types of programs, but I wanted to know if anybody knew of any that are considered reputable in any field that don’t have abysmal reviews. 

I’ve done a ton of different jobs and volunteer things. Retail, volunteer archaeology lab work, PR/events for an on campus club, various activist things, food handling/bartending, office work, social media management. When I say I’m open to anything as long as it won’t physically harm me by forcing me past my limitations on a regular basis, I mean it. I’m in the northeastern US but open to relocation. I am very flexible as long as it’s something that could give me good work skills and a job after that’s stable."

expat here.
I recent got to salary analysis stage on last Friday with one big MNC company.
they asked for current payslips, pay breakdown and expected salary.
Current - 4000 SGD/month
Expected - 7500 SGD/month

I got managing experience back at my home countries at big MNCs and graduated from a reputable UK university.
I grabbed my first job at low pay of 4000 given the 30-day visa.
Now this position is managing position so I asked for a jump.
They asked for payslip with bonus and by today, it is 2-days already and no feedback yet.

I forgot to input ""Negotiable"" in expected salary.

1) should I follow up and add ""negotiable"" term or
2) should i just wait?
3) or make a phone call to clarify with HR

Normally how long does it take for offer letter to come after sending payslips?
I want this job so bad. thanks in advance, guys"

I am deciding to make a career change to financial analysis across the country with my girlfriend. Mainly because the amount of money I could potentially make at my current job, does not compete with the happiness I would have making less money in a different area. 

My boss is the sole advisor, I am essentially doing analyst and administrative work as his right hand man. There are a couple office assistants/secretaries that could cover my workload. My boss has given me a great opportunity and has taken me under his wing. We have a pretty good relationship although he can be quite condescending at times, along with his way is the only way. He is the type of person to tell me how big of a mistake I’m making, and will never make as much money as I could potentially make if I stayed. He has also mentioned if one of us quit we won’t have the opportunity to work for him again. 

I have already received a few interviews and plan on accepting an offer between now and the next few months. 

My biggest concern is him lashing out and treating me terribly until the time I leave the job. We are located in a pretty small population and I do not want to leave them short staffed or in a bad position. But also don’t want to make my life hell up until the move. 

I am 100% confident that my girlfriend and I want to make this transition. 

I’m probably overthinking this, but what is the best way to go about this? The fear/anxiety/guilt of letting him know my plans to leave has been daunting to say the least. I would greatly appreciate any insight that you all may have. Thank you in advance!"

They specialize in a particular niche of the healthcare market, and they expanded into the USA by buying out a large network of clinics that had sites all over the US, but were headquartered in Florida. They still run the American branch out of the Florida corporate headquarters. For a little background, that Florida-based company had declared bankruptcy after about 50 million dollars worth of cumulative medicare fraud settlements over the course of a few years before they were finally acquired by the Australian company. A few doctors who were found to have been spending a bunch of money on fast cars, hookers and blow or whatever were let go, but the company is mostly intact, only now with a different name.

The people I work with here in California often joke about the “Florida mafia” when talking about dealing with the remaining Florida-based corporate infrastructure because everything seems particularly difficult. First it seemed like general incompetence. For example, the finance and procurement departments keep leaning on me to mark orders for supplies \`\`received” in the documentation system even though the order hasn't arrived, and then place the order again. I figured someone had dropped the ball and was trying to cover up their mistakes by making someone else say they had received it even if they hadn't. 

Next, there was a CCTV system that is legally required for a particular kind of procedure. The Facilities department who is responsible for this doesn’t actually employ anyone who works on CCTV systems, they just contract out to a company in Florida who then hires a local company to install the systems for any locations outside of Florida.  After the initial request, it took three months to get the new Camera system sent to the site, over the course of an additional three months someone would be scheduled to come out and install it, and then didn’t show up, they did this over and over, but it still hasn’t been completed, Now they say the hold up is that for some reason the payment for the installation didn’t go through. 

All the staff is flabbergasted that this thing that they were expecting to have fixed in a week has taken half a year and they are still operating at ½ capacity because they can’t legally use that room.

At another location, because the procedures incorporate radiological equipment (the same reason why they have to observe patients via CCTV from outside the room) there is a heavy motorized door made of lead and concrete at the entry to the room.  The motor to open the door stopped working. The staff called a vendor who works on that type of door to come out and give a quote for the repair.  Normally these kinds of quotes were approved by a particular person from facilities who now says she can’t approve them because her job function has changed,

The procurement department took over facilities (why would Procurement merge with Facilities?… they seem totally unrelated). Procurement controls the Purchase Order process. 

The whole thing is surreal: when you ask facilities to assist with a building maintenance issue they act as though they are on top of it, but then as you watch the chain of emails getting passed from one person to another in the procurement/facilities department for weeks or months and Nothing has even started to get done, You soon realize that they aren’t going to do anything and when the problem escalates to where it threatens people's health and safety or one of the doctors blows a gasket because these problems are preventing them from treating patients. The staff eventually ends up paying out of their own department's budget because the Purchase Order system won’t allow us to create a purchase order that will charge the facilities department.

Presumably when Procurement took over the facilities department they also took over the facilities budget, but now they push the expense of building maintenance onto other departments. Where is the original facilities budget going? It certainly wasn’t reallocated to other departments.  Now if the roof starts leaking water into the server closet, the IT department ends up paying to get the roof fixed with funds that would have been spent to upgrade outdated equipment.

Looking back on everything, it seems more and more likely that when orders don’t show up and we have to mark them received and then reorder them, someone is just stealing the money rather than placing the order. Why would they keep using that CCTV installer in Florida to do jobs in California when nobody shows up?  Why wouldn't they find a different vendor after the first few weeks of inaction?  Is someone getting kickbacks from that CCTV company, or are they just dragging it out in hopes that we’ll pay for someone else to do it out of our own departments budget like they are doing with the door.

I moved here for this job a year and a half ago, I really like this location. I bought a house at the worst time because it was also the worst time to rent. Relocating for another job really isn’t an option. I do a very specialized kind of work, and there aren't any other companies in my area that deal with my specialty, so if I am not working here, I’d be starting over in a different industry with a substantial pay reduction.

TLDR: I think parts of the company I work for are a criminal racket. I don’t know how much I want to risk getting fired for trying to fight these people or trying to blow a whistle on them, or if I should just hang on and deal with things until they eventually go bankrupt and get bought out, hopefully by someone who is better at rooting out corruption."

So I recently got a job offer from a big company, I start working in January. In my contract they specified that I am not allowed to work another job (Understandable) as the job is already demanding and it is full time.

However, I create content on the side, and my main goal was to monetize from it (I like filming too), so my question is: Is influencing considered a job? A lawyer advised me that it's a hobby that happens to create money, and my content is based on lifestyle, fashion, makeup etc... so I don't even reveal my job.

My question is: Can I do brand deals on the side? Or is it considered as a job?"

Yes, I'm looking for other jobs, but should I quit now? I absolutely cannot stand web dev and I'm not even that good at it, I feel stupid asking so many questions.

I have a bachelor's in business and I've had a string of crappy jobs in grocery stores, pool cleaning companies, hotels, etc. I always stayed entry level because I didn't want to work overtime or have a lot of stress, since I value work-life balance and enjoying my time off.

I found this job working for a travel company making $18 an hour. It's totally remote and I work eight hours a day and the work environment is really relaxed. I'm on the phone ten minutes per day at most, I am not micromanaged, my boss is super kind and is always there to talk when I need him, and he's even implemented some of my ideas. 

There's also not a lot of workplace drama, and when I make a mistake no one yells at me or puts me down. I also can tell my boss I'm taking off today and he's fine with it. I also have time to do stuff like clean, cook, wash dishes, etc. So overall the environment is great.

However, I don't want to be promoted. The next step is being promoted to a manager where I'd manage my own travel company, but I don't want to do that since it requires a lot of phone time and some overtime. The job also has high turnover, and our customers are (like everywhere, I guess) hard to deal with. 

Right now I'm in a good place mentally. I sleep and eat well, I have time for hobbies and friends, etc. My life is pretty stress free. I also have the opportunity to work on my laptop in other countries. I speak German and some Spanish, so moving to Mexico for a bit to improve my Spanish is a possibility with this job.   
But I realize I only make $18 an hour. My original plan was to stay here and then job hop to make more money, but I don't want to start a job I hate with toxic co-workers and a negative environment. Should I just bite the bullet and look for another job anyways? With inflation it's getting harder to live off $18 per hour., but I don't want to leave and hate my life and job. 

Would you stay in this situation or would you keep trying to make more money? Keep in mind I'm trying to work 40 hours or less per week and I am not into climbing the ladder. Any advice is appreciated."

1,2022-12-13,Becoming a retail manager (potentially area manager),u/TakeARainCheck,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zkwdzf/becoming_a_retail_manager_potentially_area_manager/,jobs,"I have over a decade experience in people roles, social care/service/retail/TEFL-teaching, and a UG in Sociology. Tbh I could potentially have qualified for area manager schemes off my 1st degree but it's been since 2016 and general impression is that graduate schemes are out of my reach w/o a refresher marketing management msc.

**EXTRA:**

Currently I was saving to fund my  way to a masters in Computer Science, I spent the pandemic learning to code, but I'm quite divided in that I really love customer service / marketing as much as I love programming (both have the element of being involved in person-system interaction and making that efficient), and my favourite part of teaching was lesson planning, so I can dilute myself into a love for the formulation of a client/service system in various fields. I recently took a role as a sales assistant to fund my degree and I actually love it- and can imagine enjoying going into retail instead.

**TLDR:**

What does it take to become a retail manager, how competitive is it and how to get into middle management? How competitive would a masters in marketing management make me as a 32 year old with ""people service roles"" experience when I graduate?

But I also see people who are brave, resilient, and grateful. Every day, I get to be a part of their journey towards healing and hope.

One day, I was taking care of a young girl who had been in a car accident. She was scared and in pain, but she was also very brave. She held my hand and looked at me with trust in her eyes.

I did everything I could to make her feel comfortable and to help her heal. I talked to her, sang to her, and even told her some jokes to make her smile. And when she was finally well enough to go home, she gave me a hug and thanked me for being there for her.

That moment, and so many others like it, is why I love my job. I get to help people every day, and that is a truly rewarding experience.

I know that not everyone has a job that they love, but for those of us who do, we are truly lucky. Let's all take a moment to appreciate the work that we do, and the people we get to help along the way.

Thank you for reading, and have a great day!"

I have TWO degrees - I put in the blood sweat and tears, paid my own way from my own pocket working 3 jobs to pay my own tuition, and get a double degree from a top tier university...in South Korea. 6 1/2 years I spent working on that. Korea University is one of the top 3 schools in ROK, the top 30 in East Asia, and ranked one of the top 100 in the world. Its programs are often compared to the prestige of Harvard. I'm an American, who was living in Korea, and I decided to stay and do my undergraduate there because I could afford to do it on my own, albeit with some difficulty. But now I have no debt, so that's a plus. But now I can't even get hired at a GAS STATION or a GROCERY STORE, when these places are so ""urgently hiring,"" let alone a basic 9-5 office job. 

&amp;#x200B;

And everyone keeps telling me because I got my education abroad and how I spent so many years (10 in total) abroad, immersed in a different culture and being multilingual, etc, will be something that helps me stand out in my resumes and interviews.   


If these places would just give me the opportunity to EXPLAIN, I would be able to provide copies of my diploma, transcripts, even get notarized form from an organization that can validate my international degree and its equivalence to an American one... and I'm applying to places that at the bare minimum require a High School or Associate's degree.   


I know my circumstances are unique - statistically, most born-and-raised Americans who study abroad do so for only an exchange or graduate school program. Has anyone else had this issue, or similar? How can I get people to not look at my resume so superficially and assume that I'm a foreigner or that my degree is invalid?"

Kind of what the title says. I have been trying to leave my retail job as a day shift salesfloor stocker for about 3 months now but after 100 applications and 10 interviews I’ve gotten no where and just straight up ghosted after interviews even if I reach out for feedback.

For reference im 23 y/o male living in a college town in Texas and have lived here 3 years. I dropped out of college after 3 semesters. I have a high school diploma. I have 4 years combined in retail experience and a bit over a year at my current job, but I’ve never moved up I’ve always done stayed entry level because moving up to management just never felt something I’d be well suited for since this field of work severely affects my mental, for reference I have panic attacks or near panic attacks weekly and have to go to the restroom for 5-10 minute deep breathing exercises almost daily during my shifts.

But I sort of feel in “the retail trap” to where all I have is a high school diploma and nothing but retail experience, and no money to go back for a degree or trade school certification, and with the negative income I make from my fixed expenses is something I feel holding me back as well.

I was mainly applying on indeed and interviewing for receptionist, admin assistant, bank tellers or anything that was m-f 8-5 office jobs as I was wanting something with consistent 40 hours with set shift slots and off days since right now I basically just get random hours (sometimes 25-sometimes 37) based on store sales, random shift slots, and random off days, sometimes consecutive and sometimes not. I’m not sure id enjoy an office job, but I just want a real job lately and not something like retail that feels so unstable and chaotic. 

Gaining better health insurance has also been a goal of mine as I’ve been wanting to be able to afford going back to see a licensed therapist and been having numerous physical health conditions come up as well in the past year that I’ve been putting off seeing a doctor due to lack of reliable health insurance benefit.

And I felt the only other option with no degree was manual labor jobs which I don’t feel well suited for either. I don’t have a passion or anything like that I mainly just have practical things I’d like from a job so then perhaps I could actually start saving for a better future or career help. 

I just feel I need something to change soon because my current job is really having me suffer to the point where my free time I’m just stressing til the next shift starts having nightmares and losing sleep. And I just feel upset over the fact that I’m trapped or locked in to retail and food service type jobs. Any suggestions or advice would be much appreciated."

BS in business admin/HR. The company I am with now was bought out and is fixing to move. With this move it adds over an hour to my commute and ultimately my job would be phased out as we are merging with 4 other companies. 

My gut says run. Within the last 2 months, I have started the process of job searching. I owe it to myself to be selective of course but the rejections keep coming in. More than one has stated that I was over qualified. Thanks?

Am I looking at the wrong sites? Using the wrong keywords? 

I have been in an office setting all these years and through the pandemic even. I would love to work from home/be remote. My little one is 2 and I feel like I'm missing so many milestones because I'm gone 9-10 hours a day. Not working is not an option. 

So ultimately the question is - is there such thing as a WFH job that actually pays well?! I'm in the $65-75k range currently and dropping down to what seems to be offered out there isn't going to fly. I'm great at what I do, I pick new things up fast, and love a good challenge.

I have been in search of a new job with better growth options and have come to a crossroads. Some background on me is that I graduated with a psychology and a criminology degree last December. I’m currently deciding if I would like to attend grad school or fully enter the workforce with no plans to attend for at least the next 5-10 years.

Option 1 (Novant Health) has great insurance, more growth opportunities within the actual company, resume padding and everyone is so nice! In addition to this, it is guaranteed 40hrs and it’s only Mon-Thurs. They offered me $15.45/hr, which is $1.55 less than my previous job. The job does not have any type of meal options and I would have to pack/travel for lunch. I have no experience in medical office work.

Option 2 (Starbucks Shift Supervisor) also has great insurance, but not quite as good as Op. 1. There are defined growth opportunities for my role, however it’s hard to get these positions due to external hiring. There’s not a guarantee of hours, however the manager told me that they avg. around 30-ish hours, but there are opportunities to visit other stores and help out for additional hours. They offered me $19.05/hr, which is $2 more than my previous job, and they also provide free meals. I have 3 years experience as a barista and am very passionate about the art of coffee and tea.


I had already accepted the Novant position when I received the Starbucks offer after interview about two weeks ago and not hearing a reply. I’ve gone through an intense onboarding process to work with Novant, and finish my last day today before I officially start on-the-job training. I’m so conflicted because I would love to work with a Novant as a company, but the position that I’ll have isn’t really in my field (patient experience representative).

Any thoughts or advice about how to make this decision?"

I wasn't too sure how much to request but read online that for this company it is very important to have a good starting sallary since there won't be any major jumps afterwards. So I told a number that is a bit too high for a starting position but to also have some negotiation leverage. (lets say told him 75k-80k)

He came back and said ohh way too far maximum between 60-70k, really can not go that high and just after the call tell him if I am still interested and send my CV,etc. with wage that I want.

On the call I was actually ok even with 65k-70k but I didn't say anything regarding that to not sound like I was obviously bluffing. How should I have handled it, I mean just saying ""ohh ok then I take 70k too"" haha?

Didn't email him anything specific regarding my wish to hold firm on the 75k-80k yet and haven't heard back anything after 24h.. should I write him in the sense of ""I am fine with the lower amount of 60-70k"", not write anything and wait or tell him something like ""had time to think about it and am fine with 72k (slightly more than ""max"")..

Lucky for them, I was. I’ve had bad luck with jobs this year and was over the moon that they reached out even after so long because this job was my original plan. Anyway, they ask to schedule an interview and ask for my availability for the next week. I give it to them and they say “oh actually i’ll be in another city then it will have to be the week after”. Alright cool that’s totally fine. Next week arrives and interview is set for tuesday. 4 hours before the scheduled time, boss lady emails me and says we have to reschedule for thursday. Annoying but alright I guess. 

Thursday comes along and I arrive 15 minutes early for the interview and the interview ends up starting 15ish minutes late. I’m greeted by the practice manager and a manager from another location. We start the interview and it went great in my opinion. I’m overqualified for this job so I wasn’t surprised it was a short (25 minute) interview. They seemed excited about me but cut me short when I started to talk about my availability, informing me that they still have many interviews to do. Well that’s a little annoying. Why pull my resume from 9 months ago if you’re conducting so many new interviews? Oh well whatever. Still figured i’d be in the top 3 at least. I mean it would be virtually impossible for any unlicensed applicants to have as much experience as me. They let me know id hear back soon but that the onboarding process can be pretty lengthy. I leave. 

It’s been 2 weeks now and I haven’t heard back. I desperately need this job. They knew how happy I was to interview and how hard I was ready to work. 

I decided to reach out to the manager via text message as she gave me her personal cell. She left me on read two days ago. The text said: 
“Hi, this is ____!
Just wanted to follow up and thank you for taking the time to interview me. I really enjoyed meeting you and learning about the job. I am definitely interested. I hope the interview process is going well😄 Please let me know if you need any additional information from me.”

Do you guys think i’ve been ghosted?

She told me about the company what it does, how it is, I told about my experience and what I want. I specified I want a Full Stack role with Java + React as I am comfortable with this stack and have experience in this.

After a couple of days I got email to schedule the first technical interview in like 2 weeks, I accept and was eager to get on with this. After a couple of days I receive a call to delay the meeting and have it 1 week later that what we discussed (First RED flag), I accepted and went on with it. The interview was difficult with questions from all chapters of JAVA development but I got a good feedback. I needed to wait to find a match for my stack.

3 weeks pass by and I message the HR for news, they reply ""we have a couple of projects but still gathering feedback"". After some time I forgot about this company as the HR stoped responding to me. In 30th November I got an email from another HR in that company about a possible project which sounded really good (New project from scratch, Java, Kubernetes, React or Angular for an investment bank), I said I want it. Next day was asked if I want to relocate to the capital ( a little weird as previously I understood it would be fully remote and the capital is more than 7h away from me), which I didn't want to do so. We scheduled the interview which was today (13 Dec) and was surprised in a bad way.

Interview was ok, a couple technical questions and after he started to describe the project I would feel a weird vibe that it doesn't match since they don't have front end and not a backend the way I was thinking, they were more on an integration application. I show him the document with job description and we agreed is not that (second RED flag). Contacted HR and she told me it was what she said. I didn't get it at first but after a couple of messages I saw that after I said I don't want to relocate the next email would contain another link for another position but no mentioning that it is another one(third RED flag). She said that she didn't receive any info regarding the full stack role which I wanted and that she sent another position because I did not want to relocate.

I didn't replied to her and was thinking of what to do. Like you can't ask me to set the interview but you change the link to another position with different stack without mentioning something about it. The quality of HR is going downhill a lot.

The only thing is, I've hit the ceiling in my role (maybe I could get up to 10k more in salary) but don't have much of an opportunity for further growth. There are days where the work doesn't really challenge me.

I hadn't really been looking, but I applied for an opportunity because the position/organization would provide an opportunity for growth and developing my experience on something pretty cutting edge and making an impact in my city. It would be a much larger but also reputable organization, and it does align with my values as well. It would also likely start at about $15k more annual salary than my current position (of $100k). But, I do believe it will be more challenging overall. Vacation may be less due to how long I've stayed with my current employer, but pension and benefits may even be better.

I've been through two interviews and I'm at the reference check stage. I'm not holding my breath for an offer but it could be a very real possibility. 

Would appreciate any advice or thoughts. Thanks!"

My current job is already very heavy on IT and PM as most of my job is about installing new IT solutions on the shopfloor for operators.

The avg. PM salary at my company according to Glassdoor 52k and the avg. salary for a PM in my city Glasgow is 47k.

The salary I've been offered is 42k on the phone and I had a brief chat with HR about the role. I believe the upper budget for the role was 45k on the job advert.

I mentioned that the salary is below avg. but they said it's because I'm new to the PM field.

Based on that should I still negotiate and what type of arguments could I use?"

I hadn’t heard anything back, so I mentally moved on and started considering other options. 

As soon as I crossed this employer off of my list, a recruiter called to see if I would be interested in an interview. He was extremely unprofessional, had said he had questions about my resume but couldn’t think of any when I reminded him that he had mentioned he had questions, and seemed overall flustered. Not a big deal as I’m aware most companies outsource their recruiting teams (I currently work in HR) and that this doesn’t necessarily reflect on the company. He told me a scheduler would be in touch to set up an interview. 

Three days pass and I never hear back from said scheduler. The weekend came and I managed to set the whole thing on the back burner. Monday evening rolls around and I get an email from this company saying I had a Teams interview scheduled the next day at 4pm. I immediately started panicking. I’m currently covering for another employee who leaves early, so it’s extremely difficult for me to leave my work between the hours of 3pm-5pm without two weeks notice. The email said to reply to confirm the interview. I replied and told the scheduler that I unfortunately would not be able to attend the interview and I would be open to rescheduling if they had the flexibility. 

The next day (today, day of interview), I hadn’t heard anything back. I assumed they had moved on with other candidates. I just received an email from the manager conducting the interviews asking if I would like to interview in person instead at the same time, but I can still opt to do a Teams interview instead. Now I’m really panicked. The scheduler must have never cancelled my interview and I don’t know if I should try to weasel my way out of work or just politely ask to reschedule. 

Is this a red flag? Would I be passing up on a potentially great opportunity if I don’t try to make it to my interview today? I’m not entirely desperate for a job and this is the first and only one I’ve applied to so far, but I’m unhappy at my current employer and this new position could possibly result in a 5k-10k pay increase if I’m offered it. I had a few yellow flags during the interviewing processing at my current employer, so I’m a little nervous about ignoring any potential red flags.

I had done internships in the past. So basically very new to job market. Since I have bit of free time as my studies are about to end and only thing left for me to do is to do my thesis. So I was thinking about applying for some part time jobs which could turn into full time career opportunities after finishing masters but before I could apply one of the company reached out to me with a dream position and kinda my dream company too but they want me for lot more hours then I wanted to work. They are paying decent. In the past, I had said no to some very popular companies for similar (not exactly) roles because of too many working hours to handle with my studies. 


But this time I ended saying yea because I thought I haven’t been able to find exactly what I’m looking for this is very close to what I’m looking for … it’s just with my thesis my life will be too hectic  for almost 6-9 months every weekend I’ll have to study for my thesis and even after work I’ll have to focus on studies … I know I’m capable of doing all that because  I have dealt with high stress durian but I’m still extremely anxious. On one side I’m scared about burnout on another side I’m happy that this will help my career  quite a lot in the next 5-10 years because I’m being offered an opportunity which is usually offered to people with 5-6 years of experience at least 

On one side this will extend my time to finish my studies by a bit but money will help me pay some part of my expensive tuition. 

Not sure if anyone ever been in this situation but is it normal to feel so anxious. Im usually not so scared but for some reason, I’m getting panicky about this whole thing"

My 1-year performance review is coming up very soon. Do you have any tips for a graphic design performance review? I have to write a self-assessment examining my role, accomplishments, and possible challenges throughout the year. Then I will meet with my manager to discuss my role. My manager will discuss with me and rate my performance, which I believe will then determines my salary increase or not.

I have done a great deal of work for this company and have worked many weekends (unpaid) to meet tight deadlines. I go above and beyond expectations and have done several special assignments outside my normal job role.

Additionally, during this review, I want to purpose to my manager my upgrading to a higher-ranking role. I believe I am more than qualified to be a Senior Graphic Designer. I am not happy with the initial salary I was given from the beginning. I know I am worth more and deserving of better pay. My goal is to be the Art Director but I am uncertain if that is too big a leap to ask. The company does not have a Senior Designer or Art Director position, I would have to suggest one to my manager. Another challenge in making my manager understand why they should open a new position for me, they are not from a marketing background.

Any advice, tips, or insight would be greatly helpful.

1,2022-12-13,How do you deal with a newly appointment manager?,u/AML214,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zl4bzs/how_do_you_deal_with_a_newly_appointment_manager/,jobs,"I was hired at my company 6 months ago by my manager to support their program. He had set his expectations for me to slowly transition into taking over multiple roles after a few months of training and shadowing other members of our team. Recently, He had been promoted within the past month and a member of our team had been promoted to fill in his role for our program.

My new manager held a position similar to mine previously so she understood how the program was setup and the asks of the client/other departments within the company. This is their first time leading a team and their expectations for my work and proficiency are a lot different from my previous manager's. Our director is concerned about where the program is headed and my new manager has been giving me flack even though I am forced to pick up new responsibilities without much training time. Whenever I get trained we have 2 sessions: On-boarding and Shadowing. During the Shadowing sessions I work on the tasks for the first time with her watching and I get patronized for making a mistake or forgetting something (typically these tasks are conducted bi-weekly or a monthly basis so I don't get much exposure to them). I review my notes and our On-boarding recordings to fix this in the future, but unfortunately, whenever I make an error that she has discussed once she repeatedly patronizes me and has made it a task on her work list to ""Correct my errors"", mostly in emails involving our director.

I have voiced my workload concerns with our director and she has flagged that I am taking on too much within a short period of time. As I am supporting a newly acquired program for our company and absorbing all the previous tasks my current manager held. However, my current manager does not allow me to make mistakes without voicing her concerns to our director.

Am I thinking about it the wrong way or being too defensive? Not too sure how to react because I have only been at this company for 6 months. I understand each manager has different styles and expectations, but my current manager's reactions to my minor errors seem overblown.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TLDR: Newly appointed manager has not lead a team before and they are not taking into consideration my experience with these newly absorbed tasks. Leading to me getting looked down upon by her for making mistakes."

2,2022-12-13,Question about Indeed job postings,u/Tiffkat,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zl7kvt/question_about_indeed_job_postings/,jobs,"This may be a stupid or obvious question, but Google has been of no help. What do the green checkmarks mean in a job posting? 

For example, Job Type might say Full-time and Part-time,  but Full-time is highlighted with a green checkmark next to it. 

Same for Shift and Schedule. It might say 8-hour shift, Overnight shift, and on call. Yet, the first two are highlighted with a green checkmark next to them.

I would think this means that's what the employer is looking for, but if this is the case, then why even list the other options that aren't highlighted?

Can someone explain it please? TIA!"

I love my company, but haven't really enjoyed what I do 100%. For context, I finished up my undergraduate degree working with climate science, renewable energy and physics. 

At my current job, I'm a glorified light bulb changer. I work to install energy efficiency measures, but recently got the green light to become an auditor and for a supervisory role within the team. 

However, I recently just got a job offer from a very large company in Arizona for an environmental technician at a sustainable data center. Unfortunately, the job is 12-hour shifts and there's no guarantee of if I get the day or night shift. 

I can't decide what job to pick. Very happy where I am in the Rockies, and not sure I want to move out to the desert. Not sure I want to risk working 12-hour night shifts, or working for such a big company where I'd feel meaningless. 

I'm curious what you guys think. 

Is it better for me to take a risk moving somewhere where I may not like it, working for a company that would look better on my resume and could give me better experience? But could also be an absolute drain on me. 

Or

Would it be better for me to stay where I am and move into the supervisory role, then use that experience as a segue into something better?

I'm trying to plan for the future, where I would want my current experience to better feed into my later careers. So the real decision is between better company with better sounding job, but worse location/ work balance. Or, not as good of a company with not as enjoyable of work but a supervisor role, but with a better work, life balance and better location."
0,2022-12-13,What does it mean having a similar sales target for 2 Co-workers at two very different levels,u/UnknownKiller40,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zl8jlp/what_does_it_mean_having_a_similar_sales_target/,jobs,"I’ve been doing what I do for a year. My Co-worker has been doing the same for over 15 years. Obviously his base salary is probably twice as high as mine 

We both received our sales target for next year (it’s not the end of the world if we hit it or not to be honest but more sales does mean more commission).

HOWEVER, my sales target is set for 300k for the year whereas his is 360k. I feel like either my target is really high or his is really low because 2 people with such a massive difference in experience can’t bloody have such similar targets? 

A bit about me - I did do quite well in the past 4-5 months &amp; made the highest sales in the team last month, thus they justified my target by saying I was special and that I should be able to hit it, but I don’t know if that’s true or they’re just being partial to the other guy? 

In addition, my base salary goes up by 10k if I hit 120k and by 5k if I hit 250k so technically doesn’t have anything to do with the sales target (so technically has not much to do with the yearly sales target of 300k that’s set for me). However, hitting the sales target does mean multiple sales trip.

I’m so confused and quite inexperienced so I could really use some advice??"

My only family, bar my dog, is my grandfather, who just lost his wife recently to dementia (I took care of both of them for years), and he has Cancer; he has asked me to hang out with him more due to this.

I could do this due to working remotely but after a long-term health issue &amp; falling out with my last boss; I quit three months ago. I have looked for jobs since then. Fast forward to today &amp; I've recently found a job that I enjoy plus am good at; the team is friendly &amp; most importantly, the pay is excellent (around £52,000 a year &amp; I live in a small town, so that money is madness). The caveat, unfortunately, is that it's 55 hours a week &amp; travel to the city is 12 hours there &amp; back a week, so 67 hours a week spent working means I have little time for anything but work. 

I've felt rather torn as I feel this job is a life-changing opportunity that, if I play my cards right, I could set myself up for a successful career, but then I'm not fulfilling my duty to my dog or grandfather. 

I've got an interview for another job working from home (around 25,500 for 37.5 hours, so a significant drop in money &amp; hours), so I would have drastically more free time with family. Still, I feel I'm throwing away an opportunity.  My family is more important than a job, obviously, but I think I'm throwing away one of life's few blessed chances to make it.

The turn over is immense, moral is at an all time low, owners are in the middle of divorce, etc. I got this job right out of High School. The industry is something I have no love for.

In 2017 I went back to school for my Associate’s and graduated with a 3.9 GPA in Criminal Justice. I was in the hiring process for NYPD but then covid happened and my test was thrown out. Overall, the way things are, I would prefer to do police work anywhere else but there. The problem is tests are given infrequently and they highly competitive. That being said, I am on waitlist for MTA police test and MTA Conductor tests.

In 2022 I went back to school again after covid restrictions began to ease, etc. I am currently working on my BA in Criminal Justice Law Enforcement Technology. It is a CJ degree but with some added basic computer focused classes, nothing like Computer Science. Grades are still great and I should be finished by Spring next year. 

I currently make $50k/year but in reality, less, because I am working less hours so that I can take classes.

In the past it seemed as though employers would immediately be turned off by the fact I am still in school because it meant I could not adhere to there M-F full time schedule.

Indeed just seems to be an endless list of “Sales” jobs around here. 

Beginning to think I squandered the last 10 years at my current job and worrying my degree is pretty useless outside of police work.

At this point I am willing to do anything to leave this current job if it means flexible hours, I would even take a slight pay cut. I am quite handy and would actually love manual labor work but cannot find apprenticeships hiring in the Long Island/NYC area.

 I would like to finish school because I’ve come this far. Currently my fiancé makes around 90k year working in NYC as Human Resources. I feel as though I am holding us back despite her saying otherwise. She is also a big motivator of mine and pushed me to go back to school. In her mind, no degree is truly useless. 

The depression, anxiety and feeling STUCK has been unreal. Should I apply to any and everything? Any advise on manual labor job searching or apprenticeships?

I don't even think I have anything to worry about, really, my boss is nice and I feel fairly confident that, overall, I'm doing a good job and have made myself valuable to the company. My boss and other higher-ups have told me multiple times that I'm doing great work. The few times I've gotten constructive criticism in the past, my boss has always been very professional about it and has emphasized that she wants to support me and isn't trying to accuse me of doing things wrong.

I guess it's mostly just because I'm very sensitive and a worrier, and I haven't done a real performance review before. I feel insecure that my boss is going to tell me I don't work hard enough, or that I have a bad attitude, or whatever. Also, in my previous job, my boss was verbally and emotionally abusive, and I think I still have some baggage from that experience.

My only two pieces of evidence against this is that i am currently in the middle of a project until mid next year and my section has a ton of work, so it would be a blow for me to leave. Also, i still have a scheduled performance review, which makes me think i still have a future here.

I just wanted to say that as long as you are providing a valued service, even if it is only 5 hours out of a 40 hour week, feel good about it. If you feel guilty, use some of the time to learn more about your job, get some certificates, or even help out another employee if that is an option. 

My job can sometime have me doing 10 hours of work a week, and then other times I have to work overtime because it all hits the wall at once. Most jobs that aren't on some sort of assembly line or call center are probably going to have moments, short and long, where there is nothing to do. If you have good management in place, they will recognize this and be alright with it as long as you don't flaunt it.

I personally think the most important things to do at a job you like are

1. Definitely try to provide value, even one thing that makes you hard to replace is key
2. Get along as best as you can with people, even if they are annoying (everything else being equal, nice guys do not generally finish last in the office)
3. Make the rounds on occasion, be sure people don't forget who you are. Say hello once a week, bring some doughnuts, whatever. Out of sight, out of mind. 
4. Be available when customers / management reach out to you (maybe you work 5 hours out of a 40 hour week, but that doesn't mean you can go fishing in the middle of the work day and ignore calls)

Just my opinion after many years of working great and crappy jobs."

He hates school and does not want to go to college, he’s very smart though. However, he is open to getting some certifications/licenses if needed.

His goal is to have his own business, mainly in real estate and the trucking business. He currently works in Customer Service and makes 55k a year, but it’s for a finance tech company (if that means anything). He has tons of experience in management, property management, retail and customer service with a little bit of sales. 

He said he can save roughly 10k a year after all bills and expenses. He needs much more to put money down for these investments.

He told me he doesn’t care about a “career path,” but not opposed to it if it’ll lead to more money. He’s just looking to make more money to hit his goal. The only thing he’s not willing to do is manual labor. He doesn’t mind staying in a customer facing role either, maybe even sales. He’s looking for a job that’ll pay him at least 70k+.

Background: started at a new company in January. New company was starting a new division and I was the second person hired, after my boss. During interview and for months after, boss tells me he loves my work and I am a shoo in for promotion to the senior leadership role (I am more than qualified) once we begin hiring. 

Get funding to hire. We interview his friend for an open position on our team - boss tells me that he wrote the job description based on friend and that he is “gold standard.” Boss shares with me that he wanted to hire his friend for my position but friend was “too expensive.” We interview other people for position, who I really liked, but boss found something wrong with all of them - one was “too driven” and the other was concerning because they didn’t like sports. Yes, you read that right. 

Friend is hired. Friend is paid 20,000 more than me, on paper/title doing a different job, but actual tasks are the same. I am again promised promotion, told friend doesn’t want that senior leadership role. Discuss salary with boss but told once we get more funding, salary will come. 

Three months pass. I bust my butt on my projects, going above and beyond, working toward promotion. Friend turns in nothing, nada, zilch and is lost, despite lots of onboarding assistance. Friend asks for no help (I have sneaking suspicion friend is working two jobs due to background in zoom, attire during zoom meetings, and lack of availability). Boss asks me to start monitoring friend because he is disappointed friend isn’t turning things in. I start having to pick up friend’s projects and work. 

Friend gets promotion.

Reason given to me was that “friend has a PhD  which just makes him a better representative of company and he is older than you.”

So yeah not the usual post I guess, a mix of job and lifestyle advice I’m asking for here.

So I am 22 and have a degree in sound engineering, currently working in a hotel as a night auditor. Neither of which I can realistically see a long term career in at the moment.

Being young and still having time to change my career path, I want to move to something with suits or well dressed people, fancy dinners at restaurants, well educated people, well spoken people.

That’s the lifestyle side, but I also want to find a career I can love, a job to be passionate, something I don’t mind being there doing overtime for late into the night.

I’d rather not do another degree, although if there’s a masters I could do for 1 or 2 years I guess it wouldn’t be the end of the world.

I currently live in France, but would love to move somewhere like Toronto, or New York. A place where there’s money to be made. 

I’m not looking to be infinitely rich or anything ridiculous, I just want to have a comfortable job with a comfortable salary, with the sort of people around that have also been places and been educated, and seen more than the local area they live in, people with aspirations in life.

I did think about law, but it’s a lot of expensive degrees. Journalism maybe? But yet again that ends in a lot of expensive degrees. Also love tech, always had a nerdy side, maybe I could do something in that industry.

I do love the media industry and it interest me, but it isn’t the same world as I’m looking to be in.

Sorry for the ramble I’m just trying to find new direction in my life, and honestly have no idea where to start.

2,2022-12-13,Working as a receptionist,u/doevanilla,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zlgiiz/working_as_a_receptionist/,jobs,"So I’m considering a job offer of $50k full-time,  as an entry-level role within a corporate office. I’m wondering because the average in my area is from $55k to $60k and my current job as a casual wage earner gives me practically the same pay. I understand pay is calculated differently for casual and full-time, so am I overreaching by wanting to negotiate to $55k at the least?

Job offer of $50k, $55k - 60k is considered the average, is it worth negotiating"
2,2022-12-13,Help me decide between two offers,u/Avocado__Man,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zlgogu/help_me_decide_between_two_offers/,jobs,"I do not officially have the second offer in hand but was told to expect it tomorrow. I started at Job A this week and it's been going really well. Like the team, organization, and product. 

I interviewed for Job B 2 months ago and unfortunately came in 2nd. Since accepting and starting at Job A, B has come back with a new opening for a similar position. I told them I would accept if they came to me with 10k over A and an extra week of pto. The offer would be for 5k more base, 5k bonus, and the extra week. So really close to what I had asked for. 

Here is my breakdown of some statistics.
Benefits: both have amazing benefits but slight edge to B

Commute: equal (35-50 minutes). B is likely to build a new office next year that will cut my commute down to about 25min

Comp: A-100k +15% yearly bonus. 6% 401k matching
B-105k+ 5k sign on bonus+15% yearly bonus. 4% 401k matching 

Role: edge to A at least I think. B is closer to what I have been doing but A is maybe what I think I want to do.

Product: I give the edge to A because it suits my background  a bit better. Still think I could learn the product of B just fine

Organization: both are very established and leading in their respective industries. Either will be very stable. 

Some things that stand out to me is that the commute for B should be much lower when the new building is finished. That is 1+ years out so I feel like I shouldn't count that as fact. 

My current plan is to see if A will counter. The extra week of pto is going to be a must but I'm not sure I will get more straight comp from them. This department needs the help so who knows. 

If you made it this far I appreciate it. I'm in bed with these thoughts bouncing around my head. Any different point of views are appreciated."

On average the pay starts at 25/hr minimum and tends to cap out at 45-50/hr at high profile companies. I was making 35/hour at my last one when I was unfortunately let go after a management change and since then it feels like I've been blacklisted from the field as a whole somehow, seeing as every single job I've applied to has denied me. 

Prior B.A work I was also a kitchen/head chef lead, which has such a low ceiling for its pay. I keep getting offers in the 18-21 dollar range, which is significantly lower than what I've been used to for the last 5 years. I could make more doing Uber, for less work let's put it that way.

I'm struggling to figure out where to go from here, honestly don't want to settle for less than I'm worth. 


As for why I was let go from the job due to manager change I'll elaborate. My manager was put in a tough spot of not being allowed to work for 2 companies at once, and he chose the competition because it paid better. Another coworker who never seemed to like me got his position. The instant she took over the role I was axed, with the reason being ""you don't have the right look I want for the company going forward""


Edit for some clarity: A Brand Ambassador is basically the salesperson/face of the brand/company they're representing. For example, if you see someone at a bar that's handing out free samples of a certain liquor and talking about it and hyping it up: that's a Brand Ambassador. You see a representative who works for a cigarette company handing out coupons to try a new product, they're a Brand Ambassador. You walk into a grocery store and see someone with a table set up of samples of a brand new organic drink or some variation of that? Thats a Brand Ambassador too. Hell, those annoying dudes who bug you about what cable provider you use at Walmart? That's also a Brand Ambassador. 
It's mostly speciality type brands or companies that have Brand Ambassadors and that's why it pays as well as it tends to. For example B.A's who work for the company that makes White Claw alcoholic seltzers make 50/hr. You might be saying ""wow that's insane, sounds too easy and good to be true"" but believe it or not, it isn't. These companies have huge budgets for these things and it's like paying us to advertise and put in the foot work."

I have a lengthy notice period and am partly quitting due to years of staff shortages that were never properly fulfilled. 

Part of the reason I want to resign now and not hold out is my bosses' refusal to allow remote working, despite my job allowing that to be a possibility. Instead they're losing me.

To not be too on the nose about it, I just said it would be great to have a follow up conversation about remote working in which I was going to say we are clearly on extreme ends of the spectrum on the subject and it'd be best if I did something different. 

One has said they are so stressed with running the business that they aren't well right now and said they doubt both of them can meet before Christmas. I don't want to hold out resigning for another month to be honest. 

What's the best way to address this? The management is so toxic I kinda fear the reaction that an email resignation would bring but idk if I have any other choice."

1,2022-12-14,looking for job recommendations please!,u/Hyper-scout2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zloybr/looking_for_job_recommendations_please/,jobs,"I live in central KY and I currently work as a maintenance tech for a wastewater treatment plant (avg 20-40MGD, max capacity at 60MGD) I work on pumps and do A LOT of plumbing, but I have no certifications in wastewater operations nor a license for plumbing. I learned all my plumbing in the 7 years that I worked here and that goes for soldering copper, gluing PVC, threading black iron and galvanized pipe and installing ductile lines as large as 8inchs. Like I said we're a big plant so I got a lot of experience doing this sort of thing.

In maintenance we have 3 teams of two people, each team gets a truck with tools and everything you need to work on this equipment. We even have a supervisor who repeatedly has told us he doesn't care what we need as far as tools go, he will buy it from our budget (with reason of course). There's literally no excuses here to not do any jobs. Except for one major problem.... All the good workers are gone and most of management has retired so what's left are all the workers who don't work and worse, talk down to you cause your try to do a job. Here's a good example, we still use chlorine to disinfect at the last stage of our process, right above that line is a hydrant we use to clean the contact tanks (tanks designed to slow the flow down for longer chlorine contact time). The hydrant is busted and I really want it back in service. We own a vactor truck just for jobs like this so I tried to get another coworker to operate the truck for me cause I don't know how to use it. When word got out that I was going to hydro excavate the area to make a repair, that same coworker got management involved and I was told to back off from the job cause it's ""to dangerous"". Chlorine is deadly as fuck which is why I was going to hydro excavate the area and not dig it out with a backhoe but I did what management told me to do and there the hydrant sits, still broken, never to be touched or fixed again. I can give lots of examples but that's not important anymore to me. I just want out.

I'm having a lot of personnel issues where my coworkers are not motivated to do anything mainly because there's no repercussions or disciplinary actions for not doing any work at my job. So even though we have things not working at 100% and a few leaks from seals here and there, no one actually cares enough to do anything about it. And why would you? I get that, cause to most this is just a job but to me it's different, Yeah it sounds like a dream job to get paid 8 hrs to play on your phone and go home but I'm sick of it!!

I just want to go to a job where if I can work by myself and get things done then I can. Or work as a team with others when the job requires it. To me, I know what needs to be done around here but good luck convincing others.

What hurts the most I guess is how encouraged and self motivated I was when I first got here but now it's literally not worth sacrificing my mental health. So now I turn to Reddit to see if there are others like me who needs a coworker that wants to work? Are there any jobs out there that will allow me to work alone or at the very least not prevent me from working when I actually show some sort of initiative? Please help me y'all lol I'm drowning over here"

1,2022-12-14,Had a very strange interview recently,u/Cinemairwaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zlp9wb/had_a_very_strange_interview_recently/,jobs,"So I recently applied for a job that honestly sounded perfect for me. It was my exact skill set, in an industry that I want to be in, and somewhere I felt like I could do some great work.

I got to interview with the head of talent (HoT from here on out) shortly after applying, and that's when the red flags (to me) started popping up.

In the interview, the HoT asked if I would be willing to come into the company's location ""every so often."" I asked for some clarification, as I live about a 2 hour train ride away from there, to which they replied ""in office Mondays to Thursdays, work from home on Fridays."" I don't know about you, but that doesn't sound like ""every so often"" I'd be on site, that sounds like every so often I'd be home. Foolishly, I didn't press this further in that interview.

Also during the interview, there was a bunch of noise on their end, and while I was describing myself and my skills, the HoT was looking off camera, talking to someone else, clearly not paying attention to what I was saying. 

After the interview was finished, they discussed next steps, which included sending me a work exercise so the company could get a grasp on what type of work I create. Understandable, that seems like a normal request for this type of work (audio editing). They said to send them an email soon to schedule that, as it was a two hour limit. So from the minute they sent me the exercise, I'd have about two hours to complete it. Odd, but okay.

I send emails to schedule it, telling them my schedule at work so we can work around that. I tell them that I work until 2:30 pm, and have about an hour and 15 commute home, so I could do the exercise around 4:15 pm, to which they replied ""great! let's do tomorrow at 3 pm."" Another red flag, and I reiterated my schedule and basically insisted on the 4:15 pm time. They agreed.

The day the exercise was scheduled, I had a weird little epiphany about it, saying that this whole process seemed super disorganized, and got a weird feeling about it. I tried to look up some reviews of the company itself, but couldn't find any. However, I did find a review of the interview process, one of which that was posted like 3 days after my interview, that said how disorganized and unprofessional the whole interview was, and how the exercise that was supposed to be 2 hours ended up taking over 4, and was unpaid. The reviewer talked about how the next step after the exercise was even MORE unpaid work, and then they didn't even end up getting the job. 

So with my already weird feelings about it, and now with the knowledge that it wasn't just me who experienced this disorganization, I sent an email at 9 am saying that I rescinded my application, but appreciated the time and wished them luck on their search. I thought everything was all done at this point but NOOOOOO.

4:15 pm rolls around, I'm sitting at home after work, and guess what comes through? The email with the work exercise! Now, I understand that more than likely, the HoT scheduled that interview to send and probably just forgot about it, I don't fault them for that at all, that happens. But I sent an email at 9 in the morning. You're telling me that this person, this department head for a relatively small company, did not check their email for 7 hours that day? 

I politely replied back to the exercise email explaining again that I rescinded my application.

It all just seemed like a really weird experience to me. Yes, I'm desperate to find a job, but if this interview (and interviewer) is a reflection of how the company is operated, I'd rather stay away, even though it was the type of position that I've been looking for for over a year."

I'm excited in some ways because I hate my current job (Also Federal) mainly because of having to wake up at 2 am and go to bed at 6 pm, having to constantly deal with the public as I'm constantly dealing with people who get aggressive with me.

However, the new job that I just got offered, Isn't really what I want to do with my life. In high school, I wanted to be a pro wrestler or voice actor something I still want to try and do in my free time, while in college I got my degree in Journalism and had thoughts of maybe Public Relations if I wanted to keep my education going and this new job would be completely separate as I'd be a paralegal specialist. I guess the reason I'm getting nervous is a combination of finally being comfortable in my current job after one year as the job task themselves are simple enough to understand to the point I help out some of the newer employees. And the fear of this being what I'm gonna do for the rest of my life. Most likely stemming from my mom working at the same Federal agency her whole life. Mom was the one who sent me the job and I talked to her about my feelings she said you don't have to work there your whole life as she was a single mother and so she stayed at the same agency but even she moved around the agency and did different things and how it's my life I should live it the way I want.

I guess I'm worried that as I'm getting older the chance to work in the fields I want to will slip by me and I'll always have a feeling of what if. My current plan is to take this job save up some money and go to classes at night doing the things I want like acting and pro wrestling to see if that's what I really want. While also working on my writing on my off days so that I might still have a chance in Journalism.

TL:DR Are my feelings of nervousness valid after getting a job offer or am I crazy for even thinking about leaving a job if I could be stable for life?"

2,2022-12-14,Leaving job after six months?,u/spookyspacekook2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zlumrt/leaving_job_after_six_months/,jobs,"I recently was married, and my husband and I relocated to a city a couple of hours from our families. We thought this was where we wanted to live, which is why we picked this area. However, we are starting the process of looking to buy a house, and we realized we wanted to be closer to our family. 

We are glad to finally have closure on where we want to settle long-term, but it is unfortunate that we will have to move again after realizing this is not where we want to be. That being said, I have obviously gotten a job here. We don't want to wait another year to buy a house, so I would have to find another job after only being at this one for six months.

So, with that background, will I hurt my resume if I jump jobs after only 6 months? What is the best way to approach this with my current employer without burning any bridges (when I started, I indicated that we were hoping to be here long term.) Should I give more than a two week notice or heads up, so there is ample time to fill the position without it being vacant? 

Any advice surrounding this situation would be much appreciated! TIA!"

1,2022-12-14,Bad Annual Performance Review After 8 Months,u/Weeaboounlimited,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zlv07e/bad_annual_performance_review_after_8_months/,jobs,"I'll give some back story:

So, I started working for this small agency about 8 months ago as a ""project coordinator"" and was hired to manage a big client for them. I was trained by a more seasoned person who I found out doesn't really understand know how to train properly. By the first day, I was given very outdated training materials that made it difficult to understand the job entirely. My trainer only was on a call with me for the entire first week. They shared their screen and explained what it is that I would be doing and how to do it. I had to stop them to say that I couldn't learn like that and would like to share my screen and have them guide me through the process!

Fast forward to two weeks ago (I had been working for the company for 8 months now), I was notified the day before that I would be receiving an annual performance review. On the call was my boss and my trainer, they commented ""Don't take this personal - this is just an annual review!"" Then proceeded to go over the review very fast, leaving me with no room to actually process and read the review properly. I did comment that my trainer was going fast but got ignored so I just said that I will be reviewing it once I have received it and write my concerns in the employee comments.

That day, I got my annual review and was taken aback by the review. I received 2s (Needs improvement) for my job knowledge, 2s for strategic thinking and I needed to take more ownership of the client I was hired to manage. The hidden expectations were insane!

I do not have contact with the client that I am ""supposed"" to manage since my trainer aka lead talks to them for me! It's because since my position has have such a high turnover rate, my company doesn't want to introduce everybody to them. But I am left completely out of the loop of emails and not even copied on them. My lead manages the client a lot more than I do which I voiced my opinion about it 6 months and it STILL didn't change! In other sections of the review were comments like ""Need to go back to training materials"" ""Requires repeat repetition"" ""Needs to look back at examples instead of asking questions"". I ended up writing an extremely length response to each comment with backing points to say that I was improperly trained and expectations were not clear.

My lead got extremely offended about my comments even bringing up a milestone sheet that was given to me at the first week to ask if I had reviewed it. I told them that it wasn't my place to review such a thing since it was designed for my trainer to review it with me every month. Which did not happen! My lead told me that they have been checking off each task on their own, I told them that should have been discussed with me as well. I started my job search again after the review due to communication between me and management not being clear. After my review, my trainer has been training me more but I know it left me as a mark in the agency. I don't really care but I had to stand up to myself after that piss poor review.

I would like to say that I have only been out of college for a year half and this was my first real annual performance review. I should have told them to slow down the review but I didn't.  Just wanted to come in here to rant.

TDRL: Annual performance review had hidden expectations even though I am being held back from doing my job entirely."

I know that you don't go to work to practice social life, but it kinda hurts to see all of them being friends with each other and hang out while I'm usually left alone with the feeling of being out casted. They are all nice to me, don't get me wrong, but ultimately their interests are different and they all have solid relationships and conversations between them, there's no place for me in their social circle. Most of them only really talk to me when they need something from me to do. 

Some times I think if I were mistaken to choose a medical speciality in which the majority of its practitioners are female, or if I were wrong to choose this hospital from the start. The feeling of being alone while everyone are in a group even after 1.5 years just hurt me from time to time.

To be honest, I have never really had that many friends imo, but I thought things will improve when I start to work and people I deal with on daily basis, that I will start building some relationships, but it's turning out to be even worse."

3,2022-12-14,My current boss is leaving and starting a rival company. He wants to hire some of us for his new company. He's also been underpaying us and we all will gain a massive raise after he leaves. Advice on when he approaches me with a new offer?,u/SCORPIONDEATHDROP_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zlxq3l/my_current_boss_is_leaving_and_starting_a_rival/,jobs,"So, my current boss is 76 years old and has been saying he was going to retire every year for the last 3 years. He owns our local company, but had a deal with a parent company that no other manager of that company has. It's a 70/30 split where he acts as an agent and keeps 70% of profits and is the one who sets our salaries and bonuses, etc. instead of the giant corporation, who just keeps the remaining 30%. He's always said he pays us very generously and no one else gets bonuses like we do.

So anyway, his contract with the corporation is coming to an end. He didn't like their new contract offer (he went back on his own to retire, again) and is ""so insulted"" by their low offer that he is starting a new company and taking clients/customers from them (us). Over the course of this 3 month ordeal we've found out actually how much more money he makes than any other manager (more than THREE times as much) and how little he pays us compared to the employees of other offices (I stand to make a 30% raise literally just because he won't be here anymore and the corporate office is now in charge of salary).

When he comes to me for the new job offer, I have all of this in my mind and my first instinct is to let him know how greedy he's been, but it would be far smarter to try and negotiate SOMETHING so I can bring that back to the company I'll be staying with. I'm already getting a huge increase, but if I leave, my office (of only 5 employees) doesn't have someone in line to do the more complex work that I do. Should I hear him out and use it to negotiate with my company, or just decline his offer and let it be OR do I try to explain how out of touch he is with regular citizens who struggle with insane inflation and cost of living increases? He still thinks the small salaries he's been paying us is generous even after finding out the corporate office pays 10-30% higher wages.

Sorry for the info dump, I've been here for 6 years and it's all coming to a head in a few days lol."

To explain, I have a large tattoo on my forearm that is mostly concealable such that my dress shirts cover it entirely.  However if I reach out for something, it will be a little visible.  I know a couple of coworkers have seen it by chance and no one has ever said anything.

This morning we had a company meeting (roughly 15 people) in the conference room to review company rules going over issues like punctuality and other policies that people aren’t following.  My boss is discussing the company dress code going over how all men must wear ties at work and similar things.

She then singles me out and calls me to the front of the table.  As she talks about how tattoos are not allowed and are unprofessional, she rips up the sleeve of my shirt showing most of it.  She is screaming at me about how this is against the rules and that I should be fired for this.  

At this point, I was stunned and stood there getting yelled at and threatened in front of everyone for what felt like 5 minutes. There was complete silence afterwards.  Also the tattoo was still healing and a bunch of scabs fell off when she pulled up my shirt.

Noone has a spoken to me since as I have become the office pariah.  Sorry for rambling, but I am just at a loss for words; not even sure if I will have a job in a couple weeks."

Its a 100% onsite job. I caught my coworker looking for other jobs (i dont care if they do) and they said they make 58k in this role. I make 50k. They also have no degree (just for context, not hating). I have less experience but thats a large jump. My soon to be former coworker leaving soon is making 60k doing the exact same job I am. Their is little difference in what we do and how efficient we do it. I am also being given more responsibilities, but not getting paid any more. Been here almost a year and no talk of raises. 

I know I have less experience, but I feel a bit given the short stick. Especially since I bust my butt at this nonprofit (this is a very huge nonprofit too, no one here is making nonprofit wages that are not entry level). And with one less co worker I will be doing even more work, but the same pay.

So far the ones I've answered...

 **Are Cover Letters Still Relevant?**  

 Cover letters will always be relevant. They give context about your career journey and background. The right cover letter will set you apart from other candidates who will have the same or more experience than you. A good cover letter can impress recruiters enough to give you a chance, even if they find your resume lacking for the job position. A cover letter is also a great way to display confidence and give the hiring manager a better idea of why you decided to apply.  

 **What is the Difference Between a Cover Letter and a Resume?**  

 A resume tells an employer what you've done, a cover letter tells them why. It gives context to the achievements, job responsibilities, and expertise found in your resume. It explains more about where you've been and where you want to go."

A little background into where I am coming from with my question - can i get caught fluffing my resume? I have been self-employed for the better part of a decade; seven years as a trainer in gyms teaching group classes and training clients 1 on 1. (Always paid 1099). I shifted into the real estate world in 2018, first getting licensed in CA. My first two years were ho-hum sales-wise, but I busted my ass to get done what I got done. In my third and fourth years, I had pretty substantial sales but I have arrived at a point where I am burnt out, and just want to sell for someone else, in a 9-5 M-F capacity, get a base salary and commissions/bonuses. I literally do not care what I sell, I just need a job and sales is what I have found I am good at and where my experience lies. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, in the job market, attempting to apply for account executive or other salesperson roles has presented this challenge; I do not have the typical corporate experience or business to business sales that seem to be SO IMPORTANT when applying for these roles. Like everyone else, I believe I am qualified and can get the job done, and am tempted to fluff my resume to make me more appealing. I have applied for dozens of jobs, followed up, done inquiries, wrote great cover letters, and feel like I am hitting a wall. I need an edge, and am willing to stretch the truth to get myself in the door. What potential consequences can I get hit with if I stretch timelines with jobs, or even just invent experience which I have considered doing."

I   recently handed my notice in to my current job (in large part because I   hate my boss) and I currently have two days left before my last day.

However,   I’ve started to feel unwell since yesterday and now I feel pretty   unwell.  I’m not so sick as to be bed ridden or anything but I   definitely don’t feel well enough to drive an hour in the freezing arse   cold over to my job then work all day and have shit from my boss.

So   I text him this Evening saying that I appreciate the timing isn’t  great  but that I don’t think I’ll be in work tomorrow if I feel as I do  now,  as I don’t feel well enough.

He   did not take this well and has basically been pressuring me to come in   saying ‘we still have loads to do’ and ‘you’ve only got two days left -  I  expect you to be in’ and ‘being sick on your last two days doesn’t   reflect well on you’

So now I just   don’t really know what to do…….should I bite the bullet and go in not   feeling well or prioritise myself over a job I leave on Friday?

I’d   be lying if I said that I wasn’t a bit concerned about how me maybe   being off sick for my last two days will effect me approaching them for a   reference in the future."

For example I was asked what my colleagues think about me and I said that I'm good at my job that I'm ""on to it"" and that was 100% the truth in fact one of my colleagues used to call himself the master and then jokingly said that he had to hand the title over to me now.  But what I conveniently left out is that they also know that I'm easily distracted and absent minded. So I told the truth sure but not without deceiving them too.

Or they asked why I want the job and I went on a spiel about wanting to help people and that it's the type of job that I think I'm good at etc.  All true but realistically I just want a job with more pay where I can sit down. And again I conveniently left out the money and sitting down reasons.

I really vibed with the executive chef. There are some issues with the property (the club burned down early in 2022), they expect the new club house to be built in 2025. They are making it work the best they can and honestly they've got some really good things happening. 

So the chef offered me a sous chef role as a salaried position. It sounded like a done deal. A couple weeks later he calls me and says that the GM of the club is dragging his feet and isn't too sure about being able to hire me and doesn't want to hold me back if I find something better. He does express to me that he wants to hire me and that he knows I'll be an asset to the team. 

A couple weeks after that he texted me saying that he can't hire me as a salaried position and told me an hourly wage instead. 

Is it wrong of me to be completely put off by being texted this bombshell information? I really liked him and I see so much potential for growth at this place but I feel really weird about it."

1,2022-12-14,Laid off after only 1 week,u/Kainbas88,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zm1ncx/laid_off_after_only_1_week/,jobs,"So my fiancé's brother recently was hired for a job working at a local automobile factory making parts through a temp agency. Anyone who starts here is hired this way. His start date was 12/5/2022.

He worked all of last week and exceeded their expectations by making 2345/745 parts in a 40 hour shift and making them correctly I might add. I know this because he called me after I dropped him off last Friday and they sent him home as they had no work because he had made so many.

Fast forward to today. He worked Monday and Tuesday but when he got to work today, they called him into the office and told him that he was laid off effective immediately as they had no work available. This is highly strange as usually this place hires temps after 90 days.

After a conversation he told me he had asked what prompted them to lay him off and they told him it was only because of no parts left to be made as they were shutting down for a few weeks next week. He then asked why not keep me on the books so I can come back when you start back up after the beginning of the year and he was told that wasn't how they did business and it was up to the temp agency.

Now I fully believe this is a cop out because I've actually worked with temp agencies and many clients before who've never done something this shady. It feels more like they never intended to hire him and was just cheap labor. It also seems odd to lay someone off after literally 1 week. He's rather pissed about it as he had been without work trying to find something for over a month and they pulled this

Anyone else experience this?"

I have regular appointments with a health professional virtually for my well being weekly. I am working a job with set hours and was planning on using my lunch these days to have the appointments. 

The issue is, my lunch time can change throughout a normal day. Along with this I can also have meetings added to my schedule any day. I have an appointment scheduled during my lunch this week, but also had the monthly company lunch added to my calendar. Clearly, I cannot have 2 lunches in one day and am not sure how I am to proceed.

I could move the appointment, but I need it this week in particular bc I couldn't have one last week. My provider will likely not be able to reschedule anything for this week

I could skip the company lunch and just take my lunch at the time of the appointment like I originally planned. Since it is the first company lunch happening, I feel it may be unprofessional for me not to attend.

I could also discuss this with my boss as these appointments are regular. I'm hesitant though because I want to make a good impression and don't want to be a pain. 

I really don't know which one is best. Ideally I'd want to talk with my boss but I'm so worried about losing this job."

&amp;#x200B;

I just got off the phone with my dad, who is struggling and needs to find a job and I am looking for any advice for someone of his age and background. He has some severe financial issues as well but I understand this in not the sub for that, so I will keep it to job help.

My dad left college and starting working in printing sales, he did that until he was 50, only ever working for 2 companies, and the second he worked at for over 20 years. Unfortunately, that company went under, liquidated and was sold to a competitor, who closed the doors on their office and didn't retain anyone. My dad struggled massively after that finding a job, and bounced around a few places, first selling life insurance which failed to go anywhere, then struggled in an operations role at a big trucking company. Now at 59 he is struggling with what to do next, I fear that the last decade of stress has broken his spirit and even impacted some of his skills. He failed a basic computer competency test when trying to get a job in a call center doing customer service, he's body isn't  in the greatest shape he has some bad back pain, I am not sure if hard physical labor would be doable. He is single now and lives a modest lifestyle, he is just looking to get by, make rent, eat well, and hopefully have some security. I also think he handles stress very poorly and so looking for something that is not high pressure.

Some of the ideas I've had but not sure if they would be good--FexEx/UPS delivery driver or postal worker, grocery store clerk, maybe real estate agent (he has lived in the same city his whole life and has good connections to the community), landscaping/snow removal... Maybe others I am missing.

Any help is good help--

Thank you"

At first I asked myself why I put up with this crap.  Used to wonder if Manslaughter was really that serious...  But eventually I came to a realization; he can't do anything about me.  So I let it roll off my back.  And now, If it's gonna suck, I'm gonna make sure it sucks for both of us.

For context: This used to be a mom &amp; pop exporter.  It was recently bought out by a larger company and they made a lot of changes.  Not all for the better.  Before I knew it, my immediate boss, my partner, and the office admin have all quit.  This forced the regional director to have to come in house and run things until we replaced them.  And I'm not sure who started it, but he and I have been butting heads ever since.  

He does not interact with me unless it involves instruction or correction.  No ""please &amp; thank you."" No ""Good morning."" just barks orders.  Sometimes he even berates me in front of the other staff. ""Why did you do XYZ like this! You need to break that habit right now.  I want XYZ like this!  Let me hear you say it!""  But he's not like this with anyone else. Just me.  Now I don't want him to become my best friend or anything, but it is quite stressful to work for a guy who only talks to you with an attitude.

He likes using antiquated systems involving actual files.  Loves printing everything, hand moving physical documents, and faxing. So much paper. So much waisted time.  Don't even get me started on his filing system.  Meanwhile I've found ways to digitize the entire process: Excel, emails,  shared documents.  Saves time, so much easier, and more accurate.  I'd even shared a couple sheets that I've created to make things smoother. He told me to print them.  We murder some trees in this office.  I think that's why he doesn't like me; I balk at his operations flow every step of the way.

Now the epiphany:  He can't get rid of me.  I know he doesn't like me, and maybe he's being a dick to try and get me to quit. But he can't do it without me.  And maybe it's petty of me, but if I can piss him off with just my presence, well then that makes me smile.  I secretly smile when he gets pissed.  Most secure I've ever been at work.  And I still use my spreadsheets."

I've been working for about 7 months now in my first job after Uni. I don't mind the Job (I quite like it sometimes) but early on I realised its not the best move for my career and its not the sort of Job a Uni graduate usually does. I'm still learning a lot but it's quite a niche industry and I'm not sure if it's what i want to do the rest of my working career, or if its the best in terms of my potential as i feel my skills arent being utilised. 

However I am conflicted about leaving for multiple reasons. Firstly, it is a 2 year training programme and I would feel like a quitter if I left before it was done. This would also make me feel guilty as my manager has invested a lot of time into me and has also been good to me and is a nice guy in general. Secondly, I would also feel guilty because it is a small company (&lt;30 people) that has been facing recruitment problems for a while. I know this shouldn't bother me but I would still feel bad that someone will have to pick up an already large workload. I also work in a depertment of only 3 people including me and my manager. I also suck at interviews and that scares me a bit.

I guess the main thing that's putting me off is guilt and in a way embarrassment. As I said I don't mind my job and I am still learning both technical and personal skills but it might be better for my career if I could get a job somewhere else (although the grass isnt always greener). I don't know what answer I'm looking for tbh but it just feels good to get it off my chest even if no-one reads this.

After two or three weeks while I was still trying to learn my new tasks, I and another colleague that was also a recent hire received a call from Constantin. He essentially told us the following:

A) why are our tasks taking so long? That he didn’t care if we spent 7 hours in the kitchen provided we completed our tasks. 

B) whatever he gave us as tasks is priority, no matter if our actual boss told us otherwise. That this is a problem between him and our boss. 

My colleague and I couldn’t fathom what was going on so we didn’t say anything. Mind you Constantin has our same rank but been in this role for 2 years. 

Constantin also fails to reply to our questions when we do ask him for help. Literally leaving us hanging on Skype. 

Last week I had to give a presentation to my immediate team where he asked “can’t we do it like I used to do it ?”  Obviously I felt like crap after this.

I heavily suspect that there are illegal reasons why I was fired (don't really want to go into details here because those issues are still under investigation) but obviously that's a bad thing to say in an interview.

I'm just really confused. My current option is to state ""I was officially terminated, but I don't know 100% because the company's reasons for termination were determined to be false."" I don't know if that's good enough or if it would just raise more concerning questions.

To clarify, there was not actually misconduct. The old company took behaviors that were explicitly allowed in the company handbook, but only on break, such as texting, and tried to make it sound like I was doing that all the time on the clock."

Problem is, it’s been 5 years and I haven’t stayed in contact with him. I’ve used him as references before multiple times in the past 5 years.

I’m embarrassed to ask him because he will think that I have not found a job in 5 years. My other employments in the past 5 years have not been great so I can’t ask them for references. This particular boss is a high ranking professional and is now retired. 

Should I ask him? Because I have no one else to ask. One of my previous bosses is on vacation for 3 weeks which will be too late, I can’t get ahold of her."
1,2022-12-14,My Boss put in his 2 weeks and I need a raise - what do I do?,u/markyymark13,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zm4ac6/my_boss_put_in_his_2_weeks_and_i_need_a_raise/,jobs,"Important context - I was recently 'promoted' to an Associate Product Marketing Manager recently but was only given a small 3% raise because my boss felt I need improvement and need to show im capable of the job. I have a lot more responsibilities now than i did a year ago and yet im effectively making the same money, less really with inflation.

Now my boss just put in his two weeks, which means we have a TBA interim Manager to take his place. My entire workflow is up in the air but no matter what Im going to have to take on the brunt of responsibilities until we get an actual manager to replace him - and who the hell knows when that is. We're launching two products soon which he manages, and now all the responsibilities and oversight is unclear as to how that's going to be managed by the interim manager - no matter the details I will likely be thrown into the deep end and have to take on a lot of this. 

My next review isn't until February, which of course he won't be a part of. I'm not sure if this is the case at most companies, but my boss has to go on my behalf to his direct report for me to get a raise. That whole process is now up in the air, and the interim Manager either can't or will likely not be willing to do that. So im not sure how im supposed to get a raise at this point. I don't want to wait around and hope that I have a new manager in time for my merit review willing to fight on my behalf for a raise.

**TL;DR:** I'm seriously overdue a raise and my boss is leaving, potentially putting even more work on my plate and putting the salary negotiation process up in the air. Do I ask my boss to get me raise before he leaves? Has anyone ever done that? I'm worried he's going to just shove onto whoever takes over putting everything into limbo."

I was laid off last month, and I began sending applications immediately. I was offering a job today, while at the same time Im on the final interview rounds for another place. 

Honestly, this place wasn’t on my top list because it isn’t remote and I’d have to relocate. Which I wasn’t opposed to, for a good offer however the pay seems rather underwhelming and a lot low than what I had requested. Manager gives me 3-4 business days to respond, and says there’s a slight chance for negotiation. Manager also told me himself took a pay cut when accepting HIS role….

I have another fully remote opportunity, I’m in the final round, but they are beyond my desired pay and I would have LIKED that this one came through at the same time as the other one so I could compare…. But it hasn’t.

What do I do? By the time option A needs an answer, option B will probably be a week or so from making their offer (I’m confident, a little!) 

I have 4 months of my living expenses covered, so it’s not like I have NO income and need something immediately however of course, sooner than later I’d like to have a job.

I’m torn with this. Thank you for any advice.. PS please be kind! 😅 I don’t want to sound ungrateful… I’m grateful I get to be in this position after being laid off… at the same time, I’d like to make enough money to pay my mortgage without struggling."

Last week I submitted my resume for a call center position with a Health/Clinic company in my area. I received a email from one the HR recruiters asking to set up a phone interview with me for this week. Interview was supposed to take place yesterday, 1:30PM. I make sure I am fully available, phone charged, comfortable area etc. and 1:30PM comes, then 1:35, 1:40PM and nothing. I email the recruiter asking if something happened and then decide to call her directly. Her voicemail  says that she is out of the office this week and leaves another extension to call. WTF?? I left her a voicemail and call the other number. This extension is her supervisor which I chose not to leave a message. These are my thoughts on this: 

1. It seems like this health company uses recruiters to do their hiring. 
2. Even if i left a message with her supervisor, I doubt he would have any knowledge of my scheduled phone interview so I wouldn't have interviewed with him either, I am assuming. 
3. I leave a message with her supervisor and now I have exposed her to not being responsible about her schedule/phone interviews and her lack of rescheduling/follow through. ( I mean she should of done her job correctly) 
4. Maybe this is the first time she does this and just slipped up and didn't get a chance to reschedule, and now she will be upset that I basically told on her and there goes my overall chance with this interview..

Is this a red flag of what to expect out of working for this company? I need a job but do I take my chances on something like this?"

I of course said I could handle it but my stomach sank because in reality I do not like being very stressed and overwhelmed at work. Not that I mind being busy, but she literally said ""stressful"" which I didn't like.

Is that just something most hiring managers say? Or is that a red flag? Maybe she was just exaggerating, it hard to tell.

I was called today to say they want to set me up with another interview next week, now I'm slightly freaking out because I don't want to find myself in a high stress job that makes me anxious and miserable.

I can't seem to find anything worthwhile outside of the field that is willing to hire me at greater pay than what I'm making now. I have two bachelor's degrees in CRJ and SOC which unfortunately secludes me within a particular job field that I'd really not like to work for much longer. Unfortunately, I cannot afford to take a pay cut due to current obligations but, in most places, the starting wage is much lower than that of what I make now.

My prior job experience is working in management in both front end of restaurants and kitchen work. I will not go back to that life as it is considered to be a dead end for me.

For a bit of context, I work at a university with a longer holiday break for staff and the company I am interviewing with is in an adjacent type company.

I have been invited for a finalist interview for a position I really adore. My concern is they have stressed the preferred start date in the job posting, during the first interview and at this invitation. From the start, it was a tight timeline since my interview was after Thanksgiving and they have just invited me for a second round at the end of this week. 

I'm on leave from the 20th through Jan 4th and it would not be possible for me to give a proper two weeks notice (and prep the transition for student teams) with their start date being only a few days later. It really goes against my values and what I have built with my current team to leave without proper notice. 

I want to be really upfront but also not shoot myself in the foot for this incredible opportunity. Should I notify at the end of this interview my concerns around the preferred date or wait until I (hopefully) get an offer? I understand why the start date is there - they have an important team retreat but with the interviews colliding with the holidays, I'm concerned.

There are some things I'm unsure about, and I think thats making me the most nervous. Its pretty simple with about 5-10 dogs for an hour before the numbers start going up, and I'm sure I'll have a lot of dogs by the time someone else comes in to help. However I'm terrified I'm gonna mess up and get yelled at, or accidentally let one of the dogs get hurt if I'm not paying attention properly, or miss something I'm supposed to do. 

Does anyone have any advice for this part of the day, or working at a doggie daycare in general? I got most of it down but I'd still appreciate some tips.

Also I should mention I'm 17 and this is my first job. And sorry I wasn't sure what to tag this as 😭"

Long story short I work as a nanny and have great references from many of my other families except the previous one who was in a nanny share with another family. I ended up removing them from the share because they gave everyone COVID (including the other families baby) and insisted the share should resume immediately because everyone was already sick/exposed.

Currently the family I am interviewing with wants to speak with both families from that share and not just the one family I continued working with. I really need the work and have no idea what to do."

1,2022-12-14,Do you think my company would fire me for refusing to do unfair work?,u/Xano74,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zmbjgl/do_you_think_my_company_would_fire_me_for/,jobs,"I am a contractor for a company and have been working at this company for over 3.5 years. I'm actually the most senior in my department and have said several raises and extra responsibilities over the last several years.

I live fairly far away from my job. My morning commute is around 1.5 to an 1.75 hours one way. I spend about 3 hours a day just commuting for this job.

The job is trying to get me to work out of a different location that is even further away from me. This would tag an extra 2 hours onto my commute and I would basically be waking up at 5am and not getting home until 630ish. I had worked at this location before with this schedule and it was awful. Roughly 5 hours of my day was commuting and the work was extra boring.

The unfairness part. So there are locations closer to me that others in my department work at. Those people get to have their transit time paid for, while I do not.

Let me break it down like this.

I live near location A. And I need to travel to location B for this new location. The extra time I spend having to get to work is not compensated. I still get my 8 hours but now 5 hours is just commuting. 

My coworker lives near location B and has to travel to location A. Because he is going to B, he gets to log his transit time to that location and gets paid for it. 

So we are both traveling the same distance to our locations, but he gets paid for the 5 hours of commuting and I don't. 

I tried fighting it with my contracting agency and the director of our department and they both said too bad.

The director even lied to me and said they aren't paying transport time to anyone anymore. I asked 3 of my coworkers that work at location B and they still are getting paid for their transit time.

The other thing about it, is I actually did get paid for my transit time back in August for doing something similar, and now my boss is saying they never have paid transit time or gas, which is a like because I've gotten it approved several times in the past 3 years I've worked there.

So. If I talk to my boss tomorrow and flat out refuse to go to this location, am I super screwing myself. I'm using the unfairness and my seniority against them. Ive explained im more than happy to go if I get my commute paid like the others but they have continued to refuse."

Working as a VP at a small-ish start-up (50 folks). Our executive team is small (4 folks).

Over the past 2 years it has become more and more clear that our founder prefers / is closer to folks who effectively ""kiss his ass"". 

Let me lay it out for you as objectively as possible.

2 folks on the team don't produce an output and are managers for managers-sake with no associated KPIs. They are generally well-behaved, non-demanding, and are ""happy to lucky"" type. 

2 folks (I fit into this) are what the company relies on for both operation and also revenue. This group is more demanding (as we need to reach goals set out), more realistic (see before), etc. 

We've lost 3 folks from our executive team over the past 3 years who fit into the 2nd category. These folks (and the 2 folks who are in the group) come from relevant industries / backgrounds. Other 2 have seem to have effectively fell upwards due to time with company and founder preference.

&amp;#x200B;

Tried to leave this as objective as possible - any advice would be appreciated. It definitely is tough when we're both relied on for the company's success **but** are also given the cold shoulder at the same time.

Many thanks."

Does anyone have experience with using a resume writing service? Is there one in particular that is recommended? 

I think that I would much rather talk to an individual about what I do, and let them itemize my qualifications (with the ability to communicate back and edit ) rather than do that myself - and, now that I think about it as I'm typing this, it's  actually kind of par for the course for previous roles that I've held where I have been more of the person who runs with the big picture and creates the smaller ideas/minutiae the ends up on descriptive slides..

 Are you bad at self promotion too? Do you also need ideas on how to market yourself or have someone or something that has helped you overcome that issue? I'd love to hear about it!"
2,2022-12-14,Staying in current role versus taking more ambitious job,u/dmalekk,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zmc52w/staying_in_current_role_versus_taking_more/,jobs,"A year ago I started a finance job for a large company in a pretty specific industry.  I have minimal complaints so far, and for the most part, it's exactly what I wanted in a desk job: 35 hour work week; 4 weeks vacation, passionate and supportive manager; lots of work to go around; decent pay that allows me to pay off a mortgage, have disposable income, save some money.  However, my team is small, the department isn't that big either, and turnover isn't high so the room for growth isn't that great from what I see.

Recently, one of my former managers of this previous huge, corporate company that I worked for reached out to me on Linkedin asking if I'm interested in applying to an analyst role with the intent to groom into a supervisor.  I was a contractor for the company at the time, and when my time was up, they didn't have an open role for me under him but he said he would had loved to have me on the team.  I enjoyed the job, but the working conditions were a bit more strict with a specific start time, plenty of boring meetings and calls, 8-5, performance was more heavily measured, more stressful.  But becoming a manager sounds like a good opportunity and challenge.  And this company has unlimited opportunities on top of that.

I take my job seriously and try to excel at it, but I was never career-oriented.  I don't mind working extra hours but also value my time away from work, my mental health, and peace.  Is it worth for me to stay in my comfort zone than turn down a more ambitious role with higher prestige and more money?  Would I regret it?  Has anyone been in a similar situation?"

I got a B.A. in Anthropology, worked simple office jobs for a while and then attended law school and ultimately dropped out. In 2020, I went back to school to complete a web development bootcamp and graduated amidst the onset of the pandemic. I searched for a job for one and a half years, with no luck, while working low-level jobs to support myself. I furthered my education yet again by taking a 4-month course in UX design to add another credential to my resume. I've now been job searching for eight months since then and have not gotten even one interview. I send out 100+ applications per month, and there has  been no movement in my job search whatsoever. I am in my early 30s now and am working in an unrelated job that requires virtually no skill and barely allows me to support myself. My status is embarrassing and my life Dickensian. 

I have done all of the things. Reach out to recruiters. Reach out to hiring managers for jobs I've applied to. Join clubs. Attend networking events. Attend hiring events. Connect with fellow alumni. Complete ""freelance"" projects for next to nothing to gain ""experience"". Participate in mentorship programs. I follow all of the advice given by my mentors. They've OK'd my resume and portfolio. And yet, I cannot even get one interview. ONE. 

The bottom line is that I have no formal experience yet, and I cannot get any since I'm competing with more seasoned professionals with Masters degrees who have been laid off. My freelance work and school projects cannot compete with their 8+ years of professional experience. I WOULD ACCEPT AN UNPAID INTERNSHIP AT THIS POINT, but I'm not even eligible for that because I wouldn't be able to receive school credit since I'm no longer a student. 

I know I am smart and I know I am talented and I cannot go on like this being under-employed, under-paid, and under-valued. I work a job that a monkey could do and everyday I feel my brain atrophying and my soul dying. I have become VERY BITTER. I am even considering going back to school, yet again, for a FIFTH TIME to start over from scratch?!?!!? Maybe learn nursing?? Get a Masters degree?!? I just don't know what to do at this point. 

tl;dr: I'm angry and sad and bitter."

So, I recently applied for a job working for a church in a college ministry. I applied to the job several weeks ago. Whilst applying for the job, I found out that the head priest/pastor of the church got sick and was admitted to the ICU. Well, unfortunately, he did not make it. He passed away this past Tuesday. It was very unexpected and he died of pneumonia/covid. Of course, I want to extend my condolences to his family and the staff. But I am not always good at writing formal letters or emails and would appreciate your suggestions on how to appropriately offer condolences at this time. Have any of you ever run into situations like this and how did you approach it? Would you offer condolences to the family, the other staff, or send a card or email or both? Should it be a physical card? Or an email? I am leaning towards sending a card to his mother or sister and writing an email to one of the staff. I happened to know this priest on a personal basis as he had given me advice/counsel several times on personal/family matters. Does anyone have any advice for how to proceed? How do you respond to tragedy in a situation like this in a way that is both professional and meaningful?"

It's one thing say I mess up but how you say it is another. Like my boss just counts the times I have productivity (rate and things related to rate or quality. But never says where did I go wrong in my quality he just how am I doing and literally just hounds me in politically correct manner.  I'm not knocking him for doing his job but how he does he does it. Like okay yes my job is to work and work correctly and efficiently but his job is manage me is it not. Dude he comes around with his laptop doesn't show me what he has on me but will get on me about my errors but never calls me out on exactly what mistakes I am exactly doing. Like how do I fix myself if you just idle and do nothing but announce to me saying hey your rate or quality is bad. It's annoying you keep hounding me without telling me what I'm doing wrong. Would you like it if I said hey you messed up but don't specify what I did now would you? Am I in wrong for feeling this way I know I am messing up but I made some improvements too my other managers notice and they observe me how come he don't. Why is he my boss if he not gonna lead me to success? That's like me being a trainer when not being a people person. Also everyone knows there is multiple things that can mess with your rate and productivity in my warehouse job not gonna say what cuz it be a TLDR like this already is idk what I should do me and him been having this issue for almost 3 months I been working there like almost my entire employment at this point just him not other two managers. What do I do? He ask what can he do I explain to him he does give me retrains and my trainers see me fixing my mistakes but why can't he just take a minute look at what a boss should do if employees not slacking off and trying? I hardly use bathroom in my shift at all and even so just 5 minutes or so. He doesn't say I'm slacking just that my rate and quality is low he says rate is part of productivity.

I had an interview with a very large UK broadcaster seven working days ago and haven’t heard back. It seemed to go amazingly: loads of really positive replies, discussion of their plans for the new year, asking when I could start and what holiday I had etc. Still, it’s been a week.

In my past experience this has never boded well, but I’ve only ever worked for small businesses or in retail roles that needed filling urgently. 

They also took a month to get back to me after the application, so I’m not sure if that’s just how they are. I got a really good vibe at the end of the interview, which I am normally very good at judging…but one week + has never meant anything good.

Has anyone had any similar experiences with larger employers, or had an offer after so long? I really can’t tell. 

I know, I know…assume you haven’t got it and keep applying! I’ve got an interview coming up and something else in the works, both of which I’m feeing good about. I can’t get this out of my head and just wanted to pick the brains of people with more diverse experience than I have had.

3,2022-12-15,Should I Stay or Should I go?,u/Birchust,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zmktyz/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,jobs,"In a nutshell, I currently live near Oklahoma City making 67k a year, and have been offered another job in Austin Texas making 90k. 

At my current job, I am very comfortable, and it is low stress for me. The downside is that lab work (what I want to do) is very few and far between. So I'm often stuck doing boring document reviews and not very desirable work. I also get to work from home often, and it's extremely flexible. Benefits are great (10% match on 401k). After finishing my engineering degree (I have an associates) my pay will be bumped to 100k at least.

I also own a home on 1.5 acres, with mortgage around $850. I have a dog, so a yard is a must. All my family and friends are here in Oklahoma within an hour from me, and I visit my parents roughly once a month. I'm not into night life and going out, so a bigger city isn't appealing to me in that regard.

Pros of new job:
- I will be doing lab work exclusively
- Gaining more career experience faster
- Austin has a lot to offer outside of work life

Cons of new job:
- Housing market is outrageous and does not appear to be slowing down. Rent for a house with a small yard is 2k a month. Buying a house with even 0.5 acre lot is not likely. 350 to 450k is the going rate.
- I have to contribute 10% of my salary to my 401k with company matching to equal the amount I currently contribute.
- After paying 2k for rent, 401k contributions, and paying for insurance, I will only save an extra $50 to $200 a month more compared to what I do now.
- Far away from family and friends
-Traffic

What would you do in my situation? Any thoughts and opinions are welcome. Thanks!

TL;DR: would you take a 90k job in Austin over a 67k job in OKC?"

There’s another team in our company who come in Mondays and Tuesdays. 

I feel like as I’m new I should make an effort to come in most days, so I usually come in Mon, Tues and Thurs and work from home on Friday. I’ve been in this job a month and on Thursdays no one else in either teams come in, except for this guy from the other team who I think comes into the office everyday. So every Thursday it’s just been me and him in the office.

He’s never made me feel uncomfortable, and I’ve been made to feel safe working with him, but I just feel uncomfortable working alone in the office with a man. I’m 27 and I think he’s in his early to mid 40s. I’m the first professional job I had when I was 22-24 I was sexually harassed by two guys- one was 8 years older than me and the other one was 45, so around the same age as the guy I’m working with now In my new job.

My manager suggested that since I’m off uni for Christmas until the end of January, I should swap my uni day to another day so that I’m in the office the same days as her and the other people in my team. This is great because then I feel like I don’t have to overcompensate by coming in an extra day. When I go back to uni, I think I’m going to stop coming in on Thursdays, so I’m not alone with this guy, what do you all think?"

My only idea at the moment is to recommend them to volunteer for Red Cross perhaps to have some sort of experience and remove the years for the uni, but that will still not fix all these years of unemployment.

Other agents say the position is 1099 and not W-2, so I would classify as an independent contractor despite “mandatory” meetings and such. The company has had to pay out a class action for misclassifying employees before.
I know it’s shady, but I’ve been unemployed 2 years due to disability. 300+ applications sent and no bites except for this, and they do pay pretty decent commission.
But, I was wondering if a 1099 contractor could, under Colorado law, pressure this company into compensating training and meeting time. The position already doesn’t meet the CDLE requirements for what can be asked of a contractor."

I already have my R01 and R05 and will look at completing other exams later next year. Whilst I love the small company I work for now is it time to branch out and learn with a whole of market IFA?

As I have finished my apprenticeship I have been offered to be a trainee paraplanner within the business. I would love to eventually be an adviser but figure I need the experience as a paraplanner writing reports and building my knowledge first. The salary will be competitive for a trainee paraplanner and I'm sure in the future I will be able to progress into an adviser role in the business.

The only thing I'm not so certain on is if I would be missing valuable knowledge if I was to stay within a restricted paraplanning role? Would I be better going into an independent firm - or would it be worth it and going into an IFA later on when I eventually become an adviser? Would it also be looking at trainee financial adviser roles?

I wanted any thoughts you guys have which I haven't considered?"

And one of the questions is what do you want to do within the next year and if you identified any hurdles how can the company help you? 

I'm not using the real industry because I know people from work read the sub. so am just going to use marketing as an example. 

so I am a marketing tech writer, the next role I wanna move up to as marketing coordinator. 

So my current position is basically a technical writer for the marketing team. And my direct supervisor is the Director of marketing. She has been very supportive. I told her I would like to be a coordinator within the next calendar year and she verbally supported me. She even told me some classes to take at a local university branch that have helped other people advance to the coordinator position. We're just pending an acquisition finalization before they can get a final sign off on those classes. 

S*o the part to help wording--* one of the ways they could help me would be to actively giving me stuff to do in order to prepare for the coordinator role. So for example I wrote something along the lines of ""I understand there is a balance between actively seeking out opportunities my self, but it would also be supportive if the team could find ways to utilize my current skill set to provide opportunities to learn new skills to get experience for the future role."".

I've been completely WFH since COVID. My wife uses our 1 car to go to work. I very much enjoy remote work, but always said that I would go back into an office for the right amount of money. It's not my preferred choice, but money talks.

I've recently received a job offer that is a 50% salary increase. It's not an understatement to say it would dramatically improve my family's financial situation, based on salary alone.

The job is for a big company (hundreds of millions in yearly revenue) which would provide a lot of stability and potential for growth in the future for my family.

However, the job is in an office with no option for remote work. 

The commute is only 15 minutes; not bad at all. However, as mentioned, we are a 1 car family. I would either have to buy my own car or take an Uber/Lyft everyday which would cost more over time than just buying my own car. Nor can my wife drive me to the job site. It's not in the direction of her own job; it would add 15-20 minutes one way to her commute everyday. Public transportation is not really an option either unless I want an hour commute one way.

I'm looking for opinions. We already have one car payment so adding a second one doesn't sound fun, but the salary increase is enough that I believe the extra car payment/insurance wouldn't eat into it too much. Of course, there are other expenses with a car I can't predict; repairs, oil changes, etc. that can/will add up.

Is it worth it to buy a car and add this extra financial burden for this position and accept the job? Or should I keep looking, maybe for another remote job, and avoid purchasing a car entirely?

**EDIT: Looks like I should have added specific numbers. I'm going from $55K to $80K.**"

He told me his lawyers would have the paperwork done right after Thanksgiving. Fast forward to today now it seems as if he really had no intention of actually selling me the business and it was more of a tactic to get me to stay because I have heard nothing else of it and he isn’t acting like he’s ready to move on.

2,2022-12-15,Roles for Introverts,u/rgoellner,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zmomzg/roles_for_introverts/,jobs,"I'm an engineer by degree and I've worked various engineering jobs over the last 10+ years - I'm currently working on proposals but I've worked in execution/design too. 

I hate it. The stress is too much for me personally and I'm desperate to switch roles/industries. I constantly feel like I'm drowning and forced into that ""Hustle culture""...I don't want to live my life for my career, I just want to get paid so I can enjoy life outside of work. I'm tired of feeling like I'm forced to take the next big role when I'm not confident that I've really learned my current role.

I'm wondering if there are jobs that people have found that work well with introverted and/or anxious personality types. While this isn't true for all introverts, I prefer to be left alone and collaborate with my coworkers, as needed. I work best with clear expectations and I like the routine of working on similar things each day. I struggle with anxiety so I tend to need external forces like deadlines to motivate me but I'm bright and pick things up quickly. I'm also very friendly and can get along with most people, I just prefer to work and think alone. Honestly, I just want to show up each day and be successful with my tasks and then leave work at work.

Has anyone found a career that they feel like they can thrive in?"

My job has good health insurance and I would really not like to lose it. But I also couldn’t tell my job why I needed to leave or at least I wouldn’t be comfortable doing so as they a. Wouldn’t understand. And b. Wouldn’t they then see me as a “weak link” and seek to fire me?

Anyways my schedule is really sporadic at the moment and it keeps changing day to day. So I thought it was best to not fill out that section and instead just wait for the recruiter to suggest a time. After all, it was labeled "" optional "" so I thought it was not required.

But I haven't heard back from the recruiter. I'm wondering if it was rude to not fill this out? Is that why they're not responding back?

Previous to that I was always in an HR/Trainer/Manager role. I am currently completing my MBA and know I will be re-joining the workforce around September when my youngest starts school.

I know my experience and skillset match those of senior management, but the gap in my resume may be problematic. I would like to take a few more classes and certifications before I start applying in hopes it will counterbalance the time off.

My options are getting

1. Masters in Data Analytics from WGU
2. Business Analytics Certification from Wharton
3. Professional Certificate in Strategic Management from Wharton
4. Google Project Management: Professional Certificate
5. Business Management Certificate from Vanderbilt
6. Yale School of Management Executive Education Certifications

I would like to get a combination of these, but I want them to make sense on my resume.

I am familiar and have done the work required for these roles, but unfortunately I didn't think ""titles"" mattered previously so I'm hoping the certificates illustrate my hard skills.

The competition is tough and though there remains a shortage of Ophthalmologists—finding that perfect opportunity is not always easy. So, here are a few pointers to ensure that your first job or the next is not only fulfilling but also highly compensated.

1. **Make a list:** It’s important that you take note of what you want or expect for your next position that includes, career priorities, geographical location, autonomy, work-life balance, compensation or specific clinical interests. You can also identify available practice settings and how each of these settings can affect your experience.
2. **Look for options online:** Begin networking with colleagues, interview different types of practices, compare offers and eventually narrow it down to one-two top choices and start in that direction to pull in your efforts to applying to similar positions you’ve chosen.
3. **Be open for relocation:** A good rule of thumb is to have at least three different areas where you are willing to work. Since compensation, patient demands, and patient volume might all vary greatly based on where you live. Depending on the law of supply and demand, you will likely see much higher compensation from other locations needing specialists. 

Feel free to message if you have any questions!"

My company is smaller, but when I signed my contract, it stated that I would be eligible for benefits starting at 60 days and bonuses were included and outlined during onboarding. Well, about one month ago, I had a situation with a manger where I was being heavily micromanaged and ultimately it came down to me asking if we could talk about which management style works best for us. Things seemed okay, and she even sent me an email saying she was impressed with my transparency about what I needed as an employee. She put smiley faces…. but I guess that small thing started an avalanche. I have been consistently more micromanaged (I am assuming manager communicated with the team on some level about our discussion, so now everyone is micromanaging me) and have been challenged with on very basic things, and so much more I can’t even fit here. I was and am also consistently reminded of my 90 day introductory period (which is actually now over/ the handbook says 60 days, but I guess they changed it to 90) and they’ve been using that over my head. Anyway, today, I overheard two coworkers talking about how unimpressed they were with their holiday bonuses. Obviously, I didn’t get a holiday bonus. It was outlined in my paperwork when I signed an offer, but I had assumed that the team wasn’t getting one. I would likely be the only person on my small team to not get one and nothing was communicated to me about it. I asked amongst my group chat if this was normal and a few of my friends think I should bring it up, along with my lack of insurance promised after the 60 day period, now apparently 90 day to HR. Any advice on what to do here?

JFC, obviously due to the environment, I am not completely comfortable here and want to look for other jobs, I am just waiting until the new year after the holiday season."

I honestly never really thought I would go to Reddit for this sort of thing but here I am.  I've been applying for dozens of jobs in my area or about 25 minutes away from me after leaving my 2nd job of about 4 months due to my life getting endangered during a night shift, along with being in a toxic/hostile work environment with none of the managers caring about their employees. I have \~1 year of experience with customer service and cash handling, 1 year of food service while having have reliable transportation and no criminal record.

The jobs I have been applying for are very basic jobs that I know I'm qualified to do and would do well at, like being a cashier at a grocery store (or at a café too) or being a receptionist at a business/hotel. I have submitted at least around a few applications and I have been rejected from almost all of them, the ones I wasn't rejected from have been ignored, even after getting an interview with the places I really wanted to work at. I have good references and a full resume. I had only a couple jobs in the beginning of my resume from when I was about 18, but other than that, my job history would be described as good to be exact than most of my old coworkers (which in my opinion, I think theirs are better than mine). There is also an employment crisis in my area and everywhere is understaffed so I would think a qualified worker with a flexible schedule would be helpful to have, even while heading to college in the spring soon.

I genuinely can't see what the cause for the rejection is, so if anyone has any tips for this, please let me know. I can only find tips for being rejected after an interview but I'm getting half of those so I'm just really not sure what to do.

Edit 1: I also wanna clarify that I have applied for 10 jobs so far and looking to apply for more tomorrow (maybe through Indeed again but it's gonna get me nowhere for sure.) since I'm currently waiting for a callback from one of the places I applied for while also trying to follow up with them tomorrow.

Edit 2: Thank you all for the comments/advice and will keep all of them in mind for future reference, I just landed a job at a local cafe today so I'm pretty excited about it :)"

Last Wednesday my fine arts department head and principal brought me in and out of nowhere and no explanation said they are putting me at part time next year. It’s an incredibly affluent school. At first it was predicated on my number of students. I started in 2019 with only 8 singers. Now I have 30. This has happened to so many of the arts teachers the last six years. I feel like it’s a bad move considering there are not many POC on faculty. I’m mature enough to know if I’ve had any missteps and I can’t think of anything that warrants this action. It’s confusing because I’d get consistent shout outs from students that admin would email on how much they love working with me. No contract just employee agreement so it’s at-will.

Job B (hybrid) = 1 hour (60 miles) commute 6 days a month, driving personal vehicle, I estimate it would cost $1500-2000 yearly (gas, car maintenance, etc.).

When I average it out, job B would be less of a daily commute combining WFH days and commute days. However, I'd be paying more for the commute with job B, plus more car use = more maintenance costs."

I’ve had a bit of an existential crisis lately as well as a crisis of conscience, and I’ve decided that I may do a postdoc, but after that, I think I want to leave academia and do something more directly helpful.

I'm just sad... It *feels* unfair to be getting paid less for mandatory days off. Even though I know intellectually that I just came in at a bad time, and this is just how most entry level jobs work.

I emphasize on “bridges” because this is a top company that I might want to return to in the future, but right now, I don’t think I want to accept the offer. I want to frame my words in such a way that I’m not blacklisted from reapplying in the future - maybe to a different position - if I ever choose to do so.

Thanks."

Had killer experience, answered all of the questions right, felt fantastic vibes during the virtual interview, and then two days later got an email saying that they’ve decided to go with someone else.  If anything, I’m overqualified for the position and was lowering my standards to get a foot in with a good company.

Just last week I was almost convinced I got a very good remote job interview, I was so excited after WEEKS of rejections and ghosting. I was very lucky that in my current state I had my roommate and friend sit with me. 

They listed a job on Indeed, looked legit, and sent an official looking email as well for a text inquiry/interview. They had me download the Signal messenger app, of which I later learned deleted old messages after a period of time. They asked for an interview over it, which was weird but I'm used to multiple interviews by now. Something that grabbed my attention was that the job itself was for JY construction, but the person interviewing me was with a concrete company.

They sent me a website (https://www.jyconstructionco.com/), asked me to look over it, then started with questions. More about my availability and why they should hire me. Then at the end they said I scored an 8.5/10 and I was hired! Congratulations! (What???) Now I was supposed to buy very specific equipment from one of their providers including an HP 18"" laptop. Yes they'd send me a check in the mail, and when pushed says that the contract I was to sign would be mailed with the check. I finally asked, twice, for a number to call so I can talk to an actual person.

Now I have been left on read since last week, and thankfully they didn't get anything out of me. Please be careful, scammers prey on desperate people like me, so be sure to stay safe. Back to the hiring board..."

I keep applying to practically every single job around here in NJ, I keep going to all these interviews, and not *ONE* single place ever calls me back or gives a damn I showed up for the interview (one interview in particular they basically told me to go home before said interview was even over)

Apparently getting a job so I can afford to go to acting school (so I can go get a career in acting), afford to pay for driving school so I can get my license, and afford to pay bills is too much to ask for

Hell, my most recent job screwed me over *BIG* time. It was supposed to be a seasonal pop-up shop gig which started back at the end of October, yet they paid bi-weekly, gave me the bare minimum of hours, and then I got fired for getting upset that they refused to schedule me at *all* for 2 weeks straight despite asking for as much hours as I could do

Why is it so hard for me specifically to get a good job around here?"

Salutations!

I am writing this to inform you of my interests and qualifications to apply at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for the position of Chemistry Research Technician 4. I am excited to have this opportunity, as Los Alamos is the crown jewel of the national laboratory system, in my opinion. I am a recently graduated master’s student in chemistry. While specializing in nanoparticle synthesis and characterization, the skills learned from this are easily transferable into other chemical fields. With these skills, I know I could be a valuable asset to the LANL.  

The job listing mentions needing someone with experience with myriad seperation techniques and analytical techniques. I’m glad to inform you that I have said experience, particularly in solvent extraction, chromatography, crystallization/precipitation, FTIR, UV-vis Spectroscopy, Fluorescence spectroscopy, SEM, sputter coating, and have studied X-Ray spectroscopy. These techniques provide the background for any competent chemist wishing to start their career in research.  

I eagerly await hearing back from the hiring committee to discuss my qualifications in more detail. I’m available anytime throughout the week. I’ll be in touch within seven business days to verify you’ve received my application.  

Sincerely and respectfully,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"

Give them a number and see if they meet it.

You have to know a few things first:
- what the average pay for the position is in your area
- if you're truly qualified to do the work
- the amount you would need to make a move work and beneficial for you.

Do all the research you can beforehand and go in with a number range. Feel free to high ball them first and see what they come back with. I've secured multiple jobs with clearly stating what they get with me and how much I cost. I also missed out on jobs because they thought I was too expensive but that's fine I found something else.

It is these hiring people's job to get qualified people at the lowest price. If you're truly qualified for the job and know you can knock it out of the park you command a premium. 

Don't ask for their offer, tell them how much your time costs."

My former employer tried to match the offer and move me to another department where I may be exposed to newer technology, but I decided to take this other job instead. There were some aspects about this job at the time I found exciting that my current company couldn’t offer. Despite me turning down their counter offer, my company wished me well and said to keep in touch. 

Now I am one week into my new job and I’m realizing how much I hate it. It’s not what I had envisioned and is appearing more stressful than my last job. I don’t know how long I should stick it out at this company and if my old job would even take me back. I have actually left them before, but upon my second return I stayed for five years before leaving to take this position. Is it crazy to return to a company for the third time?

I’ve learned that I’ve been approved for hire but they are waiting on more business before I can be offered.

Of course I’m still exploring other opportunities, but I still really want this job. At the very least I wish I had a firm “yes” or “no” after months of waiting with the same boiler-plate response that they really like me, remain interested, are waiting to see, and so forth.

I was getting the hang of things and I was learning well and even started to make a few friends. Come to find out about two weeks later, I was let go because the “season ended”. I was so frustrated and disappointed once again because I really thought I landed a job. I then came in to drop off my name tag and pick up my check but meanwhile I was there, I overheard when one of the girls asked the manager why I was being let go, her tone kind of changed and became low. I found that to be strange but eventually I moved on once again.
4. My fourth attempt I actually landed in a pharmacy as a clerk. So I came to the interview and I let the interviewer know my availability is anytime but on Saturdays because i’m also a college student. I ONCE AGAIN was hired on the spot and came in a few weeks later for my first day. This job was very overwhelming and sort of stressful, it was nothing like retail or my previous jobs, but I was getting used to things there and was still in training. The lead pharmacist who hired me seemed kind and charming at first but then he sort of changed? I started getting strange vibes from him and I began to almost not like him anymore because something felt off. So, about 2 and half weeks go by and I’m there at my shift doing my job, but then the lead pharmacist ( the one who hired me ) calls me over because he needs to “talk to me”. So I get up and I walk over to the office room and we all sit down and he proceeds to tell me that my “schedule isn’t a good fit for him” and that he was looking for someone who can work anytime (mind you i’m a college student) and I was so confused because he knew this already but all of sudden has a problem with it? so after my shift ended I pretty much texted him i’m not gonna bother to even come back if he’s gonna replace me either way once he finds someone else. But yeah, that’s my story or stories and honestly it sucks and i’m kind of hurt not gonna lie, like damn how can people be so inconsiderate."

He has been bad from the get go. Nothing I have ever asked of him has been done, nothing I've complained about has been legitimately fixed. Within a month, he was just ignoring me and most people. I wasn't going to him alot, nagging. But when I'd find another driver had left pallets in the truck we share, I'd text a picture and that this isn't cool. It happened maybe once a week or every other week. As he ignored me and others more and more, I started getting more and more frustrated. Eventually, I dumped the contents of the truck in front of boss' office. The log said he was the last one to use the truck, so I returned his mess to him. The other drivers saw this and mostly stopped leaving stuff.


It seems the other drivers got the message to stop leaving their stuff on the truck for me to deal with. But based on what another driver has said, ""I know you get pissy"" while gesturing towards boss' office, I'm positive he's ""fixed it's by telling them I'm a bitch/pissy/mean and they need to stop for sake of me being mean. 


I walked through the office earlier and overheard part of a conversation between boss and another driver ""she's just mean. I mean, I like everybody..."" There was a pause, and when I walked around the corner the boss was ""on the phone"" and in a different conversation than I had heard part of. 


I'm at a loss what to do or what can be done. I feel I have a right to be frustrated with coworkers leaving their work for me. I feel it's sexist to leave me extra work and call me mean/pissy for not being happy about it.  What do I do?"

If he switch to UPS, it would mean a big pay cut. He’s currently making around $60,000 but his current job requires lots of travel and overtime. The UPS job is around $40,000, closer to home, and has a fixed schedule. My husband is hoping that he could move up to a managerial role and get his salary back up.

The email had a link which redirected me to an online calender and I saw lots of open slots. There were slots open for the next 2 weeks! I picked an early slot and set up the interview.

The interview seemed to go well and the recruiter also said "" I'll see you next week. "" with a smile. So I thought I got selected for the next round.

Then came next week, and I heard nothing. I contemplated reaching out but I thought it would be better to just wait and not appear desperate. Then later that week they sent me an email saying "" Thank you for application but the position has been filled. ""

Now I just have 1 question. Usually when you get selected for a second round.........does that mean that the recruiter will reach out to you again and send you another email? Or do they expect you to make contact? I'm wondering if I was supposed to click on that online calendar again.....because after all, it had 2 weeks of open slots. 2 weeks of open slots sounds a little unusual right? Has anyone else been through an interview process like this? Did you go back to the same calendar to make the 2nd appointment or did they send you a new link??

One of the supplier directors joined the meeting on video while clearly driving. I don't thing that's the best idea but at this point  gave him the benefit of the doubt that he joined while parked and was just listening. 

Anyway about 15 minutes in he gets asked a question, picks up his phone, comes off mute and answers while holding it up one handed. 

I dont know what country he was in but it's either UK or Poland. Anyway I cut in at that point and asked him to leave the call as I was concerned for his safety. ""hey (supplier director) I can see you are driving. I'm really concerned for your wellbeing and for those about you. Could you hang up please and we can update you afterwords""

I removed him from the meeting to make sure. 

Anyway its 2 hours later and my boss has a complaint that I was rude and forcibly removed him from the call. To be fair to my work he left out a lot of detail like clearly being in a moving car. 

To be fair to my work they are supportive of the action I took and its not going anywhere. 

From a personal standpoint I would do this again. Not only is it dangerous but I was the most senior person there from my company. I don't want any of our team thinking it's acceptable or required to be so overworked you join meetings while driving. 

I'll need to catch up with the rest of our projet teams as word will get out a complaint was raised against me. I'm good with that as I believe in my behaviour but curious to see how you guys would have handled that? 

If you were the junior in the call would you have supported someone senior doing this including removing the other person from the call? Or if it was you driving how would you have handled that complaint? 

Every day throws up something interesting 😁

Edit to make it clear. The call was on video, I interrupted when he picked up his phone and held it in one hand while still driving but trying to divide his attention between the road and us as he was talking. I don't think that was very clear in my post

Listening in to a call while driving doesn't fuss me when it's just audio and your Bluetooth is on. Though I'm pretty sure that's still not advisable."

**TL/DR: Which is more beneficial (or damaging) to my prospects of finding that career changing move I truly want - staying in my current job (which is relaxed, supportive, stable, but almost too relaxed!) OR taking a new job (with better pay/location/title, but a less friendly feel to it and the position of actively searching before/just after accepting)?**

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a fairly recent university/college graduate in my second job in as many years since graduating. (I'm also 34, worked in catering mostly before finally getting back to uni).

The first job was really not right for me, so I left for my current role in a different industry after 7 months. It turns out this second role/industry really isn't what I expected and not offering the variety and depth of challenges I am looking for.

I am very keen to think carefully about my next move, as I don't want to look to recruiters like a risky bet, and I want to find the type of work I can excel at.

I randomly came across a job posting, which is essentially the same duties as my current role, but with significantly higher pay (30% higher), better location, and a better job title for my CV/resume.

I couldn't pass it by, so I applied, interviewed, and got an offer! 

My question is: which is more beneficial (or damaging) to my prospects of finding that career changing move I truly want - staying in my current job (which is relaxed, supportive, stable, but almost too relaxed!) or taking the new job (with better pay/location/title, but a less friendly feel to it and the position of actively searching before/just after accepting)?

Any thoughts at all would be really appreciated!

I'll take anyone's advice.,u/allyoucandoisbitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zne6md/im_torn_between_going_back_to_my_old_job_or/,jobs,"Quit my job in September with no notice after my old boss made me mad.  Now they're reaching out asking me to come back.  I had worked there for 8.5 years, working my way up to the general manager position. I only held that position for this year so I didn't get a ton of experience but it was something that came fairly easily to me.  It's fast food and only paid $36,000/year for me to be there 60-80 hours a week and constantly be contacted at home. Never got to use any vacation time ever when I worked there because there was always some kind of crisis that prevented it.  But yet I miss it in the sense that maybe half of the days were good but that was also when my old coworker worked there and she quit in July.  That's what really pushed me out was not having her help anymore.  We were a great team that made the store run well and now I'm being contacted because the store has fallen apart so I'd have to clean it all up by myself if I come back. 


And I know I could turn it around even though it would be frustrating to do so.  I just don't know that I want to.  I've done it before so I know what works and what doesn't but I just don't know that I want to. It would be nice to not be the new guy at another job and to come back to something familiar. But I feel like I'll just be returning to the same bullshit. The only difference is I'm on my own and don't have my old co-worker's help.  Apparently the store is down to 17 staff now from the 35 that were there when I quit.  I'm not afraid of the hard work and love the running around cleaning, helping everyone, I always had schedules done weeks in advance, I loved the inventory and doing truck orders and putting the stuff away and organizing it all. 


I haven't had a job since September but I'm fine financially. I've been trying to find remote jobs and making enough passive income so far that I'm not in a desperate position to need to go back.  But is it stupid for me to have the goal of remote work when I'm basically being offered my old job back?

I've applied to other jobs since quitting and have been contacted by all of them but I never respond because I chicken out at the thought of being the new guy.  It's something at the time of quitting that I had thought I was ready for but I guess I'm not. 
I feel like I have this nostalgic outlook when it comes to my old job but in reality, I had to come in on my days off when the store was closed in order to have time to do truck orders and schedules and inventory. We always had call ins and broken equipment and the district manager was extremely incompetent.


If I could get over the nervousness of being the new guy somewhere else, I'd say screw them and not think twice about going back.  I want to be able to look back at my time there and appreciate the good experience and not have it ruined by coming back to the shitshow it is now.  But are there even jobs where I could be in charge of inventory and ordering?  Is my goal of wanting a remote job unrealistic?  I feel like I haven't had enough time to explore my options but maybe I just need a reality check."

It’s all just a bit intense. I have never done a serious interview, only a couple for part time jobs that lasted about 10-30mins.

The same company (it's a big company) posted a really similar job at a different location. I'd love to work for them. Since I haven't received a response yet, should I apply to this new posting? Should I contact the recruiter I've been talking to? Or should I just wait (it's been 4 days since).

So I work in a relatively small warehouse, my job is a lead picker which entails making sure our orders are picked and ready to go on their ship date, we recently moved to a new city last year and outside of myself, the CEO and the COO everyone is new to this warehouse, including my boss.

December is a very slow time for us since most of our product is gardening and construction materials, between me and the other order picker we have our work caught up to mid January, recently the CFO (who started last January) has been giving our boss flak for the us not doing anything (standing around, talking, taking smoke breaks together) mind you most of our busy days we work through our breaks and take a total of 15-20 mins of breaks a day with just a quick smoke here and there.

Our boss has been coming out to the floor to tell us we have orders that were behind on (in her words: ""we have dozens of orders that we're behind on"") everytime I talk to our logistics coordinator he tells us that the only orders we have are for product that our sister facility hasn't produced yet, otherwise we have 4 orders for the whole next month. Even our forklift operators are telling us that the only reason we hear anything is because our CFO is giving our boss shit, so she comes out and gives us shit, when I started with the company 3 years ago it was never like this, it seems more so that we're just getting roped into office politics, and don't get me wrong, I would much prefer to have work to do instead of staring into space for 8 hours a day.

I loved this company but it seems with all the new office employees it's becoming more of a slog, the whole shipping department has been debating finding new jobs over Christmas break and telling this one to kick rocks if this is how it's going to be, our boss has also taken on 3 other departments in the building and now none of them have been overly productive, our inventory is wildy inaccurate, production is behind, and we over order materials to the point where we have no floor space, the only department that ever seems to be in the green is shipping.

Is there any way I can approach this with them? Or would it be best to take my team and find new jobs?

TLDR: CFO gives our boss shit for us not having work to do, our boss gives us shit for having no work to do, we have no work to do which just makes us walk around and look busy for 8 hours a day."

And I hate my job,u/lawyahz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/znhmoq/i_feel_like_ive_been_lied_to_and_used_and_i_hate/,jobs,"When I interviewed I was desperate for a good job. I applied to my recent role and went through all rounds. What caught my eye about this role was the opportunity to work with different brands and work specifically on crossbrand things. Well after I got the job I was informed that my boss would not be my boss and that I would be working under the boss' subordinate who heads one specific brand. 

My field is one that focuses entirely on brands and their images. So I was a bit unhappy that I wouldn't be working for the head of all the brands and would he working under the head of the one brand. At first, I would get projects specifically for all brands or collaborations. Now just for that specific brand. And I've been trained on all aspects of that specific brand and I have so much work/ tasks that have been handed to me from the director and manager - I don't have time for other brands or projects. It's upsetting. I feel robbed and unhappy. To be frank, out of the brands I was meant to work with this is the brand I don't understand or feel excitement over the most.. I feel like there's no creativity and the vibes are just different for this brand. I am SOO unhappy. I have become lazy. And unproductive. I want to quit. But I like the company overall. It's just my position and team. They're nice but I think they expect me to put my 100% for this brand when my position was for all of them. My title states all brands but I mainly work for two brands. 

Please give me some advice it hasn't been a full year at my job, like other companies my company is also having budget cuts so don't want to push it. I am looking for jobs and applying but I'm upset. I like the people a lot, I have had opportunities to work on different projects but not at the capacity I wanted. I also feel like my boss keeps me away from more ""advance"" meetings and doesn't take my ideas into account. I know I'm mote new but I have been known for my creative ideas/events.

- also another note, to be frank I also feel more like an assistant than a assistant manager. My boss asks me to print stuff out for her photoshoots and she doesnt even ask that favor from our coordinator (who's been here a bit longer) I don't mind but I feel undervalued.."

6,2022-12-16,Laid off without enough experience,u/escarglow,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zni4uh/laid_off_without_enough_experience/,jobs,"I was laid off last week. I've been applying like crazy to anything and everything my degree (English) could be remotely related to. December is an awful month for hiring, so my expectations aren't super high. But things are worse than I expected.

I keep getting rejected without interviews. For the most part, I'm getting automated responses that don't actually explain why. Twice I've received actual personal rejections, both of which explained that I don't have enough experience. And that's true! I don't! Even ""entry level"" roles are listed as wanting 3, or at least 2-5, years of experience and my job laid me off at one year, seven months. So I don't have enough experience. I list my college work on my resume, but that still doesn't get me to three years, and that's *if* a company is nice enough to consider that real experience.

I don't know what to do. I have rent and bills to pay and unlike most people, I have no family to reach out to. I'd change my industry if I could, but what industry other than marketing would allow an English major into an entry level role? I can't afford to go back to school to get any other degree, though I wish I could. It doesn't help that my previous job was paying me well ($50k) and that I'll inevitably take a pay cut anywhere I go. 

I'd freelance for extra experience and portfolio work, but I've had zero luck getting freelance work on Upwork, Fiverr, etc. Like absolutely no bites whenever I'm actively looking. So I have no experience, no recent portfolio work, and no job prospects. What are people who aren't new grads, but also not established supposed to do?"

2,2022-12-16,Advice dealing with a drawn out Background Check and running out of time for proper notice to current employer?,u/Valkyr1983,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zniau9/advice_dealing_with_a_drawn_out_background_check/,jobs,"Been employed in my current job for just over 3 years. Really like it, nice people and relaxed environment. Have plenty of work to do but not a crazy workload, etc. Normally that all sounds good and would definitely stay here long term except one problem, I feel I'm very much underpaid for my role.

This company does not do evaluations or offer pay raises except a company wide COL increase which even that has been sporadic. Got one COL increase this  year for 5% which is great but has done little to offset inflation or how expensive everything has gotten. Either way, my 95K goes a lot shorter these 3 years later than it did when I was hired on. to be fair I havent sat down with management and asked for one either, but I felt dissuaded to given we were told there was no budget for pay increases and a coworker in IT with me was turned down for a raise they asked for. 

Either way, wasnt really seeking new employment either way but a headhunter found me and asked me to interview for this new job. Took it because I figured why not, turns out not only is the position full remote which will cut down on the 2 hours I commute each day, but its for 127k base salary plus a sign on bonus and 5% guaranteed bonus each year (not performance based). This all sounds great so I interviewed, apparently knocked it out of the park and had a verbal offer a few hours after I hung up the phone. got a written offer letter that I signed later that week and was starting to feel excited. 

Then I got the invite to do a FirstAdvantage background check and its been all downhill from there. Asking for my high school transcript (I graduated 22 years ago and how is that relevant, plus I have never requested that before). Was able to get, now we are getting into the weeds with requesting W2 documents from previous employers, again I never keep old W2 forms so had to create this ridiculous ID account for the IRS website and log in, got Wage documents from there and provided in the hopes that it will suffice. It does show the tax year, partial name and SSN and partial company info.

Either way, was hoping to have the all clear to give a notice by today but I have no idea how much longer this will drag on, drug screen is atleast done though.

this leads into the big issue. Im supposed to be out on vacation starting this weekend until the 3rd of january, im always habitually last minute on my PTO and we have a use-it or lose-it type system. Well if I were able to give notice today my plan was to work with my current employer and offer to work from now up until the 9th of january and not take time off to train my coworkers, in exchange for them paying out my time off. Then I would take the time off between my last day here on the 9th and the first day of the new job on the 16th. Im very adamant I do not want to work up until the last day at one job and start the next job that next monday. I feel i REALLY need a window to mentally reset and prepare for new role.

But at this rate, I have no idea of knowing when the screening process will finish and im running out of time to give my employer a notice and still leave that buffer between jobs, the new company also seemed pretty strict about starting on January 16th as I accepted the job offer several weeks ago.

Any advice navigating this situation? I feel uneasy even giving ""only"" two weeks as in the past, employers have been upset with that. Ive actually given a full month notice of still working my last 2 jobs to avoid this. Perhaps im being played because they simply were upset im moving on and they knew I had a lot of the responsibilities, or perhaps 2 weeks is no longer the standard?

Either way, I dont want to leave my current employer on bad terms but also dont want to walk away from 2.5 weeks of PTO ive worked hard for, and I think I would have a rough start without the small break between jobs but its looking like one or two of these three things is going to get sacrificed. 

Any advice appreciated, sorry for the super long rant i didnt expect to type this long."

I was recently encouraged to apply to a leadership role at my alma mater for an incredible opportunity. The position is the job I've wanted to move toward for several years, blending work between student and academic affairs.

I wasn't really looking, but I thought this would be a great experience and decided to see how the interview went, if for nothing more than practice. I've made it to the final round( of four) and will attend a full-day interview next week. I've gotten really excited about the opportunity, and If I'm offered the job, I'm going to take it.

However, I'm feeling guilty that I've not been transparent with my current employer that I'm looking. Over the years, especially post-COVID, our team has been transparent and discussed each other's future plans, etc. They know and support that I want to move on eventually since I'm currently in a role outside my expertise, which has been limiting for me. Still, I don't think they expect it to happen now; like many other academic departments, we are overworked and understaffed.

In the past, I let my current supervisor know when I was applying to other roles, but nothing ever worked out, and I felt like it branded me as having one foot out the door and may have cost me some opportunity to work on cool projects. I don't think it has been retaliatory, but it has still been a bummer.

So I have kept this process private; I don't want to ruin my chances at my current institution if this opportunity doesn't pan out. However, I feel guilty that I haven't informed them about it. These people have watched me grow as a professional, and I care about them. Of course, I will obviously give ample notice if I'm offered the position.

TLDR; When is the right time to tell my employer that I'm actively interviewing for an external role, or do I wait until I have a new contract in hand?"

Interview: Got into the 1st round of group interview with the store manager, and found out candidates are from many different industries. Didn't get the offer. I tried the following:

1) Kept smiling during the entire conversation to appear friendly;

2) Emphasized my language ability because the store I was looking is located in a community mainly populated by Chinese-immigrants.

3) Demonstrated my conversation skills by telling a story of how I dealt with a difficult customer through walking her through the entrie service process.

The new field is a 9-5 desk job like the last one but there are intense group collaboration requirements. I have trouble with my mental health and am finding this to be very difficult for me to do. It is triggering my depression and anxiety in very serious ways. 

My employer offered me to either get a doctor note saying I can work or take a compassionate leave of 30 days with the intent of returning to the position. 

I’m planning on taking the leave so I can start feeling better and also so I can try to start a business I’ve been trying to get off the ground for months, but I haven’t had the energy to do so. 

But as I mentioned the catch is actually returning to my position. I’m already the weakest team member on the team and we are ramping up with a lot of initiatives for 2023. I’ve been warned it will get much tougher since the pace will be accelerated and also been told that I’m not meeting collaborative group work expectations. 

I don’t think I can make it in this position but if I take the leave I’m expected to return. I was thinking of taking it, trying the job when I get back for maybe a month if possible. I know it is highly discouraged to do so but I may have to quit before finding another position due to mental health. 

My question is should I still take this leave knowing that I likely will not be able to perform the job for long after I return? I’m concerned that I’m burning bridges just by my lack of performance and now the possibility of quitting after a leave. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you."

Even from call centers. It has been making my depression worse when I get rejections from jobs I was so sure I would get because I had the experience needed. It's even worse when I get ghosted by these job and just never hear back. 

I don't understand what I am doing wrong that not even call centers want me. My mom thinks my old job with the government is what is poisoning my job searching since I am being rejected from even low paying jobs. I didn't want to believe her but now I am starting to think so too.

I think this because have been getting rejection emails of ""your background is impressive and your experience and skills are valuable but we aren't moving forward with your application"" over and over. I even had a staffing agency in my town say to me when they looked at my resume ""I don't think we can find someone for you."" And they couldn't. They tried but couldn't.

I don't know what to do to overcome this. I can't just take the job off the resume and I don't want to just limit myself to government job searches."

I am asian born and bread, living in France, got a Bac, an MBA and a Master from a prestige school.

I worked so hard, i thought it would pay off eventually.

And it was, kinda. I got my first english speaking job in Paris, it was a low paid, but i was young, i needed to start somewhere and so i accepted it without hesitation. I always felt inferior to my french / french speaking colleagues as i didn't speak french and i often heard about their big salary increase by the year end, but not mine. Plus, it's hard to be a foreigner in a french company, sometime i got anxious because i couldn't understand what they were talking about during company parties or just during lunch time.

Things got darker during the covid, with the quarantine and the intense competition/complication at work. My old boss - a micro manager - was out for himself, the team ignored my contribution. I spent a year seeing a therapist just so that i could finally quit my job. It was a hard decision for me, as a ""good kid"", a people pleasure with lots of insecurity - i felt like a loser, irresponsible and guilty for this decision. I got mild depression and burn-out, so with my family support, i quitted. I never regretted that decision, but it has been so hard to bounce back from this.

Since the day i quitted, i never stopped working : 5 - 6 hours job search everyday, studied french language, followed tranining to improve my skills, tried some side projects to keep myself creative;

But all the rejections keep coming in and its taking the pleasure out of my life, i often question my self-worth and started avoiding social events because i felt embarassed. The job market is limited when you are a foreigner who doesn't fluent the language. I became desperated, so i was sending hundreds of applications in and outside the country, for all types of positions, even apprenticeship.

Even so, things are not getting any better. I hit my rock bottom when attended a career training which should help me re-joining the work force through getting an apprenticeship. Though i was performing well in class, i didn't receive any offer at the end of the training, while most of my french classmates did. Everything became extremely frustrating, those who got the offer didn't necessarely have the experience or skills like i did, i try not to envy them because i know it was hard for them, too, but seeing how hard i tried and how competent i was in class, i couldn't accept the fact that i was the one who got left behind. It felt so unfair and harsh, as if the whole world was shutting me out.

I am trying to stay positive and move forward, i try as hard as i could to continue and overcome this challenge. But time goes by and i just find myself more stressed and less joyful. I am so afraid i will get into depression again. Life shouldn't be this hard, or is it because i over-estimated myself? Often i find myself questioning about what i should have done better during those interviews, what more could i have done to show them i am good enough? I am no longer know the answer to those questions. I am so tired.

It's been 1,5 year that i am out of job, and i feel stuck.

Now, all i know is I am trying to breath, put on a brave face and move forward, knowing that i just need one Yes out of all the rejections i have gotten.

This is a long post and if you are reading this, thank you so much, i appreciate it!

P/s : thank you all for being so supportive and for all the advice. It gave me new perspective and more positivity to continue the job search. This sub is awesome. Happy holiday everyone!!"

0,2022-12-16,My job offered me a promotion...,u/Soupernerd-386,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/znk7ky/my_job_offered_me_a_promotion/,jobs,"I've been trying to work from home since the pandemic started.  My job finally let me be 100% remote a month and a half ago, and I've been loving it. My current position is also relatively easy. The only negative right now is the pay. I got offered a promotion, but I may have to go back to a hybrid work model for the unforeseeable future. I also found out the pay is only $1.50 more per hour for an upwards promotion.  It seems like by taking this new position, it's how you get your foot in the door for other promotions later on. I am just not liking that I may lose my remote-ness and it's not much more pay for more responsibility and work.  I did make a counter offer on the pay to see if they will negotiate and am waiting to hear back.  Before I found out about the promotion I was starting to look for other jobs online where I could be fully remote but didn't have any bites on applications.

The pros of taking the promotion
-slight raise
-learn new things
-likely to get another promotion at some point
-annual bonus up to 3%

Cons
-going back into the office
-more work and responsibility 
-pay not as high as I was expecting and is non-negotiable"

My husband currently works for a large company and loves the company, but hates his current role (phone support). He has such anxiety over his current role and wants to get out asap. He interviewed for another role in the same company that he really likes and should hear a decision in the next few days.

He has a bachelors and financial industry certs, but right now the role he’s in does not require a degree.

He also interviewed for an external company for a role somewhat related to his certs that requires a degree and he just got an offer yesterday. It’s the same as what he’s making now and in the office 4 days a week and they won’t budge on the salary. He needs to make a decision soon, but he is holding out  hope for the other position internally. There aren’t a lot of off phone roles at his current company, so I’m worried if he turns down the first one and doesn’t get the second one, then he’s stuck in the same position. 

My gut says to wait if he’s not 100% sure about the offer and it’s the same money and in office versus remote like he is now, but I don’t want him to be miserable anymore. Any advice??"

I have held the same title with each employer, developing my skills and experience within each role versus going to new roles. 

I am currently in graduate school and three classes away from getting my master’s degree. I hope this offsets any impression to prospective employers that I lack ambition in my career, which is what I am afraid of and why I am posting this. I used to believe that staying a long time with the same employer would help me stand out or appear more attractive, but I am beginning to feel like it may have the opposite effect.

It seems like job hopping and/or changing jobs every few years now is almost encouraged. I am confused (and increasingly depressed) about how to “play the game right” anymore.

I’ve been feeling stuck in my career for awhile now, happened upon your column and thought I would write to elicit some advice. I’m in my second or third career now, if I ever had one. My father is the president of a small metal fabrication company and has been trying to get me to work with him my entire life. I worked for him in high school, between summers in college and even as an “internship” right out of college. I had a brief career in IT consulting after which, burnout caused me to hop around for a few years to decompress, doing mostly warehouse and retail. 

The frustration is that I feel like I’ve never been able to craft a vision for a career. Every attempt to put something together was rebuffed by my parents (I’m 30 now). There wasn’t any support for things of interest – even if they were realistic, because the expectation is that inevitably I would go back to work for my father. Every time I do go back to work for him, I become the every-man project manager with projects that vastly outweigh what I’m compensated – things like acting as Safety and Inventory Manager for $16/hr. He’s been trying to get me to do financial analysis as well (I do not have a finance/accounting background). Each time I leave for another opportunity,  my father become pseudo-hostile, saying he “can’t understand why I would try to leave”.

 I’ve recently started my third stint working for him, making a liveable salary this time, but whatever sense of independent self esteem I had has since eroded, and I almost feel resigned to stay here until he retires. I am tired of the nepotism and unrealistic expectations. Am I unreasonable in wanting a separate and fulfilling form of work away from my father? I know this is a mix of r/depression and some other psych/family stuff, but any advice for a 30 year old wanting to become truly independent would be great."

But, I spent a good part of the last two days in tears.

We had a Christmas dinner and our company is 8 ish people totally so it’s not a lot. I’ve been there for 3 years and a lot of old coworkers have left but there still are some people.

When leaving I asked someone I’m working closely with how we’re going and she said “I don’t know!” in a very prissy tone and walked away. Okay not really that bad so I ignored it. But this person not only received training from me but also sends me memes etc (we’re all in our 20s lol). Then the office secretary decides to organize us based on who had a car and who didn’t to go to the venue and just put us in groups without properly checking with the people who had cars.

I was told to go with this woman let’s call her Paula and I went to her and asked her if we were going together and a lot of people sitting around Paula were smirking etc. it was uncomfortable. Anyway then we get to the event and only a few people were talking properly to each other it was cold 🥶

Then I went to work the next day and this secretary leaves a couple of presents on the desks of people beside me. When I come back from lunch a coworker asked me if I left something and I said nope and then realized the people beside me had little gifts.

I felt really awkward the rest of the day and felt like crying. (Idk) Then when leaving the office secretary lady walks up and puts something in my hand. 

Like wtf?!?! Is this a pity present?  I went home and cried lmao. I’m so disappointed in myself for crying and honestly I’ve cried a lot since getting a job here. 

The whole two days were hectic."
1,2022-12-16,"How to choose between two job offers after being unemployed for a while, both are dream jobs!",u/Napkxng,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/znn1s3/how_to_choose_between_two_job_offers_after_being/,jobs,"  
Hi, 

So I graduated in 2021, and after a  very difficult time full of grief and difficulties. I ended up working a fully remote internship in a fintech/Crypto app. However, both my best friend and Grandma had passed away with my Grandma passing on the first week. With it being fully remote, I would sometimes oversleep, and have a lack of motivation. But the positive was that I would be quite stress free, had time for the gym, and even went abroad whilst working on my laptop. 

Due to that performance plus the business going under influenced by the market crash, my 6 month fixed contract was not continued.  This was back in early September 2022, 

**The Two Offers:** 

**Offer 1: B2b translation service and I will be a junior business development ( mostly sales from what it seems but still cool), I am bilingual in Arabic but they are focused on Europe and it will be mostly business calls**

**Pro's:**  it's in my home town and it's hybrid so it's so so perfect commute wise. They've given me a start date in early January 2023. Uncapped commission (10%)

**Con's**  Issue is I am really obsessed finding passion and meaningful work which I don't know if I'll find it here. Also, there are some shady work reviews here and there about favouritsm from 2019, but the person I met on call was quite nice and he would be my line manager. Commission implies pressure and a lot of sales.

**Offer 2 : A Healthcare tech app connecting patients and for this it's as a marketing assistant,**

**Pro's:**  I can have really good progression, as marketing executive then a marketing manager. And it's something not only have I graduated in but also the Healthcare system is a big passion of mine as my father was a doctor. This gave a perspective of how mismanaged the healthcare system. They've given me a task and I literally can't wait to do it and present it to them! 

**Con:** the issue is they are 3 hours away in England, (2hr40min by car), I maybe had connections there but no longer is available. So I've let them know and have been honest telling them so. They were so polite and said that they're happy to accommodate, which already shows how understanding they are!

I have my UK driving test next Thursday, and will have access to a car. As it's fully remote I'm scared I won't be self disciplined like last time, but last time was an internship and wasn't something I am super passionate for.

I have been looking for work for over 3 months and it's been stressful, this is a dream come true, but there's so much pressure on choosing the right path right now as I'm 23 and am living with family and not able to provide for my parents.

I would be so grateful for any previous experiences or insights, I can't hear my **inner gut** voice right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really unwell right now so will have the week to think!"

My institution is great, my boss and team are awesome, I enjoy my work and find it very worthwhile, and I have a wonderful work-life balance. The pay could honestly be better, but I’m happy. 

Today, I saw a job in a different area of my state (the place I grew up actually and I have been wanting to get back there). It would be a perfect fit for me because it’s essentially what I’m doing now with the added bonus of living in a better area with a better housing market and the (unconfirmed) potential to earn more money. 

Now, I love my job and I really don’t want to leave, but part of me wonders about what this other job could pay because, if it’s a significant increase, I would leave my current institution. I also have looked up things online saying that passively applying for jobs when you are happy at your current one can be a good thing because it keeps your interview skills sharp and allows you to come from a position of power when looking for a potential opportunity. 

What are your thoughts on this? Do y’all think applying for a job you may potentially not even consider is unethical?"

I was just sitting in a chair eating, occasionally using my phone. I looked antisocial. And whats worse the manager makes us do team building activities where we talk more about ourself. Everyone else was talking to each other laughing and having fun. I felt really uncomfortable. I started this job in October, and have been struggling with adapting and forming better connections with coworkers. There have been some new people that came in and they have adapted quickly and have gotten along with everyone. But I am very quiet and shy, but consider myself to be a hard worker. I always try to be nice to everyone saying good morning. But the thing is i am very quiet and don't talk much about myself. I mainly just focus on getting my work done. I'm afraid of looking so antisocial and nervous at the party. How can i get out of attending this Christmas Party? What makes this difficult is that its during work hours which i hate."

Long story short, he told HR I now report to her, and so I said ok, can I have that and an updated job description in writing, and my boss declined to give HR anything and said I just have to basically do what they say. so I said I quit. Anyways, the executive assistant sent an email to HR confirming my resignation ‘schedule’ without me ever talking to my boss to confirm or speak about anything when he asked me to after a series of conversations. What on earth do I do. I suspected she had wanted my job since the beginning and ended up being right, she admitted it to me shortly before she sent that email.

recently I had a recruiter for a company in my field reach out to me for a role they had just created at their company (we’ll call this company B). I’m not really actively looking for a new position right now for two reasons; 1, I enjoy my current company and my coworkers and 2, though I wasn’t able to get a raise this year (due to business decline caused by the economy) I *am* getting a title change “promotion” starting early January and figured I would be better off applying for a new job once I can add that new title to my resume. So when the recruiter from company B approached me with what seemed like the perfect position, with an amazing work culture, benefits and salary (94k-112k). I began to get really excited. I scheduled a call before sending an application in and this is where some red flags started. The call went great they loved my experience, background and general disposition and it went really well but when I asked about submitting an application or even sending them my resume they sort of laughed it off like it wasn’t necessary. I dont know if this is normal, I mean in what world does someone not want to see your resume? I couldn’t have been that charming on the call. Regardless I let it go and then they followed up with an email introducing another person (head of people) and an invitation to schedule a zoom interview with the department head. 

A couple hours after I scheduled some time on the calendar for that zoom meeting I received an email from the head of people apologizing that there was some miscommunication between HR and the department heads on the salary range and that the actual salary would be around 61k. Now I was really confused. Thats a huge difference from what was posted and frankly though the role is an operational role the scope would be to literally create their entire business operations structure from bare scratch as they currently have nothing in place which is why I found the previous salary range to be fair. As someone with a few years of experience doing exactly that, in the same industry, from the perspective of the businesses they aim to capture as clients I felt really strongly about having the necessary experience for this and not settling for this amount. 

I responded (being very polite and understanding and grateful 🙄) that this amount would require me to take a pay cut and that “at this point in my career, given the scope of the role and expertise I could bring the team, I’m looking to earn between $80k-90k” and then asked if the 61k is a firm cap on the positions approved budget. 

THEN they respond that the range would actually be $68k-$78k and added in a tidbit saying theyre “assuming” Id like to retract my application (an application that doesnt exist because I never sent one 💀) but if I wanted to continue to let them know with a time that worked for me for the next interview.

I ended up just thanking them for taking the time to investigate this for me and that I appreciate the effort happy holidays blah blah blah.

I dont have many professional people of confidence around me I can speak about this with but Id just like to gauge a general consensus of whether I fumbled this opportunity or not? My reasoning for not wanting to continue are; 1, the fact that there was already so many discrepancies on the pay alone seemed really dysfunctional (something that had they had someone like myself onboard likely could have been avoided), and 2, While I did fib about that initial salary being a pay cut (its nearly the same amount) that number wasnt reasonable for the amount of work I would have to do and 3, like I said previously I believe holding out for the official title change at my current company will give me more leverage in these instances for earning in my desired salary range.

Last week, on a project we were both somewhat involved in, someone asked about the project status and if we could meet early next week before Christmas.

I responded today stating that I was planning on taking PTO next week and that my coworker was on paternity leave. 

I just assumed that he would be on leave because he messaged us all yesterday saying his wife delivered baby and everything went well. 

He responded later today saying that he was planning on attending the meeting next week. So now I feel a bit awkward because it seems like I spoke for him when I responded to our teammate that he was on leave. My other coworker last year took maternity leave after she gave birth and it was very obvious to me that she would be unavailable before her actual due date and even had an away message saying that she was going to be out on maternity leave. 

Are men expected to work during paternity leave? Or maybe my coworker is delaying his paternity leave? Should he have communicated that to us before his wife gave birth? Feel like he kind of just left everyone hanging and he rarely communicates to me in general his status so I just had no idea."

Anyways it took 5 minutes to fix it , even though its not my mistake. Anyways I emailed the team and let them know and the COO replied afterwards thanking me profoundly.

Now I realized the issue is even deeper, and im wondering I should fix it since I know how. The co-worker who created the issue probably doesn't even know. l. This would take about 30 minutes for me to fix. But I also dont want to make it seem like I want to work off hours.

I just started applying for jobs and just got a job offer pending background check. I filled out the background check and just used the dates from my resume. I was trying to get it done quickly as I’m excited about the new job. I was looking over my resume after I had already submitted the background check and realized I put the wrong year for my end date at my last job. I put 2020 instead of 2019. So my resume and now background check are incorrect. I sent an email to the company I’m trying to work for saying that I made an error on my resume and background check as a result. I apologized and offered to pay for a new background check with corrected dates. It changes my work experience in that job from 1 1/2 years to just six months. I’m very worried that I will have the offer rescinded now. It’s an an entry level position. What are the chances that they value my honesty and look past this?

 So i was rehired 10 months ago and they started me with the time off that i had leftover at the point in which i left the company about 2 years prior which was 4 days PTO. I had no vacation time when i left.

 During the course of these 10 months i have had no time off accrue and i was able to be strong enough to pull through with the 4 days PTO until the end of the year which i put in for the holiday as a break is much needed but the thing is i still have no vacation time so I'm here wondering if maybe that goes by annually which is why i don't see any time yet? Or did i perhaps enter into an agreement where i signed a hefty load of ""fine print"" basically getting strong armed?

I know I have leverage, but managers are telling me be patient for my promotion despite high praise I get. I haven’t asked for a pay adjustment since merit increases are around the corner. I might miss out on a higher percentage if they’re done too close together.

A recruiter reached out today with a position and I think I can get an additional 30k if it works out. (And if I wanna put in the effort of applying, interviewing, etc.) I don’t actually wanna leave, I just want to use an offer as immediate leverage.

This one job Ive worked at for 3 years Ive worked multiple stores and the one I currently work at is the nastiest environment Ive encountered. Im scared of sharing full details and what company this is because Ive reported this manager once before and got retaliation; it was supposed to be anonymous but the DSM and store manager are best friends so it didn't matter. But basically what has led up to recent events, I finally got promoted after 3 years of recommendations and praises and the store manager and another manager couldn't kick me down about it anymore so they are sabotaging me. They have been bullying me more, make lies about me so I cannot fully perform my job, do not communicate with me so I am left in the dark, among other things. The assistant manager is the only person helping me and knows I can do things.

These two awful managers have done so many horrible things and broken so many rules Im stunned they haven't already been thrown out. I know Im not going into much detail in this post and Im extremely sorry for that; but Im scared to. They've been horrific to several employees (hell, this store has a higher turnover than the freaking walmart i work at) and also customers, locals know to not even shop here. Been trying to reach out to the company hotline to report a giant list former coworkers and I have made with incidents to report these two and finally do something but they haven't responded at all. The former regional manager was informed what was happening here but a week later suddenly walked out of the company. 

Before anyone says ""just quit"" This is an onslaught of issues with this store alone because of these two people Im mentioning, every other store is nothing like this and Ive loved this job otherwise. I dont want to give up and keep letting terrible things happen. Is there even anything I could possibly do, bringing some type of outside source, are there certain laws in the US that could even help me?

Again Im sorry this post isn't extremely detailed, but I am scared to on literal reddit and I just want help."

Because you still haven’t put me in for training or anything.” THEN ARGUES with her.
Long story short my gf started today for a 4 hour training shift and they’re telling her it’s gonna take 2-4 weeks to finish training. Wtf? Only two nights a week, 4 hour shifts each, for 2-4 weeks?

What are your general guidelines around providing a recommendation to a terminated employee? I never had any bad experiences working with him. 

I don't quite buy the bell curve thing and I feel like maybe he had run ins with someone at the firm or rubbed people the wrong way and it's led me to hesitate on writing this. If there were other persons involved they  will at some point come across my recommendation and I don't want to appear to have poor judgement.  

Thanks in advance for your thoughts / recommendations."

Now, when I get calls for interviews, some don't accept this gap and hang up, some say that I am asking too much considering that I have a gap. I am currently asking for a hike from 4.24LPA to 12LPA as that is what I have seen all my colleagues and friends getting with similar years of exp and salary. Am I asking for something I won't or shouldn't get? I have friends who got 8LPA after just 2 years of Exp at the same company I was in. Another who got 13 LPA from 4.8LPA and 4+ years of exp.

Now I want to work as a waitress as well, same amount of hours with same wage. -&gt; 600€/month

I also tutor kids at my school once a week, so 4 hours a month, wage of 10€-&gt; 40€/month

About 1240€ a month (in total) if i show up consistently. 

The issue is that i live in Germany, idk about other countries but i’d have to pay taxes and some other stuff so i’d probably end up with like 700-900€ i think? I’m not sure how much exactly i get to keep. If i go over 520€ i have to pay for other stuff aswell. 

Now it’s kind of a dilemma situation for me, idk if i should take the second job because 

a) i don’t know if i can handle that much while being a student. to me it doesnt sound that much because the working hours are pretty ok but idk how i’ll feel once i actually do it…

b) i dont even know if it’s worth it if i have to pay such high amounts.. i mean lets say i end up with 960€ a month, that’s still a lot but it’s like i wasted the rest of my time working for the government and not myself

btw i’ll be done with school next summer and i’m trying to save up for a year abroad, that’s why i wanna earn as much as possible in a short amount of time 

do u think it’s a good idea to take the waitress job?"

The boss is kind and the work will be simple. There are opportunities to grow and put my foot in the door in the future for pharm tech. This only pays 9 an hour 

The very next day I had an interview in the nearest metro area (a forty minute commute) at a small privately owned and operated telecomm office. [I have worked for a soul draining telecommunications company vut this isn't what that was. The office is essentially a homey looking house with a nice kitchen and screened in outside area. They provide a full pantry, the cubicles were the least cubicle-looking cubes I've ever seen. It wasn't corporate or dreary in the least! They operate by taking contracts with local businesses and basically field and schedule appointments and relay messages call backs for clients. My interviewer and I hit it off very well, and they offer health, dental, vision, as well as cancer insurance.

No joke though, the commute forces me to drive to the other side of the city, and while it may be draining, I can tell I'd be happy there.


This job will pay 12 per hour for the 3 month training period, then 14 per hour after that and 16 if I work an alternating weekend shift because they honor a 2 dollar differential.

She said the closest to 9-5 I'd get would be their 11-7 shift. Which I guess I can deal with--- though I am not crazy about driving at night.

I'm 26. Getting pretty close to thirty, and I need to start getting my ducks in a row and pursuing education. 

I wouldn't mind moving to the city after I get my bearings, but I'm not sure if I'm making a huge mistake by letting the pharmacy offer go. Plus I can see kicking myself if I got in a wreck or just got wore out having to drive 40 minutes both ways 5 days a week.

I might see if they are open to a 4 day work week."

Received an offer I'm 99% going to take at a new company after 4 years at my current place. I don't hold any contempt or ill-will toward my current company or boss *at all* \- the new gig is just giving an 18% raise and feels like the next natural step in my career to grow and not risk plateauing/growing complacent. 

Issue is - I need to accept the offer by early next week, which is right when my current company goes into the holidays for break, so I'm not sure if I should:

1.) Give my notice at the end of next week ahead of the holidays so I can technically provide the ""full"" 2 weeks notice or,

2.) Give my notice at the top of the new year, even though it would be a couple days shy of the full 2 weeks. 

My main worry about giving my 2 weeks too early is (god forbid) missing out on my bonus that gets dispersed at the top of the new year, but I also don't know how much it matters if it's not a full 2 weeks notice vs. 1.5 weeks.

I didn't have the option to go to college following high-school, but my dream is to find a job that allows for a lot of independence and would possibly let me work from home. 

I've always been interested in improving operations of companies by automizing procedures, using spreadsheets, and using research to solve problems. I thought for awhile I'd like to do consulting, learning to be something like a systems analyst. My next option was to learn how to code and find a tech job that pays decently. Finally, I've started to consider doing day trading, or running an online business.

While I have good customer service, I really prefer being in independent roles without having to constantly interact with customers or team members issues. I'd love to do something where I could just go to my office most of the day, plug in my headphones to listen to an audiobook and do self-learning when I encounter difficulties. 

I could start saving up for college, but it's something that'd have a big impact on my family both time and money-wise. I know without a degree, I might be limited in options for awhile until I get more proven experience, but I really just want to get started in the right direction.

I’ve been with my company for about a year and a half now, and unfortunately job creep has led to burnout and consistently unsustainable workloads. It’s been brought up with my manager, and though there have been efforts to improve, I’m still struggling to deal with the overwhelming amount of responsibilities I’ve absorbed due to my varied range of skills. For reference, our team consisted of 6 people last year, and it is now 4, with me acting as manager and still expected to do tasks that should be delegated to roles that have not been and will not be filled. 

I got a 20% raise when I was promoted to manager, but in my opinion, I am doing much more work than that raise accounts for. 

I was recommended for a job with another company that incorporates my wide skill set but also plans work to outsource a portion of the responsibilities as well. The new job is offering a 12k raise in base salary, a couple days more PTO, and 2k signing bonus. 

The problem is, I do like my current company, I have a really solid team, and until the burnout kicked in, I liked the type of work that I’m doing in my role. The new job is a similar type of work, but there’s no way to tell if I will click with my coworkers and company culture the same way I do at my current job. 
I also feel a bit guilty, because with the holidays, I will only have 4-5 actual working days to wrap up the large amount of projects I’ve got going on, and since I am close with my boss, I hate that I am putting them in a tight spot. 

For those of you who have made left a company you were content with for a better paying opportunity, what was your experience? Was the grass greener on the other side, or did you regret making the switch?

I've (22F) have been working in this corporate for a year as a trainee

I got drunk at a party and I think I was too ... casual with my co-workers. And people who are higher in positions as me as well. I'm usually not that talkative, or least I keep everything lightheaded and professional. Although, the company is casual generally I feel like, not super strict. But still.

I don't remember parts of conversations I've had.

It was all good up to a certain point. But then I remember sitting at a table with our colleagues and we talked about age for some reason. Somehow I ended up asking them how old they were and said they were older than my parents (and then proceed to tell that they had me very early and my siblings are really young). And our GM was one of them. He's usually very chill but still.
I also kept calling my other coworker ""bro"" and just casual speech I wouldn't use sober. Which I straight up told him ""I'm sorry, I won't be saying that when I'm sober"" or smth like that. I don't remember cursing though. I hope I didn't.

That's the part I'm worried about the most. I'm worried I was, most importantly, disrespectful and also obnoxious.

I also remembered dancing and singing and other drunk rumblings. Some women from logistics kept petting my head and calling me a sweetheart for some reason lmao.

Then we got kicked out of the office cause it was closing and left for some random bar. I got a redbull there and went home almost immediately, the after party lasted for a while after that.

I definitely wasn't aggressive, just loud and waaay to chatty I think. And casual af too.

I saw the GM on Friday the next day in the office and he didn't say anything at all. The girl who was with us and saw the whole thing didn't point it out either.

But I'm still very worried. Everyone will be in the office on Monday and I'm afraid I've made a bad impression. Friday was very busy so I didn't have the time to overthink, but today it's killing me.

EDIT: this post got a lot of attention, so I'll post an update on Monday. We'll have some more informal pre-Christmas gatherings so if someone wants to say something, they will have a chance

1,2022-12-17,Is it weird to offer/ask to help on the internal side of the business?,u/queenwormie,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zohko7/is_it_weird_to_offerask_to_help_on_the_internal/,jobs,"For some background: 

I am a dog walker for a small company. All of us walkers are technically independent contractors. Then the company itself has the owner, who literally only handles super behind the scenes things like invoicing. I have never met or spoke with him… Then there is the Director. He handles all of our schedules, onboarding, training, client consultations, yada yada. I’d say 85% of what he does is remote. He is always swamped. 

the director (our boss) and all of us independent contractors work as a team unit to support each other and are super close. I have only been with the company about 10 months but I am one of only a few that do it full time and therefor i’m one of the “main” staff and do have a tad more responsibility than some other walkers.

Anyways, i’m leaving town for a good while. I plan to hopefully come back in the next year or so. The plan is to keep me in our portal for the time being until i have a better understand of if/when i’m coming back.. 

My question: 

I want to tell my boss (the director) that I would be interested in helping on the internal side of the business if he ever needs it.. Like I would love to still be involved with the company however I can, which would obviously have to be remotely and therefor what I would be offering, is to help out with some of the work that he does. I technically am qualified to do his exact job, and frankly, long term, I want a job like what he has currently...

however, of course I don’t want it to come across like I want to take his job. I also don’t want it to sound like i’m asking him to create a whole ass job opening for me haha. I just don’t want to overstep. It’s only ever just been him handling the internal stuff and us dog walkers are just the more disposable physical labor component on the business... 

I’m just not sure if it’s unprofessional to offer/ask or if i’m really overthinking it?"

So you know what f*ck all of you and to be honest I don't care if I die. Y'all calling me a liar makes me feel like my feelings are invalid, and I'm making this sh*t up, why the f*ck would I make sh*t up?  I really don't care anymore. Thanks for assuming that I'm a liar and faking when you don't even know who the f*ck I am. I'm done and I'm deleting this stupid ass toxic ass app. My mental health is deteriorating and I just want to know what I can do to bypass the 90-day probation for a life or death surgery. Instead I'm called a liar and making a bullsh*t which why would I go into a subreddit begging for help.


TL;DR
I'm a 29 year old female who's disabled that can work part-time. I have to get a major surgery but I'm on a 90-day probation period at my new place of employment. My HR and higher up management said that the only time I can take those days off if, I'm hospitalized due to coronavirus and on a ventilator. I need the surgery or I will die.


I'm a 29-year-old female who is on full-time disability so I can work a part-time position. I just found out from my doctor that I have to get major surgery for a complicated hernia that can cost my life.

 I talked to HR &amp; higher up management at my newest job about possibly having that surgery, and I would be back at work by a week because they want me to rest 6 to 7 days. They told me because I'm new, that my 90-day probation period won't allow that surgery, I should just postpone my surgery. My 2 doctors advised me NOT to postpone my surgery because my hernia could rupture at any minute and it could kill me and or cause severe sepsis &amp; possibly lose my colon or bowel. 

I don't know what to do because I really need this job, I'm really poor.. they said to me in the handbook that the only time that you can take any time off is if you are diagnosed with coronavirus and you are hospitalized on a ventilator. I read the handbook and it is true it does say that employees are not allowed to take any time off during their 90-day probation period, unless they are hospitalized with coronavirus and along with being intubated. 

What do I do from here? I have to see the general surgeon this upcoming Wednesday (which is my day off) and my general surgeon and OBGYN are pressuring me to get it done by the beginning of next year, because it's just going to get worse. How can I bypass the termination for something that's out of my control?

I've learned to become more optimistic and hopeful over the past year but I'm falling into the same trap of helplessness triggered from the constant rejections of job searching, it's gotten so bad I don't even apply because I'm afraid they'll reject me (so I just reject myself first). It's so silly, I just can't build the confidence to apply properly for a paid position (but if it's volunteering or an unpaid internship I don't feel any pressure because I'm not really losing anything if they don't accept me). I feel afraid of the constant application portals for no reason. How do you power through the process and keep going? The easiest thing would probably be to reach out to a recruiter or person in the company who can get a human to read my CV....Should I just scrap the ""400 applications for 1 job offer"" motto and just focus on finding people in my network willing to pass my CV to their HR department? How can I stay optimistic throughout the process despite having severe depression (and how can I hide my mental health history if needed)?"

I don't dislike much of my coworkers, one of them gives me the sense that they don't like me and that's kind of it. I didn't really click with any of them and while that's not needed, I'm only there for the money, it'd be nice not to dread 8 hours of social interaction after a week of school. 

I kind of feel upset or in a way left out when they all group up together and are able to talk and text outside of work. I've tried to join into conversation a good few times, but it always feels forced or awkward after and everyone just has this look or they stop talking, or they continue without looking at me. 

I don't really have a choice of another job right now, especially with the hours I can do. The team is small so that's probably why it feels like that, like 10 or so at most. 

Do other introverts experience this? The people I work with are mostly my age so maybe that's why this teenage emotion stuff feels weird. 

In the end I'm not there to make friends, it wasn't my intention, it would just feel nice to not feel transparent but then awkward if I do try talking."

I live in Ontario, Canada for context. I recently changed fields; I went from an education job, a very secure job (looks good on the outside, icky on the inside), into a social service work job. My new job offers so much more - hybrid location but close office, pay raises, 'work/life' balance, and general respect.   


I went from having multiple jobs and always needing to go on unemployment during school holidays to just holding my new job, working in an office with a phone extension, work laptop, and work cellphone. It feels like a whole new world; this job is so dimensional, I am so busy with multiple ZOOM meetings, I eventually will have a caseload of multiple people (20+), and I am doing 80 hrs of resource training during my probation. 

Since I am at a mental health company, I am fortunate that they practice what they preach; everyone is so upfront about how 'big the job is' &amp; how 'intense training is'.. but also open about their high turnover rate.

How can I smooth this transition into my new workplace? I don't want to come off like I am incompetent, which I am worried I have been these past two weeks!"

2,2022-12-17,My boss assigned a project that would be right up my alley to a family member- how should I proceed?,u/hoeverwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zokcau/my_boss_assigned_a_project_that_would_be_right_up/,jobs,"
I (22f) graduated in May with an illustration degree, a small portfolio, and some prior experience in student teaching for various age groups. I was hired four months ago at a small education company as a person assigned to writing arts based curriculum, and my contact states that my two other responsibilities are to create artwork for the studio as needed, and to occasionally be consulted on the art supplies we ship in our programs.

When I took the job, I told myself that although it wasn’t quite what I wanted to do, I’d stick it out for the sake of having some real world experience and, more importantly to me, work in my portfolio. Unfortunately since then, out of my two secondary duties, I have yet to be assigned any real artwork, worksheets, or even marketing graphics to be made. Meanwhile, my boss has made me:

-Teach at a school two months ago because they were having hiring issues, despite promising me that I would never be put in a teaching role
-Took away my ability to take an occasional remote day last week and is dragging his feet on putting a working setup for me in the office
-Actually SORT and pack the supply kits for the schools to the point where it was even cutting into my primary duty of writing course programs

I gritted my teeth and pushed through a lot of these challenges, and a few minor ones as well- until now. During a recent meeting with some colleagues, one of them let it slip that we would be hiring a hobbyist painter to work on a mural in our space, and that painter is the daughter of someone my boss recently hired, who is also related to him. My boss didn’t even approach me to ask if I would be interested.

Am I dumb for feeling super deflated about this? I think one of those coworkers caught on that something is wrong, but I haven’t told her. I don’t even really know how to talk to my boss about this. This would have been right up my alley, but I still feel like I’m mainly there to toss paper cups in a plastic bin and maybe doing a task like organizing an Excel sheet if I’m lucky. The worst part about this is I don’t even really quite know how I’ll be able to leave if it continues to get worse."

I have been in a really bad work environment for the past 4 years, progressively getting worse. I was the youngest and only woman in management in the entire division. I have been bullied, ostracized, name called, denied training opportunities, sexually harassed and so much more. It took a huge toll on my mental health and I'm still recovering from it.

Things are going to be different now. I got a new job, making $10k more than my old job and I start in the new year. I cannot express how excited I am to be leaving a work environment that was so bad for me. But I feel nervous, inadequate and scared to start this new position. What if they hate me? What if I get bullied this bad again? 

I also recently interviewed for a great position at a previous employer that I know loved having me there and I left on great terms. But I don't think I did as well in the interview as I could have. 

Anyway, I just really wanted to tell someone how excited I was and curious to know if anyone else here has experienced anything I've talked about in this post regarding interviewing with a previous employer, not feeling confident starting a new job or experiencing harassment at work.

I just don't know what I'm good at, and how to market it.

I get that i've been told a billion times that jobs don't care what your degree is, but when I'm looking at job postings online and i read the job requirements, i never see ""...or a willingness to learn"" as a requirement. There's always some Degree or a minimum amount of years experience.

Sure, I get that for some fields like Finance or Law, it would help to have that education behind me. 

I don't know, I just don't have any marketable skills and it's getting really frustrating trying to find that one path. I really don't want to be ""entry level"" for my entire life"

I had reached B1 level and started applying to jobs. The funny thing is that I actually hadn't applied to many but I got two of these so called trial day. I showed up to the buisness, helped them out for a day not doing any intense tasks in order to figure out if it was right for me and if I was right for them. I only did two, and got rejected from both. 

After I got rejected from one job they admitted to me they were looking for someone who knew more German. It sucked but I appreciated the feedback. They had even offered to hire me if I got better. 

Im not with my ex anymore, and I got really depressed for other reasons... so I moved back to the US. Ive been job searching for 2 months now and applying to more stuff but I dont even hear much from them. I get rejected, and Im glad that at least I know and continue looking. But Ive used for example Indeed especially, where jobs dont even bother to contact you if you get rejected. 

I seriously wish there was something like the work trial day here because it was so helpful for me. Sure, Im technically working for them for a day unpaid but I get a good look about what the enviornment is like. 

Is there actually something kind of like this? As far as I can tell its a bit like the probational period but not quite the same."

By the time I graduate, all the fucking jobs will be taken and I won't be able to get a job, which I'm worried about. Having a degree doesn't guarantee you a job, think about it.

""QUICK APPLY by messaging “coordinator” to four zero one, six three three, four zero four five to schedule a meeting with us."" Or some variation of that. 

And every single one has a variation of this. Like are these mlm companies? Are they trying to get information for scam calls? Have any of you seen them or know about them? 

And beside those postings, I have been seeing a lot of confidential work postings. I sent my resume to one just out of curiosity (insurance agent was the position) and they asked for my number and email, which is provided when you send you Indeed resume.

Got a job that I'll never go back to when I leave. Just don't enjoy the work and I'm around a lot of lazy people. Don't dislike my boss at all but as I've gotten older I realized I need to do what's best for me. The job is working special events and requires random hours during the day. A lot of late nights. But also prep work with loading trucks for the parties during the day. This isn't word for word but the below is the basics.

John,

This letter is to inform you I'm resigning from XXX. Because of the nature of this job I will not be working anymore parties nor will I be working late hours. That pretty much leaves prep work for loading/unloading the trucks. I'm happy to stick around for those types of duties if you would like me to &amp; you do have my word that I will do the job right. I completely understand if you're not on board with me not willing to work parties anymore or work late hours. I have no problem resigning immediately and stating my last day in a formal letter so that it doesn't look like you're terminating me. It's not my intention to complicate things but I need that to be clear with all of this. 

I do have positive things to say about you &amp; I have appreciated how you've treated me but this just isn't the type of job I can do anymore. 

Thanks

0,2022-12-18,I feel suffocating at my workplace.,u/mortissed,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zov1bc/i_feel_suffocating_at_my_workplace/,jobs,"Hello guys.. Ankit this side from Mumbai(India) well i like finance and accounting too much cause you see its my passion i like to know how an organisation works on money and how it's cash flow works, how accounts are made and how they calculate all the day to day transaction in their system. Thats why persuing my passion I would like to tell you guys that I'm a BMS FINANCE (Buisness management studies) wgo graduated this year , i wanted to do higher studies like MBA FINANCE but our home financial condition isn't good my dad's is the only one who earns on his Rikshaw..so I searched for work consistently for 5 months because you see i wanted to collect some money and gain experience of corporate world for my upcoming future and amidst these 5 months of not getting a Job I was getting depressed and all, feeling demotivate and self doubts are also very common in that.
Let's start here...
I am a fresher. In November i went to give an interview regarding a sales job..i knew it it was a sales job. Even though it was a sales my mind was telling to just go their and gain some money and experience to give a hand to my dad and my future also. On 9th November I went for interview, got shortlisted and the onboarding on job was on from 17th of November. When i went there on 17th of November idk why my heart told me that i am in the wrong place. And yeah what was coming in future exactly happened what my heart told me. It was a calling job! I never in my dreams ever thought that this will be a pure calling job for customers to recommend them to invest in capital markets.(from the day of my graduation i didn't wanted to do an calling job because i hate to talk too much i am a kind of person who like to works on his operations and things in alone) But even though its a calling job i handled my self. Completed training in 12 days and started calling afterward. There is a girl who started with me till this day she got 12 lakhs of rupees (Indian money)of customer which invested in something. But i didn't get any potential customers till this day. My closure record on sales up to this day is 0. So my colleagues started laughing and demotivating me. My TL(team leader) always from my 1st day to this day always looks at me disdainfullly. She always find something in me to went her anger on me.. she literally told me if i faced any issues during call or communication so just ask me but whenever i do something wrong and asks for her help she looks at me like i am a lowest creature being, ahe always scold me in front of my team. There are some guys who always make fun of me because just a 20yrs old. I smallest in age there. So i feel very alone and feel disheartened and suffocating. From starting this job on 6-7th day i got my laptop damaged because you see i have to travel with Mumbai local and spend 2hrs to just get to my workplace. (And if you want to how much crowded a local train can be in Mumbai morning/night everytime just go on YouTube and see it). Everyday i spent 4hrs in travelling. And my boss is also like my TL he also comes to my side and asks me like total number of calling, when will i make some contribution to company? When i will get customers?..In meeting he makes fun of my words which i said in interview. Everyday i feel like someone is choking me there..it feels too suffocating there, literally i can't work there. Even though i am a man i cry every single day in my heart i didn't showed my tears to anyone. I told everything to my parents and brother they told me to leave this job. My brother told me sometimes taking a step back in something is the best thing you can do. My parents told me to wake the courage up in myself and ignore negative things, if they are behaving like that to you, you gotta just have to leave that negative environment. And i made a decision that i will resign or abscond that full of sh*t workplace in 31st Dec to pursue my passion even if it is going take 1year to find a Job where i can work on technical and practical work i will still pursue those things!
I know you guys must be thinking that i am running away from those things and not facing it ,but you see i learnt something there that ""If you are finding that you are doing something that you absolutely hate, then there is no meaning of spending your precious time there because you also know that time doesn't come back, you are just wasting your time there, sometimes we have to run away from these things to focus on your future"" 
Spending 4hrs of day in travelling by just standing in full pack of crowded people, getting there and feeling suffocating and disheartened/demotivated , becoming a laughing stock to everyone because i said something in interview. Become a chess piece in political games there, giving your 100% on calling of customer and getting nothing and getting scolded just because of that...I am quitting. 

( I am 20yrs old. If Indian people are reading this please give suggestions and tips for my upcoming future. I am an enthusiastic guy to know about finance and accounting. well, Suggestions of all people are appreciated☺️🙏.)

Tysm for listening to my story please help me through this! 🙏"

250,2022-12-18,Am I the problem at work? I'm 22 and feel completely lost and cannot seem to keep a job without becoming miserable,u/Major-Hippo-336,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zoy3vr/am_i_the_problem_at_work_im_22_and_feel/,jobs,"Hi everyone. So I'm going to start off with a little bit of background info this might be really long but I feel so confused and lost I don't know where else to go. I am based in the US btw.

So in college I majored in Business Analytics and IT and quite frankly never understood or even enjoyed a single course related to it. I was also a COVID student so all my classes related to my major were online. I graduated a semester early with a 3.9 GPA and started a job 2 weeks after graduation. Throughout college, I honestly did not know a single classmate since we went online my Sophomore year and classes related to my major started Junior year.

Fast-forward to my first job out of college in January 2022 and I was absolutely miserable. This is a completely remote IT consulting role and I'd be thrown into calls by myself in front of the client having no idea what to say. No one would show up to my 1:1's. I felt so lost and had no idea what I was doing. I did get positive feedback but I was absolutely miserable and my mental health was awful. All of my colleagues were overworked and it was a very ""hustle culture"" ""grind"" mentality. My manager would always tell me that your 20's are your time to grind as much as possible.

This job and COVID in general made my anxiety so bad that I started to go to therapy in April. I have really bad social anxiety that worsened during the pandemic and in this role as well as just overall anxiety in general. I have gotten a little better but I am still really struggling today. I quit my job after 8 months in August because I just could not do it and started a new IT/tech role in a fortune 500 company in September. This role is also mainly remote.

Now in my current role I am in a similar situation. My team is extremely overworked. My coworkers are putting in 12+ hours a day and I am not receiving training. My manager told me that I need to basically be an experienced worker even though this is an entry level role marketed towards college grads. She does not show up to our 1:1's or provide any guidance on the tasks given to me and then gets upset when I am struggling. She never really answers my messages either. She told me this is a ""hustle culture"" and ""fast-paced"" and I need to be a ""driver."" This is the exact opposite of what I was told by HR in the interview and this is the exact environment I wanted to leave. The role is more tech-based than IT overall and I genuinely do not understand anything.

I feel so lost and have no idea what I am doing. I am so miserable I do not know what to do and just am not interested in what I am doing. The problem is I have no idea what I want to do or how to proceed. If I leave this role in under a year I have to pay back all my bonuses but I have not spent any of it yet. I live at home with no debt, which I am lucky for and have around 50k saved, so financially I am okay but I do want to move out eventually and am worried I won't have stability. I am having trouble finding any motivation for this role anymore and just feel so useless.

I can't tell if I'm the problem and I just cannot function in a corporate role or if I just have no received proper training. In my past internship at another company I did get good feedback but my manager would show me how to do everything and would meet with me everyday which is something I need but I think is extremely hard to find.

The thought of doing this for the next 60 years just makes me feel so miserable. I don't know if I should change careers, go back to school, take a gap year, I just have no idea. I am so confused and terrified that I am just going to feel this way at any job.

I think I realized that I just want a role that provides adequate training, an involved manager, work/life balance, and pays me enough to support myself. I don't need to be a millionaire and just do not fit this ""hustle"" and aggressive/competitive culture. I just do not want to be so stressed out and only enjoy 2 days out of every week since over 2/3's of our life is spent at our jobs.

And I know it is going to be extremely difficult to find a job nowadays with the recession so I am just so confused on what to do. I know my anxiety issues probably play a role and I am working on it with therapy and have seen improvement but I still do have a long way to go.

Are there any career paths/companies that fit with what I am looking for? I do not want to be a failure or burden my parents. It feels like everyone else is able to function in their corporate roles but me. I feel so lost so any help would be appreciated."

Whether it's due to my coworkers dropping the ball (often in ways that are 100% preventable), or managers and bosses who don't give a shit about their clients, it frustrates me to no end knowing that our client's problems can be prevented, or at least fixed with minimal effort.

I frequently have to apologize for the actions of other employees, who usually face no consequences for their constant fuckups. I wish I had a way of holding people accountable, but the workplaces I've had are so toxic that I just job hop instead of looking for a raise, so I'm always the bottom rung on the ladder and have no authority to fix these issues. It seems so prevalent that it's comical.

It's also so fucking stupid that I have bosses breathing down my neck to make sure things are done quickly, yet just ignore requests for overdue bills and brush off client's complaints that have been going on for a long time. They don't trust me to get basic tasks completed without supervision, yet make gigantic mistakes in full view of everyone.

For some background, I left my previous job (which I LOVED - the people and the job itself) where I was for 3 years ecause the pay and benefits were so crappy, I couldn’t survive on it anymore as the economy got worse. I just turned 28, and like many people, I am drowning financially. To further complicate things, 2 weeks before starting this new job, I was diagnosed with POTS, which is a chronic health condition that requires relatively frequent cardiology visits. (Not cheap)  

Old job paid me $18 / hr base which = to $20/hr with shift differential. Benefits were through Aetna. Worst possible plan options. So expensive. But I loved the people, and the job. It always felt like home to me, and still does. The only reason I left is for financial reasons, but I’m still there per diem. I pick up shifts often because the job is fun for me and getting to see my coworkers is a highlight of my week. 

So I set out to work for the state so I can receive better pay and benefits, and here I am. New job is with the state, so I have incredible benefits now (Anthem) and I’m getting paid $22.05 base and $23.55 with shift diff. However, I received my first paycheck Friday, and even though I’m getting paid $4-$5 more an hour, my paycheck was the exact same amount as it was at my old job! I was so disappointed. I know it’s a trade off for benefits, but it doesn’t feel like it, especially since I am still financially exactly where I was (minus savings $$$ with my medical expenses).

I have nothing but issues with the new job. If it was not for the benefits, I would have quit on my first day. Immediately, I knew, the unit I am on and the role I’m in is not for me. The people are cold, bullies, every man for himself kind of people. The boss is crazy. I was totally misled on the position itself and the responsibilities required. I am not allowed to leave my desk unless a nurse is available to cover me for a scheduled lunch break. I must be there at all times, which is unrealistic for me with my condition. I am still on orientation, and I have been told many times “don’t expect to get a bathroom break, don’t expect to get your time off approved, don’t expect to be able to leave for emergencies”, etc. The bosses say they don’t mandate often, but everyone who has trained me / I have met throughout the hospital says they mandate all the time. Every day, I hear something horrific about this place and the unit I’m on.

Total change from my previous job. I am miserable every second I am there. The people would be tolerable if I could tolerate the job itself, but I can’t tolerate either. 

I had a POTS flare last week at work and had to spend my entire lunch break in the bathroom, and had to leave the desk multiple times. The only reason I could leave at all was because I am being trained and someone else was there to cover me. When I’m on my own, I won’t be able to. Knowing that I can’t leave to take care of my own body and chronic illness causes stress, which causes more flare ups. The goal when taking this job was to reduce financial AND physical stress. Now, I can see I have increased my stress and only reduced my medical expenses, but have no change in my income. 

In a typical situation, you need to wait until your 6 month probation is over to transfer to another position. I was told today that if you call out once on probation, they will start you from the beginning. Additionally, I was led to believe that the hospital covers tuition so I can return to school. Nope - turns out it’s only for nurses and other clinical staff, but not us. 

I talked to my boss about my illness and requested I be transferred to a different unit. I was honest and said I physically can’t stay here. They did say they will accommodate me, but I don’t know what is open, nor do I have a choice. I am also hesitant to remain here all together considering the horror stories I’ve heard and the fact that the cons outweigh the pros. And, I was just so much happier at my prior job. There are so many other things I was misled about, like parking, schedules, etc. I can’t even put all of my disappointment into words. I never thought this would be the case, but it is, and I’m having a major “the grass was not greener” dilemma. 

I find myself wanting to return to my previous job. I now understand why people will take a pay cut for their mental health and happiness. But I guess my situation is a bit different. I’m not your average “young and healthy” 28 y.o, so the benefits do matter a LOT. 

But, I want to be happy, too. I feel like I have to choose. Any advice is greatly appreciated."

Overtime this girl has gotten more and more touchy and flirty. It started with just casual non work related talking and touching my arms and such, which I simply avoided without much thought of it. But now she's constantly grabbing my arms, trying to lean on me (she sits right next to me), at every meeting she is constantly tapping my feet with hers under the desk...

Two days ago, at an event where about 50 coworkers, including myself, went for lunch at a restaurant, this girl sat right next to me and started hugging me, trying to interwine her fingers with mine, leaning on me, putting her face literally 2 inches away from mine everytime she could... To which I kept telling her to stop doing, to keep her distance and pushed her aside more times than I can count. But she seems to be taking all this as a game and doesn't care.Eventually she started trying to reach for my crotch, right there, in the middle of the restaurant, among all 50 coworkers, while no one seemed to care about while I kept pushing her hands away from me.

Which brings me to the second part of my issue: I've discovered that people in this company love having romance/dating/etc in the workplace (including HR). Many have openly manifested that ""it's been too long since the last time any coworkers started dating or having sex"" and have been directly told by two, at this event, that this girl and I ""would be a good couple"" and that I am ""going to get some action (wink wink)"".Every time I tell this girl to keep her distance or not to touch me I get the mean/disapproving looks, specially from 2 other coworkers (37F &amp; 40F) who also sit next and in front of me.

And these people love the gossip, which brings us to the third issue: I have just discovered the other day that some of my coworkers are spreading rumors about ME flirting and trying to have sex with her.

Now I am thinking about finding another job or asking to be moved to another team/project within the company (though I wonder if that'll just delay the problem).Either way any of those two options will take a while, and have no idea on how else to deal with this coworker anymore. The few times this kind of thing happened at school/college I could just rudely tell the person to fuck off and leave alone, but this time I have to work and talk with her everyday.

So I would very much welcome any advice/thoughts on how to deal with this, as I wouldn't want to quit without a plan B ready, if possible."

11,2022-12-18,"Have you ever left a job with good co-workers, but just hated the work?",u/Illustrious_Cress_42,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zp9i41/have_you_ever_left_a_job_with_good_coworkers_but/,jobs,"This is long winded, but I thought I just would share what I'm going through and my thought process, and see if anyone else is going through a similar situation, or has gone through a similar situation?

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided to end my career as a materials technician for geotech firms and move on to what I went to school for, which is environmental technologist. Over the past 5 years, I've moved to 3 companies. The first one closed its doors after a year and a half, and I was hired on by company 2 who bought them. Year and a half after I joined them, I left and am now working for company 3 and once again, a year and a half later I want to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

During my time with company 1, I was not happy. They had an environmental section to their firm that I wanted to join, but my boss refused to give me experience. I was disappointed, and decided eventually when worked slowed down that I would look for a new job. Speaking of work, they worked me like a dog simply because I was young and naive. I worked everyday for 6 months straight, 12 hour shifts almost from the start while he and some other people were working on fixing up the shop we had. I genuinely hate my boss from company 1 because of that! Then the company decided to dissolve and allowed itself to be purchased by company 2. This company also had an environmental firm, and the branch manager said eventually I would get a crack at it. This had me excited, as did the promotion I received. Instead of just being purely a field tech like I had been, I would be a manager of materials testing. At this point, I had forgotten my desire to go for enviro tech, as I now had a higher position and more pay! However, reality kicked in and I realized I was not fit for a managerial position. I was also overworked, was still out in the field all the time, and I had gotten tired of the small north Canadian town I worked in. I did get enviro experience, but it was literally one day, and it was after I told my boss I did not want to be a manager. Its like he did that for me as if he was trying to convince me to stay. But one day doing the thing I went to school for wasn't going to cut it and called it quits. This time I had to make a resume and apply for a new job, it would not be just given to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I sent out a bunch of resumes for enviro tech positions, entry level or not, and made some cold calls too. Eventually I made a resume that seemed to work, as half the companies I contacted seemed to call me back. Unfortunately, at the time anyway enviro tech was a competitive market, and most enviro firms wanted someone with a few years experience. Then I get a call back from an enviro position, and once again they were looking for someone with more experience. They then offered me a position doing the same thing I had done the past 3-4 years. Initially I was a bit hesitant. It wasn't the position I had applied for, and I'd be moving to southwest BC which is very expensive. I knew I could say goodbye to having a pad all to myself, and I would need roommates. However, I thought about the town I was currently in, and thought heading somewhere more population dense might not be so bad. Perhaps I could make some friends and be more social, something I was lacking big time up North! I ended up taking the job, which brings us to now.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back, I realized the only thing I hated was my work. I always thought I just wanted more time off, needed a higher position or just need to live somewhere else. While I still want time to play, I've learned that its just as important to me to do something I am interested in as it is to get a good work-life balance. I mean, if I am going to work 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week, I better make sure I enjoy what I do! I know even enviro tech will not be perfect, but to me it just seems like a perfect fit. I've seen some well paying government and municipal jobs up that I'd like to work towards. Yeah I might have to start low on the totem pole, but 3 years will pass quicker than I realize and I just might be in a position I enjoy! I just really do not want to do compaction testing or concrete testing ever again. I've looked at what my co-workers do as well, all of who are engineers and more educated than me. I think to myself and ask if I would be willing to learn more about geo engineering and reach into their roles, and I say absolutely not! I've tried reading learning material that they have mentioned, and it doesn't stick. I am just not interested at all! As well, field work is more stressful. Whereas before I'd be stuck on one site for the day, maybe having to visit another 1 or 2 other sites on occasion, I now make 5-10 site visits in a day, some of which are a couple hours away from each other. It drives me nuts to be cooped up in a vehicle driving around just to do a couple minutes worth of testing, just to drive another couple hours to do the same thing! I want to be able to stretch my legs and get out! My boss tries to cram as much field work as he can into my schedule, as he and the other engineers are also crammed with reports they have to release to clients. Luckily my boss and one other engineer can go out into the field and do what I do, but they try to avoid that as best as possible. At the end of the day, I just do not give a damn about my work, and it feels like field work is way more stressful than it used to be. If I don't arrive in time to a concrete test, I may miss getting the samples we need, but that'd mean I would have to leave the site I'm currently at ASAP who wants me to stick around a bit longer for their compaction testing as they weren't ready. Looking back too, I realize that I like working in the field as long as I am walking around doing something. Definitely not ready for office work. I also want to be able to reach for higher roles if I want too, and I want to understand the engineering lingo and terms my peers uses, as there is still lots I do not know about geo eng and I will never know because I do not care about it.

&amp;#x200B;

This time around I am working on my resume, going with an enviro job no matter what. I do feel bad about leaving my co-workers though. They are really nice people and do what they can to help everyone out. If I left, it would mean a panic to get a new field tech ASAP, as each passing day means more in their agenda. It also means they risk hiring someone who shows up late, or is completely incompetent. To feel better about my decision, I tell myself I owe the world nothing and that they would be better off with someone who actually enjoys geo tech. If I have been running around a lot in the field, I tend to arrive from the field grumpy (I keep to myself, only saying something if its off importance. I leave immediately too if I have no more field work and its been hectic driving everywhere) and I don't think its fair to myself to be mad all the time just to help my teammates, nor is it fair for them to have someone on their team who just does not care."

Yesterday was the last straw for me. After the holidays I’m quitting. Need a place to vent. So basically as a social media manager I get everything I post pre approved before I post it. A pre approved post went out yesterday for a client and doesn’t my boss immediately message me saying take it down the photo is bad. For context it’s a Saturday night during the holiday season and like most people I was busy so I couldn’t get to my phone right away (was out for a family dinner). I told him I didn’t have my work phone on me as I was out, and he got all pissy saying oh fine I’ll take it down but I still need something reposted. He then goes and deletes all the posts I got up for the weekend (AFTER HE APPROVED THEM) and goes on to say well I’d like to find a solution here so we’re not in the same situation every weekend. Am I crazy or shouldn’t the pre approval that we’re already doing resolve that??? Why is he putting the blame on me after he gives me the okay. I don’t get it… Also why do I have to feel guilty about this whole thing. Every time my phone goes off on the weekend I panic now because of this guy.

2,2022-12-18,Started a new job in October after being unemployed for months.. but I am on the edge and probably going to leave.,u/bisegi,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zpbids/started_a_new_job_in_october_after_being/,jobs,"I enjoy the work itself and the people are alright. Many aspects of the job align with my views on health and eating healthy foods. The problem is they don’t schedule me much, maybe 2-3 days out of the week for only a few hours each time. On the original listing it said 15 hours minimum yet I scrape that only if I pick up a shift or do a double. Hours would go up in the summer but I don’t know if I can wait that long, I’m not some high schooler supported by my parents like most of the other people I work with. I have rent and bills etc that I pay every month and I can’t just scrape by and hope I get scheduled enough.

I barely make $600 a month in this job compared to making $1,100-$1,400 in my last job. I left my last job in June because it was leaving me on the verge of checking myself into a hospital and I couldn’t take it anymore. I was about to walk out and never look back if I kept going. I have some unresolved mental health issues I am in therapy for and it honestly makes it hard to even go to work some days. Was doing Uber Eats and DoorDash up until it got really cold and dark. Sometimes my mental health feels debilitating and I wish I could just stop work until I can get a little better, it’s so frustrating. 

I am grateful they aren’t scheduling me too much at my new job though, but they’re scheduling me too little. I told them 15-25 hours works great when I was interviewing and they said that was fine. Yet I get 0-12 hours a week. 
This upcoming week they didn’t schedule me at all even though I made it clear multiple times what days I can work. I can’t live off of $500-600 a month, I feel stressed about money all the time and still get denied for food stamps. My partner supports us both pretty much at this point and has to help me pay things off that I used to be able to pay. We barely make rent every month and it’s on the low end for a simple one bed apartment.

The new job also told me in my second week after I picked up a double that I would be closing alone and to skip a mandatory legally required break. I ended up taking it anyway. Big red flag but I can’t just leave and I almost feel guilty leaving.

The main issue is I can’t seem to find a new job. I really wanted to work at chipotle but they never called me back, should I reapply and call them? I don’t want to work retail again so that’s out of the picture for now.

Edit: I also couldn’t clock in until about two weeks ago. For the newest paycheck I received one week wasn’t on there at all. I sent them my hours I worked for that week on Thursday like I normally would but they only paid for the week I clocked in. Haven’t received any updates on when I’ll get the money and I really needed it. Just the way they run things stresses me out too. It’s like they didn’t even look at the hours I sent when they first received them."

I was there for two years. Keep in mind you have to be a member in order to go to this place. Over that two year period, I've had a person make anti-semitic comments towards me. Multiple times we've had people just overall treat us like garbage and neither the GM nor my manager did anything to stop it. Three months before I was let go, a member degraded me after I tried educating him on policy and when I told my GM about it, she accused me of having an ""unconscious bias"" towards members. 

I went to HR and over the course of the next three months, I noticed the policies start to change to make the jobs in my department harder. I was watched like a hawk, even by my coworker, and any mess up no matter how small constituted a final warning and that is exactly what happened. 3 weeks after that final warning I was let go. 

Is it worth leaving a Google or any type of review about this company or specific location about what really happens behind the scenes at that place?"

I work as an account manager, facilitating operational requests as well as managing client relationships. My team has had an exceptional year with regards the workload we have had to endure, for various worthy reasons.

I have a client who I have not been as responsive to as I would like, because my workload has been large the past few months. However I have not been negligent and I have carried out the supportive operational tasks this client requires. I also have gone above and beyond to facilitate something that my organisation historically is not able to - no risk to me from this, just some effort that I was willing to explore.

After some persistent chasing by this client to several members of my team, I felt the need to email this client outlining some of the context of the past year. I did not present this as an excuse, but as context for why there have been some delays. Given the industry I work in, and the way i like to work, i did not feel this was inappropriate. Working collaboratively in an open and honest way is important to what me and my team do, our style of work and relationship management. I feel the tone of my email was not overly sentimental or exaggerated. 

The response to my email from the client was that sending my email was unprofessional, frustrating and counter productive. They ended their email by saying ""Please do not email like this again or I will escalate this to your manager"". I felt this was deeply unfair and uncaring, and I was in floods of tears.

I will be notifying my senior manager tomorrow to intervene. I feel that the email sent to me was threatening and borders on bullying. I am going to recommend I am taken off this particular clients workstream.

I've worked with difficult and pushy people before, but this feels too far. I know my boss has my back but I'm wondering - in my self critical style - if I have serverly misread this situation and done the wrong thing? What do you think?

Tldr - I contacted a client to give context to why me and my team have not been as responsive as ""normal"". They responded with borderline bullying email and called me unprofessional."

From what people have told me, it's a fairly easy job and some even deem it as ""fun"".

I have very little medical experience as I've only worked in a hospital as a unit secretary. Those who are unfamiliar with that position, I would show patients to their rooms, instruct them to change into their gowns for surgery, get them anything they may need while waiting to be seen by a nurse or doctor, assist the nurses at nurses station with anything they needed, put patient's charts together and then after the patient's surgeries I'd transfer them to their vehicles in a wheelchair.

I'll elaborate. I am currently a first-year student studying UX design, and my university offers an empty window instead of the 3rd semester - for a minor/exchange/internship of your choice. Sadly, I never did anything related to UX before starting the program, so I have zero projects done except a couple of very trivial and hardly related university assignments. Hovewer, I'd really love to get an internship during the window, to actually get a chance to develop some skills and build a portfolio.

As far as I know, there should be companies which offer ""educational"" internships, which don't require any prior experience, hovewer I've been struggling to find even one. Do you think my thought process is completely naïve and the concept I have in mind does not exist, so I should drop the idea and go for a minor? If not, do you know any companies in Western Europe (UK/Ireland/Netherlands/Germany/Scandinavia etc.) which could have something like this? Do you have any suggestions about where/how I should search for something like that? 

Needless to say, financial compensation is NOT a requirement, as I understand there's nothing to pay me for in a case like this. (Accomodation assistance is welcome though, but I understand that's more wishful thinking than anything else)"

Hi everyone, I don’t really know where to post this but I figured this is a good start. 

So I am a college student working over my Christmas break at the place I used to work at in high school. I got this job from my sister, it was one of her good friends from elementary school’s dad’s shop. Some of the daughters worked there, including my sisters friend, which we will call Claire. 

When I first started I worked at the new location, so mostly new people, that weren’t in the family, worked there and this was my job from freshman year to my senior year in high school. 

I started working at the old location during Covid after being sent home from college in which I would always see these family members, but Claire’s husband never really worked, I guess took care of their children at home. 

Over this break I have worked with him a few times, and the first time he tried to friend me in Facebook 30 minutes after I got off work. I thought it was weird but didn’t really think about it after. 

Last night I received a message from him that said “Would you like to get coffee”. That freaked me out and I sent it to my sister that was friends with Claire, and she said I should just ignore it, which was what I was planning. 

The next morning I wake up to him deleting the message.

Overall at work he was just friendly, like everyone else is. But he definitely did hang around me when I would try to cut the conversation short, because I’m not very interested in the conversations we had. I believe we’re about 10-15 years apart, with me being 22. 

Should I tell Claire about this? I still have 2 weeks of working there till I leave and I really don’t want to be around him, but I need the money. Any advice will help. 


TL/DR: Manager’s husband asked me for coffee over Facebook app, then deleted the message when I did not respond."

He is currently a trucker for a well-known food company and makes a great living for my son and I. The problem is, he works anywhere between 12-16 hour days. He comes home after 6p usually after being at work since 4:30-5am. I would love for him to get a job 

He became interested in becoming a pilot after going on a flight with his buddy who is working on getting his pilot license to become an instructor. He loved being in the air and how he felt. He also loves how it comes with traveling perks, as one of our family goals is for our son to be well travelled and to see as much of the world as possible. 

He looked up information on being a pilot and came about two routes he could take: (1) get a BS in Aviation after 4 years, or (2) apply to a program through an airline (ex. AA) and get his commercial after about 14-16 months. The cost of him getting his degree or the program isn’t a huge huge deal, as I’m looking to get a full time job once completing my masters and he would still work (not as much but enough to help with mortgage and stuff). 

Any advice from either pilots themselves to people who know of pilots? How did you start?

1,2022-12-18,Seeking Advice,u/pumpkinqueen93,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zphkow/seeking_advice/,jobs,"So here’s my situation, I (29F) have worked in the manufacturing field since June 2019 (almost 4 years) I’ve worked at 3 different factories and for the most part, I really like this field for a few good reasons (in my opinion there good reasons) I work 8 hours (sometimes 9 hours a day, if I’m feeling or need the overtime) a day, Monday through Friday, I usually don’t have to work on the weekends. I get holidays off and I get paid for them. Medical and dental insurance are ALWAYS available and usually aren’t expensive (the money taken out of my check is a fair price for benefits) the pay is usually pretty decent. All of these things are pretty standard for the manufacturing industry and they’re really important to me. I’ve worked jobs before where I had to work weekends and holidays, and if you wanted a holiday off, you didn’t get paid for it or you just got denied. 
Anyway, I really like this industry. However, I can’t help but notice.. it’s a little sexist. In the 4 years I’ve been in this field, I’ve always been at the bottom of the barrel. Which, don’t get me wrong, is somewhat fair when you’re just starting at a new company, factory, etc. But, I couldn’t help but notice that me, and other women that I work/worked with, are started out at the bottom and are kept there. I’d like to add, that some of the women I work/worked with had been there for 5, 10, 15, sometimes 20 years. I really want to get to the next level. I really want to start getting into/trained in CNC machining. Mostly for the pay (I think we can all agree the cost of living is pretty out of control these days), and the challenge of learning something new in a field that I very much like. But, I just can’t seem to find any company/factory that will give me a chance. I fill out applications and send out emails expressing my interest in CNC machining positions (I would like to add that most, if not all, of the positions I apply to are advertised in newspapers and online ads are described as “Entry level CNC Machinists, no experience necessary, willing to train.”) I fill out the applications, send emails, and…. not so much as a phone call or an email back, even when I call, or send a follow up email. Given my experience in manufacturing, I can’t help but think “Is it because I’m a woman?” I’ve looked into manufacturing programs and CNC training programs at my local community colleges but here’s the problem, A. They’re anywhere from $2,000-$5,000 and they don’t qualify for financial aid because they’re usually certificate or just job training programs. B. Because these are certificate or job training programs, they don’t really offer an option to work around whatever schedule you have. One that I looked into was a “CNC Operator Boot Camp”. If I remember correctly, it is a 6 week program, but it was 8am to 4pm (I forget how many days a week). For those of you not familiar with manufacturing shifts, 1st shift is usually 7am - 330pm, 2nd is usually 330pm - 1130pm, and 3rd is 1130pm to 7am. You see my dilemma right? There’s no way I could participate in this program without missing work, I have a hard enough time paying bills with my 40 hour check, never mind taking a leave of absence for 6 weeks without pay. It doesn’t really seem fair either, my male coworkers usually get bumped up to CNC machining WITHOUT having to take ANY of these courses or programs. The company usually just has somebody train them. 
I’m really just looking for advice. Should I be doing something different? Have any other women in this field had a similar experience to mine? Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

I’m 19. Currently attending community college and working full time at law firm make $18/hr.
I am wanting to leave the company (even though it was my dream position). Some things came to light and the board of attorneys had been ignoring one of their attorney partners raping and stalking one of their employees. There is a case filed and I don’t want to have this company on my resume for very long. (This is a high rated firm by the The state Bar unfortunately ).

I have lots of experience in these areas:

Fast food (4 years)
Management (1 year at a gas station)
Loan Officer assistant (about 7 months)
Sales (about 7 months) 
Customer service/ inventory (a few months)

Currently working as a legal admin assistant to paralegal. (My dream job is to be a paralegal and eventually be an attorney)

All of these have given me LOTS of experience.

Is it possible to land a WFH job and in what field with the same pay?

Open to all suggestions."

I had been interviewing for a few places but one of them made an offer first. It’s a state job, stable but pay suuuuuuucks.

I’d take this I’d pay was a little higher and I was given more remote possibilities. (Example…. One month in office, one month remote)… Advice on please negotiating that?

However, if they’re not willing to negotiate those how do I tell them they can follow up with me in January? I am supposed to wrap all my other interviews then…. If I have no other option I’d take this one.

I’ve been at my new job for 77 days and for the last 4 weeks I’ve done nothing but wish I could quit every day. Mainly because my new boss is toxic. He micromanages everything, speaks to me like I’m an idiot, constantly criticizes the smallest mistakes, rarely provides any positive feedback and overall makes me feel like he regrets hiring me. 

I have spent so many days just crying after work or feeling like an idiot for leaving my last job where my boss was so kind and encouraging. In my last job, I was promoted within just one year due to my great job performance. I left because I wanted to do something a bit more aligned with my educational background and a population of people I feel passionate about supporting in my line of work (healthcare). 

However, I don’t know how much more of this I can take. I tried speaking with my boss directly - asking him if there was anything he would like me to improve on and he didn’t say much. I also told him I felt I was making really good progress on my project and listed how everything I’ve accomplished since I started. I thought maybe I had gotten through to him, but he just went back to his hostile ways a few days later. 

I’ve tried just giving into his micromanaging and letting him check all my work and be cc’d on every email, but that also seems to annoy him. When I do submit work without his approval, he ALSO gets irritated.

I just don’t know what to do. I have the added layer of difficulty that I need a visa to work in the country where I am employed and they aren’t that easy to obtain. In July, I will qualify for permanent residency so that will remove that layer of difficulty. Should I hold on till then or try to find another employer now? I have never quit a job this soon but my mental health is suffering. I have had onsets of extreme headaches, weight loss from the stress, and just feeling ill most days."

I’ve seen many variations of the post “is X major okay?” And “I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs, why can’t I get one?”

Unfortunately, a degree or specific major will not be enough to land you an entry level job. You’ll need to combine a degree with 2-3 internship experiences.

If you’re applying to entry-level jobs without any relevant internship experience, that is the reason you’re not getting good results.

If you’re still in college, getting a relevant internship should be your #1 focus. If you receive work-study through financial aid, that’s an incredible opportunity to use it to help secure an internship.

Needing internship experience to land an entry-level job is an unfair system, but that’s the world we’re living in."

I have my annual review this upcoming week, first annual review of my life. I started during the last week of august, and was originally supposed to go through a 90 day review. Well, about 2 weeks ago I was told that I'll be going through an annual review like the rest of the team. This caught me by surprise, and my boss this morning said to ""please come prepared with goals"" all that stuff, etc. I originally have the plan to stay here until I get my masters and probably look elsewhere  
Some things my job

I answer emails and help vendors out with their issues

I usually put up good numbers, and as the newest person here I've actually helped train and revisit hard topics with a person on our team whos been here for awhile

My boss is extremely nice and definitely laid back

I know I wanted to manage a team, but being the newest one on the team and new in general, I think bringing this up is too fast too soon. Also unsure if I want to stay or if I will leave as stated above

Boss knows I'm a part time masters student, she def asks me a lot of questions about that

&amp;#x200B;

What would you all usually talk about in this early 1:1 meeting, where it definitely hasn't been close to a whole annual year for me haha"

I have been a top sales rep, made the companies I worked for tons of money, been to company dinners as a reward for my numbers, etc.

After COVID hit the company that I worked for and adored was bought out, they cut their sales team down to a quarter of its former size. I was not one of the reps they kept. Since then I've been bouncing from company to company, trying to find consistent work. The pattern so far has been that I join a company, we work for three or four months, and then they lay off everyone who was hired in that time period.

In the meantime, I've been applying for sales jobs (and other jobs) outside of my original field, but I can't get an interview anywhere! I can't even get a job at Wawa. 

I'm a model employee. My reviews and coaching sessions are always stellar. I sound friendly, knowledgeable, I'm tech savvy and I don't need to be babysat. I never miss work. I don't know what I'm doing wrong."

I've been here around 4 months and haven't been trained on much or had anything to do beside 2 to 4 permissions tickets a week. I'm debating If I should leave or not or if this is just regular par for uni jobs.

 And when I study for a cert or something my boss says that certs are theoretical because unless it's related to the business software then it's theoretical. And that hes been in the same role for 20 years and doesnt have any certs because he knows this niche university software so well lol. Don't you think it sounds like he's just being discouraging though lol?

I'm also making 55k but paying 1450 a month for rent. So, I'm suggesting if I should look for remote jobs and move back in with family. Would it be a bad idea to leave only 3 months into my lease though or will it look bad on a resume? 

Also, my current role has a 6 month probation period so I'm worried that they'll keep me. But, the role also has good benefits, pension, Healthcare, and free schooling. But, I could also go to WGU and do schooling that way too. 

I'd also have to move back in with parents where there was mainly older people. Part of the reason I moved to the college environment was more options for dating and things to do. But, it hasn't been what I thought it was. The town is really transient and it seems like everyone leaves as soon as exams end, and the environment is really transient.

Some people at my job said they would never go back to the private sector because you have no retirement, they often do merges where they let you go at anytime, and the jobs don't really pay that much more than public sector. 

Are these things really true though or are they just set in there ways? It's weird because whenever I read a book on coding languages or something, they'll say that ""you don't need to remember commands just look it up online based on your particular problem with the business software.""

 But, at the same time I've literally had interviews before where the interviewer would just ask 20 non stop what does this command do type questions. And whenever I ask my friends they say it sounds like they just don't want to learn much outside of there roles because there just waiting on retirement from the pension.

 Do you think that sounds like their trying to discourage me from learning anything outside of the specific software that they use though, because they seem really out of touch with the private sector? 

Or is it just me and should I stay where I'm at because the private sector is really risky with the economy being the way it is?"

The next day (Wednesday), I received an email from a senior consultant stating he received my email and wanted to know what my availability was early next week (now this week). I sent that email stating I was flexible to meet any day and time this week no more than a couple hours later that same evening. I have yet to received an email back from him and am getting antsy since it’s been 5 days.

What are your recommendations for handling this? Should I send him a follow-up email today in case it somehow missed him? Am I being impatient and should give it a couple more days? Should I not do anything at all? I want this internship so badly, so I’m looking for various opinions on how to make the right decision. Let me know what you all think, thanks.

EDIT: Thank you all for the advice! I ended up emailing them later that afternoon and they responded with it being close to the holidays and it was becoming difficult to find a time when the whole team could meet. Meeting postponed until the new year, but he said he appreciated my diligence. Thank you guys so much for alleviating my worries!"

I don’t live with my partner, but taking this job would mean seeing each other less….potentially the relationship ending because of the distance.

My lease ends in February, and without a job security I wouldn’t be able to renew it. So I would end up in my home state anyways (with my parents)- my partner hasn’t brought up that i could stay at their place if I were to lose my place so I’m just assuming…

I have to answer the hiring manager TODAY and it’s honestly eating me alive. I don’t know what to do. 

Yes, I have severance until April but no job so far. I don’t know what to do tbh. If I wasn’t in this relationship, I’d probably take the job and try life in my home state.  But because my relationship hasn’t, it’s hard.

I started this job a few months ago back in July, and the managerial feedback has been great and I really do enjoy my role, I have a great team and I work from home. 

A week after I started, another person started within my team in the same role as me. I get on very well with my colleague, however they work 4 days a week as opposed to my regular 5 days a week.

Since I started I was told I’d be covering their day out of the office and I was absolutely fine with this, I am very team oriented and enjoy helping. I was also told it would only be for 6 weeks max and because we were both new, workload wouldn’t be crazy. 

That was almost 5 months ago and now it’s just expected that I cover this colleagues day off, this isn’t my colleagues fault of cause, management have just not changed the dynamics. I also have a very busy workload of my own. 

I didn’t really think about it until one of my other colleagues said to me the other day ‘you should ask for a pay rise if you’re covering every week’ and I kinda laughed it off but now I’m thinking about it a lot.

In the new year I have my probationary review and I don’t see any reason I shouldn’t pass, due to the good feedback I’ve been getting, but would I be cheeky in bringing up the salary question? Maybe I’m just doing what is expected in my role, but no one else does this for other colleagues."
1,2022-12-19,I didn't get my last paycheck when I got fired. Had anybody been in this circumstance?,u/Pufferfishinthesea,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zpzwby/i_didnt_get_my_last_paycheck_when_i_got_fired_had/,jobs,"On December 13, I got fired after a week of being employed at this company. Someone at the company overheard me foolishly confiding in someone about how a different company I interviewed at a while ago is asking me for references. As a result, I got fired because they expected me to commit 

Now, I completely forgot that according to CA employment law, I was supposed to be entitled to my last paycheck at the time of firing. It's been almost a week and still crickets from the company and the postal service is slow. Now, I'm a 24 year old guy who has never hired a lawyer in my life, let alone sue any entity in general. Has anybody been in this situation before and how did it turn out for you?

Thanks

Edit: I did contact them before contacting a law firm and the response was essentially telling me to just wait for the check to arrive. CA Labor Code does not give any flexibility to employers for postal service delays and delivery times."
2,2022-12-19,Thinking of switching careers to pursue making more money?,u/Envision06,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zq05x2/thinking_of_switching_careers_to_pursue_making/,jobs,"Hey there. I’m in my mid 30’s and have been working in the graphic design field since about 2011. We live in a relatively low cost of living area in the Midwest but costs have went up a lot here recently. I’m sure it’s the same everywhere else too. My wife works part time and stays home with our 2 kids when she’s not working. She used to work full time but went part time due to childcare costs. I Started off doing some easier production/design work for a number of years and now I am working remotely from home doing print design and meeting with customers via Teams meetings. 

I make a $50,500 salary and most weeks I work 50 hours and there’s times I’m working a lot more than that during our busy period. Perks of working from home are great - save money on gas, same commute time, at home with family, etc. Cons, I’m just feeling burnt, uninspired in my career. Between working long hour weeks at times and feeling like we’re struggling to save money each month, I just feel like I need a career change to make more money and enjoy the work that I’m doing. If that’s even possible? lol

Graphic design isn’t a super lucrative career, but I suppose you could make it if needed. I resell items on eBay and do UberEats and DoorDash on the side to supplement our income. I’ve been doing pretty good with those side hustles. We recently had to replace our Furnace, A/C, Hot Water Heater and roof so a ton of our money went to that stuff the past couple years. I’m just tired of working so hard on side hustles and spending it all on emergencies. I guess it’s good that I did the side hustles or else we would really be in trouble. 

So here’s my question. Has anyone been in my shoes before and made a career change or got a different higher paying job and actually enjoy the work? I’m reading Ken Coleman’s book (From paycheck to purpose). He talks about being able to find work that you love. But where do you start? I’m not sure where to look or begin. Any advice? Thanks so much!"

If I stop what I'm doing and read + reply every single time an email comes in, ***I will be in a constant state of fragmented attention and things will get done at 1/10th normal speed.***

I have had 15 minute tasks take an hour because I am a pin cushion for all the problems in the universe at my job, and I get emails every ten seconds, and my bosses get in a mood sometimes where if I don't respond ""got it"" or ""will get on this"" or ""Roger that oh five two three zero eleven niner,"" they throw a fit.

This is what the standard should be: if you emailed it, assume it was received, assume the recipient has a de-facto prioritization algorithm for when/how things get addressed, which is usually ""it'll get done when all the other flagged items before it get done,"" and if it is ***truly urgent*** (which means there is an actual time sensitive depedency at play and not just you're in a mood and something triggered you)***,*** put the red exclamation point on the message or Teams me.

1,2022-12-19,"Friendly interviewers, slightly odd experience, terrible Glassdoor reviews, what would you do?",u/knockinforthesugar,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zq29jh/friendly_interviewers_slightly_odd_experience/,jobs,"So I've been through 2 rounds of interviews with a non-profit that does refugee resettlement. At first I was excited after getting a response. I had been applying to tons of jobs so I didn't take time to look at reviews first. I interviewed with them and had a generally positive experience, it felt relaxed and conversational, and I felt appreciated by them. 

After I went and looked at their glassdoor reviews, they have a 2.4 star rating with 9% approving of the CEO. Most reviews complain of toxic work culture and bad miscommunications with management. Sometimes it seems like people are overworked as well. Some reviews are actually okay. This is a huge organization with field offices and the field offices have better reviews than HQ. HQ sounds like an absolute nightmare and the CEO sounds like a tyrant. The indeed reviews are better, but they are worded kind of strangely, as though English is not natural to the reviewer. That would be fine, but they almost seem bot-like, not like a simple language barrier. Some of them do seem for real though.

After reading this I was invited for the second round of interviews with higher management (not at HQ but in another field office). However, this was for a position which requires more experience than the one I applied for. The office where I am is in its start-up stages, and they asked if I'd be interested in being a level above what I applied for. To be frank, I'm still in my 20's and don't know if I have enough experience for a role like this. I'm not dumb, I know the limitations of my experience even if I know I'm capable. I just decided to interview for practice and shits and giggles. They were very friendly in the second interview as well. I decided to ask some indirect questions about issues on the glassdoor posts such as ""How do you work to reach goals when things are busy and there's not as much as staff etc??"" I didn't get pushback per se, but I felt like my question wasn't fully answered. 

The interview ended with them talking in a manner that basically seemed like they were going to offer me the position etc. Normally I'm used to interviewers asking if I have any more questions, but they didn't do that, and I didn't get to pursue any more of my questions. I can't tell if this was schedule related, or if they were just trying to avoid too many deep questions about work culture lol.

It may seem as though I'm answering my own question here, but what would you do? Has anyone ever ended up having an okay experience with a company with bad reviews? The interviewers were very friendly and it's not what I normally run up against in red flag interviews. I'm not naive though, I know it could all be an act. 

**Also, if this company sounds familiar to anyone in this field and you want to PM me, please do!**"

Any advice?",u/rosy_reader,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zq39l0/new_general_manager_is_making_our_lives_a_living/,jobs,"I wait tables at restaurant and I’m a full time X-ray tech student. The owner of the restaurant, was also our old boss. She was fantastic. She deeply cared for her employees. Due to her age, she hired a full time manager, so she didn’t have to be there everyday. She still owns the place, but isn’t there too often.

The new hiring manager is making our lives a living hell. We’re required to be there 15 mins before the start of our shift. If we come in more than 5 mins late, we have to call 4 hours in advance. We were open on 4th of July and Thanksgiving. I’ve been there 3 years…that’s never happened. We have to work Christmas Eve. We’re not allowed to schedule ANY call offs from June-August, and November- January 2nd. 

The owner knows that mostly college age students work there. She would ALWAYS rearrange our work schedule, to accommodate our school schedule. That’s just the kind of person she is.

I take my Spring 2023 schedule to the new manager. I needed to switch from Thursday nights, to Saturday nights, in order to take the class, to graduate. She said “That’s not going to work”. I either have to keep my job, and change my school schedule, or quit. I really don’t want to quit. My best friends work there. The owner has become family to me. When I broke down, she drove me to work for a whole week. When I got a concussion, she gave me PTO for almost 2 weeks. I love her dearly….

But she won’t do ANYTHING about the new manager. We’ve all gotten together and told her how miserable she’s making us. Her response is “I’m going to be selling the place to Amy in a few years. I can’t jeopardize that. There’s nothing I can do.” 

I’m not doing too well financially right now. I just got out of an abusive situation. My car died on me, and the job is close enough to where I can walk, while I get another car. 

My plan was to work here until I graduate next year. I really don’t want to start somewhere else, just to start my career in June. 

I just need some advice. Should I quit?"

I would like to wait until the new years as the companies I am in the final stages for are ones I would really want to work at regardless of being laid off, this one I probably wouldn't.

1. Accept the offer and then renege on it if there's an offer from the other companies

For example, me, a graduate with a 3.01 gpa, can’t find a job anywhere. I have applied and talked to many people. I have never been fired and I actually have been recommended by previous jobs. However, I have been ghosted by 17 different employers. 
     Now I would understand if they were high-tier jobs, but they are simple jobs you would find that pay less than $15 an hour. The “Hiring Immediately” and “Urgent” are just lies to get more people to apply. The ones that say hiring multiple candidates aren’t a lie, but they won’t hire anyone without 2 years of experience. Where can someone get experience if everyone is asking for this 2 years of experience?
     I have tried the easy route and went for military. After all, they accept almost anyone; however, at my age, most people are compared to a bone structure to that of a 35 year-old female. So, on week 4 of basic training, I was medically discharged. 
     My next route is to work at somewhere in which I have worked before, but for less pay (I moved from state to state). I would call this a success but rent here is around $1500 a month and minimum wage is $11 an hour. It would be near impossible to live with the bills, groceries, and housing cost. I would be living barely paycheck to paycheck giving myself no room for free time or spending money of my own."

I hate it. I’ve been in customer services my whole working life (5 years) and have 2 years of management experience. First working in a supermarket before moving to the role I’m in now.

I enjoyed working at the supermarket up to about 6 months before I left. I left because I wanted more money (this job pays a lot more) and I was bored.

In my 3 months there I’ve seen 16 instances of people crying. My boss is a massive micromanager and not a pleasant person. Most of the other Team Managers carry the not my problem attitude and try to fob all the work on me the new guy. I have to attend multiple unnecessary meetings a week due to my boss’ micromanagement.

When I have to get on the phone because the customer is requesting a manager (normally about twice a week) I’m greeted by abuse. I would rather put the phone straight down but I’m not allowed to. I got in trouble for disconnecting after 15 minutes because I had enough of how a customer was speaking to me. I get customer service you need patience but when I’m met with abuse for 15 minutes and no resolve I think forget this.

The targets are ridiculously high which normally means if one thing goes wrong we are below target. For example, our target lost calls are under 2% but because we aren’t a frontline team and deal with specialist queries we only get about 40 calls a day. 

I’m not a huge fan of the manager style I have to abide either where I have to monitor every little thing my team does and the grade boundaries I mark by. (I know this is common in middle management)

I’m doing my AAT Professional Diploma outside of work and I am desperate to move, hoping to get a role in Accounting.

Thing is as I have only been in my role for just over 3 months I’m worried my CV would look rubbish as a result.

Should I continue in my role for a few more months before looking? Finish my AAT then look for an accountancy position? Or straight up get out of there as soon as I can?

I’ve asked around and my friends/family/old coworkers seem to think it’s a toxic environment.

I’m at an impasse."

Anyways, Monday update:

1) No one said anything to me, not even as a joke or smth. And people usually tease when you've been standing out big time so that's a good sign ig. 
Also my entire department (and majority of our colleagues) were gone by the time of me getting giddy and only some ""party people"" were left

2) I did NOT start talking about age. Apparently the colleagues asked me and the other girl our ages first as we were talking about generations and stuff. 
I then said people at the table, including our GM were older then my parents, and then proceed to say it's because they had me early and stuff. I remember the GM laughing

Ah, probably should note that he's a Sales GM, I'm in marketing and our director was long gone by that time so at least that I guess

The GM (or anyone really) had multiple opportunities to bring up my behaviour since we've had a training and a lunch with the team but they didn't. The Christmas party was mentioned super briefly, mostly talked about the quiz we had, and how it was ""successful""

The colleague I said ""bro"" to is actually a really loud, extraverted and friendly guy who brings 30kg speakers to an outing so he was fine. And apparently I apologised immediately too lol
He works online from the other part of the county so I very rarely see him in the office 

3) I asked my work friend who was there the whole night. Shortly, she said it wasn't bad, it was rather funny and unexpected seeing me dancing and singing (along with other colleagues ofc) + being so hyper/chatty since I'm usually shy and reserved
I didn't fall, I didn't say anything bad and she said no one seemed offended or uncomfortable

She also said she did have a thought I might be overthinking it afterwards cause she kinda knows I'm anxious

I also did leave around 2 hours before the after-party ended and according to my other colleague I'm friendly with I ""seemed very fine on Friday""

So yeah. Won't do it again because it's dangerous, and I don't think it's good to be hyper every time there's a gathering
And I can't go through this mental hell again

I am a huge overthinker, so it is probably fine, like my work friend said. So yeah. Hope so"

Can I keep my previous senior title on my resume?,u/lefthandshakes,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zq7zcb/got_demoted_can_i_keep_my_previous_senior_title/,jobs,"Im a managing producer and used to lead a small team of other producers. A couple months ago, all of my direct reports got laid off. With my team wiped out, I’ve been performing a lot of their work in the meantime. Today HR notified me that the Union pushed the issue that I was doing work meant to be performed by Union employees and as a result, I have to take a demotion. Besides the fact that this is one of the most absurd slaps in the face I’ve ever received in my career, I’m worried how it will affect future job prospects. 


Should I keep my previous senior title on my resume? Should I not include the title and just include my leadership responsibilities elsewhere in my resume? Any advise would be appreciated. 


I’m also 4 interviews in for another role with a new company. I’m worried that when they do my background check with my current company, they’ll find it fishy when I suddenly don’t have the same title as listed on my resume. Can I explain the situation to them to make it clear this had nothing to do with my performance?"

I (24m) graduated with my MSc in kinesiology in Canada last winter and I haven’t been able to get a job despite applying to anything I can and networking my ass off. My area of research was low back pain, but I’m not married to my specific field of study and just want to work anything in health sciences.

Majority of my networking don’t want me unless I get a PhD, become a physiotherapist, or go crazy into coding and software (which I never want to do again unless it’s stats). Or just straight up ghost me when I try to talk again. I also work with a career counsellor and everything is exacerbated by the fact I have ADHD and a chronic illness I’ve been working on rehabbing as well (thank god for therapy and meds though) as well as helping my mother rehab after a very near fatal illness and a grandmother with Alzheimer’s.

Healthcare jobs working with patients is unfortunately out of the question because I get too overwhelmed (at least full time work). I’ve worked as pt assistants/kinesiologists and strength coach and am just so burned out of being paid min wage and doing essentially 3 jobs for the pay of one and not having my education or experience respected and no room for growth. But these are the only places I seem to get interviews and offers for. I didn’t go get an MSc just to get stuck with the same jobs as my BSc. All I seem to only get are part time jobs. I’m not even someone expecting good pay right off the bat, I’ll gladly take sub $50k a year if it means I can grow over time and I’ll just get even a little respect.

I’ve applied to countless other roles even outside health sciences that match my skills or experiences. Tailor resumes to each applications. I’ve had some interviews, made it to final ones, but didn’t land it. Dream job came up at my university for teaching and I matched all the skills and requirements. I ta’d a lot and loved it and many profs were super excited that I could be coming back. Made it to final interviews. Ended up getting absolutely shafted by the uni and job went  to a new phd student of the interviewing prof who had no teaching experience. Course went to shit.

My dream role is to either teach, community health promotion and outreach, or even admin or counselling/advising roles in uni or college. 

I love supporting people and helping them learn or become healthier. I love doing literature reviews then taking that info and present it in ways the public can understand. I’ve in the meantime begun periodically making YouTube videos and infographics on ig presenting health science to the public rather than academia and I really enjoy it. I’m pretty much done with kinesiology specific things or research jobs. I’m looking at switching into public health and doing a masters in that which thankfully has a coop for connections, but I still have to be accepted and that’s a years away. I don’t know what to do. I’m beginning to really panic.

I know the only thing I can do is just keep plugging away, but when does it get easier? I’m tired of getting rejected all the time. I’m losing hope. I just want someone to give me a chance."
3,2022-12-19,Help finding a career when I haven't had any success in corporate america. 30/skipped around - kind of a odd case study.,u/Remy1738-1738,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zqdbgt/help_finding_a_career_when_i_havent_had_any/,jobs,"Hey all.  Heads up this is a bit wordy. 

I'm 30 - I have a degree in MIS from a decent school (graduated at 26).

In my working career I joined the army reserves out of highschool and then proceeded to provide for myself by essentially hustling. I figured out that macbooks and such (gym euipment, cars, bikes, smokers)  would make quick cash and set up a million search alerts on craigslist/letgo/offer up and would put ads out to buy them. I would drive at a drop of the hat cash in hand and did well enough to pay through college and my first house whilst working minimum hours. 

After college I got a job as a solutions specialist which was essentially editing SOW's for IT bids. That didn't pay great and sort of sucked - I supplemented it with the hustle and eventually was offered another job at a company a friend worked at. 

That job I was a project coordinator for a client that company contracted me to. After awhile the company moved me to a data support role (checking batch jobs and such). The company lost the client and kept me in the weeds for a while and then put me in a Dev role on a internal project. Never once were my annual reviews commented on or was I trained - the dev role especially I was way over my head on. I had a SQL and mathmatics/analytics background and they expected me to learn python/gitlab CI/CD in a week.  They laid me off along with half the main team due to poor SOW's coming to be paid (I guess they didn't manage the finances well)  and I am just sort of lost for what to do next. 

I'm good at math - and I've been using that to supplement my income my entire life flipping things or getting value out of things and trying to save money/learn on the go. I love learning and diy and over analyzing to make the best choice. 

I also do pop ups with my partner. She built [pongoseatery.com](https://pongoseatery.com) if you want to check it out. We've made decent money at pop ups selling smash burgers and some catering but have yet to scale it larger (never having worked in food myself). I'd love to build this but am between a trailer/brick and mortar etc. 

 Examples of some of my value saves/earnings:

1) My honda fit was shot up and totalled. I owned it and after insurance paid out - I purchased it back for $400 and found a local pull a part car and put ""new"" doors and panels on it for around $250 and some elbow grease. I'm not a mechanic. This car was driven 3 more years and was unfortunantly hit a month ago and totaled - however for $800 in frame pulling and suspension parts it may actually be on the road again. 

2) I purchased a smoker for $4000 listed on facebook marketplace. I searched it and found the builder and the market was around 20k to have one built. We managed to sell it for $9500 a few months later after keeping it stuffed in my apt garage back. 

3) I went around to orange theory fitnesses and crossfit gyms and gave them my card/number and told them if they're ever liquidating/selling equipment (especially c2 or waterowers) to call me. I have had one call me with 8 rowers around 250 apiece that I have sold 3 for 500 so far and the rest are listed. 

4) When told my roof was going to be 25k 6 years ago - I hired a roofer after interviewing several and purchased/moved all the materials myself - did the tearoff with friends - got the dumpster - and came in under $5k total in a weekend of work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I want to go back to checking the craigslist/fb marketplace links etc as I used to be in the metro detroit area and I'm in a smaller texas town now that seems to have a monopoly on that niche (which sure I could compete but it's been years and learning the numbers/product...)

I'd like to find a job that's consistent at least short term - I have a project house that's going to be a whole reno (starting with a 30k foundation this next week) and income is key. I would value remote and flexibility over pay (my salary was 65k for the last 3 years no raises). 

Any help/guidance or ideas are appreciated. I'm hoping to find a career path in something that offers growth - business related issues (particularly financial) - anything that really has career potential and support.  Thank you for any responses."

Most of my positions have been contract (1099)-based, but I've had a couple of short-term W2-based jobs from home too.

I've noticed, though, since the lock-down, it's nearly impossible for me to find work of any kind. Now I'm getting to a desperate place. I've had more experience in my field than ever, had my resume professionally written, and have had good experiences with the jobs I've had, although they've only been part-time and are deadline and project-driven rather than hourly.

I'm feeling very depressed because I've recently come to terms with having some learning differences and realize that I will likely always struggle to hold down a full-time or regular job considering that, my mental, and physical health. I also have very bad social anxiety and haven't worked outside the house in years. I don't think I could handle it physically. I also end up very sick and stressed - or I did the many times I've tried against my inclination.

I don't have people to fall back on as I did before, and I'm afraid I will start becoming suicidal again and falling into a deeper depression. I'm not in a good spot because I've lost 3 family members including my husband and father this year and I'm also facing several physical ailments for which I keep being called back to the doctor's office. 

I don't know what to do at this point. I've been applying for a couple years now.

I also just took a test for a contract position. I spent a whole day working on it and think I did a pretty good job considering that I have a lot of experience and knowledge in the area. It's been a week and I haven't heard anything. 

Am I alone in this or is it nearly impossible to find a job from home right now?"

41,2022-12-20,An example of a scam job,u/redditadmindumb87,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zqf0ii/an_example_of_a_scam_job/,jobs,"https://imgur.com/a/p9KMgpZ

Just some tips on how to spot a scam job, first off some individual points I make don't mean its a scam, but all combined together its likely a scam.

* This company is using a gmail account to email me, a real company would have their own domain name (well at least most of the time)
* The job has literally nothing to do with my resume at all
* They want me to forward boxes (this is a huge red flag)
* It seems like the job is mine I simply have to say ""Yes I want this job""

So how is this a scam and how does it work?

This person is using stolen information of some type to buy stuff online. So this person will send me boxes, I will make sure everything in the box is good to go and then I'll forward it to a different address.

They do this cause they are ""laundering"" the stolen goods. Eventually the authorities will figure out your receiving stolen goods, and they will come knocking on your door.

Also there's a ROCK SOLID chance they won't even pay me. A lot of times they'll say ""O you get your first check after a month"" and then they don't pay you. 

Because this job is clearly just about accepting packages and forwarding them. However why go through that expense if this was legitimate? Because if they wanted those products why not ship it directly to the correct address instead of having me receive them and forwarding them.

I'm posting this cause I know some personally one that got affected by this recently, and I've also seen a post on legaladvice where someone got caught up in this.

Also I don't know what they are paying, but I bet if I asked them it'd be an attractive amount. But of course they can make an attractive pay structure offer to me...since they never intend on paying me for helping them break the law."

351,2022-12-20,Terminated for lack of engagement..I’d had a virus and haven’t been able to travel due to a foot injury. Also JUST bought a house next to the job..help.,u/lilytutttt,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zqfig1/terminated_for_lack_of_engagementid_had_a_virus/,jobs,"My worst nightmare just came true..6 months ago I [27F] left my cushy, remote private accounting job of 3 years for an entry level equity research role at an asset manager. Took a small pay cut too. 

I took the risk because the new job was a “step up” compared to my previous job, but the lack of guidance at the new job and 5 days/week in-office rule were tough. I should have known from the beginning that they’d fire me for wanting to wfh at times because they don’t issue company laptops (but you can remote access the desktop from the office using your personal computer). 

New job wasn’t entry level at all and had unrealistic expectations (I was covering 40+ companies and my peers were covering 10-20?). 

I was also reporting to this portfolio manager who’s a bit of a slacker who had no actual responsibility over my work..and the two managers who “oversaw” my work never gave me deadlines until the last minute and never walked me through anything. They’d just say “this is wrong” and not elaborate..

3 months ago I injured my foot and have been on crutches since. It’s taken longer than it should have to heal because I’ve been going in 4-5 days/week. COVID and some bacterial infection/flu were also circulating around the office, and I worked remotely for one week because I was legit sick and had a fever (also had a doc note). My foot has def negatively impacted my performance (can’t fly to conferences, am missing parties/games) but it wouldn’t have even mattered if they’d let me wfh a bit more. 

I went into the office today because I’ve mostly recovered from the virus (worked remotely for a week) and I got fired.
I’d never previously gotten any performance reviews or been told that I should step up my game. I was never told I was doing a bad job. I’d even been told that my “health” was important and that I shouldn’t spread the virus around. I was told I was doing well, actually. 

When I got fired I was told that I wasn’t “engaged” and that I didn’t ask enough questions, but I DID have questions - I would just ask vendors/sell side people more often because my coworkers were usually busy/would sometimes ignore my questions. 

I chalked it up to me not being social enough..and not willing to be in the office 5 days/week. Tomorrow I’m also supposed to move into the house that’s 5 min away from the job,  so I also have a mortgage. Am devastated because I feel totally blindsided by the termination. Help."

My work life was abruptly changed (for the worse) when one of my colleagues got fired almost 3 months ago.  I inherited his role, and how and why he became fired became even more apparent to me - he couldn't get his work done and over promised by a LOT. The end users either loved or hated him - but those that loved him had made my life extra stressful by piling on work and promised due dates. Needless to say, this was and continues to be very detrimental to my mental health and, I'm sure of it, to my baby's.  My manager while understanding basically has asked me to suck it up and I just found out is leaving for another job in a month, so all that work in trying to reorganize will almost be for naught and I need to start the politics all over again - NOT my cup of tea.  So while before I was waiting for my FMLA to kick in for a true break, I'm now seriously wondering - should or can I quit now but still get my FMLA benefits?  Anyone who has been in a similar boat? Can I start FMLA early?"

2,2022-12-20,6 Weeks of searching - Advice needed,u/KraZerrr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zqkigi/6_weeks_of_searching_advice_needed/,jobs,"Hi all, 

Apologies for the length but i wanted to be thorough.

I've been searching for entry level 2 service desk jobs and Data input/collation work for around 6 weeks, i currently work remote and i intend to keep it that way or hybrid for a local company. I've had some employers contact me back and had interviews but most of the time they go in a different direction.  
   I have the skills and ability and have been focussed about moving toward a job in either of those industries.  
   Main reasons for this move: I used to be a person who wanted to work in customer service to help people and to give them attentive attention to try and get them what they want but over the years my mentality has changed, i dislike the general population now as i have taken abuse daily and want to move into a job i can just do the work and ""Log off"". My mental health is taking huge hits and im really struggling with anxiety attacks before work to the point ive just stopped going to work and im running out of money.

I have people saying ""just go to work"", ""everyone has issues at work"", ""You have to do it, you have no choice"" but i feel like if im having panic/anxiety attacks before work, or everytime i go to log on.... thats a pretty big sign i need to move away from it.

The other issues is, i live in a small seaside town in england so everythings in the off season right now, so going to work in a pub or bar isnt doable while i look for something else. (which is normally my go to between jobs i actually want to do)

I have a doctors appointment tomorrow for the attacks and hopefully they can help me.

  
I'm a bit lost right now and am desperate for advice, websites with remote work around the world that i can apply for or any ideas on what i should do right now. I'm close to not being able to pay my rent for Jan and im more scared to go to work than i am to get kicked out of my house (i have NO family here, no one so i would literally be on the street if left too long)"

So I spoke with a recruitment member from a company I applied to about a week ago and the phone interview was really great, and they expressed wanting to secure an immediate in-person interview. They were super understanding about my limited availability for one during the week, because my current job schedule doesn't allow for anything before 5pm. There were concerns on their end saying that they didn't want to lose me to another job in the meantime, and they were sweet enough to see if they could still get the interviewers to see me after their usual hours (which is after 5pm). I let them know that I would be taking a vacation the week of 12/25 and would be happy to schedule any day during then, so we did next Monday. 

Now, I've been out sick from my current job and am taking the day off. I'm wondering if I should email them saying I have open availability just for today, in the off chance that the interviewer also has time. I don't know if that would come across as suspicious/desperate or even just straight out rude since it's technically last minute, but I figured I would give them an update.

I've been at this job for six months now, and my boss is allegedly so overwhelmed with work he can barely connect with me. My boss often makes clients promises he can't deliver on, then I get pulled in to clean up the mess. He often cancels our 1:1s, or if he DOES keep them he calls me 20-30 minutes late, which I find rude. He interrupts me and talks over me. Occasionally wouldn't be a problem, but it's nearly every time. When he's transitioned new clients to me, the transitions have been super poor, and I'm just out here winging it as best I can. Successfully, I think, but still very overwhelmed with the lack of direction.

Today was the straw that broke the camel's back. He called me yesterday afternoon and asked me to finish up a document he'd been working on for a client for the past six weeks, promising them he'd get it to them soon. He had also scheduled a 7:00 am meeting with them today, so I stayed up late to get it all finished and out to the client for review before this morning's call (which honestly is not enough time).

I check my email at 6:45 am right before the call, and there's an email from him at 3:00 am saying he'd stayed up way too late and wouldn't be on the call. I suspect he was out partying with our CEO and that's why he couldn't join the call, although I have no proof. He traveled to Denver yesterday for a meeting with him, and they're buddies from a previous job.

I'm furious. I find it rude and disrespectful to throw the work on me at the last minute AND bail on the client call (which is not his first time doing this). I once again end up winging it. I'm happy to be a team player as needed, but this feels like chaos - I've never had a boss mismanage his own time this poorly.  I'm waiting on another job offer, as this has fueled me to leave. 

I know that he's the boss and he's allowed to do whatever as long as it's not illegal, so I want a reality check here. Am I making a mountain out of a molehill given this pattern of behavior? Or is this just how some bosses are and I need to chill out?"

For example, I work in software development and we recently hired someone who changed careers from working as an auto mechanic to getting a degree in computer science at 45. He just graduated in May and we offered him a job. Problem is, that he wasn't hired as a ""junior developer"", he was hired as a ""senior developer"" because he was 48 years old and had worked in the automotive repair business for 20+ years. This is his very first job working in software development and he's getting paid 120k a year to write code as a senior developer just because of his age and total years of experience. I don't get it. How can someone be hired as a senior developer when they barely know anything? 

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen people in senior management who don't do jack shit all day who make 200k a year just because they've been with the company for 20 years. Meanwhile, some new guy who's 28 who has an MBA and actually knows his shit and is a good person is the real one managing the business and he makes 90k a year. If the guy making 200k a year left, nothing would change in the business. But if the guy making 90k a year left, the entire business would collapse. It makes no sense to me. I feel like compensation should be based on performance and impact, not just ""seniority""."

No sick days,u/sharonward1996,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zqphh1/ever_hear_of_occurences_no_sick_days/,jobs,"So I periodically (1-2 times a month) take off 2 hours early for doctors app. Unless its for blood draw, then I need half to the whole day off (I'm on medication for it). My supervisors been great, never worried and said fine if i needed an extra 10 min for break, take off, ect. And I give 2 week notice everytime. (Except once when i sprained my neck) However HR is not being so cool about it. I offer HR doctors notes every time but they say its fine and act like nothing's wrong, which is why I'm so confused.

they have something called occurences. You get 1 occurance if you are tardy (never been tardy) or need to leave early and 2 occurances if you take a day off without using PTO. After 10 occurances in 6 months you get a verbal warning, 14 write up, ect. 

This job gives no sick days or vacation days. Just PTO. But you can only use PTO if you've been employed 100 days. I'm hourly btw which sucks. Ive never had an hourly job and I hate them (no overtime opportunity in this job). I dont make much money, pretty paycheck to paycheck. So when I take off those hours or days I need for doctors app. I dont get paid or anything and now I just realized im getting ""occurances"" for them too.

Plus I have a few vacations ive been saving pto for so when I can use PTO I don't want to use it for doctors app. Like I said ive only had salary positions before this so leaving early was never a problem. 

I asked for a raise because I took on a second job at my job. So now Im doing 2 positions for the price of 1 (until the raise). I asked for more money obviously and theyre going to discuss it during my 100 day employment period which is right after the holidays. 

Im irritated because I feel like my flexibility (only good thing) is being stolen from me. And I think theyre complaining to try to not give me extra money.

I could get an accomodation but thats bringing the law into it and def wont get me anywhere but now I have a bad taste in my mouth about this job. Love my supervisor, dont like hr's stupid little juvinile rules. Feels like working at fast food.

Any advice or experiences like this?"

(he makes a fair amount more money than I ever did) Financially we're stable, but it's really made it hard for us to save on one income. Since we want to get married and have kids in the relatively near future (five years or less ideally) It's very bad timing.   


I've been trying to find a new job on indeed and a few other places with no real luck thus far. It's been three months. I've worked as a dog walker, pet sitter, doggy daycare attendant, and at animal shelters. So my work experience is pretty one sided. The issue is that pet-care is not something that low income people tend to spend money on. I don't know if it's the economy being bad, or I'm just looking to broadly at jobs I have no experience in.   


I have a GED and a few semesters of collage. I know that impacts the jobs I can get, but I'm not trying to get a job that's above my paygrade. $15 an hour is what I want, I'd be willing to take a bit less too.  
I've only ever gotten one job I needed a resume for because I worked for myself finding dogs to walk, building up clients by being seen walking dogs ext. I worked for myself, no boss until I moved in with my boyfriend to a new city. Without the network of clients I built up, all I had was the job I was hired at locally right before moving here by sheer luck. (they had high turnover of employees, and were desperate) I left that job on very bad terms with the employer, so I'm not sure I should even have them on my resume.   


Since I've lost that job, I have no idea what to do now I've been applying to almost every job I think I have a chance at, and isn't fast food. (one of my few red lines in getting a new job) any advise would be apricated. I need new perspectives on this. Thank you."

I’d been working as an English teacher at a school in Brazil for 8 years. It was a good job, with nice health insurance, but it had its fair share of shortcomings. Still, I felt “stable” enough that my wife and I decided to have a baby. 

Then the skin cancer diagnosis came. I had surgery to try to remove it, but no luck, I still need radiotherapy. Then we did get pregnant, which felt extra-scary, but I thought “at least I’ve got a job”. 

Then I get fired a few days before Christmas. No particular reason was given for this, but it’s probably got something to do with the fact that the school wants teachers that work exclusively as teachers, and I have another career going on parallel, as a translator. They asked me to work more hours, I said I would just like to stay with what I already have. 

It’s really heartbreaking and cruel, and I’m having a hard time getting over it. This feels like the worst time possible to be fired. I was due to start radiotherapy in January, now I might not get coverage for that. It sucks. I was going to enroll my kid at that school. Now I’m terrified of not being able to financially support my family. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I want to go back to that world of working at schools. I’m afraid of getting a job that’s significantly worse than the one I just got fired from. I keep thinking “what if” I had done something different. This sucks. I feel terrible. I’m thinking of focusing just on translating. 

TL;DR: I got fired by a school, even though they know I have cancer and a baby on the way. Might focus on translating rather than teaching."

Long story short: I've been in the company for ten years, working in different roles and teams. My colleague has been here for only 5 years and is less experienced than me. I own a PhD and am about 5-7 years older than him.

I have less exposure than him because I joined the team I am currently in recently, however today he got promoted to a more senior role than me, which really sadens me in a way. Although I honestly think he deserves it and am happy for him, I kinda feel left aside and not really motivated anymore.

I have a very good pay check and always had good feedback from my managers. This year I had a good pay raise too, and overall I think it'll be hard for me to get a better package/pay somewhere else (considering I'm kindof old in the market - 45 yo).

However I still feel frustrated about not moving into this position after ... nearly 10 years in this company.  There are not many opportunities in this company though, but this truly sucks.

I put a lot of work and do my work seriously, and I feel my value is not rewarded as it should be, at least for the role I have in the company. I have spoken of this situation to my boss, but that was before my colleague got promoted. At that time, he basically said I should wait for another 1 to 2 years, so that I can get more exposure in the team. The way he said it to me felt like it'll be hard for me to get promoted any time soon, mostly because of bureaucracy I guess.

I know my boss doesn't decide who gets promoted in the end, he can only ask for it, however I'm not sure if I can wait for another few years. I also now feel uncomfortable in the team, being the oldest and having a role which is weaker than some younger colleagues who aren't \*a lot\* better than me. Having money is great, but having a stagnant career is boring at some point and destroys motivation.

What do you think I should do? Should I go for another company and get a better position? I know it's not a title that will pay my bills in the end, but I really feel frustrated on this one.

Any advice welcome.

Thanks &amp; cheers"

There was a guy in senior management (let’s call him Matt) whom I’d worked with somewhat, and he pursued me romantically after I left. I’m still talking to Matt after 9 months of leaving, and I know I shouldn’t because he’s married and much older.

When he first started pursuing me romantically, I did call up my ex manager and another coworker and asked about him..and I’d hinted that he wasn’t very professional. My ex manager took offense to it as the guy has always been supportive. 

Matt really likes me, sends me daily good night texts, calls me often, and has thought highly of me (professionally). But our relationship has become EXTREMELY unprofessional and now I’m hesitant to reach out to my former coworkers about any possibility of going back.

Is there something that sounds better than Administrative Assistant for a job that is an absolute chaotic mess of roles that constantly changes based on the needs of the department that basically changes from one fiscal year to the next?

Background: My boss is trying to get me a raise so we're working on updating my job description. This position was developed for me years ago because my husband was looking for an IT assistant and the VP of a different department decided she wanted an assistant. My responsibilities have evolved over the years as the department needs and our contracts have changed. I work at a non-profit and I'm currently ""(DEPTARMENT) Administrative Assistant."" One of the ways people get raises here is by adjusting job descriptions and getting a new title. Weird, but apparently it goes with the territory of working in non-profits from what I've gathered. I worked 8 years in retail before this, started as a cashier, then customer service, then Geek Squad while I got degrees in IT and graphic design and illustration. This is my first ""real-world"" job that I've had and I'm going into my 8th year now.

Duties: This started as a consultant job with general data entry, assisting in tracking small portions of budgets, helping with some small IT problems, and occasionally helping design flyers. Over the years various tasks have been added/removed and adjusted. Currently I maintain records, generate/sort and distribute reports, track case loads, develop new tools to track ever-changing budgets across multiple contracts, develop new forms for data collection (that have ended up getting passed along to other agencies multiple times now because the state likes them that much), assist with writing contract and grant requests, department billing, general clerical support, liason with the IT department for issues I can't assist with and to enhance workflow, liason with our fiscal department more and more as the contracts increase and get more complex, gather and maintain reference materials as needed, and recently I've also started attending conferences and meetings with state-level contacts about the various contracts. It's basically a hodge-podge of stuff that the other folks either can't do or don't have time to do.

My boss wants me to pick a new job title. There is a different Administrative Assistant in another department and an Executive Assistant in another. My job duties are wildly different than theirs and the way this company is set up, similar job titles need similar roles and if the roles are different enough.... the job title needs to be different. 

TL;DR: I need a cool but professional title for a job that is basically a chaotic Administrative Assistant."

They both have a history of screwing over me and my coworkers with extra unpaid hours or retracting promises of raises or promotions. Due to these issues, neither managers are well liked. Well, they found a way to upset the department even more by both of them coming in sick with COVID the past couple days. No masks. No distancing. Nothing. 

Now I’m not one that’s still scared of COVID, but what’s upsetting to me about this is that it’s the week of Christmas. A lot of us are traveling home to see family for the holiday, and if our managers get us sick, we either run the risk of spreading it to our families or we will not be able to go home in the first place. I can’t speak for everyone here, but I know I’m absolutely furious at the complete lack of concern for the wellbeing of the people in this department and their families. I’ve done my best to watch out for myself and ensure I keep my distance, but I’ve had COVID before and I know how easy it is to transmit. If I get sick, I know it will be from one of them, and for me that honestly will be the final straw. Retracting a promise for a raise is one thing, but ruining my Christmas and potentially getting my and others families sick due to a lack of care or concern is almost inexcusable. 

Maybe I’m overreacting, but I just can’t imagine being this inconsiderate of my employees."

I work for a private, water treatment/purification  company in Chicagoland. Its ethos, purpose and message are great. I believe in the business and its impact on humanity. The growing scarcity of clean, potable water is slowly becoming threatened and in my children's life-time, I believe wars will be fought over it. If not, the technology to MAKE it potable.   


ALL THAT SAID  


The owner is a manipulative, abusive, greedy narcissist. I am an ex-felon and got lucky with this job as they didn't do background checks. I have helped build this business in the last 10 years from a $2 Million business to approaching $14 million business. I am in the executive management team and have administered our database, created our customer service department, IT Director, Marketing/Advertising. I am proud of my work and thrive when I can HELP my coworkers and customers. I feel stuck and I don't know how to leave. I do not know how to build my resume or even say 'what I do' because I do so many different things and wear so many hats.   


I am honestly at the point where **DEATH** sounds easier than separating from this business. I am scared, afraid and don't know what to do. I wont be able to find an equally paying job because of my felony tag (over 12 years ago) and feel like I am destined to work for this terrible terrible man until he dies, he fires me, he sells the business and the new owners fire me, or I walk across the street to the train tracks and just lay down. I don't know what to do.   


Has anyone had this issue in the past? How to you divorce yourself form something you actually, finally found, that you can believe in. I feel like I am having to euthanize a child."

Here are some tips and strategies to help you in your job search:  


1. Start by defining your career goals and the types of jobs you want to apply for. This will help you focus your job search and tailor your resume and cover letter to specific roles.
2. Network, network, network! Connect with people in your industry, attend job fairs and career events, and join professional organizations. These connections can help you learn about job openings and get your foot in the door.
3. Use job search engines and job boards to find open positions. Be sure to tailor your resume and cover letter to each job you apply for, highlighting relevant skills and experiences.
4. Use social media to your advantage. LinkedIn is a great resource for finding jobs and connecting with professionals in your industry.
5. Practice your interview skills. Research common interview questions and practice answering them with a friend or family member.
6. Don't be afraid to follow up after an interview. Sending a thank-you note or email can show your interest in the position and keep you top-of-mind with the employer.
7. Keep an open mind and be flexible. Consider internships, temporary or contract work, or part-time positions as stepping stones to your dream job.

Today we had another 1:1 which we have weekly and she told me again she felt like the focus wasn’t all the way there. I had asked her for specific examples because I felt that I had been doing better and she said she did not have any which is fine with me, I just asked her to point things out in the future….

However this paranoid me a little bit….if she stating that this is happening but cannot name specific examples would it be possible that after the first occurrence that I’m labeled the bad focus guy? I’m at a new job in a new industry…I know I’m going to fuck up and I’m very ready to acknowledge my mistakes and learn from them when I make them. But they are going to happen a lot being that I am new. I don’t want to be labeled as the bad focus guy every time I make a new mistake.

I recently had to go to the emergency room about 2 days ago due to having severe chest pain and not being able to breathe. I started having a really bad sore throat and urgent care misdiagnosed it as strep throat, when the symptoms got worst.. I went to the emergency room because I felt like I couldn't breathe.

 They swabbed me for covid-19, influenza, and strep throat just in case if I did actually come back as strep throat. The ER doctor comes back in the room saying that I been diagnosed with influenza A and that I MUST stay home for at least 2 days, because I'm highly contagious. I called up my company which is IKEA, and called the call out (absence) line &amp; that I wouldn't be able to make it into both shifts the next two days because of Influenza A. The person I talked to on the phone seemed understanding but then told me to call back around 10:00 in the morning to talk to my customer service rep team leader about why I'm calling off.

 Fortunately I got a doctor's note and all of my test records and discharge papers. I go back to work this upcoming friday. I'm just really concerned about being fired because I'm on that stupid 90-day probation period, where you cannot take any time off. I understand if you take time off for BS reasons such as making a last minute doctor's appointment because you want to, skipping work because you have a hangnail, or don't feel like going into work. I have a legitimate reason that I am diagnosed with Influenza A. When I go back to work on friday, is there anything that I should be prepared for? Like I said I have all the doctor's notes, doc notes of excuse of absence, discharge papers, all of my tests that ran as influenza A.. I really don't want to lose this job because it's already hard enough to find a job. Mind you also full-time disabled and I want to work, I can only work a part-time job. When I get sick, I get extremely sick like I feel like I'm on knocking on deaths door. 

All I've been doing for the last couple of days is just been sleeping drinking lots of fluids, soup, rest, and been worrying about if I'm going to lose my job. If I have a doctor's note and all of this paperwork, do you think I still will get fired? If I did happen to get fired is there any possible way to fight against it or sue them? I did find out that IKEA does have a union but I don't know if they have it in my state. I live in Michigan. Thanks!"

I've been applying to jobs using indeed and just had a question about how indeed and/or recruiters select people for interviews on this platform.

I know that for certain companies, an ATS is used to determine how many keywords and other variables match what they're looking for, and will screen resumes in or out as a result. I'm wondering for indeed if there is an ATS which will show/hide, or recommend the top qualified resumes that have applied to your position?

Or does indeed just screen resumes based on the screening questions like ""how many years of javascript experience do you have"", and if you pass the screening questions, then your resume will show up equal to all other resumes that have passed the screening questions?

If you can do this challenge, your chances of finding a job are very high. I definitely recommend it, especially for those who aim for a career in areas such as cloud technologies and cloud security!  

&amp;#x200B;

You must have at least one of the following certificates:

* For AWS: [AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/tr/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/)
* For AZURE: [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900)
* For GCP: [Google Cloud Digital Leader](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-digital-leader)   These certificates are entry-level cloud certificates. If you have a more advanced certificate, you can use that too. They average around $100.    

&amp;#x200B;

Prepare your resume document in HTML. (not as doc, docx or pdf)    

&amp;#x200B;

Style your resume with CSS while preparing it. This doesn't matter if you don't have a taste for design. Just make it look a little tidy.    

&amp;#x200B;

Your resume written in HTML should work in one of the following. Actually it might be better to use Netlify and Github Pages for this. But your goal is to show that you know the cloud:

* For AWS: [Amazon S3 static website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html)
* For AZURE: [Azure Storage static site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website)
* For GCP: [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website)

&amp;#x200B;

Use HTTPS for the security of your resume website. For this, you must choose one of the following services:

* For AWS: [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/amazon-s3-amazon-cloudfront-a-match-made-in-the-cloud/)
* For AZURE: [Azure CDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-custom-domain-name?tabs=azure-portal#map-a-custom-domain-with-https-enabled)
* For GCP: [Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https)

&amp;#x200B;

Buy a domain:

* For AWS: [Amazon Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
* For AZURE: [Azure DNS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-map-content-to-custom-domain)
* For GCP: [Cloud Domains](https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs)

You can also use a different domain provider.    

&amp;#x200B;

Your resume page should have a visitor counter. You need to show that you know JavaScript. If you do not know about JavaScript, you can learn from [codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) and [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).    

&amp;#x200B;

To be able to show and update the number of visitors, you should use a database:

* For AWS: [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
* For AZURE: [Table API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/table/introduction) from [CosmosDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction)
* For GCP: [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore)  

If you choose on-demand pricing for the database and don't store or display more data in your database than you need to use it, you'll use it for almost no money.    

&amp;#x200B;

Do not communicate directly with the database via JavaScript. Instead, create an API that accepts requests from your web application and communicates with your database. Use the API Gateway and Lambda services of the cloud service you are using for this. These services will be either free or very cheap for the transactions you make.    

&amp;#x200B;

You will have to write some code for the lambda function. You can use more Javascript but for your current purpose it would be better to explore Python and the libraries the cloud service provides a bit.

* For AWS: [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
* For AZURE: [Azure SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python)
* For GCP: [Google Cloud Client Libraries](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference)  

If you have problems with Python, [learnpython](https://www.learnpython.org/) is a good resource.    

&amp;#x200B;

You should add some tests to your Python code. [Here](https://realpython.com/python-testing/) I leave a resource for writing good python tests.    

&amp;#x200B;

You should not manually set your API resources by clicking somewhere. Instead, identify them using one of the templates below. Deploy using the CLI provided by the cloud service. This is called Infstatructure as Code, or IaC for short, and saves you time on long-term projects:

* For AWS: [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)
* For AZURE: [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-infrastructure-as-code)
* For GCP: [Terraform template](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/predictable-serverless-deployments-terraform)

&amp;#x200B;

You don't want to manually deploy again every time you change your backend API or your site's frontend code. You want it to automatically update with every change you make to your code. This [continuous integration and deployment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration) is referred to as CI/CD for short.    

&amp;#x200B;

Set Github Actions to update your Serverless Application Model template or your python code, your Python tests will run when you update your code. If it passes the test, your App will be packaged and published on the cloud service provided app.    

&amp;#x200B;

Open another Github repo for the frontend code and set a Github Actions for this repo as well, the change will be updated automatically on the cloud service provided app. **Note: NEVER add your credentials to source control!**    

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, open a blog post and write about what you learned while working on this project. Add this blog to your resume. If you have a question, you can search for answers on platforms such as [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). You can also contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fkkarakurt) and ask your questions."

Apparently, people are telling me it’s because I’m overqualified!? I mean yeah my resume is different from most but on the surface level it’s standard….


Plenty of admin/customer service/food and beverage/retail work experience since 2006. 

Completed dual undergraduate degrees in both liberal arts and sciences that I worked and paid for entirely out of my own pocket, in another country with no scholarships or loans or family support, graduated with a high GPA - so obviously good at time management, prioritizing tasks, responsible

15 years of zero negative work history- always left jobs due to uncontrollable life circumstances, was well-liked and respected by peers

Bilingual 

I write cover letters for every job to elaborate my experience, highlight specific applicable skills, and explain my study abroad history. 


Yet i’m not experienced enough to get a full-time salaried position that’s liveable with basic benefits either. 

I haven’t been picky with job selection either. I avoid sales jobs only just because I am really uncomfortable with that kind of aggressive work and I’m a terrible liar. Everything else is fair game. 

I have bills to pay. My comfort and happiness dont matter. If i can make enough money to live, i can save up for grad school or classes or whatever but right now I just need SOMETHING.

I'll give some ideas of my own preferences before asking something job specific.

I live in the US in the south. I'm currently working in retail and I hate it. I'm trying to get a job that pays enough for a single individual, with no children, to live comfortably. I have an Associate's in aviation with an emphasis in small videographer drone technology (I'm currently studying to take the recurrent training to update my license, but until then, I need a steady job), I have no office-related skills, only custodian and some retail as I was working these jobs while in college. I was originally interested in film and animation and that's my main talent, but I know it's hard to find work as an artist and I don't have a degree or experience professionally with what I originally wanted to do. I'm also very introverted, absent minded, and struggle with depression and severe social anxiety, so my current minimum wage job is making these problems a lot worse. I've been thinking of trying to get a stable Monday through Friday job where the pay is at least somewhat above minimum wage with little to no experience required. I wanted to get an office job, but it seems like all the jobs like this in my area are all receptionist and deal with customers, clients, and multitasking (which I'm terrible at). Anything else posted online is either warehouse worker, nurse's aid, hotel worker, or restaurant. I didn't know if there were jobs in places such as a bank or post office where you could work in the back. I'd rather be doing things like bookkeeping or filing/processing paperwork than an upfront job like dealing with money transactions or answering phones.

Any ideas or a list as to the types of jobs that aren't customer service related would be appreciated."

Of the 13 jobs I’ve had (mostly temp jobs), all of the longest-lasting full-time ones have had a similar pattern: I start the job, no one explains anything, I ask people if they need help, they say “no, thanks,” and then I sit around until someone wants me.

People sometimes *do* want me for something, but that “something” rarely lasts most of a workday, and is still generally uncommon—think once every two days or so on a busy week. This has been in multiple positions in multiple industries.

Is this the correct approach? It certainly doesn't feel right, but there’s never clear, consistent opportunities for me to do the work I was hired to perform, or for that matter, to even *understand* what I was hired for. No one is able or willing to explain anything beyond, “Hey Lewa358, I need you for this specific one-off thing,” and they never explain how to know when that “one-off thing” needs doing aside from waiting for someone to reach out to me. I ask for help—both to give it and to receive it—so often that I nearly come off as a nuisance, with my co-workers and supervisors politely brushing me off.

What, if anything, am I doing wrong? How do learn how to do the work that I’m hired to perform?"

I'm nervous because with this branch closing, I'm already losing work and now I have to share with someone who I'm not sure is really ready to even be promoted especially since they're nervous about traveling.

I had several interviews during my ongoing holidays, each time mentioning that I am ok taking some time with interviewing, but I would prefer to continue discussions about potential employment after christmas / new year.

Of course - as you would have expected - my request was ignored by a company , and I have an offer which they expect an answer to in a couple of days. The offer is nice and I would be excited to work there, but:

1. I feel that my request was not listened, nor discussed in our previous meeting when I brought it up, and they are kind-o forcing my hand.
2. It feels strange to accept / sign with another company while I am on vacation, withoutt letting my current employer know of my intent.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious how you view my current situation and if you have any advice for me. Just to mention, I am expecting other offers as well, but not sure if they will come this week or in 2023 ( probably because they move slower, not because i made myself undestood about wanting to deal with this issues later )

I will be as brief as I can, pardon if I’m vague. 

I started a call center IT job in October.  The company was very short staffed and under an insane amount of pressure to meet customer expectations on a tiny budget.

Often times myself and my team received apologies from our leadership and management for their consent absence.  I brought up that we often do not receive replies when asking for assistance, or when we do, it’s days later.  I even inquired about scheduling 15-30 minutes once a week or every other week.  

There had been just a couple of times where they had been able to take a second to meet with me. Each time it was because I had done something incorrectly which they met with it being their fault as I continue to lack training due to their busy schedules.  Other times it was due to my lack of permissions to particular tools to perform my duties that got overlooked by them in my original training. 

My initial training was done by a leadership member who often stated things like “We are going to cut corners here and save ourselves some time. You have been in the industry long enough to know this or that.”  I honestly feel like my outcome would have been better if he had not rushed through having pre made expectations of me.  

So here I am 2.5 months into my role still trying my best to support a client that has this extremely outdated knowledge base article (OneNote).  Often times spending too much time on a call because I started following an outdated article OR an article that the call center couldn’t complete because at some point the client revoked us from having administrator permissions. (The articles never stated in the beginning if it would require admin credentials) 

At some point I had done something that upset a VIP member of our client. I found a loophole in something while trying to fix a problem.  I utilized this because no one would respond to my questions.  And next thing I know I was logged off of all systems and my password was changed. 

I received a text message soon after on my personal cell from my manager saying she just got off the phone with the CEO of our client who asked me to be removed from their systems.  I am suspended until HR completes an investigation. 

A couple of days go by and my local police department shows up at my home on behalf of my employer.  My phone died and I don’t have friends so I hardly pay much mind to it. They called 16 times that morning and left 7 voicemails. They “said” I missed a 10am meeting with them that day that they never communicated.  This was the afternoon of Dec 19, 22 or yesterday. 

In shock and in anxiety I had not called back.  I received a letter this morning with a handful of comments I made in our chat program at work that were deemed inappropriate. 

Slang: I once said “oh, sheesus!” back in early November.  

Demanding and intrusive: I asked client for direct access to an Active Directory server in October. 

Inappropriate remark: “I think this person is on something.” (This was a rehabilitation center and a training video stated we will sometimes get calls from people on drugs.) 

And in the letter it states they have tried to council me on several occasions but I continue to fail to adhere to them. 


Thank you for any help."

Back in October, I received an offer for full time Business Analyst job at the same company I’ve been working for as a contractor for 5+ years. I didn’t really want the job so I put it off as long as possible. In the end, I accepted because the salary was really good (I went from $80k to $110k) and I was sick of doing the same job I’d been doing for 5+ years. The thing is, I was so caught up about receiving such a good salary offer that I accepted the without negotiating a more money, time off, sign on bonus, etc. 

I get treated well by my boss, even got a $1,000 bonus this month for my past accomplishments at the company. I didn’t know the company valued me so much / wanted me so badly. Otherwise, I would have negotiated a bit more. I really didn’t want the job because of 1)negative things I had heard (which turned out to be true) 2) Burnout and depression was affecting me pretty badly, 3) feelings of incompetency in doing the job. 
Despite all this, I felt backed into a corner because I thought if I didn’t accept, a) I could get laid off from my contract job and b) another offer like this wouldn’t come again.

Now I’m 2 1/2 months in with not much work to do and realize this would be a perfect opportunity to take a week or two off to get some relief from burnout and depression. 

Is it too late to ask for more time off? I was told at orientation that I should ask my recruiter about how much PTO is included in my offer package. We didn’t discuss PTO, just salary. Maybe they would be willing to give me more PTO since I’ve been with the company almost 10 years. 

What do you think I should do?"

I ""think"" it is a one-on-one interview but it's not clear. The first interview was a written-test.

Anyways, they said they're going to test me on:

* Accuracy and verification.
* Dependability
* Effective Teamwork
* Ability to think things through
* Client-first approach
* Written and Oral Communication

To prepare, I've heard that I should always have 3 positive stories; each with a Problem, Action, and Result. Then regardless of what scenario they ask me, I can twist one of the stories to fit the question. But... I'm having trouble thinking of good stories. 

I don't want to make things up, but in my current job I'm working alone so there's 0 teamwork involved. I could go back further but it wouldn't be related to this new position. I've got lots of stories of angry customers so I can try to workshop one or two of those into something positive.

Anyways, any feedback and tips are welcome. Thanks!"

I was the first in the company that brought fought a design process and everyone generally loved my work. Fast forward almost two years later, our company ain’t doing great and in order to provide the most basic functionality they can and  to try and keep the company going to a point where they maybe able to bounce back, they had to make some tough decisions, me being one of them. I could see that it genuinely hurt my manger and he is someone that does care about their employees. And I knew this was coming eventually, I just had how that we might be able to bounce back or something. Or maybe I thought I had a little more time.

I finished my Masters in lockdown, had major track record at work and in my volunteer life. The CEO is an absolute legend, I took it over a larger company offer because mentoring from him was its own sort of pay. 

Snag is, after a year of getting familiar…This is not a functional company. What I thought was small scale logistics issues gave way to increasingly being treated like an assistant rather than a manager. Pushing back to get more project ownership from peers was met with ‘you were paid to do this job, this is the way we do it.’ The CEO and other two employees have been there seven years. Marketing it a revolving door. My predecessor apparently was a random temp they hired on the fly with no marketing background, who went to a non marketing job after this. The CEO hired me for my track record…but the culture in place still treats this role like they hired a guy to move boxes.

For a while, I blamed myself and thought I had to buckle down to keep up. What changed was realizing the other employees have never worked in an association before this. They were a file clerk and a teacher’s aide who fell into the job and ran with it. I’m realizing that they do not KNOW what other companies are doing, and my recommendations are on mute because they are in a groove all their own and riding this to retirement. 

This last week had me catching flak for some smaller task errors. Some all me, some preventable with a ticketing system like most use for MARCOM. When we had an e-mail blast error because the project owner bluntly refused to proofread it, she replied telling me that I should find a relative or friend to proofread for me. Any other company, refusing to review marketing materials for a project you own is…Insanely precarious and inefficient. This got me reading up on things because a professional just doesn’t say that. 

CEO really is a legend at this and a great thinker. But he’s hands-off, can go weeks on end without contact, and isn’t going to change status quo when the other two are working fine even if new hires can’t work effectively with them. The structure is biased so errors will always get pointed at the messenger, marketing. But we cannot change that or it throws off the other staff. 

I can ride this out for the benefits and just expect grassroot problems to keep causing errors, or I can jump horizontally for somewhere larger. My biggest reason to apply around is that I’m not truly learning, these are not skills I take to the next job."

It was addressed and they just told me to make sure I double check. The mistake I’m most concerned about is that today I fell for a stupid phishing email. It matched the name for our HR manager and was asking us to follow a link, input our credentials and fill out the survey. I clicked the link and imputed my username but not my password. I went back to the email and realized it was a phishing email and sent it to someone in the IT department but I forgot to cc anyone from my department and am not sure if I was supposed to. Looking back it’s so obvious it was a phishing email and I know I messed up. I’m just really worried I’ll get fired since I’ve made these mistakes and i feel like I’m not catching on to the material as fast as they would like. I also feel like I might be being paranoid but then I realize these are very careless mistakes and reflect poorly on me as an employee. Im just venting really, I’ll make sure to be more careful in the future but what if they no longer want me as an employee. Im worried I won’t find another job because of the economy and I need a job…."

When I first started, it seemed to be going well but I noticed a lot of the sales were repeat clients. 

A few months go by and they hire someone that made changes to our goals. They also gave away my most active accounts to the new people that joint a few months after me so I basically had nothing going on expect for 1 account and they just gave that one away too and won’t tell me why. 

It’s end of year almost and they are putting pressure on me wanting me to schedule more meetings and they also put me on PIP. I believe I will be fired soon because the goals on the PIP are not realistic especially that they gave away my almost active accounts. They ask me every week what new meetings I have scheduled and I cannot get any for December because no one wants to sign contracts right now.

1,2022-12-20,Early Career Crossroads- PWM vs PE sales vs Municipal Bond Sales?,u/thetryguy47,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zr9hfr/early_career_crossroads_pwm_vs_pe_sales_vs/,jobs,"Hi everyone, looking for some advice/ questions answered,

I'm a recent college grad that is in the later stages of the interview process with 3 firms, 2 of which are top 5 (AUM based) Private Equity firms, both roles are internal sales roles paying 90-100 base. The other firm is a well respected bank, working on a municipal sales desk as support, paying 80-90 base.

The third option would be staying where I am at, which is one of the top investment banks within the wealth management division working as support to FAs (think CSA's). The program I am in leads to a private wealth associate as a exit opp. I am debating what I should do.

There's a lot of safety staying where I am at, but think my skills and personality would be well suited for sales positions, however I am not 100% sure I will enjoy it once I am there. Curious of a few things;

1. What are some exit opps for internal sales roles? Am I pigeon holed into sales once I cross that line? What is the progression/ chance to be in other sections of the PE?
2. What does the total comp look like for PE internal sales? The positions are salary + bonus, want to compare the offers.
3. Is the only path for a private wealth associate an FA essentially?
4. Should I just say F it and start a crypto exchange?

Any answers to anyone of these questions would be super helpful! Happy holidays, thanks in advance!"

the thing is, i also came to the realization that i don’t want to work in the psychology field. my dream job used to be a mental health counsellor that at least needs a masters, but i don’t see myself doing that in the far future anymore. reason being is that i don’t want to be in school for a long time as i want to work as soon as i finish my associates degree. (btw i still want to pursue a psych degree as i find it very interesting and something i want to study!) i can definitively see myself living a calm life, working in like a bookstore or something like that, that has decent pay. i can for sure see it being a job i am happy with. back in 2021/2022 i volunteered for my high school’s library. and i absolutely LOVED it. talking books with people, putting away books and getting to speak with my supervisor/librarian about books on hold and what’s coming to our shelves, etc etc. 

my parents never went to college. so they both want me to at least go to school since i finished high school. and i think an associates degree would be enough for me cuz like i said i don’t want to be in school for long and i just want to start work full time as soon as i get that degree. but i am scared of the judgement people will give me for not having a bachelors, future employers for example. and my asian family.

so all in all, is an associates degree good enough?

EDIT: thank you everyone for your replies. i didn’t expect them to come quick! i am aware that in my situation and the outcome i want, going to college would be a waste. at this point idk if college is even for me. but i at least want to try and pursue the life my mother didn’t have the privilege of. and that is going to college when she was young. she wants me to go. and i will. i want to pursue higher education at my community college, as a few friends of mine are already there and say that it’s been pretty good so far. another future career i have my eye on is into human resources, so i’ll be looking into that. **btw, i am in canada! where i am we don’t have a barnes and nobles lol**

EDIT 2: oh gosh, wow i woke up to so many responses. thank you so much, everyone! i appreciate the feedback you’re all giving me. i am sorry if i didn’t reply to everyone. i still see many people hinting that i shouldn’t go for a useless two year degree. and some saying that i should just go for it if i am able to work hard towards my associates. i’ll still go for it! make my mother proud at least by getting a degree. i have looked into the job of being a library assistant, as the only education i need to do that is a high school diploma. i’ll complete my associates, take a year off to work and to decide if i want to do the transfer over. i am still not sure if i want to do the transfer as like i mentioned, school is not rlly for me but maybe i might go back to school for something else that can be of use for me. :) i am still quite young and oblivious to all this. thanks for giving me the advice i need! it’ll definitely be my stepping stone. 




TLDR; a teenage girl contemplating if an associates degree will be good enough if her dream job is to just work in a bookstore or as a library assistant. (thinks school is not for her but still wants to go try out community college)"

I’ve been feeling like shit these days bc everyone in my office (about 9 ppl) have so much more experience than I do so they are so much better at the work than I am. I’m in sales/commercial property management and I’m always last on the list in terms of monthly sales. I’m happy to be in an environment where I’m surrounded by smart and over achieving people. It truly is a place where I can learn a lot but learning takes time and in the meantime, it feels so crappy to always be last. I also get intimidated very easily from my superiors; probably because I feel insecure about my skill level. On top of that, most of my managers are younger than me which is freakin annoying too. It’s frustrating to see everyone go a mile a minute and get so much work done in one day, while I feel lost and stuck and not know what my next move should be. I have questions but afraid to ask them bc I’m afraid I’ll be judged for not knowing the answer already. How do I stop comparing myself to them and not give such a big f*ck about work? After all, it’s only a job."

Two months ago, a hiring manager for a competitor reached out to me to discuss an opportunity that aligns more with my interests within the industry, but it never went anywhere due to it being a conflict of interest. It was a conflict of interest because the competitor’s gig was part-time and I didn't want to leave my full-time role, at the time.

With certificate and training is done during work hours. I asked my co-worker in the same department as mine if we’ll ever have those and he said no.

So my department handles the other income in the company but still part of the accounting team, we’re only four in department and the three that I work with, my manager, supervisor and the co-worker I mentioned, have been in the company for decades. The thing is there’s a previous employee who were in my position that resigned cause she felt that the company is overlooking our department, there’s no appropriate raise nor even promotion no matter how hard you work in my department… not even a lunch out even you made hundred thousand bucks for the company.

It’s my first time in a big company. So I’m having doubts if this is normal? Is this favoritism? Or is it because were not the main source of income? Is the nature of our job not accounting related enough that we’re not included on those training?

Also, the management is dissolving our department in two weeks and we’re getting absorb to another department. The management never discussed this to my manager nor have given us a prior notice on this. They only gave us this exactly two weeks to adjust. My manager felt blindsided and decided to file for an immediate resignation.

Alternatively, I could wait til after the new year but my manager and his boss won't be back until Jan 9th which is my tentative start date. So then I would have to ask to push the start date. I've asked the offering company about the possibility of pushing the start date but no response yet. 

TLDR: Give in 2 weeks notice before Christmas or wait til after the New Year and push start date by 2 weeks.

Update: Thanks for all responses everyone! This is my first time quiting so all your comments were very insightful. I accepted my offer and put in my 2 weeks notice in today."

Would it be wrong to continue to job search while this company is sponsoring me for a clearance? If I were to accept another offer, would my clearance remain or be cancelled? I would expect that company to not consider me for hiring ever again, but are there other fallout consequences? Does anyone have experience in this? I know we all say to take the best offer for ourselves but I’d like to hear from people who may have experienced this or known others who have. 

Thanks"

I've recently found myself job hunting, have had 4 interviews (out of over a hundred applications) and have three offers currently on the table. The 4th interview was yesterday and is for the job at the top of my list. I received two of the job offers yesterday, and both need a response by end of business today. I haven't heard back from the interview yesterday, but I think it went well enough and I'm optimistic about receiving an offer. My question is this: Is it bad form to accept an offer of employment and then ""un-accept"" it if I receive a better offer before my start date? I don't want to turn down the offers I have in favor of the one I don't have yet in case I don't get it."
3,2022-12-21,Wage theft?,u/prettycote,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zrtk99/wage_theft/,jobs,"TLDR: If a company has a policy of paying accrued PTO, and they then don’t pay out all of the accrued PTO, is it considered wage theft?

I originally put my notice 30 days prior to what should have been my last day. That was the contractual requirement in order to have my accrued PTO paid out to me at time of separation. My former employer then came back and said that since I had PTO scheduled during those 30 days, I’d have to either work an additional amount of days to make it a full 30 working days notice, or I’d forgo my PTO payout. I then adjusted my last day to fulfill the 30 day requirement. 

I was finally done with the job in September, but was then surprised that my PTO had not been paid out in full. They did not pay the time I accrued during my last two weeks on the job (PTO was accrued biweekly, following the pay schedule). I immediately reached out to HR, who has been giving me the run around until now. Today they told me “Payout is based on the amount accrued at the time of processing of the last paycheck. Since PTO accrual amounts do not update until AFTER payroll is processed, the additional hours would not have been included in the payout” and that in order to remain consistent with their current practices, I am not eligible to receive the hours that were accrued during your final 2 weeks of work.

Is this legal? Should I be looking for a labor attorney? Putting in a complaint with the labor department? Both? 

Any advice welcomed. 

Extra info: the money obviously isn’t a ton, about $100, but after being treated like trash and being denied ADA accommodation (which is what made me quit), I want to fight them for every last penny they owe me."

Should I be putting in more effort making connections and building a “brand” rather than actually applying? And is it even worth it to purchase these services from these LinkedIn career coaches?"

They all seem so nice, and there is several benefits, 10 minutes commute vs 1 hour commute, I can shape the role as I want and also 1 more week vacation time, same WFH benefits.

But when I got the offer which is basically everything I ever wanted, I feel so sick, because I have to leave the notice to the boss I love before 31 dec, and I know it will cause major upsets in his plans. The current boss have been amazing, and always has my back, but it just seems like an too good offer to refuse. The new pay is 73k vs the old 53k pay, the current work I believe cannot match it.

I am just wondering why I am not happy about this.

I'm debating whether I should keep the chief preparator pat in my title, making my title Collections Curator and Chief Preparator, or just simply Collections Curator.

My thinking is that the double title is reflective of the wide range of responsibilities I have, and it's not unimaginable that either title may be useful in a future professional direction. However, the single title somehow seems more ""serious"" and less like I'm working in a madhouse and doing 10 people's jobs while the walls fall down around me.

I have 2 years of experience under my belt. It was great in the beginning (a few weeks in) and suddenly the sole person who I was hired to support and who would train me went on a 3 month leave. Our workload was equivalent to that of a small team. No one knew what to do with me until someone intervened and the company paid for ""emergency"" support. So for 3 months their main vendor they worked with trained me on what I thought I needed to know to do my job.

My colleague met with me when they could during their leave remotely. I was very grateful for that.. In those 3 months, I felt like I didn't learn as much as I could have had my colleague not gone on leave. After that time passed and they returned, work was a lot better. I was learning how to better do my job and my duties. They took their time teaching me things so i would not feel overwhelmed. 8 months into the job my colleague unfortunately passed away.

For the past 4 months, I've felt so lost and unsupported. My colleague had 10+ years of work experience in our field and basically had no choice but to assume their role. (Raise still pending). My boss and other admin staff have been working to get me additional support but at this point that won't happen until January. And they won't have my former colleague's job position posted until after January as well. 

I've been stressing trying to figure things out on my own. No one else at my job can really help me since I am the only person in my specific role.

I've been feeling depressed and basically burned out since my colleague's passing. I feel like a fish out of water. 

I have been looking at other jobs and applying to some. I am not sure if maybe I am giving up to soon but I just hate feeling that my job expects so much of me and wants me to support them. They have been taking their time getting me support so that I can know additional things in order to do my job effectively.

The company has made a lot of changes in policies and personnel in the past year and the workplace environment has unfortunately plummeted. Less PTO, money-grab policies, and a panic grip on my department’s resources. 

I’ve been through a 4 month leadership program with them, led multiple pilot programs for them, and am basically an assistant to our whole upper management team - all the while being told that as soon as a management position opens up, they’ll consider me first. And during all of this I’ve maintained 100% client satisfaction for over a year and have held Q&amp;A sessions for agents wanting to improve their metrics. Of course, with the current economy they’ve frozen any internal hiring indefinitely. 

So now I’m stuck at a job, with a proven track record of improving current processes and agent performance and strong management skills (I even help train onboarding managers to help de-escalate their employees), but no technical “experience” in management. I am applying to other places for CS management positions, but no one will consider me because I don’t have ‘management experience.’

I do list my skills and experience in my resume, and I have a strong cover letter and great references, but what else can I do to convince employers I’m experienced and skilled enough for this type of position?

1,2022-12-21,I was kinda force to take vacations. Am I being laid off ?,u/F2n3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zrzkgh/i_was_kinda_force_to_take_vacations_am_i_being/,jobs,"Basically, I work in a tech consultancy company. The big purple one that people from the area know about.

I spent 2 years without taking vacations, so I had 2 months of vacations in ""stock' (Labor laws in my country say that everyone has the right to 1 month of paid vacations per year). As I work from home, I did not feel the need to take a day or 2, so I just went about my day as usual, and due to the pandemic I could not travel anywhere, so I just stored these days for when I needed them.

I was working on a project for a big bank from my country, but the contract was suddenly cancelled, on December 5th. My company then said that since it was so sudden, they did not have any other position for me to fill, so they suggested heavily that I use my vacation in January. All other people from the project, except team leader, took vacations too.

The thing is, the company leadership was always complaining about how they were always short on staff and urged us to bring friends from uni or whatever, to work for them, so I find it a bit sus that I now have to take paid vacations.

Their argument is that by law they could be fined if I did not take the vacation offer, but other colleagues had more vacation days than me, and continued to work, so I don't fully buy into this argument.

I learned quite a while ago  that company words =/= company actions.

Should I prepare myself to being fired or am I being paranoid

I recently got into the insurance business and so far everything has been going amazing!

Then, yesterday, I find out from my other colleague (Landon), that Matt, whom I thought was my mentor/friend in the business, is only giving me 1/3 of the commission of my own families retirement policy. 

He lied to my face and told me I will be receiving half of the commission when in reality I am not. 

Also, to top it off, he did not even pick the “best” plan for my mother, he picked the plan with the highest commission amount!

I feel betrayed, disrespected, and genuinely hurt. 

Thankfully, the deal hasn’t gone through so I am going to cancel it. 

What is the most professional way to confront this situation without exposing my other colleagues honesty?

I may be young woman who just entered the business, but he crossed a line with not only ME but my FAMILY."

I have interviewed for a few jobs before I landed in my current position. I found that one thing in common is that the management (I describe as ""office people"") often set guidelines that only make sense in the office, and impractical in the retail environment. Does anyone think the same? For example,  it says in the rules that we should not have personal discussions on the shop floor, but all of our team members do, we talk casually with the customers. It contributes to our sales, as the customers like our friendly attitude. Also it says do not discuss organizational matters in front of customers, it is impossible considering the team is busy doing all of the work, including organizing the stock, etc. So the customers will hear some of those things, and as a charity organization, if we also like to talk about what we are doing, and how we are making positive change to raise funds for the people that really need it, it actually creates incentives for customers to make donations. I also do not get why it is first and foremost to ""greet"" the customers. We do not have anyone by the entrance to do that. In our store, it is almost a luxury, it makes more sense to be ""attentive"" to the customers, as it is already busy enough at the tills, no one is wandering around. ""Sales strategies"" suggested by the office people also do not work in reality. I wonder if it is an isolated case, or in general, it takes a different skill set to be in management, so they do not always have practical knowledge about what is going on in the stores? It sounds a bit counterintuitive to me, as the management ideally have knowledge about the stores, and should communicate with the staff about what is going on, and what the policies are, that are actually practical, to ensure that all of the stores have the same standards."

I have a lot of course and experience background in ecology, specifically outdoor and hands-on stuff (field botany, animal behavior, forest ecology, etc). I’ve been having a lot of trouble with finding a job- I recently became disabled, so the type of careers I’ve been working towards suddenly aren’t an option for me. I am also autistic and struggle with verbal communication, so customer-service type jobs are difficult.

There are no support networks for disabled people in my area and my university career center offered no help other than “just keep applying.” Currently I work as a barista to make rent, but it’s becoming apparent that my condition is getting worse and this will no longer be viable for me. 

Ideally, I would love a WFH job. I could see myself doing data entry- I don’t have a strong math background so data analysis really isn’t in the cards for me.

My coursework includes basic ecology courses, plant science and ecology, and animal welfare/behavior. Undergrad research/internships were:
-Field research in an ecology lab with some data entry and GIS mixed in
-Humanities research lab that ran interdisciplinary learning workshops, then analyzed how it affected professors’ teaching methods and students’ understanding of content. Presented at a conference and involved a lot of collaboration.
-Internship working at a wildlife rehab center, which involved medical care, data entry, animal behavior analysis, and a GIS research project

If I could have any advice at all I would greatly appreciate it. I’m worried that my disability will worsen before I can secure a job. I’ve been applying to data entry positions on Indeed and Glassdoor, and I’ve submitted my resume to some temp agencies, but I have no idea what else to do. I feel totally lost and anxious about finding a job."

1,2022-12-21,I received negative feedback from my PM and I need to know how to improve soms of my skills.,u/definetelynotlocal,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zs885r/i_received_negative_feedback_from_my_pm_and_i/,jobs,"Today two of my project managers also happen to be principals wanted to see my to discuss some of the things. They said, they have 3 concerns and would like to discuss with me. I was kind of nervous when they approach to me like that. I was told that;

1- I need to set my schedule and no longer request working from home, at least for a period of time. I have to be at the office by 9:30am. 

It’s because there was some days I worked from home and communicated with them. I had flat tire, my sister ended up in the ER, my doctor appointments and etc. 

I agree that I need a fixed schedule however in the beginning they told me that they have flexible hours - which so many people show up at 10 or later- and that they use office for meetings and I can work from home whenever I want. Not 3-4 times of the week.

2- I need to improve my Revit skills and ask less questions to people. 

Okay, I told them ag the very beginning that I have never ever used Revit and they were okay with that and my boss had signed me up for Revit classes for beginners. Even though, I use a lot of complex softwares, Revit was kind of challenging for me so I was asking questions to one of my coworker who promoted to Project Manager. 

They said, I need to put more effort and try to fix things on my own and not to bug others. (That’s not what they said but what they mean). 

3- My presentation skills and one client complain about my service. Even tho the other client bragged about me to my boss yesterday.

This was the most hurtful thing to hear because everyone around me praised me for my friendly and confident personality and I know that when I talk, I sound very confident but they interpreted it as being pushy. They said that I need to say less -uhhmm, like, well....- 

Here’s the thing, I have been in this country for 3 years and even tho some native speakers think that I’m an American, I am not. And when my excitement and fast-talking combine during the presentation, it might be chaos. Usually most of my presentation skills are not bad but they had an attitude as if I am a failure and need improvement.

I feel like I’m the only one who received that type of warning and don’t want to lose my job - my sister and I will be moving out soon and I need to make money to pay my bills.

Any recommendations?"

I don't talk much because it's tiresome and I don't interact much with others day-to-day, including my family whom I live with (mom and siblings, not spouse and kids). I'm a slow thinker and speaker so whenever someone says something that elicits a response, I laugh by default. I think this makes me appear young, silly and immature which isn't the best way to carry myself at work with a bunch of IT professionals. I've always felt like my coworkers are too serious and it's just not my vibe. But I am the youngest (30yo) and least experienced in the workforce compared to everyone else who has had multiple jobs and is 50+ years old with a house and family .  


How can I give clear, confident responses (instead of laughing at everything) and carry myself more ""professionally""? I will be working with a LOT of people and potentially ones higher up the corporate ladder. I feel like unless I pull it together, I don't stand a chance at success/survival.

ETA: To clarify, I act this way in general, but I’m specifically talking about in meetings. I was introduced to a team in a daily scrum meeting and just awkwardly laughed and said thanks because I didn’t know what else to say. I sounded like a goof in front of everyone. In my role (I’m a new BA) you are expected to be assertive and (sort of) command in meetings and explain things to stakeholders (I.e., important people) in a particular way. Giggling and being awkward will do nothing but put a huge target on my back to make others think they can can walk all over me. Others I’ve had meetings with absolutely do not do not behave like this in my IT department."

I have never been in a position like this, and there has never been someone hired who has done what I now do, so there is no official title.

The common concensus was that my original title had to do with Purchasing, which I couldn't agree with more BUT...

The reason I wanted to know what my title was **when I was hired** is because I've been at this company less than a year, and the purchasing aspect is now the least of my responsibilities and thats only because I cleaned, automated, and streamlined the purchasing system and got new tasks or issues thrown my way, and now it's neverending!

Some examples of new responsibilities I have:

-Recruited, Scheduled, Interviewed, Hired, and Fired Employees. (Collect forms/ license run background check, call references. The new hires report to me on where to go or what to do each morning)

-Created a funtional system to file and distribute administrative paperwork/forms that I collect.
-Manage and track tools and trucks (Maintenance, Insurance/Registration renewal)

-Appeared **IN COURT** on behalf of the company and dealt with DA and police for months, I had to research business law to make sure we wouldn't be liable. (All because the owner lent the company dump truck to a 70 year old man who crashed it)

-Restructed our business and the line of communication hierarchy to fit a more reasonable structure for our company. (Thus making me the final line of defense before the owner, so now I deal with administrative issues, sub contractors, designers, etc)

-Create a long-awaited and much needed website for the company. (Which a web designer was already paid $1500 down payment to make this for us, almost 2 years ago before I started)

-Researched and utilized existing systems to refine Invoicing system to communicate with time tracking system to produce accurate cost tracking with project notes and labor/material breakdown.

-*Fun Bonus* I'm now responsible for any dealing with any emergencies like car accidents/speeding tickets ***WHENEVER*** they happen like 2 a.m. calls about trucks getting impounded, as well as determining what to do when employees have drug/alcohol problems and is possibly or is intoxicated and how to handle it legally and ethically properly.

Another main aspect is I now asked to do so many things for my boss unrelated to the company I am employed at. As it is I deal with all the tenants in 4 different rental properties he owns, any maintenance issues or concerns go through me (from helping install fridges and water heaters, to climbing up the side of the house to the 2nd story eave to put squirrels traps.)
I could go on for hours with non-business related things I've done like covering so the boss can go hunting or getting his wife a Christmas tree or researching baby bouncers for his new baby, who I've had to watch and feed as well. I made an account/profile and posting for an Air BnB he wanted me to *run* until his wife didn't like the idea and shut the idea down.

It's neverending. But I'm good at it, whatever it is."

I did not expect him to regard me with suspicion. He did give me his card, but kept saying, ""I don't usually get that question."" Upon reflection, it was like he was trying to suss out what I was up to. Really I just felt the contact was better to have somewhere, than not.

I made light conversations while getting back to work on some orders coming in- mainly because I noticed most people had cleared out to ho who k own where. After just a little back and forth he said, ""It was nice to meet you, Current."" And left.

0,2022-12-22,How did you find a role you'll like or at least tolerate? I'm a recent graduate and new engineer feeling very lost.,u/durianjuiced,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zscyae/how_did_you_find_a_role_youll_like_or_at_least/,jobs,"Hi  everyone, I'm on my second job out of college and am already looking for a new job. I'm struggling to  find a position that I can get that also doesn't make me miserable. How do you find a position that you'll actually like? The job application  process is slow and painful and I often feel like it's hard enough to  get a job offer so I have no choice but to take the what I can get.

For some background, I graduated with my BS in Mechanical Engineering  around the middle of the covid pandemic and was pretty scared if I could  even get a job. I didn't have an internship and my only experiences were from a few engineering club projects.  Academically, I started  performing very poorly early on due to an undiagnosed psychiatric  condition.

I was applying for jobs  in a panic because I know my folks needed help with money, so I took  the first offer I could get. I was an applications engineer and spent  most my time repairing the devices and helping customers with tech  issues. After the first couple of months, I already wanted to find a new  job. The company I worked for was kind of unethical and  I was being  told to lie to customers. Additionally, there was no learning or growth  opportunities at all. I was trained in a week on how to perform repairs  and help customers and I had to figure a lot out on my own. I don't feel  like I learned anything interesting or useful or transferable. Just the  skills to be successful in that specific position.

After  1.3 years and \~100 applications, I got an offer for my current job as a  quality and manufacturing engineer. The job is a substantial commute  from where I live and I accepted it because the job was advertised under  a hybrid model, but after starting, I was told that the position now  needed to be fully in person. Regardless, I was excited about learning  about manufacturing processes and how quality systems work and DFM. The  work, however, turned out to be very boring. I'm essentially just a  glorified quality inspector. There's no thinking required at all, I just  look for a quality issue in our products or sometimes generate reports.  I did it all and had time to do nothing, so I've asked for new  responsibilities that would require me to learn a new skill or gain some  knowledge, but I ended up saddled with more of the same work. Now I  regret it because I'm busy with boring, mindless work.

I  started applying for new jobs in October and have had some interviews,  but this time I'm trying to be more picky about the positions.  Unfortunately, the job application process fucking sucks. I feel like  I'm just yelling, ""HIRE ME"" into  the void and hoping for a response.  I've had 5 interviews so far and the jobs that I'm getting interviews  for seem to be either interesting jobs in a bad work environment or  painful jobs in a good work environment. I honestly want to work  somewhere chill and tolerable or where I'm doing something  useful/interesting, but I don't want to be working 70 hours a week in a  toxic environment. Ideally, I always thought I'd want to be a design engineer, but I apply to as many roles as I can besides the ones I've  had already.

Do you have any  advice on how to find the right engineering role? What did your career  path look like and how did you get where you could enjoy or tolerate it?

TLDR: I'm miserable at work, but I don't know how to find a role that I'll like."

Like a job that doesn't take a lot of experience but would show that i can handle stress or something along those lines.

Or if i write that i worked for another job for a couple of months longer than what i actually did? Or that i had more responsibilities (nothing too serious) than what i actually did? 

Thanks!"

I wish I said I was flexible, but I said I wouldn't go below x amount because I currently make x amount. I feel like I bombed that question and showed my young age by not knowing how to be more discrete. Should I be worried? I mean, she still immediately scheduled me for an in-person interview so maybe it wasn't so bad? Or is it a red flag that she still wants to pursue me as a prospective employee? I'm definitely overthinking this because I wasn't ready for this question since it was just a feeler interview to explain the role to me and also because they already posted their salary range on the application, so like yeah I wouldn't apply if I wasn't okay with that range and obviously flexible."

I'm trying to build my skills and land a full time job that can replace everything else, but no luck after trying so hard for so long...

It's a big priority to get another job (part time or something else) that gives enough hours or pay to help me pay things off, and also can work with my chaotic schedule that will vary (meaning I can't pick up another conventional part time job, unless the hours AND pay is enough to replace everything else I have now). 

I'm already considering gig work, although it doesn't seem to pay well, especially considering the costs of driving and the potential risks involved. Food delivery seems best, not too sure about ridesharing or Rover pet-sitting. 

Any ideas for other jobs or ways to make decent money with flexible scheduling or choose your own schedule? And preferably without requiring beyond-entry level skills (otherwise I would just go for a full time job with said skills)? Ideally this is a temporary stopgap until the day I can finally land something sustainable.

10,2022-12-22,Blindsided in job interview,u/kfeelz,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zsj5sq/blindsided_in_job_interview/,jobs,"So I've been talking to this company for about 3 months for a position I really want. It's extremely niche, in an extremely niche area, and I have a background (professionally and academically) that maps onto it perfectly.

We had an initial 30 minute interview, then a 3 hour test. We scheduled another interview with 2 members of the team and I asked if there's anything I should prepare for the interview and what to expect. I was told that it was just going to be a general discussion about my test answers and not to worry about preparing anything. 

I still prepped questions to ask about the test, their thoughts on it etc, and I went in with a set of potential topics to discuss. However when the interview with the 2 members of the team started, they said it would be a structured question and answer round with behavioural and competency questions. They also said we only had 30 minutes so to be as brief as possible. 

I felt completely blindsided and unprepared - the questions were things like 'how would you explain [the subject of the role] to a person who fits X Y and Z criteria', 'what potential new business opportunities do you think our company could pursue' as well as more conventional questions about my experience dealing with clients.

Thing is, I have adhd and aspergers and find it hard to organise my thoughts under these sorts of situations (ie when I wasn't expecting these questions and was mentally prepared for something entirely different) so I stumbled a lot and couldn't get my thoughts together. And I got overwhelmed and spoke really fast and rambled. I'm pretty much certain I bombed that interview.

I just feel so disappointed. It felt like this role was made for me and I put so much effort into prepping. Is it normal for interviewers to tell you one thing and do something completely different? Was this a kinda mean way of testing how well I do under pressure/unexpected circumstances? And should I say anything about it to them going forward? This was a couple of days ago now and I didn't even bother sending a follow up because I knew I did so badly."

Should I take this as a good or bad sign? If they didn't want me, they would have sent me a rejection email by now, right? Right?

I’m not 100% happy with my current role/field and I’ve been interested in moving into this other field for a while. However I can’t help but wonder, if they offer me this other role would I really enjoy this new field? Is the grass truly greener? Also, I have a great relationship with my current manager and they just promoted me, is this new opportunity worth leaving that? I know logically I can always move back to my current field if it doesn’t work out, but I still have these feelings/questions. Anyone who can relate or has done this?

Edit for more details: My current position is customer service/sales.  I am very much not a sales person, I don't find it personally fulfilling. I don't like: I feel I can never learn enough to be an expert; a small mistake could have extreme financial consequences for the company; my ideas are not heard, I cannot affect meaningful change for myself or colleagues; the job is stressful, the whole industry is overworked and understaffed.  Things I like: my manager; clear career growth/pathing; always learning new technical skills (both a pro and con tbh); not boring, every client I work with is unique.  The new role is in the realm of HR so my main motivation for looking at it is to find something more fulfilling in my day-to-day.  I have done HR before so I have a little bit of this experience but the job doesn't require a lot of HR knowledge. I'd get to develop a training program for new hires and guide them in their career journeys in the company.  New hires would be in training to do the job I've been doing for the past 4 years.  I like the thought that my ideas could be heard, I'd get to help grow someone else's career, and I would actually be able to make a difference for the company and the current employees in it who are overworked like I am right now. The things I might not like are a huge unknown, hence this post."

What to do?,u/lilytutttt,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zsnff8/terminated_for_lack_of_engagement_id_had_a_virus/,jobs,"My worst nightmare just came true..6 months ago I [27F] left my cushy, remote private accounting job of 3 years for an entry level equity research role at an asset manager. Took a small pay cut too. 

I took the risk because the new job was a “step up” compared to my previous job, but the lack of guidance at the new job and 5 days/week in-office rule (started out as 3-4) were tough. I should have known from the beginning that they’d eventually fire me for wanting to wfh at times (which started after my injury) because they don’t issue company laptops (but you can remote access the desktop from the office using your personal computer). 

New job wasn’t entry level at all and had unrealistic expectations (I was covering 40+ companies and my peers were covering 10-20 &amp; had no training/feedback). 

I was also reporting to this portfolio manager who’s a bit of a slacker, and had no actual responsibility over my work..and the two managers who “oversaw” my work never gave me deadlines until the last minute, never walked me through anything, and rarely checked my work. They’d only really check my work once THEIR boss checked what I did and flipped out at me for it not being good. 

4 months ago I injured my foot and have been on crutches since. It’s taken longer than it should have to heal because I’ve been going in 4-5 days/week. COVID and some bacterial infection/flu were also circulating around the office, and I worked remotely last week because I was legit sick and had a fever (also had a doc note). My foot has def negatively impacted my performance (can’t fly to conferences, am missing parties/games) but it wouldn’t have even mattered if they’d let me wfh a bit more. 

I went into the office Monday because I’d mostly recovered from the virus (worked remotely for a week because I’d also COMPLETELY lost my voice) and I got fired.
I’d never previously gotten any performance reviews or been told that I should step up my game. I was never told I was doing a bad job. They said they’re a small organization and cant provide handholding. I even have screenshots of texts saying I was doing well, actually. 

When I got fired I was told that I wasn’t “engaged” and that I didn’t ask enough questions, but I DID have questions - I would just ask vendors/sell side people more often because my coworkers were usually busy/would sometimes ignore my questions. 

I chalked it up to me not being social enough..and not willing to be in the office 5 days/week. I missed the holiday party and a few football games. I’m also supposed to move into the house that’s 5 min away from the job, as I also have a mortgage. Am devastated because I feel totally blindsided by the termination. To top it off, I told a few girlfriends and they just ghosted me, so I’m not planning to tell anyone else. Help."

I have a coworker (product manager) who went to a prestigious university, has a ton of high achieving friends, gets her shit done and travels a bunch (we're remote.) I went to a state university, have a few friends, my friend are smart but chill, I get my shit done but I don't enjoy traveling or going out much.

Now, this woman gives me a lot of attitude. We have monthly 1:1s and sometimes she likes to throw advice down my way. She was like, if I travel more, I'll be more interesting. I grew up in NYC but I don't think I like being here anymore, but she tells me NYC is the place for a girl in her 20s to be and there is so much to do and people to meet and blah blah. Also, she told me when she worked at startups in the past, she would have sleepovers with her coworkers... I feel like I can't keep up with her.

I have too much adverse feelings to the city after my shitty upbringing here that nothing really impresses me anymore. Also, I am not genuinely interested enough in people. I haven't really told her this but I don't really think I need to explain my habits and why I do the things I do and think the way I think, but I am trying my best. I have a therapist, so I am unlearning things and trying to pick up healthier life patterns; but, I can't change right away. This is hard for me. I adapt easily at work but not in life.

I am a software engineer. I work remotely. I think maybe I do bring some negativity into the office because I am reserved but I am not mean to anyone, nor do I pry into people's lives. I think I am approachable and friendly though regarding work. I can be living an amazing life but I would rather not bring the details into virtual standup or happy hour.

2,2022-12-22,How to approach interview when I already have a job,u/sharonward1996,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zsnybe/how_to_approach_interview_when_i_already_have_a/,jobs,"Hi, so a little backstory:

I got my job 3 months ago as an hourly full time tradeshow coordinator (21.75/hr). It wasnt actually full time so I took on another job. Now I'm the Tradeshow coordinator and inside Specialty Sales. Currently, I'm waiting till my 100 day review to renegotiate salary. Im asking for ($25/hr). Besides that theres not too many benefits aside from I have the chance to work from home twice a week and I like my supervisor. No sick leave or anything just PTO. 

I'm a little nervous they wont give me the raise. Sadly making $21.75 is paycheck to paycheck for me but I needed a job so I accepted.

Well I'm applying to other jobs just incase. I kind of feel like I'm being sneaky but people tell me you should always be looking. This job in the last 3 months has given me ALOT of sales and marketing experience and so thats the jobs I've been applying for.

I have an interview tomorrow and I dont know how to approach it. Do I say, well if my job doesnt give me a raise for doing an extra position I'm interested? I'm asking this potential new job for 55-60k/yr.

Advice? How do I approach an interview when only considering leaving current job?"

After about 3 years working as a IT Specialist I am back on the job search. I am still currently employed at my company. I feel there is not a lot of room for growth at my current job (IT is very small) and I ready to look around and see what else is out there. Also I have the general feeling that things are trending downhill at my company judging by the recent turnover. I have been promoted and given 2 pay increases so I feel it is a good time to perhaps get noticed by other employers. Been a long time since I have reworked my resume. But are Simple minimalistic resumes the way to go these days ? I downloaded a few Microsoft premium resume templates online but I am not sure about a few them.. the ones with photos and the big fonts and colors just seem kind of corny to me.. What you guys think ? Simple is better for resume and cover letter ?? or no
6,2022-12-22,I feel my job is meaningless. How to find a purpose in corporate world?,u/xemq,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zsot7m/i_feel_my_job_is_meaningless_how_to_find_a/,jobs,"Corpo worker here, lvl 37. The feeling of lack of meaning in my professional work has been bothering me more and more every year. In the beginning I was motivated by raises, promotions, visions of earning more money. Even a few years ago I was fooled by the slogans ""you have an impact on the world, work with passion"" and other stuff invented by HR. I even relatively liked what I was doing and managed to get to a managerial position.

Unfortunately, for some time now, I feel I've swallowed the red pill of the matrix and started to see what it really looks like, and I can't wring out the optimism, motivation, commitment I used to have.

The thought that my work doesn't have much impact on the world eats up me like a toxin. Let's face it, there are a lot of jobs in corporate world where it's hard to find more meaning. There's even a book written about it called Bullshit Jobs.

That you ""click something there"", you don't know what exactly, but you click it because they pay you for it.

That in the beginning even tried to arrange and clean up this overwhelming mess, but over time everyone got used to it and doesn't even try to fight it. I, unfortunately, have a strong need to have everything relatively arranged and in chaos I feel lost.

That if it was your company, you would arrange it completely differently, but that someone at the top has a different idea is what you will burn energy to change their mind - I am too tired to do that..

That there is a ubiquitous mess that has to be dealt with every day, and AI will not replace humans for a long time to come, because AI needs structured input to work - it won't find itself in a mess.

That they try to brainwash you with slogans ""we are like a family, work with passion, work is not work - it's passion, that people come first"" and the simplest things sometimes don't work which drives me crazy.

That the 8-hour work mode with 20 days off + weekends is some kind of harsh misunderstanding. That it's too long a leash to not go down with a heart attack at 40, but too short to live life to the fullest.

That after a full day's work you are drained of energy and don't want do anything, because this is another day in which nothing important happened.

And so I go to work having such thoughts, maybe not every day, but a few times a month it happens. The vision of working until I'm 60 is some kind of harsh misunderstanding for me, because I feel that I don't want to right now. Well, but one has to live for something.

The problem is that work is as much as 8-10 hours a day (with commuting), and it's hard to feel happiness in life if you devote almost half a day to something that in your heart appears meaningless.

Is this specific of my job, or is it like this everywhere? Does anyone have the same thing? How do you deal with it?

I try to motivate myself in various ways, but I'm running out of ideas, and retirement is far away.

If this thread is too depressing for this reddit, you can delete it. Thank you all!"

I’m Jake, I’m 20 years old and I’m currently extremely motivated and driven, but I can’t seem to find my path. I’ve tried numerous options, and have had many local jobs, but I’m not really searching for a career, so I’m finding it extremely hard to stick a job that would really help my situation.

I’m interested in a job that would allow me to pursue other interests while also allowing for me to excel and be fulfilled. I want to be making above $15 per hour, and I’m hoping to find something I’m interested in. 

I know this is a lot to ask for, but I basically just want a step up from working at local businesses that can only pay around $12 per hour and seem like a waste of time because most of my time spent there is standing idle.

I live in sweden, so legally im allowed to start working at 16. I turn 16 in march, but feel like i need to do something before that. A job isnt going to magically appear once i turn 16, as there are thousands of others who Will also be turning 16, looking for work.

Im thinking of approaching physically as doing it online is so difficult. But dont really know how to go about it. Also, cant find any place actively looking for new workers. Unless im willing to commute for an hour to a big city just to get there

I can work any schedule I want during the week to accommodate anything in my personal life and because I am hourly I only work 40 hours a week no matter what. 

I had a recruit reach out to me about a job very similar to what I do. Still work from home but I would have to travel to their state once or twice a year. The benefits are to be determined but she said that the salary is 15k more than what I make now with a sign on bonus and a yearly 7% bonus. 

I am torn in seeing where this opportunity goes as I really do enjoy my current job, co workers and director. There are possibilities for growth within my current role but we are a new plan to an established company (plan has been around for 2 years but company has been around for about 30 years, while the recruiter’s company has been around 40 years and has grown substantially.)

Any advice? Thank you!"

I was able to land a WFH position relatively soon after graduating, essentially doing asset management, and have been there for a little over a year now. While the job pays decently for the daily workload, I really feel as though I could be doing more and I feel willing to put in the work for a better paying job. Since my degree was in math, my knowledge in finances is very limited, despite my position technically being in the ""finance"" category.

I think I was (probably wrongly) assuming that simply having a mathematics degree would essentially be enough for most entry-level positions involving analysis of some sort. Either way, my other job applications haven't gotten me anywhere since working at my current company. Since I'm currently single and don't have many other obligations to worry about, I really feel as though I would have the energy and motivation to put in the work to have a better paying job, whether that means gaining some further certificates/schooling or simply acquiring a more demanding job. With my current job being so chill, it's made me realize that I'm not all that interested in simply living a laidback, carefree life at this time.

Basically, I feel like I'm capable and willing to learn a lot but my current background doesn't have a whole to speak for itself. 

So, all this to say, some basic questions I have are: \*Are\* there companies actually looking to hire math majors? If not, what further qualifications/experience would be necessary to be employable? Would it be best to hone in on one ""mathy"" field or keep my options open?"

So I interviewed with a creative agency a few days ago. I really liked the idea of the job and the company is rather small so I feel that works great for me. I've read up on the company and they have stellar reviews from former and current employees. The woman I interviewed with said she'd email me her contact details, but hasn't so far. I followed up yesterday to ask if those details would ever come. I got a response from her colleague saying that the woman was ""having a good think"" about potential roles for me, but she's currently busy with clients and that she was sure she would reach out to me soon.

It makes me hopeful, but I know I'm not out of the woods yet and haven't stopped applying for other jobs. I just really want this job and to get out of my current one. Take it as impatience I guess.

But regardless, is this a good sign? Do you think they'll every respond or is it just filler talk?"

The role is dependent on state funding, so there are budget restrictions because of this, but it also advertised a very specific salary range when I first applied: $129,118 to $192,220. 

A few weeks ago had a very encouraging panel interview with eight senior-level team members. Felt very comfortable about both my chances and what I could bring to the role. Yesterday, they called and said I’m a finalist and will be making a visit in January for a day of interviews, dinner, etc. Just have a quick call with someone from the search team—that was today. 

She wanted to reiterate the salary range, but shared that it is between $130 and $160, and while there “may be some room to be negotiate” later, it’s above her pay grade to discuss. 

I’m feeling a little bait-and-switch here. The difference is not insignificant, and while it would be a good raise from where I’m at, I would also be uprooting my family to move to another state and take on more responsibilities.

But I have a strange feeling that this company wants to low-ball me in the end. Once I ask about the salary, I’m guessing their response will be something along the lines of “Well, it’s a pretty broad range and depends on your experience/skill set.” 

Now, if a company was to say that to you, then how would YOU respond? Both serious and funny responses are appreciated 😊

Are people actually getting fired over dips in productivity? Is it genuinely being used in performance reviews? Or is it more for resource allocation, finding workflow improvements and improving efficiency? Or is the data more for safekeeping, where down the line, if there's ever a need to fire someone, they can go through it and find a reason to do so? Or monitoring union organization activities?

I (23m) am very junior (recently graduated undergraduate) in the workforce and about 3 weeks ago I accepted an unpaid internship for January at a very, very cool company (I am in the US so this is legal). I would have to work at a restaurant at nights to make ends meet as I don't have enough savings to live off of. Having said that, this internship is in the exact field I'm passionate about, even if it is very low-level and administrative. 

At the same time I was interviewing for an extremely interesting company that does work while a little out of my area of expertise, is something I could definitely see myself getting into and at the bare minimum would love to learn more about and suits my interests. I was really surprised that they offered me a pretty well paid position that I am quite under qualified for. I really want to take this opportunity because of the pay, benefits, and I strangely feel a bit inspired by taking a leap into this industry.

We start photographing Wednesday and all have to be photographed by Sunday since people viewed them Mondays and the actual auction is Tuesday. If it’s not done by Sunday then it has be done by Monday morning. 

Anyways, when I first started it was 4 of us but now it’s only me in the department since the others left. I’ve constantly asked my boss if we can hire more staff for my department ever since the first person left. He keeps telling that we can’t at the moment due to low production which I assume is affecting the company budgeting. However, they were still hiring more employees in the office department for some reason. Once the others left and I was the only one left to manage the department, I asked my boss once again if we could hire more staff. I got the same answer and was told the company is on a “no hire status” right now. I had to change my schedule around due to them resigning and  started taking up more responsibilities ever since. I struggle with photographing over 100 cars by myself while having to move another 100 sold cars to designated areas. I’m also responsible for driving up the auction cars when they’re ready to be picked up. I have from Tuesday evening till Friday evening to complete all this. Sometimes I get helps but most of the time it’s just me. I’m usually promised with more help but it’s not enough to make up for the loss staff. 

It really bothered me this week because it is raining all day today and tomorrow and it’s been freezing cold all this week. My boss wants me to get an umbrella, bundle up, and take photos of all the cars still. I’m just thinking to myself, it’s not gonna happen. It’s raining way too hard for me to even get good pictures. I can put up with the freezing cold, but not for 8 hours straight. We have a small office trailer with heat that we stay in to take breaks that I like to go in. I just usually stay in for about 30min-1hr at a time. Most of the day if there’s nothing do. I’ve been told to not stay in as long any more and I just said “okay” and decided to sit in the heated car whenever. I was unofficially made management the of the auction lot. I say unofficially because I’m taking more responsibility with the same pay and title. This could just be me but I just don’t feel this it’s worth pleasing my job anymore if it’s at the expense of my mental health. 


TL;DR: Job refuse to hire more staffing for my department even thought I’m the only left due to low production. Left doing multiple weekly task that I struggled to meet. Promise help but rarely get any. Wants me to do my job in the cold freezing rain but won’t send help nor hiring more people."

Since I have a FedEx down the street from where I live, this is doable for me.

With this, I’m trying to think of a solution that will work in the long term. I don’t think it’s effective that I have to go out and help ship items all of the time, especially since our team is growing and we’re going to have more people. The more people, obviously the more frequently I’d have to run to a FedEx to get the work picked up and/or shipped. Can someone please help me brainstorm on what a solution would be?

My management team is not the best and they seem to make decisions on what is best for them and not the long term goals for the plant.

I make good money.  I have been working to get my finances to where I can take a cut in pay.  Thing is, with my specific skill set I’m having problems finding jobs I know I would rock at that’s not on some kind of swing shift.  I am in lower management but have worked my way up from the bottom.  I do have history in several other industries.

At my age I would love something that pays decent, maybe thirty an hour or up, and is off during the holiday seasons and isn’t shift work.  Finding jobs on indeed and other web based job searches doesn’t seem to work.  Does anyone with knowledge of power production have any ideas for a good transitional employment idea?  

I thought of retiring early and taking what I can get job wise while receiving my pension.  The pension could make up a some of the salary loss.  Problem is I need to wait another two years to get a good enough pension.  I’m not sure I have two years left in me.

To keep it simple: I don't really like IT.

I like stuff like visual design. So, most of the time, I feel incredibly frustrated and I feel I'm wasting my youth working in something I don't like just for money.

And what bugs me a lot is that I can't find anyone that relate to how I feel. See, I understand that IT is an area that pays very well, that most of the time you are not strictly asked for a degree, that there are online tutorials to learn and practice, that there are good benefits, etc.

But still: Is it bad to feel like a pawn of the enterprise instead of an employee with ""career opportunities""? Is it bad that I don't really see the point in those ""opportunities"", if I continue to be a pawn with a salary that is bound to be fired at any given moment whenever the enterprise commits mistakes? How is it that others ""feel comfortable"" in an enterprise that gives those opportunities, while I just don't give a damn to anything that is not the salary?

I'm trying to slowly build my side project that could get me out of where I am but needs a good amount of initial investment...I don't know if all these is my ""entrepreneurial"" side that doesn't like dependency jobs or it is that I am just too arrogant.

0,2022-12-22,Tired of a Very Long Commute,u/helloworld_111,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zt0dag/tired_of_a_very_long_commute/,jobs,"Hi,

I was hoping for some advice about my current work situation. I started working at a new job about 4 weeks ago, and it has been going very well but getting there and back has been a huge headache, especially with the worsening weather (I live in the northeast). Right now I am taking the bus roughly 1.5 hours there and back Monday-Thursday. Total of 3 hours daily. 
I currently live at home with my mom having recently graduated college and just getting up and running. She brings me to the bus stop in the morning at 6:54AM and picks me up in the evening.

The bus has been pretty unreliable in the evening. For the first week it was passing me without stopping at the stop, and I was paying for Ubers to take me to the closest train station, and then paying for the train. It was horrible. The morning is ok. But I have to wake up early, and I’ve hardly been eating breakfast which sucks.

I’m writing this because today again I stood in the rain for 40 minutes, and two of their busses passed me without stopping. I can’t take it anymore.

I don’t have my own car. I’ve had my licence for years but I went to college in a major city and there was no reason for me to have a car. When I’m home I just use my mom’s if I need to go somewhere which is fine.. but I would love to have my own car now, even just for that independence. 

If I drove to work it would cut down commuting time to about 1 hour each way. Still pretty far and I’m sure driving that distance every day is not peaches and mangoes. But theoretically I could do it.

The other option is to just move. But if I move, I’ll still need a car, because public transportation in that area is iffy. For context the bus I’m taking is a greyhound-esq line with a commuter route going from the city I live to the city I work.

I need to make a change because when it starts snowing I know I’m going to be miserable. But I’m have trouble figuring out weather I should be saving up to get a car, or saving up to move, or both. My family has no money to contribute and I don’t have much in savings. I’m going to be getting paid very well at this new place so I should be able to save up in a decent amount of time.

Any opinions??"

Long story short I decided to use my luck and apply to a new job to see what happens and surprise surprise I pass the interview and was offered the position.

Today I decided to let my manager know that i'm resigning to which he told me that he just had a meeting coincidentally with his manager about creating assistant underwriter positions which will start after the Xmas/NYE period which they're suggesting that i'll be the best fit for me to kickstart my career into becoming an underwriter. They mentioned that they've put my name down for this position since i'm a valued member and i've done an amazing job at this organization within a year.  

Now I really like working at this company but there's no structure- everything is burning down and people are leaving but this company is special in the sense of what they sell/do and you don't get this experience at any other companies.

Currently:

Job 1(current job). currently paying me $63k base for processing work

Job 2 (new job). deciding to pay me $73k base but with the same responsibilities as job 1. It's a reputable company and is well known. 

Manager has told me that they're going to offer $75k base but with the added bonus of me getting to follow my dreams of wanting to become an Underwriter. I have advised him to give this to me in writing but ever since i've received the email, it seems vague and doesn't confirm anything. It just mentions that since the company will be shut down for Xmas/NYE period, they won't start planning until 2nd week of January which is when everyone's back. So what can I do in the time being? 

I need help on what to do and how to go about dealing with this situation as I am new in the industry."

I went to an interview a few weeks ago where i show up and they tell me they just offered the position to someone else.  This was annoying as i had just drove about 35 minutes to get there and seems like they could have at least called before hand or maybe at least interview all the candidates before extending an offer to somebody.  He then tells me im a good fit for a lot of sales positions they have open.  I tell him I just got out of sales and was not looking to go back.  He keeps trying to get me interested in shitty sales jobs until i eventually have to end the interview before i get too pissed.

Then just last week i had an interview for a position at my current company that i really wanted.  The guy messages me the next day saying i got the job but then says for HR purposes i have to reapply on the internal job posting.  This seems weird to me as i thought i already did that.  He sends me a link to it and i find that thr position is now a paygrade lower and only a temp position with some other duties thrown in.  I call him out on this and he says he thought this was the position i applied for.  I noped out of that one as well.
 Anyone else have the same issues?  Seems like false advertizimg how is this even legal?

In this interview, I make sure to only remember important points that could represent myself properly. I prepared and practice for some time before interview, although I can say that I was able to fully memorize my answer to ""Tell me about yourself"" question after many practices.

It’s looking like I will need most/all of next week off (it’s a medical company so Christmas holidays don’t really exist) before I can perform my job with minimal pain. I have more than enough PTO for those days but my manager emailed me today and said he was placing me on unpaid leave until I come back. I asked if I can use my PTO, which he denied. 

My wife and I can financially live without a week of pay. But I am concerned he is flat out denying my request with no reasoning. Anything I should do or just leave it?

I was looking for jobs for several months and had interviews but nothing had come of them.

One particular job I got through a couple of rounds of interviews, but afterward in a 3-4 weeks period all I heard from them after was a brief phone call asking some clarifying questions that honestly made me think yeah I'm not getting that job.

Holiday period approaches and my partner has been asking for us to go visit their family interstate. We haven't been in some time and they'd really like to go for their mum's Birthday. I say you know what, let's do it, we can afford it and it will be nice for us to spend a couple of weeks together with your family.

Less than a week after we have made this arrangement, that job contacts me saying they want to go for a last round of interviews. I let them know at this stage that I have made plans to go away (making sure to include when and for how long) since last speaking with them and they say that's fine. When I go to this interview, I let them know again that I've got travel plans to visit family.

After that interview, they offer me the job and I accept.

The possible issue is that the travel is for 2 weeks only 3 weeks after I start at the new job.

I didn't think this would be an issue as they knew I was going on this trip when they offered me the job. My partner agrees.

My mother on the other hand thinks I should cancel the trip because going away so early into my new job would risk my success there and show my new employers that I'm ""not very committed"" to the new role.

Would love to hear some other opinions, especially from other employers. Would it really jeopardize my career to go ahead with this trip?"

So say I tell my boss mid-shift that I’m resigning at the end of said shift and he gets mad, starts screaming, and says something along the lines of “fine, just leave right now then!” Would that mean I was fired? If so, do I need to put that on my resume? This is only my second job so I’m not sure how everything works legally. If I’m fired and a future employer finds out I worked where I’m working now and decides to question my current boss could he say I was fired or does he have to say I quit? Also is there even the possibility of my future employers finding him if I’m allowed to leave this place off my resume?

Also: No I can’t quit at the end of the shift, my boss leaves randomly throughout the day and there’s never a guarantee he’s gonna come back.
No I can’t quit via email or message, the only way to contact my boss is face to face.
No I’m not putting in a two weeks, there’s no point. My hours are cut in half next week anyways (and I have no intention of using him as a reference because he hates me)

TLDR: Can my boss force me to leave before my shift is over after I quit even though I have no way of getting home until said shift is over?"

Context:

I am a student who ran a school club as its president. Said club became partnered with a professional firm (non-binding/no contract) after I took the initiative to reach out for the partnership and a higher-up guy from the firm accepted. I've long respected this firm and have wanted to work for them, which is why I took the iniative to contact them in the first place as I respected their mission and high performance. 

I am now graduating and, in one email, thanked the guy for accepting the partnership and for guiding us throughout the semester and asked if they had any opportunities that I could apply for in their team/if I could speak with the guy to discuss opps now that I'm graduating. I told him I respected them and as such wanted to offer my skill sets to them after graduation to continue contributing to their mission.

My friend says thanking him and asking for a job opportunity in one email was too opportunistic/potentially disingenuous, but I personally don't think that's true. I know deep down even if the guy doesn't end up entertaining the hypothetical idea of me working for them, I will harbor nothing but continued respect for him and the firm as they took a chance on us already with the partnership. But on the other hand I feel my friend could be right and that the optics of the email are bad? IDK.

Is my friend right? Was I too opportunistic? Or was what I did fine and I'm/we're reading too much into it?"

I started as the most junior person on the team and the company has hired 3 people above me since I’ve been there. My role is “junior PR assistant” and my contract is one year. I basically assist with anything I can. Usually spreadsheets and sometimes drafting press releases. 

At the Christmas party last week my boss announced that everyone would be getting a bonus that would differ depending how long they have been at the company. As I have been there 8 months I assumed I’d get a bonus and was pretty excited. I got paid this morning and it’s the same as always, if not slightly less. Any thoughts on what I can do here? We’re on a Christmas break now. I’m not sure if it’d be bad to try and contact one of the other juniors to see if they have had a bonus.

TL;DR boss said everyone would get a bonus. I didn’t get one."

I'm nearly in my third year at a florestry warehouse, and am responsible for all the stock that comes in, break it down into buckets of water and tick it off a list - amongst other things. Every valentines day, mother's day and Christmas we get a whole lot of temp workers in, mainly from office jobs who want to try something different, or florestry students and EVERY TIME they mull about the fact that they actually have to do physical work. I'm only a light female, but I still manage to do the hard yards - I just don't get it! 

Yesterday I had a woman stand next to me and watch me hack through 32 boxes (the boxes are as long as a person) of stems and branches and put them into water. Counting them was too hard for her, so I told her just to unpack on the table, I'll count and hack, and she can put them into buckets on the other side. I got so frustrated with the whole thing, because she was so slow and unwilling to do the work that I told management that I had to walk away for a moment. They put me on another job, but 15 minutes later I got told to come back because the woman didn't know what boxes were which and what kind of flowers they were - fair enough, but all she really had to do was check the side of the box and cross reference with the invoice which I showed her how to do. 

I know that everyone has to start somewhere, so did I, but oh my god!! 🤦‍♀️ instead of grabbing hand/armfuls of flowers, every single stem was picked out singly and put on the bench. 

Today when I got into work, I was so tired and stressed from the day before and everything hurt. I told people through casual conversation that I was still really tired from the day before, and some were aware of what had happened and they told me to suck it up. They literally sit in air conditioned vans all day long and get other people to unpack their deliveries for them. 

You just can't win sometimes!"
2,2022-12-23,"I want to quit but don’t know how to communicate this issue to my boss, any insight appreciated",u/CatchHennyZoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zt9xmz/i_want_to_quit_but_dont_know_how_to_communicate/,jobs," (hope this is correct flair)

There’s a lot but I’ll try to keep it concise, feel free to ask for details if needed tho.

Background: in October I was looking for a new job because my old one had a management problem that was beginning to effect wage payment. I find an ad that says “day and night shift (place closed at 10), $22hr, location A” and apply. Four interviews and a trial shift later, everyone I speak to says they think I’m a great fit for location A and after my trial shift they will email me my new schedule. They say it will be 4/10s which is awesome. The job seems good, so, based on this, I accept the position and give my two weeks to my current employer. Then I get an email saying “you’ll actually be at location B please meet new manager for schedule.” I show up and it’s clear the job is completely different: Night shift only (place closes at 12:30am!!), $19.50hr, 5/8s, no chance for day shifts. At that point I was unemployed and had no choice but to accept, though I did explain my confusion to the new manager and he seemed sheepishly perplexed like he had no idea but also didn’t really think it was an issue and blew over it.

Now: I’ve been trying to make it work for about a month and a half and it’s not working. I signed a contract to give 10 shifts notice (so two weeks basically) and I intend to, I cannot do this anymore. The transit system is so bad that half the time it doesn’t even run that late so I’m walking home, I get home at 2am sometimes, a women near my age was murdered her body found three days ago in the area I work, I just hate this. On top of it all the work itself sucks, there’s nothing to do and I feel like I’m in purgatory.

The problem: I got approval to have Xmas off because the flights were booked prior to them hiring me and I was upfront about it. I’m currently 2000km away after barely escaping (airport shutdown due to snowstorm, we barely got out). I am due to fly back and might be risking being stuck on the tarmac for 12+ hrs like many travellers currently are. The transit won’t be running at all at late night with the snowstorm. It will take twice as long to get home at night in this weather.

I don’t even want to go back. I want to just email my bosses and say “look, I can’t get back to the city until the weather event ends, I can’t safely get to and from work anymore, the job isn’t working out anyway, if you want a proper two weeks it’s going to have to start whenever I get back which might be another week or so.”

But idk if I can, or, how? Idk how to communicate about this in a professional way. I feel like after the way I was hired I don’t owe them a lot of respect however, it became clear that it was a case of “people aren’t against you they are for themselves” like they weren’t trying to be malicious they just don’t give a fuck. 

Meanwhile the manager I’ve been working under and the one I’d have to give notice to has been really nice and trying to make things work for people and he always tries to accommodate us. I also like my team, as people they are good people and it would be a shitty thing to do to them to dump my workload onto them. 

Or, do I just suck it up, try to get back asap to go to this crappy job, hand my two weeks in at my next shift and just trudge through the risky crap pile that is my current job? I was raised by “the only right way to live is through painful self sacrifice” boomers so I have a hard time knowing where the line is between healthy work life boundaries and professionalism, I need advice"
10,2022-12-23,After a while you feel so useless..,u/StotheG888,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ztar1r/after_a_while_you_feel_so_useless/,jobs,"I live in Italy which is also knows as very hard to find a job. Although I have a good CV due to languages, experience, and skills it’s been very hard for me. 

Since July un tik know I’ve only had 6 interviews after applying to over 100 jobs and I’ve been rejected from all 5 of them. (Still waiting for a response from the 6th one) 

They said they would get back to me quickly. 

What I want to say is it’s really hard to find a job and if I get rejected from the last job I have had plans of una living my self. 

The reasons is money is tight I tried to have another source of income by selling digital products and it’s going so slowly. I would like to have my own business but on the side of starting my new job. 

I am a female and a very hard worker and each rejection from all these jobs knocks me back down and back down because I feel so useless I feel what’s even the point. I enjoy working I really do. But in each interview they will say how impressed they are with my skills only to reject me. I can’t express how horrible it feels. 

With all my heart I’m praying to be accepted for this job and I will work so hard to prove I’m worth it but if not I can’t take it anymore. Money is tight and that’s that. I’ve fallen so deep in depression ever since. 

I don’t really have anyone to talk to.

So I thought I’d share my feelings here

Thanks anyway for reading this"

In this text, we will dive into the characteristics and experiences of the modern corporate worker.  


As we all know, corporations are big, sturdy and pretty non-flexible business entities that employ individuals to work for them and contribute to their goals and objectives. What are the reasons why people choose to work for big corporations?  


People who choose to work for corporations are typically those who value structure, stability, and security. They prefer working in a well-defined environment, with clear rules and expectations; tend to be well organized and detail-oriented, and value order and predictability. People that choose corporations over startups may also be risk-averse and prefer to stick to the status quo.  


Corpo recruiters think the same and tend to look for loyal people who follow the rules and don’t think too much outside of their formal daily job duties; people who are satisfied and enjoy doing the same set of predetermined tasks for extensive time periods; and preferably people with higher certified education.

5,2022-12-23,What is a good career for my likes/skill set?,u/stolenscootercredits,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zte08b/what_is_a_good_career_for_my_likesskill_set/,jobs,"MIDWEST, 27F

I'm trying to come up with a job that aligns with my actual skills and I get *some* satisfaction from. Right now, I feel that I am severely underutilizing myself.

Background: I have a Bachelor's degree in communication studies and an Associate degree in biomedical engineering technology. I have spent most of my working years bartending and serving through school. I worked in recruiting and insurance which were both essentially sales and I didn't enjoy either of them, nor was I any good at them. As of right now, I work as an engineering technician at a hospital and do routine preventative maintenance and ""repairs"" on hospital equipment (basically sending things out to manufacturers to be fixed). I get no satisfaction out of this and am often bored with nothing to do. I'm not looking for a ""love what you do and you'll never work a day in your life"" job, just one that makes me feel like I actually bring something to the table and am using my skill set. 

I also find that I don't really care much about how medical devices work, I only know how to test them and make sure it's done correctly. I never really understood electronics theory during my degree and never cared to, I'm just good at math and could plug numbers in and do equations to get the right answer. I am not the type of person who needs to know everything about something before wanting to tackle it - I only want enough information to be able to reach the end goal. This is pretty much true in every aspect of my life. If there's something that I want done, I will try it myself in order to not have to hire someone else. I'm very much a DIY-er.

Some things I enjoy:

-Making things look good/organized, and making things make sense (creating spreadsheets to organize information/do math, etc.)

-Cleaning - I genuinely enjoy cleaning things and making them look nice. My favorite part of my job is cleaning medical devices and making them look new, getting stickers off of them, etc. I think cleaning in general is something I could do for a living and feel 'fulfilled' at the end of the day. 

-Math - I love math, always have. Specifically, algebra, and I'm pretty good at it.
Having the ability to communicate with people. I'm a ""get things done"" kind of woman and although I wouldn't consider myself to be assertive, I would say I have the confidence to communicate with people and make sure things are done. 

-Visuals. I love making things look good, whether it be a clean house, a logo, or a pleasing and organized spreadsheet. If I could do graphic design professionally, I would - this skill is not developed enough to make a career out of, but I thoroughly enjoy it. 

-Hobbies: puzzles, video games, baking, graphic design, projects around the house (fixing things that are unpleasing visually, painting).

Things I have no interest in:
-Managing people. My bosses often tell me I can be a supervisor one day and that sounds absolutely terrible to me. No thank you. 

-Sales, cold calling, etc. I like to work with people but I want it to be a level playing field. I want to collaborate with people and build relationships with them. 

-Being bored. This is my main complaint at my job right now. I could get all of my work done in one-two days a week and I have to be there 40 hours. I sit around doing bs so often that when it comes time to actually do something, I have no desire to stop doing nothing. This is one reason I made a good bartender; it was fast-paced and I do well under pressure. 


There are many careers out there that I know nothing about, and I thought maybe posting all of this would make a light go off in someone's head that might sound perfect for me. For a while, these thoughts have just been in my head with no way to make anything of them. If you've made it this far, thank you for reading and I hope you have a great holiday!

2,2022-12-23,Top 3 Highest paying Jobs in Tech in 2023,u/HotLucke,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zte7b3/top_3_highest_paying_jobs_in_tech_in_2023/,jobs,"I have collected a list of jobs that have definitely shot through the roof in the last few years and are estimated to become the highest paying jobs in the year **2023**. 

Even though we saw quite a few layoff stories from the top tech companies - there is still a massive potential in this field and some jobs are more valued than others. So if you are interested in starting a career in Tech or changing a career path - this might be very helpful for you. 

**#1 AI and Machine Learning jobs -** semrush.com indicates an annual AI market growth rate of 33.2% until 2027. The global AI market is expected to hit a market value of $190.61 billion by 2025. It is a very high demand job offering an average salary of $146,000. Despite the significant growth, this field faces skill shortage and if you can meet the demands of Tech companies, you will definitely have a secure career in technology and tons of space to grow. 

**#2 Data Science Jobs** \- The US Bureau of Labour Statistics estimates a **28% growth in data science jobs** over the next 5 years. Jobs in Data Science are not only high paying but also less competitive as there are not a lot of good professionals offering up-to-date knowledge. The average Data Science Job salary reaches $144,000. If you have statistical and programming skills and call yourself tech savvy, you should definitely consider Data Science as your career choice. 

**#3** **Data Analytics Jobs** \- This one is great for those who only started or want to start a career in Tech. It doesn't require many years of experience and can be learned through IT bootcamps or courses, something like Turing College, Career Foundry or Springboard. Data Analytics is used in almost every field and this is one of the reasons why the demand is so high and it is becoming one of the best paying jobs. The Bureau of Labor and Statistics expects the number of hired Data Analysts to **grow by 25% during the decade from 2020 to 2030**. Currently, the average salary of a Data Analyst is $96,000. 

It would be interesting to hear if any of you already have these jobs and have some insights on how the current economic climate might change these predictions? Or maybe you think there are other jobs that will shoot higher in the field?"

""Oh I just would LOVE working here because blah blah blah and I’ve always DREAMED of being a cog in your total make rich people rich scheme"" is so mentally draining. Don’t play the game. There are some advanced language models that can generate custom cover letters for you. With the right data (your resume and job description)  they can generate a cover letter that is tailored to the job you’re applying to. The best part? You don’t have to write a single word. All you have to do is enter your data and the AI does the rest. OpenAI playground is one and there are others.

For me, writing the bullshit is the most demotivating part of applying for a job. So, if you are going to be sending out hundreds of applications, it may be worth giving AI a try.  Also, you can use it to write email responses as well (even in foreign languages).

So, if you want to save yourself time and energy, give AI a try and let it write your cover letters and emails for you. Your resume and qualifications should speak for themselves.

We have about 7 current employees (including myself) so it is a small company, the owner is there everyday to help which is nice, and occasionally he brings his mother in to work as well.
Basically everyone there is the same position, regardless of experience or time spent there already, pay is about equal through all of us with the exception of my $1 raise back in July, which my coworker who got hired two weeks after me also got. 
Since then, everyone I’ve worked with originally has left so I’m “senior employee” which is a nice feeling, however my boss wants me to do absolutely everything at the shop basically by myself. His reasoning is that I’m the only one that “does it correctly.” This leaves me with multitasking multiple orders while fixing others “mistakes” (my bosses words). There is no manager position.
On top of that I routinely stay at least an hour more than my scheduled shift, and if I need to leave when my shift is done (6-2:30) he gets upset and doesn’t understand why I can’t stay until 4. We also get no breaks, and he prefers if we skip our lunches.
I can get passed that and understand that work needs to get done, however I’ve recently started to receive questionable comments from my boss.
For the holiday season I decorate holiday cookies, mostly Christmas but I decided to decorate some Hanukkah cookies as well as making some Santa Clause decorations darker in complexion (I come from a mixed family). He comes to me and says that I can’t… really do that? He danced around his words but I knew that he didn’t like what I had made. Whatever, maybe he’s a little unprogressive but so are a lot of people. What truly irked me was he did not like how I laid out our Christmas frosted cookies. They are red, white and green, but the way I was presenting them (one color in one row) reminded him of the Mexican Flag and I had to “fix” it. I confronted him about these things and he didn’t see an issue with this. I can’t shake the feeling of being overworked and recovering those comments when I am the only person there of mixed decent. I worry I am overreacting and I should just “deal.”

TLDR: Expected to work later hours with no pay raise, no growth, and lately have received questionable comments that deal with race and religion."

One of my coworkers/friend, Sam, had jumped ship a few months prior and went to work at a little French inspired cafe making the pastries. About 2 months ago, a position opened in his cafe and he told me that he’d put in a good word for me if I decided to apply. Since I was still having issues with scheduling at my old job, I decided to go for it. I’m not much of a baker/cook, but Sam said everything was really easy to make and that I’d usually have someone with me to help. So I did an interview, then a test run with Danny and the owner and I thought it seemed nice. 
The way Sam had described it, the cafe also had a few advantages over my other job, such as free food, weekly pay, open hours, and I would rarely have to deal with customers. He also said he typically got out of work early, as long as he had done all his daily tasks. So I was excited to take the job and even took a $3 pay cut as I was trying to prioritize my mental health and time over money. So I put in my 2 weeks and started working full time in the cafe. 
Fast forward to now, I have been working here officially about 6 weeks. And I HATE it. 
The only other baker quit a couple of weeks ago so it’s just been Sam and me. The days when he’s here with me, it’s not so bad since he can help me and we’ll typically get out on time, or even a couple hours early. The days when I’m by myself, I have been working 10-12 hour shifts. I will mess up on baking some of our pastries and have to remake them or  Sam will remake them when he’s back from his days off. Naturally the owner has been frustrated with me and has been kind of rude about it. I’m sure he regrets hiring me, and honestly I’m regretting taking the job. It doesn’t help that Sam is currently sick and has been out for about a week, so there’s no one to really help me. So I’ve been working even more and I have been so stressed and have been barely sleeping or eating. I’ve made up my mind that this isn’t the job for me and really want to quit, but I feel guilty as I know Sam will be all by himself if I do. So I don’t know when or how I should tell Sam that I don’t want to stay."

I took the job and the starting salary is 55k, now after a month after working there and seeing my coworkers I feel like it’s hard to get my financial desire. I would like to make atleast 80k by 25-27 years old (currently 23) is that possible or would I have to look elsewhere for another job? Just would like some feedback. Thanks"
3,2022-12-23,Now I understand why you need to look out for yourself first,u/ViolettheJerseyNun,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ztk1jp/now_i_understand_why_you_need_to_look_out_for/,jobs,"Two weeks ago, I got laid off from my job I only had been at for four months. To add insult to injury, I actually liked this job. It had career growth potential (if not within the company itself, I could easily take the skills and go elsewhere after gaining experience), I made over $20 an hour for the first time ever (had a lot of low paying, dead end jobs in my life), and I liked the management. Getting the call that I was being laid off was devastating. Not only did it mark the obvious issues being laid off brings (health insurance cut off at the end of the month, no income, and my state’s unemployment is awful and months behind so good luck getting your benefits), it also ruined my plans for a move next month since, you know, won’t be able to pay movers and a security deposit without income. And it threw me off track financially since I was just making plans to rebuild my savings and be a more responsible spender. My management was sympathetic and tried to fight to keep me, talked about how valuable I was…but it wasn’t enough. And I only got one month’s severance. 

I figured I was included in layoffs (which affected about 10% of the staff) when IT called me to see what equipment I had and claimed it was for “inventory” and my boss blew off a simple question by saying let’s talk tomorrow; I’ll let you know when I’m ready. So I felt super lied to and blindsided.

I’m back on the job market, and I’ve realized….this is why I will never get too tied up in one job again. If the next job I get offered is hybrid, I can take it to get money coming back in and keep looking for remote. (I’m in serious contention for a job that requires three days a week in office.) If I’m so disposable even though I apparently did such a good job and learned fast, why be so loyal and obsess about history? Like yes I can be reasonably professional and do my best but…I don’t think I’ll ever obsess so much about one opportunity and think I’m at an amazing job ever again. It seems so crazy to me how employers can be heartless and dump you with no warning. Never again."

This is only my second year there. I was excited and happy to finally get my ""dream job."" Turns out it's a nightmare.  
  
1- recruiting is awful. I don't know why I thought kids would fall into my lap. Nope, I am pretty much texting high school seniors all day every day. I knew I would have to, but I didn't realize the amount of stress it would put on me. I have a certain goal of students I need to bring in. It's so much pressure to try to convince these kids to come to this college that costs a fuck ton. This brings me to my next issue.  
  
2- our tuition costs $45,000 per year. With scholarships, it could be $18,000 to $22,000 for actual good, non poor families. For low income students it would range from $11,000 - $17,000 per year. I literally can no longer justify telling kids to come to our college and pay that. It kills me inside when they commit to me, when I know they could go to JUCO for two years almost for free! Our college isn't nice enough to cost that much. I just don't want to do this anymore.  
  
3- the college itself is such shit. Our dorms are terrible. Walls falling down, extremely outdated. Our facilities are shit. Small gym. High school gyms are bigger and nicer than ours. Small practice gym, small football stadium, outdated weight room. There are supposed to be upgrades but nothing has broke ground yet. It's difficult to convince recruits to pay all this money for these shit facilities.  
   
4- my kids are awful. Half of them don't want to be there. I feel like I'm the only one who cares about the team and getting better, as well as a select few kids who I am close to. If I quit, those select few kids will be devastated. Some of them have expressed interest to me about transferring. This is not uncommon at our college. We have horrible retention. I pretty much convinced these kids to stay based on my plans for the team in the next few years. I am also super close to them, and I know they will be heartbroken and be in scrambles trying to possibly find a school to transfer to and a team to join. It takes years for a new coach to creature culture on a team, but I literally can't. And I also don't want to, my heart is out of it and i can't bring myself to care anymore. I'm no longer the coach this school needs.
  
I have good people skills, and I have created personal relationships with my recruits so far. They have signed letter of intents, meaning they can't go to another school in our conference. They are going to be angry/devastated and I am literally going to ruin their college plans. Maybe they will stick around until we can hire a new coach. It usually takes months since we are such a small town, and a lot of kids choose college because of the coach which is a huge mistake.  
  
I just know I'm going to let down so many people. But I realized that this job is too much for me. I'm not cut out to coach college. In fact I have lost my passion for my sport, and am going do something else completely. I don't know when /how to quit. I feel so awful but also huge relief knowing I'll be done soon. Thank you for reading
   
  
Oh almost forgot to mention, all this for $30,000."

I worked as a graphic artist for several years up until 2019, when I was laid off due to my job not being “necessary” any more.

Then the pandemic hit and I was stuck indoors for even more years, relying on unemployment to get by.

1 year ago, those benefits stopped coming in due to me not having a current enough job that for them to still apply to me, and I’ve been slowly burning through the money stockpile I built up. It’s in danger of running out by the end of next year based on rough estimates.

And I still haven’t been able to find a job, despite hundreds of applications and a few interviews over the past three years.

I’m stuck and confused and deeply worried about my chances. I can’t keep living like this forever, and I won’t be able to survive in the long term if I don’t find something soon.

What should I do? Find gigs on gig websites like Fiverr? Keep trying with my applications? Shift to a different field to get some income? Any useful advice is appreciated.

EDIT: Okay, I've read through a lot of your responses, and I've kinda sorta gotten an idea of what I can and can't do right now."

I interviewed for my dream job last Tuesday and I asked the interviewer when she would be making a decision. Her answer ""I'm hoping by Christmas""

Well, Christmas is here and nothing :(

I've been rejected after so many interview I have anxiety about the whole process. I keep telling myself I didn't get the job because ""I should've heard something by now"". I think its because I've been through the rejection so many times.

I plan on following up next week after the holidays (maybe mid-week?) Next Tuesday means a 2 week mark after interviewing and in my experience it usually means you didn't get the job. I could be wrong.

Does anyone experience this? I just want to know :( I've never wanted a job so bad. I'm so tired of being rejected. If it were a job that i ""sorta wanted"", I probably wouldn't be so anxious about it. 

 Am I being too paranoid?"
2,2022-12-23,Keep Getting Rejected After Interviews Despite Meeting Education/Criteria,u/SilentPapaya,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ztpem4/keep_getting_rejected_after_interviews_despite/,jobs,"I am wondering if anyone has any insight on how to self-reflect on reasons for rejection after job interviews. In summary, I  have a Bachelor Degree and Master's Degree in Science from a top university in my country with a strong GPA. I graduated from graduate school a few months ago and have been out of work. I have 4 years of work experience in my field. Since graduating, I have been applying to jobs daily. Initially, I was applying to jobs in the scientific industry, which I knew were competitive based on insight from my mentors, who advised me that 100+ are applying for 1 role. 

After not receiving interviews, I decided to focus my efforts on applying for jobs within my field that I knew I better met the criteria and have held similar roles in. These were largely research coordinator roles (essentially overseeing research project(s), doing admin work, some research/data work, all which I have experience with). I was finally getting interviews. To approach these interviews, I usually was spending 5 to 10 hours preparing. To prepare, I research the company / research group, do behavioural practice questions and practice all common interview questions. I also look up the roles on Glass Door to see any related questions to the position that people have posted. After about 5 interviews with different groups, I again received rejections after completing 2nd round interviews. Often, they would cite that they chose someone with more experience. Because of this, I took the next step of trying to apply for slightly lower positions that based on the job description that I may be 'overqualified' for (for example. require a Bachelor's degree and 1 years experience, but I have a MSc and 4 years experience). Really at this point I just want to work so I'm happy to get my foot in the door, regardless of the wage. Although I'm getting interviews, I'm still getting rejected after interviews. 

I am sure there are ton of qualified applicants and it might not all be personal, but now being months after graduation, the job search is going nowhere. I feel I am a strong communicator and have been told by colleagues over the years that I come off very approachable and friendly. On paper, I meet the requirements and expertise they are looking for based on the job description. I'm thinking it must be something with the interview that is going wrong, but I am unsure at this point. Does anyone have any insight on common reasons there is rejection after interview? I'm thinking maybe I don't articulate my skills well enough in relation to the position, but I am unsure."

Due to the economy, they had  performed three rounds of layoffs and she wasn’t sure she’d survive a fourth.  She obtained a new job, same company, different division.  She was told it would take six months 

Hiring her as a remote emoloyee was a mistake.  The systems she has to use and the processes are entirely too difficult to learn remotely, something no one realized.  She was fine when she made a trip to HQ and returned after almost three weeks.  It was a good learning experience and she felt well-received.  She was three months into the job at this point.

The following Mon and Tuesday, she was her usual, highly motivated self and worked 10-12 hrs each day.  On Wed, her one-over mgr called and destroyed her work efforts and motivation by telling her she was making too many mistakes.  (There’s a story behind that too.)

Since then, there’s been two other calls and it’s clear, they want her gone but everyone seems to want to do it in an amicable way.  Remote, not a good fit, etc.

She has the next position lined up.  She’s spoken with the executive leader and the hiring manager who was enthusiastic about her fit with the requirements.  The job should post the first week in Jan.  If she receives an offer, there’s no way to know how long that will take.

Her one-over put a lot of pressure on her yesterday to agree to leave.  He’ll provide a month‘s salary if she’ll leave.     She wants to remain active and working so she’s in a good spot for the new position.

Should she mention this new possibility to her her manager and one-over to buy a week’s time?  I don’t think they’ll try to torpedo her.  Her reputation was too strong in the previous job.  

She may have a lead on another job also but it’s not solid enough to bank upon yet.  If both fall through, she’d like unemployment to carry her for a few months while she searches. 

Suggestions on how to manage this with her current position are hugely appreciated!"

We have no problem helping and think it's a good team player to do so - we all try to help each other, however, this coworker tells our boss they completed all the work themselves and does not give credit to the person who has helped.

The help they request is not simple questions either, they want hand holding through the whole task - even writing out emails word for word.  This takes alot of time away from our own tasks.

We've just had our performance reviews and this person gave themselves a very high rating and, since the boss only sees the end result and not the help they've had, they also gave them an outstanding rating - above everyone else in team, which is a little frustrating tbh.

I am currently finishing up a Master's in Education, but my dream is working in Cybersecurity. That's why I got a working student (basically part-time, year round intern where you get paid a low wage to be trained and smoothly convert to FTE after Uni) as an InfoSec Engineer at a SaaS Startup. Because the pay was low, and I basically did all of their Security Operation and Engineering, including GDPR/ISO compliance, single-handedly, I wanted another job. 

Ended up getting a Customer Success Manager for MS 365 working student position at Microsoft because they pay a lot more than my last job (€17.5/h). Now I'm scared I won't be able to find a Security Engineering Job after finishing my Education Degree soon and should have accepted one of the other Security offers I had, who all had a lower pay tho. Should I stay at Microsoft, who would like to extend my contract and convert me to FTE later, try to pivot to a Security Sales position there, or leave after 6 months to hit up one of the other Security offers I had?"

Overall, I feel bad because sometimes I vent to my dad who lives many states away and he says ""Well at least you’re making money.""

Not sure if they went ahead for a gift without me, but I’d still like to get my boss something. Unfortunately, I’m not able to make it to the office to talk to anyone because I just came down with something.. so I plan on buying and mailing it early next week. 

I feel a little weird about not including the two of them, but neither made any attempt to make a choice or talk about it further. Is it weird to go it alone? The two on my team are out next week, so not really sure how we can coordinate then.

Ps: I have had issues communicating with them a lot so far, which is why I gave up after a few attempts.. but would it be seen as rude if I don’t include the two of them? Probably going to go with a bottle of wine or box of chocolates."
0,2022-12-23,"No Cover Letters are not Bullshit, No you don't Always have to Write One, Yes they can be Valuable.",u/JHarvman,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ztr9g1/no_cover_letters_are_not_bullshit_no_you_dont/,jobs,"I just wanted to correct some of the misinformation I've seen lately about cover letters. Most of them seem to be a misunderstanding of the purpose and value of a cover letter. A cover letter is not there for you to ""suck up"" to the company. It's not useless in every occasion. Your resume is not a substitution. So I just wanted to clear a few things up.

A resume tells an employer the past, what you did. Resumes are useful for displaying your achievements but they don't tell an employer context about your accomplishments. Not only that, but most people have the assumption that their resume is better than other candidates. Let me tell you that just through a normal distribution, your resume is far more likely to be weaker than other candidates.

That's what a cover letter can help with. It tells the employer how you do what you've done, and what you can do for them in the future. You can also use it to give context to the employer about what your achievements are. You can talk about your professional personality. It's a very easy way to brand yourself and make yourself stand out from other candidates, even ones that are better qualified.

**Should you write a cover letter for every job?**

No. Especially minimum wage jobs, unless you are on the brink of homelessness. Cover letters are better for higher income jobs because they show motivation. And better for competitive environments. You have to weight the opportunity cost.

**Do most jobs care about cover letters?**

Yes.

[https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/do-hiring-managers-read-cover-letters](https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/do-hiring-managers-read-cover-letters)

**What should a cover letter talk about?**

Who you are. Personality traits that make you effective at your job. The way you solve problems. The values you bring that align with the company. The research you've done on the company. Anything that makes them interested in you.

**Should I use a cover letter template?**

No, AI generated cover letter templates or standard cover letter templates just prove you didn't even care enough to introspect yourself. If you don't know how you can add value to a company, why would they hire you?

# Truths that people need to hear.

No job owes you a wage or job position. There is an open position for every job in America right now.

Effort is not always rewarded, but if you put minimum effort expect minimum results.

Just because someone else didn't write a cover letter and reached success doesn't mean you will. Evaluate yourself, you might just not be as valuable as you think you are to these companies."

2,2022-12-23,What position should I apply to?,u/Vampire_Wife_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ztt9je/what_position_should_i_apply_to/,jobs," 

Hey guys! I'm a Brazillian marketing employee and I've been thinking about starting to apply for remote jobs in USD-paying companies. The thing is, I have no idea what position would fit better in comparison to what I'm currently doing at my company. So I came to ask you guys for some advice, and some other questions to placate some insecurities too (this is such a new goal I'm setting for myself, I'd like to be extra sure about everything). So, I'll describe what I do and ask some additional questions after that. Thank you in advance to whoever is kind enough to help me out! 

The options I've considered so far are Project Manager and Account Manager, and this is my work description atm: 

 \-Organization and control of processes and campaigns involving marketing and paid traffic;

\-Distribution of tasks to the team assigned to the client, collection of demands, organization of delivery dates and production cadences;

\-Analysis of internal processes and continuous suggestions for improvements to optimize the management and production of the team;

\-Briefings for campaigns, graphic pieces, videos and Landing Pages;

\-Customer service;

\-Crisis and people management;

\-Creation and analysis of Inbound marketing strategies;

\-Growth Hacking;

\-Customer retention and satisfaction analysis; 

Additional questions: 1- How much can I ask as a salary goal? I'm not a junior, I've been doing this for 3-4 years, but one of the main reasons I want to apply abroad is that I have the need to learn more from someone way more experienced than I am. 

2- My english is fluent on writing and listening bases, but my speaking is terribly rusty atm. I'm not as eloquent as I once was. Is this going to be a major drawback for me? Ofc I'm willing to put up some hours of speaking lessons to oil up my vocal cords, but just to know if this is going to look bad in interviews and if it's better to take those lessons before even applying. 

3- Since I have no idea what companies outside my country value, I need to know what to focus on. My strong suits currently are being a ""people's person"" ,  doing customer service (I answer ridiculously fast and am really good at communication) and maintaining a good level of understanding with everyone that I have as a client or as a coworker. Not sure if this is really a differential to other countries. If not, what would be the best soft skill to focus on?"

I have received a lot of good feedback and even some job opportunities that I have since turned down. 

I was excited in speaking with one company, in particular. They offer a graduate program. I had gone through three interviews and had the number of the hiring manager whom I texted and spoke over the phone a handful of times. I made sure to checkin and they did the same. They told me that they are very interested in me and that everyone that I have met with during the process speaks very highly of me. Just last week, I spoke with the hiring manager again. They informed me that some new opportunities within the company are in the works, and that I may have multiple options in terms of jobs. 

That brings me to this morning. I was just informed via an automated email that they moved forward with another applicant. Whaatttt?!!?? 

It feels inappropriate to reach out to the hiring manager today as it’s just two days out from Christmas. But I am completely caught off guard. In hindsight, I should have read into the fact that they were telling me about other positions that they are considering me for. I’m just new to the game I guess. But this feels like a waste of time - I would like clarification on this soon, though. I’m not sure how to proceed or if I even should do so.

Edit: I was never told that this position was being offered to someone else. Basically, I was under the impression that the job that I initially interviewed for would be one of the options. The hiring manager even told me that they drug test so I should know now incase I need to quit. I assumed that was an indicator that I would be offered a job at some point lol."

a brief follow-up email saying thank you/I look forward to hearing back.

This morning, I sent a second email, again thanking the interviewer but saying I have a few questions (they said if any arise to ask away). I was concerned I may have not asked enough role-specific questions/discussed my qualifications well enough. 

So I asked a few basic questions about the role, along with adding notes next to each of them discussing my experience. 

I haven’t gotten replies to any of my correspondence, and don’t plan to send anything else. Did I go overboard with this mornings email? I hope I didn’t crush my chances."

I don't think college makes someone qualified for a job, I have friends who graduated from college and  cheated their way though or just simply don’t remember a thing, and it didn’t even matter because it wasn’t relevant to their jobs anyway.

we do saas and cell phone support. Stuff like,

For the phones - Did you take the battery out and back in? Did you adjust display settings? Did you force stop the app? Did you clear the app cache? Factory reset?

For the browser based SaaS bugs - refresh the page? Is your browser up to date? Clear browser cookies and cache? Try firefox instead of chrome?

To pay the bills and the mortgage, I am seriously considering working 3 (yes, three) retail jobs to stay financially afloat. My wife cares for our autistic daughter and really can't work. This is what I have in mind:

Job A: Grocery store front end clerk. Union job with health benefits. (40 hours)

Job B: Night crew store stocker at big box store (40 hours)

Job C: Movie theater clerk (16 hours, Saturday/Sunday)

Is this a suicide mission? I feel like either my brain, body or sanity will give out. I'm also concerned about not having the available time to interview for jobs in my actual profession. 

Any feedback is welcome."

Long story short, I joined a company and was let go in the 2nd month of the probation period. I was happy to leave as my manager &amp; I just did not get along at all. 

Now the agreed payment was that they’ll pay me for my 2nd month in full then in December they’ll pay me my holidays that I didn’t take - all good. 

Today I just received a pay from that company that I left, which is unusual as they pay on the last day of every month - but to my surprise they paid me for the FULL month of December too even though I hadn’t worked there.

What do I do?"

I’m applying for a role with a very big Health Insurance company and i’m getting quite close to the contract stage, This company offers many benefits such as health insurance for the whole family and health related bonuses for meeting certain health goals (think of it like closing your rings on apple watch except you get paid to do it). 

When it comes to signing the contract, I’d really like to ask if a Gym membership could be included as part of my contract to help with my well-being outside of work, I generally enjoy going to the gym but don’t like to commit to the membership agreements because if there’s a week or two that I can’t go I feel like i’m wasting money and end up cancelling all together. 

I’m tossing up asking them for this to be included as i’m not entirely sure if it’s a fair thing to ask a company to pay for, I’m not looking for anything fancy just a $20 a week place which may even offer corporate discounts (i’d have to look into that one) but the only reason i’d ask is due to the fact they promote health and well-being so much, being a health insurance company. 

To sum it up - Is it fair to ask to include a gym membership in my employment agreement?

Thanks!"

(railroad) I was passionate about what I did had a few bad days here and there but still enjoyed coming to work. Unfortunately some stuff happened in my personal life that made me have a sudden mood change and it started affecting my mood at work. At first the people I were close with at work were very helpful and understanding and they tried their best to support. However I was too stubborn to change my attitude which ultimately led to me being let go for “discord in workplace”. I have been extremely devastated and embarrassed about this whole situation and been shedding a lot of tears. I really wish I could go back in time and change but it’s too late. 

Has anyone experienced this type of job loss before.

I worked for the company for 5 years total. At the end of October I was notified that my position would be eliminated as of January. For the first 4 years and 4 months of the position I lived in Ohio, where the company has an office location, though the business has its primary location in Illinois (I’ve lived and worked in Ohio for all my life before April). In April of this year I moved to Alabama, where the company has no locations, but the company did begin paying my state taxes to Alabama in May to June-ish. So I’ve paid into both states this year (I know my taxes will be a mess). My boss and most of my team continue to be employed out of Ohio (those who are left). I’ve read some conflicting information about where to file unemployment. I hadn’t really worried about it, I expected to have a job lined up by now. I’d honestly like to file in Ohio, since that’s where I’ve paid the most taxes and they have a higher weekly limit than Alabama.  But I obviously don’t want to do the wrong thing either."

My serving job won’t fire me but has not put me on the schedule in a month and they’ve even hired new people. After two weeks I called to ask what was going on and if I still had a job there and if not if I could get it in writing. They were shocked and said of course I had a job still and that everyone had to reduce hours. I checked on our job schedule and that was not true. Everyone had multiple shifts and I had none. I waited two more weeks just to see. I’ve been trying to do EDD but everytime I hit file new claim it thinks I’m trying to extend my 2020 claim, the website is like busted for me in that way. I’ve emailed my local assembly member asking if I could get a phone appointment with unemployment office still waiting on that but now I’m thinking should I get a lawyer?

EDIT: I should mention this is my second job I work after my 9-5 and on weekends. My Mon-Fri 9-5 still puts me under the poverty level in Los Angeles. I would wait tables 5:30pm-10pm weekdays and weekend shifts about 30-40 hours so it was a huge financial loss for me and I’ve struggled with rent had to borrow. Thank you for advice I will call labor board and keep trying EDD repeatedly

EDIT: Thank you everyone I was able to file by calling an EDD office in my county in a different city instead of calling the number on the website it gives that hangs up on you. I filed through the phone with the lady and I will be getting about $250 week which is peanuts but it will help while I look for a new 2nd job. So ignore people saying otherwise in comments just call an office and file by phone with them."

Even my friends were wondering how I could get a salary this high as a fresh grad. 

I was so attracted to the salary and the flexible work hours, I kind of ignored everything else and took the job. Since it was a remote job, I was only in contact with one person from the company - he was my supervisor and he would assign tasks to me through WhatsApp. The problem was that he acted as though I was available for work 24/7. He would call and text me after work hours with no prior notice, and even occasionally at midnight to point out my mistakes and assign tasks for the next day. 

I was also suddenly asked to work on a weekend and had to cancel my plans. On some days, I would be working on a task assigned to me until the afternoon, only to have him suddenly ask me to work on something different and I would be expected to hand it in by the end of the day which was obviously impossible so I would be working until midnight. 

Also, there was almost zero training so I felt lost a lot of the time and I would make mistakes which I would get scolded for. Because there was the lack of proper training, I would take a longer time to complete certain tasks and I would be told to “pick up my speed” but I didn’t know how I would be able to work faster without compromising the quality of my work. Even when I caught covid and told him I didn’t think I work, he would still text to check if I managed to do any work anyway. 

But I didn’t complain because I was scared of losing the job and I needed the money but after a month I started getting anxiety attacks, IBS and lost a lot of weight. Since I knew I could receive work calls at any time of the day, I was anxious and stressed 24/7 and couldn’t make plans even after work hours. So I finally decided to resign after 2 months. Is this something that’s normal when you’re working flexible hours and remotely - am I just inexperienced? Or did I make the right decision? I’m afraid I won’t get a job opportunity like this again."

I want to be a “data scientist” (quotes because the role can be different titles based on the company). For the longest time I’ve been interested in the computational and statistical aspects of data science, as well as computational social science and behavioral data science. I am also heavily interested in the intersection of social and computational science, but can’t seem to find a direct degree path for such a career. Through my engineering program, i’ve had experience with R, Python, SAS, MATLABs, and some brief machine learning projects. We’ve also covered research design and experimentation. 

I was thinking about what program I’d like to go for, and for the longest time I was thinking applied statistics. However, I noticed that I myself spend a lot of my time learning the software side of data science that I don’t completely  from my classes and wanted to expand on my interest in machine learning applications to social sciences.  I enjoy math (specifically statistics), but I just see a pattern in myself right now that i put an emphasis on learning tools outside the theory, which makes me wonder whether an applied stats or data science degree would be the better option (or if there is some alternative?)

I’ve heard some applied stats programs do have a software aspect and it’s not all theory, but many seem to be lacking in heavier computer/data science concepts. I am also mainly looking for online programs so I can gain working experience though my graduate studies and there seems to be a plethora of options related to data science but they have less “historical backing” than those related to applied statistics. 

What do you all think? Would a computational social science degree even be worth looking into? For those of you have have done either an applied stats/stats masters or a data science masters, what can you speak on the programs? I know it comes down to what I’m interested in, but where do some of these programs fall short/benefits? What may be differences in career outlooks? 

Thank You!"

I decided not to pursue a career in teaching and took a gap year to do a service year (bleh, wordy) with Americorps as I love community service, to see if working with FEMA was an option for me, and just to gain experience as I had a lot of volunteering and an unpaid internship under my belt, but not a 'real' job.

Unfortunately, I ended up quitting 5 months in due to poor leadership and toxic workplace. I genuinely enjoyed the work, but a huge chunk of our team quit early on and some things happened that I wasn't comfortable with and I didn't feel was handled properly. I tried to stick it out and see if things would improve, which ultimately didn't. 

(As a boon to the program for any hopefuls- your experience is a coin toss, I was just... really unlucky. I was the 4th person from a team of 6 to leave, and a 5th person was in the middle of a job interview when I left.)

Quitting threw me off trajectory. I was a bit heartbroken to leave the program, if I'm being honest. I'm feeling kind of lost as I don't wish to pursue a career in teaching, and the real world just seems a bit scary now, especially after having such an adverse experience. 

I'm considering going back to school to pursue a different career path. My parents are hoping for me to become an accountant, but I'm considering getting a Master's in Library Science.

I just feel uncertain about the future, and its giving me some anxiety! Something clicked when I considered studying to become a librarian, but I checked out r/librarians and most seem pretty pessimistic about the field. I'm fortunate enough to stay afloat while I figure things out, but I just feel like I lack a 'path'. 

Any advice? I'd also like to hear from any librarians that come across this post!"

I studied a master's degree in comparative literature, in Paris France. I was teacher for 8 years. And after a burning out and depression I just cannot continue to be a teacher.

My passion is surfing and I became surf coach in Portugal. However it's not a stable job for making a living when we are not Portuguese and I do not have my home there. However I want to live there in Portugal/ Lisbon.

I did a lot of jobs like:
- selling credit
- Uber customer service representative
- Uber eats deliver
- retail shop

I speak 3 languages (french native language, English and Portuguese)

I do not what to do in my life, what's kind of job I can do. I love traveling, cultures, I do not want to teach anymore or only doing surf coaching. I love sport. 

Teenager I did programming and I was very into computers.

I know that in Portugal to be digital nomad, being a webdesigner, doing website for foreigners (us, France, or other rich country) is a good job. However since 2010, computers changed a lot and programmation as well. I am not sure to be able to do it like a professional as an amateur yes for sure but professionally doing Shopify / drop shipping commerce and website complexe like that, no for sure I need a training. 

I need your help. I want to make good money in Europe (meaning around 2000 euros per month). And living in Portugal.

Thank you for your help !"

I've also had 3 internships with major companies that directly relate to my industry, but that comes out to 9 months of experience total. I was wondering if my retail experience could supplement my resume, because I know some people see it as unprofessional.

My current question is, how much should I demand for?  
I have no college degree (I did a dual training of 3 years in 2 cause of good grades etc. and so I worked for 2 years in a company too). I made a IT-apprenticeship and the new job is for consulting + development with SAP-Cloud Software. I would be mainly going with IOT-Devices and Data analysis. I am having a small company (IT-Consulting) as a side hustle that makes not that much of profit because I have no time but I am making some - so I have some experience as an IT-Consultant and can program much better than everyone else at the training school - well...I am doing it related stuff for over 8+ years now and I am in my mid twenties. I learned a lot by myself and know already a lot, especially in the IT related field, I also got a big economics knowledge cause of a previous training that hapopend totally in school - but IO have got a certificate from it that has some worth (the goverment aknowledges it as official training job etc.)

The ""starting salary"" in germany for this job is aroung 50k a year but I know I have much more expecience than someone that would go a simple software developer job after they finished the training and I would start as consultant. 

Travel is required etc.

The company is btw. kinda big (multiple locations and some outside germany too)

&amp;#x200B;

What would be a suited number to go in the interview?

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to ask me anything that would be necessary to give an estimation."

This guy is a young guy, around my age, so he probably doesn't have much experience. He had worked here for two years, the same amount of time as me. He spends so much time just wandering around. He put out zero new products. He didn't pull any of the old products. In fact it looked like no one pulled this week so I was trying to get that done. I asked him two or three times to help me pull and he said ""okay"" but just went back to randomly walking around. I cleaned the bathrooms, organized the pricing stations and got my checklist done (my position normally does not involve me cleaning or organizing the stations). He was still just walking around. All he did all day long was put out my 100 items that I had priced, go to the donation acceptance door once or twice while I was busy (my job), and he said that he only had 1/3rd of the usual transactions. He barely had any customers. He was watching the sales floor, yes, but the MINIMUM he could've done is also pull the items off the floor with me instead of walking around aimlessly. Ridiculous. He's really nice though, but I don't understand why I was the only the one doing all the production, the checklists, the pulls, etc. That's something a manager should be helping with, instead of leaving it all to me to do. Again, he's a nice guy though. 

I asked for a raise. The big boss of the organization said I am likely going to receive a raise following 1 Jan. 

Imagine if the raise is just like 10 cents or something, that'd be an insult given that I do the job of multiple people. I know it sounds arrogant, but I really do the jobs of multiple people or positions within the organization - as it would not get done otherwise, on a daily basis. Before my former manager got fired, she warned me that the organization would not appreciate my hardwork and that I should stop working so hard. I really hope that former manager is not right.  

Thanks."

Need some outside and objective opinions. 
My circumstances. 
I’m almost 30 years of age. Been a police officer in Australia (won’t mention state) since 19. Wife and two young children and a mortgage. 

I’ve loved my job and worked very hard to a point I’m now in charge of a station and have a free house whilst our home gets rented out. I make 150k a year and super is great. 
However
After a string of jobs at work and treatment by higher management I have began to re think if 150k is enough money if you don’t come home from work as a result of someone else’s actions. 

What’s more important. 150k or 80-100k and you don’t have to worry about ptsd or ongoing exposure to daily incidents and scenes. The treatment of management and The possibility of not coming home. 

I’ve been looking at other opportunities including mining. And emergency rescue at mine sites however after joining the police so young; you don’t receive any formal qualifications. I know I have a lot of transferable skills, it’s just finding an employer who can see and value what I can contribute. 

May not sound exciting but I love the thought of going home and not having to think about work. I also love mowing lawns so I’ve even contemplated starting a lawn mowing business. The thought of sweating my ass off listening to music makes me happy. But like any government job. The thought of leaving the security of my job scares the shit out of me. 

My wife has mentioned she will go back to work full time to allow me quit but I hate the thought of that. 

I know I’m rambling but don’t have too many people to get feedback from.

Appreciate anyone’s thoughts or experiences."

I hate long commutes.

I graduated from an avarage university with a useless bachelor's degree(almost no job opportunity) and I have no experience. I want to work as a software developer (I enrolled to an associate degree in programming 2 months ago). I want to study programming. Other than developer, I am looking for digital marketing jobs. ( I started to self study marketing last month.) I don't have enough knowledge to get a job right now but I am trying.

This job will pay minimum wage, it has long working hours (10-12). If I calculate everything, there is no time left to study. Basically it is work-sleep-work. I want to continue studying.(With my learning speed I guess I need 6 to 8 months more to at least get an interview for jr frontend developer job).

239,2022-12-24,I got backstabbed and a bad reference led to a prospective employer rescinding their verbal job offer. Advice needed please.,u/AmIDyslexicStoner419,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zuopkr/i_got_backstabbed_and_a_bad_reference_led_to_a/,jobs,"After applying for a posting and going through the competition process and interview, I was given a verbal job offer. Then a couple of days later they called me and said we actually need to do a reference check on 2 references and which 1 of the 2 must be your current manager or supervisor. I provide the 2 references.

**My current job and current manager:**

I have been working for a government agency for a year now. Before this incident, I would describe the work environment and my manager as the most supportive and non-toxic environment and manager ever. I have done a lot for this agency. I've done everything they have asked and have gone above and beyond the call of duty and they know this. I have had 2 performance reviews which have both been excellent. I have had a one-on-one meeting with my manager each week since I have been hired. And at first, I made it clear to my manager that I am not just here for the paycheque, that I am here to grow and learn and to contribute as best I can to the agency and to provide excellent customer public service thus I asked my manager from day 1 to be as critical as possible on ANY and ALL aspects of my employment because I need to get better at my job over time. At first in the meetings he had a lot to say, I took his feedback well and he noticed this and praised me for it. However, for the last couple months I have asked him each week to again be super critical on even the smallest things and in this time frame, he has responded saying '' I dont have anything, you are doing really well, keep it up''. Thus I have had nothing to improve on in the past 2 months and have been doing my job the same. This is also the same manager who has told me on multiple occasions that he wants to support me in the next step of my career whether it is internal or external. 

**What has happened:**

I have just received a call from the prospective employer stating that due to the bad reference provided by my current manager, they have rescinded the job offer and wouldn't provide specific details on what he said. I am crushed and devastated. I have done so much for this agency and have made sure to improve on anything they said. How can he provide a bad reference when he has been telling me that I have been doing really well and to keep it up? and the fact that he could not find anything to be critical about. I am a young adult very early into my career thus I don't have experience with situations like this. Is this messed up? is this expected? Any advice? I feel so backstabbed and this has completely changed my view of the manager and the agency. Any advice about anything would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
10,2022-12-24,Lied on my resume and now transferring to Customer Success from Customer Experience at a startup,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zup0v9/lied_on_my_resume_and_now_transferring_to/,jobs,"Hey y’all — I work at a fintech startup, and have been for roughly a year now. In the next few months, I likely will be transitioning into Customer Success/Account Management from Customer Experience.

I’m super excited to make this switch as CS has always been something I wanted to get into and it’d be a decent pay bump. The whole point of getting this job was to pivot into CS. 

The thing is, I lied on my resume and said I have a college degree when I didn’t. Why’d I do it? Times were hard and money was tight, and I was sick of seeing myself getting rejected from jobs I’m well qualified for. After I put down I had a degree, jobs started getting back to me. 

I am very good at my job (Customer Experience) and am very much qualified for the Customer Success/AM role I’m interested in. I’d like to truly grow in the Customer Success space and eventually leave my company after gaining some experience, but I don’t have a degree and am unsure if I should keep lying or just take the degree out my resume.  

It’s not like Customer Success is like being a doctor or a lawyer, or any other profession where you **must** have a degree. Is it that serious? 

Before y’all say it, I know some companies do education verification. I always ask what the hiring process looks like before I even go through it so I know if they verify education or not. If during the hiring process, I’m asked to verify education, I’d simply express disinterest in the role and move on. It sucks, but I just don’t want to go to college. There’s really no point in doing that especially for these types of roles. 

What do y’all think?"

My boss gave me 1 month for a trial period and if I am deemed not good enough, I will be returned to my old position. I have no problem with the trial period but I think my new supervisor don't really want me there and has been very hard on me. From the beginning he was being upfront that he will only give me study materials and not taught me directly. But every afternoon he will question me about what I've learned. He expect me to be able to do ERP officer tasks straight away. Whenever I ask questions he always answered ""analyze it yourself"", so I always just froze up whenever I encounter new problem. If ask I already know his answer, if I don't ask he will berate me why the problem hasn't been solved yet.

Is he being hard on me or am I just too sensitive? Can anyone give me tips how to deal with him? I honestly started to doubt if I'm going to pass the trial period."

Now why am I asking for advice how to leave and move on? Because my manager and colleagues believed in me. They believed I'm going to be a great part of the networking team and someday become one of the seniors only for me to leave eventually and wasted their time.

I have California sick days that I have not used. 

And from what I hear at my job they will give you a write-up if you call in the day before Christmas and I believe the day after Christmas since those are high probability call-in days.

 Now the management at my work isn't the best with communication and it's more likely that you would hear about these things from other workers than management themselves, so this isn't something they put a PSA out about or anything. And I wouldn't want to hit them up to ask beforehand, especially if I'm gonna use a CA sick day on those said days.

This type of thing isn't new to me since I've had jobs before where around holidays you get 2 attendance points instead of 1 for calling in. But this is the first time I wanted to use a sick day to cover one of these days. 

# The Question

**We get extra disciplinary action for calling in on certain days around the holidays.** 

**Will my CA sick days cover me from receiving these potential extra attendance points and/or writeups?**"

Some companies/hiring managers I figure are scared/puzzled off by a 5 year gap on a resume.

My question to this Reddit is do you think it is ok if I briefly mention my poker history to my resume which can explain my current job gap? I dont have any mentions of it on my resume now, but if someone were to see my personal website or twitter they should notice my poker history.

I figure it will be an instant turn off for some (which I’m ok with) but I also figure it might be an eye catcher for some as well leading to interviews.

Old job willing to take me back.,u/uhl478,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zvad9m/overwhelmed_and_not_wellsupported_at_new_job/,jobs,"Started a new job a month ago and I feel completely overwhelmed and anxious. There's no training or orientation here. I'm tasked with jobs that I don't feel confident in and I'm messing them up. I've had to have a more experienced coworker bail me out. I'm feeling time-crunched and making same mistakes twice and it's quite embarrassing.  Now I'm being reported by said coworker and by other staff members for any mistakes I'm making (even if minor). Boss here is chewing me out (sometimes in front of staff) and focusing on all the things I'm doing wrong. Never said one positive thing about me.  I feel very unhappy and unsupportive here and it's seriously impacting my self-esteem. I only just started a month ago and I'm likely going to be fired.

The good thing is that my old boss who I had just quit is willing to give me my old job back.  The reason I had quit to begin with was due to pay.  But I loved the work environment and coworkers in that office and they loved me there. I was already working there for about 1.5 year.

My question is, should I bother with the 2 week notice? I believe that is merely for courtesy or should I just get the heck of dodge  and go back to the old job?  Will I burn a bridge by not giving a notice?   What impact can this have?"

Then Covid hit. I was furloughed since 2020. I got to keep my title and was paid a significantly smaller amount of wage monthly. I picked up a side job as a barista at a chained store close to where i live for extra money. The job is not perfect but i  feel so much less stress and have less things to study for. And the wages are not too much of a difference since the airline has introduced basic salary, frozen the rate until 2024 and all the other measures to keep themselves afloat.

During the one year that i flew, i had a lot negative experience with co-workers. The seniority hits me real hard for being the smallest potato in the group. I feel like i was being bullied to a certain extent. There was a time i couldn’t hold back my tears when i entered the hotel room after a flight. Plus, i need at least two hours of commute to get to the airport. The whole thing is just very tiring and stressful. However, i get to see my family back in my home country every week when i work. This was also one of the reasons i took the job as my mum had breast cancer, though she is now cancer free.

Now that 2023 is coming, i am being asked to go back for trainings again and learn more types of aircraft operations to suit the airlines’ needs. Im now very scared with the huge amount of information that i need to cram. My stomach actually feel like throwing up when i see the numbers of pdf files i need to go through and remember. I want to quit the job and turn the barista job into a full time one. I feel like i want to take the “easier” road so to speak. Am I being stupid here? Or am I too weak? I have to make a decision in mid January and im losing sleep every night on this matter. 

Any thoughts is appreciated. Thanks."

The fun bit is this, because i was bumped from an hourly internship to perm salary theres been a screw up with hr and i was informed earlier in the week i wont be getting paid. As far as their system is concerned im still hourly and need to submit a time sheet, however seeing as ive been promoted and have no direct manager in the system no one can approve the time sheet, as such i cant submit my hours and get paid. The division head has promised to fix this after sometime next month. I would believe him except this morning i got pinged that a task for my termination came into be done today and this company in the past has fought me very hard to pay me documented, company wide, mandatory, OT.

I dont know what to do here. I have 32 hrs at least that are effected by this.

20,2022-12-25,"Every job wants references in the application, how do I protect my references personal info?",u/ahhhh1hhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zvcnpf/every_job_wants_references_in_the_application_how/,jobs,"I'm looking for a new job right now, and every application I come accross now asks for phone numbers and emails of multiple references when I send in the application. I fully understand why jobs ask for references and I have several people who have agreed to be references, but I'm not sure how comfortable I feel with giving out their contact info with my application given how easy it is to make a sham job posting nowadays, and how many legit companies hold on to all the data they get whether they need it or not. A lot of my references don't have work phones, so I just have their personal cell phone numbers (which I have permission to share, but they probably don't want it being given out to everyone). 

Is there anything I can say in an application to indicate that I have references and will be happy to give them, but I'd rather make sure the company has some level of interest in me before I just hand out someone's personal phone number? I don't want it to sound like I don't have references, but it's not like they'd take the time to contact someone unless they liked my resume/cover letter (and in my experience no one checks references until after the first interview), so they don't need that info from the start, they're just trying to verify that I have people.

Alternatively, how can I tell which companies will be careful with that info and which won't?

Maybe this is more of a rant than a question, but some people have to send out hundreds of applications before being hired. I wouldn't want hundreds of companies to have my phone number, so why should I have to give someone else's out? Why can't waiting to provide that info be a sign to the manager that if I ever leave and need a reference I'll be careful with their info too?"

Office type environment where I can do most of my work at a desk or remotely (although an actual office where I can see real people would be good). I do not want to continue in mental health care because Florida turns out to be horrific for that field. 

I am currently a team lead at Walmart for meat and produce (department manager). I feel depressed because there seems like no way of actually getting things right and everything done properly especially due to staffing and incredibly bad inventory practices for fresh food.

0,2022-12-25,Future college students: It's almost impossible to find something that you are passionate about. You might as well give up.,u/kevinbevindevin,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zvdc9g/future_college_students_its_almost_impossible_to/,jobs,"I want to share this story as a person who was once strongly believed that I was supposed to do something that ""I truly love."" When I was in college, the only factor that I chose my major was if it was something I was passionate about. Back in the ways, there were two things that I used to be passionate about (which are oddly distinct): computers and social sciences. The following is a list of passion changes I have made over the years:

* **I decided to major in computer science first** because that was something that I thought I liked best and was a money printer major.
* I got an A in CompSci courses that I took but decided to change my major to sociology (which was my other interest). It was not because computer science was difficult, but I completely lost interest in it and didn't want to deal with the intense amount of math that I need to take to graduate. **I went to sociology major with the intent to become a counselor/social worker** (either mental health or advising). I also had a side gig of trying to get into politics but no one wanted someone with no local connections.
* Then, by the time I graduate, I got accepted to a social work school in which I decided not to attend. **I decided that I want to work in higher ed instead** because I want to serve students despite many potential flaws in the field (low paid, long work hours, etc.) I managed to become an advisor at a local college\*.\* That job didn't last long because the environment was *very* toxic.
* Then, I job-hopped a few times until I find my first real job with full benefits at the school I graduated from as an administrative staff. It took me 2 years after I graduated, but I was glad that job was much better paid then a lot of student-facing jobs like in admissions and on par with a lot of advisors' salaries (Remember, I do not have a Master's degree, yet advisors have one). I mostly served faculty, but at that time, I really didn't care much about finding a job in my passion as much as I used to. I was very content for a while.
* In my current employer before I got promoted, **I started my degree in Master's in human resource management** (actual degree name varies a bit for anonymity). My interest grew in management and human resources.
* Now, 3 years later from the start, and I feel completely miserable (even after a promotion). It turns out that I do not care much about the type of job that I hold, but rather the *lifestyle* that I want. I wanted to be able to work anywhere, but (not impossible but) it's very difficult to achieve in my current field. Most public and non-profit higher ed jobs are in-person and don't pay that much. Even with my master's degree, it might be difficult to land a remote job in HR. Even though I have experience doing general HR work (i.e. onboarding, scanning candidates, etc.), I don't have specialized skills like compensation, benefits, and employee relations.

Maybe in the alternate world, if I have bitten the bullet and stayed in CompSci, I would be writing posts about how you should pursue your dreams instead. Now, I am not doing what I am passionate about anyway, I don't have a high-paid specialized skill (i.e. engineering, programming, doctor, nursing, etc.) that would allow me to move anywhere in the world (immigration is *way* easier if you have one of those), and the paid is okay. If I saw that I would ended up today, I would have stayed in CompSci or majored in Management if I can't deal with all the math. My quest to find a passionate career completely backfired.

So, the story I want to teach you today is as titled: **It's almost impossible to find something that you are passionate about. You might as well give up.** A living is a living; your labor is not supposed to be a passion anyway. Your career is supposed to be one that serves others, not yourself. Just major in something you are good at that is economically viable and find your passion elsewhere."

I worked for them 2 years ago, but had all kinds of mental issues, due to a severe vitamin deficiency that gave me severe memory loss, among other problems.

D was a supervisor at that location, and is the *nicest* person you've ever met. But she was awful toward me. I was mentally in a very vulnerable place, and she gained my trust so she could spread anything I said in confidence around.

That was 2 years ago.

I'm working for this company again in a completely different district, but D is one of the supervisors at the training location. We've both seen each other, and clearly recognize each other, though we haven't spoken.

I finished my first week of training the other day. I go between different location: training and my home location. I was called into the office, and told I had received ""no less than 18 complaints.""

*[ETA: I have been told there were 0 customer complaints]*

I was completely baffled, and broke down crying worse than I have in years. My dad died a couple months ago, I've had a lot of stuff go wrong lately, and this just felt like I couldn't do anything right.

But my boss would only tell me 2 of these, both of which I explained. Then he said he had reports of me ""snatching things out of people's hands."" This was *extremely* confusing, as I definitely did not do that. There were moments where I'd take up parts of someone else's task, in an effort to help them (genuine, but badly). But I absolutely have not done that.

Then I vaguely began to recall that sort of accusation from 2 years ago. I also find it weird that when I asked my boss about ""18 complaints,"" he said, ""Well at least 18. There are some others.""

When I saw D there I thought, ""She'll be professional. I won't even be at her store, so why should she care?""

But now I'm thinking D told my trainer, who apparently told my boss, about some such ""18 complaints"" from *2 years ago.*

My boss refused to give other examples, names, or anything. And he told me that some complaints were from supervisors. But every supervisor I've met at my store, I've had good interactions with- at least I thought.

He does know about the issues I had 2 years ago, as I briefly told him about memory issues qnd my brain pretty much not working right.

I think these ""18 complaints"" are in no way current. How could that many be amassed after only 1 week?

What can I do, y'all? I've never been in a position to amass savings, and every moment has been paycheck to paycheck. I need to work, but I'm becoming certain that I'm being sabotaged from the start, by a still-prejudiced supervisor."

I’m not worried about the latter scenario, I tend to use many emails, so giving them a brand new “professional” email isn’t gonna kill me. If they search up my name on Google, they won’t find my name or my face.
However, what scares me is the first scenario where they actively try to find my “passive” footprint as well as my active footprint on my other emails. My social media on the other emails don’t have any personal information either, but I’m still worried because although I use aliases on those accounts, I still don’t want my employers to see it.

There’s so much misinformation about what employers do when it comes to digital footprint, some say that employers will go the mile to find every little detail about you, even the things you posted as a 13 year old on some old throwaway account, and some say that they wouldn’t go through all that hassle."

I've worked there for almost 4 years. A majority of what I've done there is date entry: describing and listing clothes in their database to then be sold on a myriad of marketplaces (Ebay, Amazon, Walmart, etc).

Lately, I've been so very unmotivated to go work. I struggle with depression &amp; I am on medication for it. I even got approved for a couple days off a month with FMLA. But it isn't cutting it. 

I took most of the week of Christmas off (4 days total). Now, it's Sunday night &amp; I have to go back in tomorrow &amp; I'm dreading it.

What I really want to do is have my own business making my crafts. I'm pretty good at sewing &amp; I want to sell my things on Etsy or make my own website. It's a dream I've had for a while &amp; something I think I'm meant to do.

I know I should probably put my 2 weeks in but I really just want to quit. I'm not happy &amp; thinking of going back in is making me very anxious. But I know I should have something lined up before I just quit but I keep coming back to the thought of quitting &amp; trying to start what I've wanted to do for so long.

I've never really posted anything like this, so apologies if I didn't explain well enough. I guess I'm just looking for guidance or some kind of advice on what I should do. Thanks."

I already suffer from anxiety and depression. Coming up to Christmas it just got worse. The company I work for is extremely disorganised. Every single day they send out emails up to 7 times in one day about last minute changes, these changes usually take a few hours to complete each. We are incredibly understaffed and I (the manager) am given no support from management above me. They refuse to put up job ads to help me fill positions that urgently need someone. They micromanage everything and  I receive multiple messages asking me to complete tasks and ask me to be meticulous about the tasks yet they give them to me an expect it to be done within the hour (even on my days off) and the average time it takes to complete said tasks is far longer than an hour. I had told my boss that I’m burnt out and needing some time to recoup and was told “that’s going to have to be put on a back burner for now”. 

Over the course of my employment with the company I have mentioned several times about the stress and the toll it’s physically taking on me as well as mentally. It’s gotten so bad my menstrual cycle is affected. It either is very late/delayed or doesn’t happen at all. I have just turned  25 years old. I cannot physically or mentally put myself through this any longer but I can’t leave this job until I can find another one because I cannot financially afford to just quit in this economy. I already struggle even on a full time contract. The pay is terrible, they require you to work 12 hour shifts without notice that you’re coming in early or staying back until you’re about to start and then expect that you just go along with it and comply. I worked 12 hours on Christmas Eve with last minute changes and another 12 hour day today on Boxing Day which is my normal day off. 

I don’t know what to do I feel completely stuck and cry almost every day about it. Can someone please give some advice on how to cope with the stress until I find something new. I’m past the breaking point. I just want to walk out and never come back.
Thanks I know it was long lol sorry"

A few says ago, my boss told their childless coworkers and employees that if it was dependent on them, they would make us work 12-13 hour shifts as we have nothing better to do at our spare time. And that every workers with children (them included) need to work 6 hours max, because caring for children is a job. The boss is the first one to finish their job everyday anyway, while we all work 9 hour shifts per company's policy. A lot of times they cut their shift short not for children, but for personal errands.

I'm low on morale now, and it feels like the boss doesn't really care about our WLB. Their remark does feel like a violation of our workers' equality. I'm a new worker and get underpayed even for my basic job, not counting the extra work I'm doing. 

Is there a way to change the situation or feel better about it, or do I need to just move on?

**3. Create a network.**

A project I worked on before ended up not going well (made A instead of B) because of things getting lost in translation so I want to make sure that doesn't happen again.

But he's still giving verbal instruction. I take notes buy its hard to take notes if I don't know exactly what he's saying. I also ask clarifying questions but his answers are never direct and I always have to try and decipher what's being said. 

Occasionally when I present projects to higher ups, he'll swap his previous opinion on them based on what the higher up says which can be annoying. For example, he'll tell me personally that he likes A. I also like A. Higher-up says that they like B. Then manager will say that he agrees and also likes B. So do you like A or B? I wish it was just consistent.

I am good at writing and organizing and researching. I am horrible with people (ASD no insurance so no diag and older).  I do have a MA in cultural studies.  I am in desperate need to get out of this retail hell, but don't know what I should apply for that would match my skills and education.  Ideas appreciated. I want to get out of poverty.

12,2022-12-26,I’ve messed up my work history really badly. I’m trying to amend it but I’m struggling.,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zvqvk4/ive_messed_up_my_work_history_really_badly_im/,jobs,"22F.

I’ve had a struggle with maintaining a job in the past. I’ve only high school-equivalent education but I’m looking at studying social work at university in 2023. I’m not overly keen on social work any more but I know the degree is versatile (and frankly, I’ve already applied; I can’t switch now).

It’s the same song, different tune; struggled with mental health. I suspect I might have autism but I’m not sure if this is a process I’d like to explore as having a diagnosis won’t do much for me. But I’ve tried getting voluntary experience — unfortunately transport in my town is bad and I’m trying to get a license but I’m self-funding on disability money at the moment. It’s hard. But not impossible — hence why I’m here asking for suggestions. 

I’ve tried doing course and whatnot and they don’t add much to my CV to be honest. I only have four months worth of voluntary experience and that was ad hoc. I’ve had 20+ jobs in the past in which I’ve not included on my CV as they didn’t last very long.

Is there anything I can do to help or is it a lost cause at this point?"

He’s got no experience what so ever, around a 2.9 GPA, no volunteering experience, no clubs, nothing much. He does have a high school club experience as the club’s treasurer and cameraman (video club in charge of recording school events into CDs).

His major is entrepreneurship and his school requires all students in this major to minor in something so he is minoring in psych.

He’s not sure what to do after graduation and as big sis, I’ve been tasked with helping him get started at least somewhere.

I don’t know where to really look. I recommended him some internship jobs that he’s turned down in favor of relaxing “one more time before adulting” but also everything I threw his way were accounting (I’m an accountant) internships and he kinda hates that side of finance. 

So where can he go from here? How can I assist him with his resume if he’s got nothing to put down? Last time I applied to a summer job (for myself) even Dollar Tree needed a resume…

What are tips to help him with writing his resume if he has nothing to put on it? What are the chances he can enter an entry level career job with zero experience? What jobs/careers are there for entrepreneurship majors?"
4,2022-12-26,i’m stuck between 2 job offers,u/patheticgirl69420,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zvr5cb/im_stuck_between_2_job_offers/,jobs,"i graduated this year, and i have very little proffesional work experience. i got a job offer from one employer, but at the same time, im currently undergoing a background check for another employer. i’m confused if i should reject the first employer or not. here are some pros/cons for each: 

1st job: “legal secretary” 
- already got an official offer 
- $36,000 a year 
- this is a better title, it looks better on a resume 
- very small law office, less than 10 employees. my dad says there will be no room for growth there
- i will be learning paralegal experience &amp; skills without needing to go to paralegal school 
- i will be working directly under an attorney. i have zero legal experience, but he was impressed with my volunteering experience and took a chance on me anyway. this lawyer said he usually immediately disregards resumes with no experience, but he is making a special exception for me. 
- he will be investing a lot of time into training me since i’m a beginner. also, he said he’s looking for someone to stick with him for a long time. he reiterated this many times throughout all our conversations. so, i would hate to start this job, have him spend soo much time training me, just to leave him quickly. if i accept this job, i would need to be in this for the long haul  

2nd job: “law assistance program assistant” 
- i did not get an official offer yet, i only accepted a contingent offer pending a background check. 
- $38,600 a year 
- this is a big company, my dad says if i stay in this job i’ll have opportunities for growth. 
- this is lower ranking position than the first one. i will be an assistant to other assistants. 
- the minimum requirement is a high school diploma, but i have a bachelors degree.
- the job i initially applied for at this company was for “legal secretary”, but i was rejected because i did not have enough work experience. then, they offered this job instead. 
- there is a 2 week probationary period. what if i’m still learning in the 2nd week, and they think i’m too slow and fire me? 

i need to give a decision to the 1st employer by tonight. i’m so stressed. what if i reject the 1st offer, and then i lose the 2nd offer? then i will be left with nothing. or what if i accept the 1st offer, and then the 2nd offer comes back to me with an official offer? i would hate to to be that person who starts a job and quits 1 month in. 

i’m so indecisive and i would appreciate some feedback!"

I was being verbally abused and it was honestly a horrific place for my mental health (abusive boss). I stagnated and looked for ways to grow in the organization but even that was limited. 

There was an event that became my last straw and I quit. I didn’t come into work expecting to quit.. but I had texted my mom and told her that I could not handle it anymore. I was tired and asked her if I could move back home because I want to quit my job. I already accumulated several recommendation letters and references from managers, directors, and the CEO. 

I had looked for jobs previously but I never got anywhere with most of them. Now I’m wondering if it’s a smart decision to get a PT job while I look for my new FT position. My father (side note: my parents have had the same jobs for over 30 years) keeps pressuring me to get a PT position when it’s only been a week since I have quit. He keeps saying I have bills that need to be paid but I have over $30,000 saved up. It will dwindle but I will be back home. I don’t know what bills they are referring to when my brother who is 27 is still home having all of his bills paid by my parents. Perhaps it was wrong of me to assume that after I asked to come back home they would give me to same treatment. 

I am quite frustrated though. I told them I would give myself three months to find a job. I would spend 8 hours a day job hunting. Yet, they still think that I should look for PT work even if I end up quitting in several months. From your experience and with my circumstances what should I do? Maybe I’m just being a dumb 23 year old.."

When I joined this company this offer letter stated that if I meet expectations I would receive a 10k raise and a my bonus would double. My previous boss who hired me left she never filed it. Her boss remembers this but can't do anything since it's to late to fix anything. Since the financial departments have everything done for next year. I'm really disappointed and frustrated because I was expecting it since I signed and returned ed the offer letter. I feel like I met the expectations since all the feedback and reviews have been positive.

People line up at my desk to ask me questions or ask if I can do something for them or else it will set timelines back.

Joined a new company months ago and this particular coworker is starting to get on my nerve. Every time coworker A catches me alone she rants relentlessly to me about how awful or incompetent the other coworkers or supervisors are. From her long rants she revealed herself to be lowkey xenophobic and has her own issues to work through like a lack of self-awareness, but keeps projecting other coworkers as the problem. She doesn’t rant to other coworkers this way but since I’m new around she probably sees me an easy target to use as her personal ranting tool when we’re not even that close. I’d prefer her not to use me as some private therapist to be the recipient of all her offputting rants, but out of courtesy I just listen along halfheartedly. She’s been in the company for nearly a decade and relatively older in rank and age. To be frank, her ranting comes across as selfish since she keeps dumping all her own bad experiences with clients in the company on me and foreshadowing it’s going to be just as miserable of an experience for me. I only later realised I don’t have to be this accommodating but I’m not sure what specifically to say to make it clear I’d prefer her to stop ranting in a professional way and to maintain some boundaries instead of dumping all her negative tantrums on me."

Currently working in second tier (\*kind of one tier above straight call center type work).  Its a decent position and been with the company for two years now, but no real possibility/other roles to earning more than this $18 ph. We get the 2% supposed raise each year and thats about it.

2,2022-12-26,Question about having long hair,u/Bee6464,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zvykxb/question_about_having_long_hair/,jobs,"Hello,

I’m a man with long hair and wondered about if it might affect me getting hired? I’ll be graduating in 2 months as Dental Assistant and I’ve always been tying my hair up in a bun or ponytail, at school or work. My family thinks my hair might be an issue with getting hired as it isn’t considered a “Traditional Haircut.” I understand where they are coming from but at the same time, my hair hasn’t ever been an issue both in school and at work, and have seen other men with long hair in different careers. My hair isn’t unkept in any means, but it will require a trim soon. Would I be ok getting hired with long hair as long as it’s neat and out of the way, or should I consider their advice and cut the length off? Any advice or previous experience regarding this will be helpful. Thanks for reading!"
1,2022-12-26,Does a name affect job applications?,u/escarglow,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zvynpr/does_a_name_affect_job_applications/,jobs,"I have what some people call a you-nique name, aka my parents were teenagers when they had me and chose the worst spelling possible for an otherwise normal name. When people see my name, they tell me it's pretty, but that's just what they say to my face--who knows what they really think. Anyway, the spelling of my name is entirely wrong and only one letter off from a questionable word.

Do recruiters/HR/hiring managers look at names and make biases? Should I be going by a different name/different spelling? All of stuff (my resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn profile, etc) has my real spelling, so I think it'd be hard to change everything to a different spelling that I don't actually go by irl. There's also no nickname at all for my name, so I can't just put a nickname in the preferred names write-in box."

I have been looking for a change, to stay in the (fast growing) industry but to try a different company. 

After some great interviews, I was offered a new job, at the same Director level, at a direct competitor on Thursday. The base salary offer is really good but, was $20k below what I was really looking for, which the recruiter and I had spoken about previously and she had mentioned it was more than possible.

I managed to meet in the middle and get it jumped up by $10k on Thursday, and told them I would sign tomorrow (Tuesday) after thinking of any admin questions I would have.

However, the only thing I keep thinking about is that extra $10k which would have me ecstatic to join. Do you think it's worth asking one more time to bump it? And if so, how should I phrase that ask? If they say no I would still sign regardless, just don't want any bad blood or rescind of the offer. 

It is worth saying the current offer is 32% higher than my current base salary which is saying something about my current employer! However, I do have an LTI,  making the whole yearly package about 20% more.

Just wondering what people think I should do and thank you for reading."

Being a big fish in a small pond (e.g. Managing Director of a small to medium sized company) often means more autonomy, more influence in big decisions, and more confidence knowing that you're making a significant impact in the firm. The flipside is that the small pond may not have a lot of resources or room to grow. On the other hand, being a small fish in a big pond (e.g. Analyst at a big bank) means more opportunities to advance and being part of a company that's a major player in their space. The downside is that you're just a cog in a giant machine, and it's easier for you to be gobbled up by bigger fish (office politics). 

I've worked in both environments and still can't say for sure which path is better. Would be interested to hear your opinion on this. Would you rather be a top dog in a smaller, lesser-known company or a minnow in a giant, more recognizable company?"

I work as a draftsman making $20/hr. which is a $2 raise from when I started working in 2018. I have considered leaving this job for other positions I have interviewed for, offering $23-$25/hr. 

I want to live a comfortable life, where I can spend time working on my passions after work, but I feel like with my current wage that isn't really possible. I live with my parents, and they can be very toxic, which is part of why I want to leave. I haven't really been able to find a job that's a good fit or wants to keep me longer because I am considered ""new"" to the industry. 

I don't believe I will have time to focus on passions or improving upon other skills like expanding my education, or even focusing on my health, if I were to live alone, in a room for rent at $20/hr. I am not sure if I got as high as $25/hr. it would get any better. I only say around that range, because apparently due to my experience level, getting anything higher than that is already considered impossible. 

I think having a life outside my work is important, because my career isn't what I thought it would be, and I don't feel like my energy is being invested into anything I am truly passionate about. How have you dealt with work-life balance with insufficient pay?"

I work for a small non-profit and stated this job a year ago. Soon after (6 weeks) I started our COO left and I took on many of her responsibilities with a promise of pay increase at 6 months that I never saw. Staff turnover and lack of proper support and supervision has made this job really stressful. They switched my department in my title/ supervisor but I never received any more money. New supervisor is a good person, and she cares but does not have the bandwidth to support in the way I need.

Flash forward to now where I accepted a new job that I’m really excited about, but received a text from my current supervisor that I am receiving a raise and promotion (but she’s not allowed to tell me the amount or title - only our VP can tell me.) One of the weird communications/power dynamic issues which is causing me to leave. 

I’m dead set on leaving, but don’t want to offend anyone since I’m getting this hypothetical promotion and pay bump.

So…it’s almost 2023 and I personally accomplished a few of my small goals this year, particularly getting an internship.

I am still going with it and getting paid (little but whatever) for my work. I love the company, the people, and even the work surprisingly.

As we go into the new year and I enter my final semester in my MA program, I want to keep the momentum going. What should my next step be moving forward?

Every time I get assigned a new task in my internship, I add it to my LI profile. I’ve been trying to network (mostly on Twitter, but trying to figure out how to translate that over to LI without being stalker-y or creepy about it). I didn’t get the paid internships I wanted at a major company which is why I’m still with the boutique digital marketing agency.

I really really want to keep the momentum going strong, as I said. I have two courses left, my capstone and another social media course towards a certificate that I’m working towards at the same time. I plan to ask two people for a LI recommendation who can really speak to my work and dedication. I’m also trying to write for myself now that I got more confident sharing my work and writing for SEO for clients. 

My dream and really end goal is to work in entertainment PR. Any ideas for what my focus should be with job hunting during this last semester starting in a few weeks

Thank you!"

I’m an MBA (Marketing), and the hiring process was a bit of a scam in itself - the entrance tests + job description + interview was for something else entirely (marketing role) but when they hired me they put me in a role that deals with contracts and tenders. Not my interest or experience area at all. But I stuck it out because I needed the money, plus I thought I could manage to do well. 

Well, now it’s more apparent that I’m not a good fit for this role at all, so I want to move towards a marketing-oriented role. How do I do this? What are the roles I could look for after having spent almost 2 years in a role like this?"

Usually i'll be done within about max. 2 hours and sit around for the rest of the day doing nothing and sitting around like a idiot... it really makes me depressed.

I know that i'll be starting to write paychecks soon too,but from what i know we only do it like 2 weeks a month since we only have to do it for about 60 people.
I pretty concerned that the other 2 weeks of the month will stay like it is right now and it's driving me crazy!! I feel like i could do way better things with that time i spend doing nothing.. :(

What should i do about it? Maybe going into part time instead of 40 hours a week? I only know that i can't stay like this... 

Any good advice here?"

I also worked at Amazon during COVID where I was sometimes put on ""safety"" where I would walk around the building and make sure people had their masks on and whatnot, because my depression was (and still is) so bad I didn't have the energy to do the work there half the time.

Seriously, at these jobs I keep getting put at these ""lowly"" positions because my managers think I'm not able to handle doing ""higher up"" work -- but seriously, they have a point. I'm not doing very well mentally, since I have bad depression and anxiety (and OCD on top of that). How am I supposed to make it in the real world where, especially considering that even just last week I was ""downgraded"" at my wedding job despite having four years of experience doing banquets, I am struggling so much at these different jobs and haven't had much of a chance to advance?

Oh yeah, and not to mention earlier this year these fuckers fired me from a country club I worked at because I wasn't ""improving"" enough (even though I told them a week before I felt like I was dealing with depression which was making it hard for me to work (I wasn't diagnosed at the time))."

In case anyone is wondering, I just went ahead and did a presentation via zoom Not ideal because it would have been better in person, but it seemed easier than coming up with a new plan (Supervisor would not allow me to have someone do the presentation for me)

EDIT: the request wasn't actually the whole day, it was for the morning 

So this happened a little while ago but has popped up in my mind again recently. 
I work in a higher ed setting and one day was scheduled to give a couple of presentations. The morning of I woke up feeling terrible (later tested positive for Covid) so I called out. My supervisor initially said OK, but after finding out that I was scheduled to give two presentations that day, called me back and asked me what my plan was for the presentation attendees. So essentially she was asking me to come up with a back up plan for them. I was annoyed because it seemed is if I shouldn't be responsible for this because I had taken off, and also, there are several other ppl in that program who are more senior than me/ in charge who could have stepped in. Like I said this was a while ago and I don't necessarily have any intentions of bringing it up, but curious about others' takes?"

If you're base paying at least $15, say that. If you're starting people off at a certain amount, say that. Quit telling people you're paying ""up to x amount"" when most people aren't getting that amount. Not to mention quit putting a predetermined cap on what people are worth. Shit just sounds demeaning and limiting. 

You gotta check off every trivial and arbitrary box just to be considereed getting paid what's being advertised. It's bs. And they really try to sit there acting like it's such a good job, it's such good pay, when most people won't even make it. Come on now, quit deceiving people with fake and false expectations. Be direct and legitimate with what you say and state. Unfortunately a lot of the companies and businesses doing that won't get enough people cuz they know their positions, pay and jobs/companies in general aren't shit. 

Just wanted to make this post after seeing a Disney ad stating you'll make ""up to $22 per hour"" like damn considering all the shit theme park workers go through, considering how much damn money Disney has and how much demand and needed/expected Disney magic at the theme parks that around $20 would least be a doable wage from the beginning. It shouldn't even be an ""up to"", it should be a ""that's what we're paying you, period"". 

Quit playing with your words, quit playing with peoples expectations and time. And quit being cheap. Quit using wrap around words/meanings and just offer everybody a decent, livable wage. Having a livable wage shouldnt even be a ""competition"" or ""more 'qualified' = only person that can have a livable wage"" thing."

My duties are to support the 7 project managers we have. 
It’s my third week and I have been assigned barely anything while the project managers are busy working away. I’ve asked MANY times if they have any work for me or if there’s any support I can provide but it seems like they’d rather do it themselves than teach me. 
My issues are 
1) I’m worried they’ll let me go if they see there’s no true use to me. 
2) I feel guilty sitting here with no work while everyone else is busy.
3) I like to be busy and moving.
4) no one seems to want to take the time to train me. 

Now the pay is good and I know it’s a great gig to be payed well to do nothing. I wish I could do some online class to make use of my time. However, we are all in an open room with computers raised against the walls, so whenever anyone walks by they see my monitor first. So I’m not comfortable being in full view and doing something I’m not supposed to be doing.

3,2022-12-27,Should I change my last name?,u/Stoners-Advocate,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zwkt9w/should_i_change_my_last_name/,jobs,"I'm thinking about changing my last name. I have a very uncommon last name, and an uncle that seems to be pretty good at making a bad name for it. He attempted to murder someone, and a few years later attempted to burn down a townhouse complex full of mostly single parent families. 

When I search my name in any given search engine, plus my location, his mug shots, arrest reports, and related news coverage eventually show up in the results (sooner than later). It sound petty, but I've noticed I get significantly more rejections than I used to when applying for jobs. 

My sister has done very well in her career(s), but has had a different last name since my uncle went batshit crazy. I have a very swedish last name, but not a lot of people have it in the US. Infact, there isn't anyone with this last name in the US I'm not related to (maybe ~200 individuals at best.)

Should I change my last name or do you think this is all a coincidence, and not worth the effort?"

For context, my primary career/job is in GIS (mapping technology) for a large company. I really enjoy it, and it's my long-term term career plan to continue advancing in the field/learn new skills (Python/SQL).

For the last 2 years I have slowly tried to grow a side business providing Matterport services (3D walkthroughs/floor plans/photos/360 photos). All of my business has been captured by cold calling other businesses/individuals. I don't think this is the most efficient method, but I can't be sure. 

This is my first business, and I really enjoy the gig and get positive feedback from my clients that i have. But I'd like to figure out how to grow the business/get more repeat customers. I don't know if it's as simple as setting up a website, getting car magnets to advertise, continue cold calling and play the numbers game, or all of the above.

Anyone gone through this journey before? Ask for any additional details and I'll gladly share.

TIA"
1,2022-12-27,Entry level receptionist/HR/business admin roles for my wife,u/AFunkinDiscoBall,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zwmeq4/entry_level_receptionisthrbusiness_admin_roles/,jobs,"Hey everyone, my wife graduated college May '20 with a bachelors in history with an emphasis in behavioral science (something like that). She's held a few different positions since then.

\-was a waitress throughout college and worked in retail

\-worked in a daycare overseeing a toddler-age classroom

\-was a registered behavioral technician working with children with autism to help them develop life skills and better integrate into society

\-worked front desk at a medical clinic

\-worked as a teacher for homeschooled children, class size of 6 or so. Basically was a full on teacher teaching them history, math, science, etc. 

These have all been relatively low paying part time jobs, $14-$18/hr, and she wants to transition into a full time job with better pay. Her ultimate goal is to become a counselor at a college, but those jobs seem few are far between. Because of that, she wants to go into some kind of office-like job so she can at least familiarize herself with the office environment. I've suggested that she could do roles such as receptionist, entry level HR jobs, maybe even business admin.

Can we get some help with how she could get her foot in the door to sell her previous experience? What are some other jobs she could be looking for? Ideally it'd be cool if she could land a WFH position, but I'm sure those aren't readily available here in Tampa, FL. I've suggested she could take an internship role to get her foot in the door but she is skeptical that internships might be unpaid positions.

Help me weigh my options?,u/polybag22,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zwmnur/cant_decide_between_job_offers_help_me_weigh_my/,jobs,"I’ve found myself in the best case scenario after a recent lay off and have two job offers on the table! But I am torn.

Company 1:
- Salary is ~17% higher than #2 
- Great sign on bonus 
- Stock options
- Job is very similar to what I was currently doing, so it would be a pretty seamless transition without too much of a learning curve
- Huge multi billion dollar company that is booming in business right now
- Have ability to work remote 2x weekly and work within various corporate office locations across the US
- Unlimited time off 

Company 2:
- Namesake company, would look *excellent* on a resume in the future and people would be shocked that I even managed to get a job there because they are so incredibly competitive 
- A lot more access to executives within my current industry, would be incredible for networking and meeting people, getting my name out there to accelerate my career more quickly 
- Salary is ~17% lower than #1, and no sign on bonus
- A few responsibilities that differ/would be additional in comparison to what I was doing prior
- A lot more vague on my actual job title/description 
- Smaller teams = increased working hours. 

I’m really torn. 401K plan and health care is similar for both companies so not really looking into that for my decision. I feel like maybe #2 would be better for my goals/career acceleration, but #1 is better for my current situation. It pays a decent amount more and I know I would be able to acclimate quickly, and the benefits are good too. But then again #2 would just, really blow everyone’s mind especially if I manage to be successful. But with company 2 I kind of don’t feel like I know what I would be getting myself into, and people that have worked for them in the past haven’t been responding to me on linked in.

Just trying to weigh the pros and cons on both jobs. Still very early on in my career so not too much experience dealing with decisions like this. Any advice is appreciated ."

Anyways, I’d like to make a clearer post defining exactly what I’m looking for in hopes of getting some guidance from some of you. 

I currently work at a local pizzeria and make around $10 per hour + tips. It’s an extremely easy job and I love the people I work with, although it’s not fulfilling. Im not interested in a career, I won’t be a slave to someone else, I will create my own path, but for now I need a step up. I don’t like the feeling of wasting my time, because right now every minute is valuable to me and I want to make the most of it and even though I’m being paid for sitting down and creating this post right now… I want more for myself temporarily.

Specifically, I would like a remote job that I could do from my home, but I feel like that’s extremely hard to come by. I’m also interested in other jobs that would benefit me more than this. That could be financially, knowledge wise, skill wise, anything, but I really would like an increase in pay of course.

I live in an extremely small town, so there aren’t many options, but I’d like some advice.

I also had a business trip planned that had to be canceled because I had put in my two weeks. This trip was planned on my personal American Airlines account using a business credit card. This was a small startup company so there weren’t any corporate partnerships with airlines.

I had reached out multiple times to schedule a time to pick up the equipment and what to do about the flight credit. At first he seemed interested in getting them back. He sent me a link from American Airlines to have them transferred to his account. I followed his instructions and I never heard back from them. The credit is still on my account. Now he hasn’t responded to my messages about having someone pick up this equipment.

How long am I supposed to wait before I can sell/donate/trash the equipment? Would it be wrong to use the trip credit before it expires?"

However, these are 100% remote jobs so there's probably a lot of competition. If it helps, the most recent two are in the same field and the last if I remove the current last one would be in the field I want to go back into.

Would it benefit me at all to remove the last one even if it reduces my resume from almost 5 years of experience to 3.5? Maybe make me look like less of a job hopper?"

My mother's been pestering me about this for a few months now. She's middle aged, speaks English well but does not know how to read and write, comes from a background of not completing schooling back home due to civil war and poverty. 
Basically she wants to know if there are any jobs that are more manual in nature, I guess similar to the idea of ""stuffing envelopes"" where no reading or writing is really required. I have a feeling something like this doesn't exist but it doesn't hurt to ask. She is the only one of her family to be fortunate enough to live here in the United States but her family back home have no means to obtain a job since the fall of the government 1.5 years ago and are on the brink of starvation, quite sad and unfortunate. She wants to do something, gain some sort of income to provide whatever she can for them. My mother has always been a homemaker and raised me and my siblings alone by herself, so has no work history or experience. 
I understand this is a real crap shoot but if there is anything out there for someone in her situation I would appreciate it and will pass on the info to her. Thanks you all!"

This is my first professional job at 23. I think I may have abused that and have been working at home on days I should’ve been on-site, or working at home in the morning, and then coming in later to work on site. Nonetheless, I am still working so therefore, I enter my time sheet as a full day of work even if that means just checking emails. Sometimes there’s literally no work for me to do - that checking or waiting for emails is all I do - even if I were on site. my dad said this is still considered working. 

My boss found out about this and sat down and talked with me. She did mention how she shouldn’t have told me originally that i could work half days - so maybe part of this is on her. (She’s also a new manager). But anyway, I am wondering if she truly is giving me a chance to improve or if she’s scheming behind my back to get me fired? She made it sound like she’s giving me another chance. Everyone keeps saying it’s more difficult to fire someone cause of costs and more training times. 

Another thing is, is this considered timesheet fraud? I’ve always been worried about that. I’ve also worked when I said I was despite being on site or not. Especially my job isn’t demanding so I figured it was ok to work from home. I am kind of freaking out and just want to put this to rest. :("

# Which jobs should I try to get?

I need to get a WFH job very soon. I'm autistic (ASD - level 1), so WFH is necessary.

**Important Factors:**

* At least $3,000 per month
* I don't have a college degree
* I have a high school diploma
* My work experience includes:
   * Catering Assistant - 6 years (My family owns a catering business. I did it as a teenager and young adult. But I can't do it anymore because it's far too draining, and I want to move to a different state.)
   * Lifeguard - 3 months (One summer while I was in high school, I was a lifeguard at the community pool.)
   * Audio/Visual Tech. - 4 months (I worked far too much for $500 per month at the church that I used to go to. I left religion a few years ago.)

**My Skills:**

* Writing, editing, and proofreading
* Tech-savvy (not coding, though)
* Detail-oriented (I notice typos very easily.)
* Problem-solving, troubleshooting

**What I've Tried:**

* TranscribeMe (I tried working for TranscribeMe doing transcription from audio files. The pay was *extremely* low, and it would be very difficult to make an actual living with it.)
* I tried learning coding through a site called The Odin Project and stuck with it for a few months. I learned a bit about front-end coding and completed some of the projects. But after beginning to learn back-end development, I realized that I was in over my head. I'm just not very technically minded.
* Freelance Writing (For a couple of months now, I've been trying freelance writing. I have my own website with samples of my work (unpaid work) and a contact page. I have done a couple of articles for a company called Titanium Marketing. They published my articles on the site, Gizmogo, and they said they'd pay me $50 per article (trial assignment rate) and told me that I'd been accepted to the ""content team"" (higher rates and more consistent work). But I told them that I'd like to receive payment for my published articles before doing any more work for them, which they said was fine. They said they'd pay me very soon (a week ago), but it's been 2-3 weeks since they published my articles, and I've still not received payment. Overall, I'm not sure if freelance writing is going to be a reliable source of income for me.)

TL;DR I'm looking for a reliable WFH job because I'm autistic. Have a high school diploma but no college degree. Tried transcription, learning to code, and currently trying freelance writing (no success yet)."
354,2022-12-27,My company listed my position on the market,u/Zgame200,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zwsuva/my_company_listed_my_position_on_the_market/,jobs,"About a month ago my manager expressed concern in my performance and that he would like to place me on a PIP. I took it as he was having a shitty morning, as a PIP was never formally signed. That day, I spruced up my resume and cover letter templates, and began my job search. 

Fast forward to today, I receive a notification on LinkedIn that a **high priority** job has been posted by my company with the same title, location, and job description as my position, and a starting salary that is paying $40k less. I have a feeling that this is to replacement as there has been no discussions to expand the team... unless I'm getting a promotion lol. 

My question to the community is: ""What steps can I take from here? Can I question my manager about this, or just wait it out and see if they'll fire me and give me unemployment."" On one hand, I don't want him to know that I'm looking for other opportunities, but on the other, I'd have to be oblivious to not look elsewhere after he told me he wants to put me on a PIP.

**UPDATE** I’ve been laid off."

I was still browsing and interviewing other jobs before I was hired, and I am still browsing while I am still employed. I think if no other company is willing to take me at the moment, I'll try to keep this job before I turn 26 (Sep 2023). 

But what do you think I should do in the meantime? 
Should I just keep browsing for jobs with better benefits?
Be upfront with my employer about how I feel about the benefits?"

Despite seeking and attempting to manage my issues in therapy, I struggled extensively in my academics, confused as to why I wasn't able to perform the way I had prior, leading to multiple failed terms, as I was not able to balance my academics and health. I was transferred into a one-year suspension from my program, forcing me to give the proper time and energy to working through my mental health issues. As my energy and mental health were at a low, my life consisted solely of therapy sessions and doctors' visits, and trying to survive one day at a time. Nearing the year's end, I finally reached a point where I felt more confident and okay enough to show up more in some parts of life. I finally got back into my program and took the courses necessary to complete the program, successfully obtaining my BSME! 

I am now on the search for an early-career first job. I know that on paper - with the failing terms, large gap time and longer time for degree completion - I do not look like a good candidate but I know that I am. 

How can I reduce the likelihood of being blown off by recruiters due to the time gap/ degree completion time I had to take due to my mental health issues? What other information should I avoid or be sure to add in my resume, cover letter, interview, etc. during the job searching process?

Any advice appreciated, TIA!

Edit: I also, unfortunately, do not have internship experience &amp; the last volunteer work I did was in high school, which I am far from. I truly only had the energy to make it to my therapy appointments and doctors visits during my time gap because I was determined to get better, but depression, anxiety, etc. is difficult."

During my year and a half I have raised all my expenses because of my raise schedule 😑 I just got my first raise up to 20.38 and it’s roughly a dollar more every 6 months. Until I hit 33 on my fourth year. Sounds great and all but I can feel myself becoming higher paid and more worthless by the day.

Should I quit my job now before finding another one?,u/Swnerd_27,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zx0gyt/dealing_with_a_difficult_manager_who_placed_me_on/,jobs,"I started working at this entry level GS-5 government job for the past 3 and 1/2 months now. These past few months have proven mentally taxing as I have to deal with a micromanaging boss who sets high, unrealistic expectations. For instance, she has me carbon copy her on almost every outgoing email I send out, which she claims is for “training purposes”, and then finds any quibble in my emails to write me paragraph-long critiques about. Within a month of working there, she already expressed interest in placing me on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) due to alleged performance issues. I was not given the official PIP until the following month, which lists all of the mistakes I’ve made since my first week of the job (which I find ridiculous) and allots me 90 days to improve or be let go (or, best case scenario, be transferred to another department). The expectations of the position were not conveyed to me during the interview and I feel they are too high for the pay grade. My manager also indicated to me that I was not the first person she has placed on a PIP and that my position has a high turnover rate (no surprise there). I explained the situation to my Union Representative and he too thinks the PIP is unwarranted and admonished me to look for a different job.

Since my placement on the PIP nearly 2 months ago, I have searched for and profusely applied to multiple job openings. I’ve had some interviews these past few weeks and have more to come but haven’t heard back from anything yet. I would like to add that the job I am currently in has nothing to do with my field or career aspirations; I am starting on a Masters of Public Health next month, yet my current job is in college admissions for a military academy. The reason I took the job in the first place was more for convenience (it’s located in my hometown) and to provide a steady stream of income while I’m in graduate school. 

Additionally, I am a 28 year old who is still financially supported by his parents, so I’m not in desperate need of the income, and I anticipate that I will find another job soon (hopefully part-time to accommodate school) within the next few months. I can certainly hold out for that long without a job. The mental toll my current job has taken on me is too much to bear, and I fear that it will impact my academic performance once I start grad school next month. My parents think it would look better for me to quit once I find another job first, but I don’t feel like I can hold out. They can’t force me to stay though. I also think it’s better for me to quit now rather than wait until the end of the 90-day period where she will most likely let me go herself. Should I just quit now before landing another job? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Does the same apply for other companies?

So, long story short, my job has left me absolutely burnt out for the past 6 months. Every single day I go to work and I hate every minute of it. Aside from being grossly underpaid for both my qualifications and the amount of stuff I keep getting made unofficially responsible for, the way things have been operating in the past few months really *really* do not have me feeling optimistic about the longevity of the agency (possible HIPAA compliance issues, just now coming under fire from our major source of government funding because an angry client wrote to our senator who asked our funding agency to look into whether we actually accomplish our stated goal, etc.-I could go on). And to top it off, I had a performance review back in September that went about as poorly as it could've gone without them firing me on the spot, despite the fact that I thought I was doing pretty well, in which I was put on probation through the end of October and was given a list of what seemed like incredibly petty things to ""fix"". I'm also just so done with dealing with clients that are demanding and entitled and having to constantly be putting out a sob story to solicit donations and volunteers. I'm 100% not cut out for human services, as I've found out. I love the idea that the work I'm doing is helpful and not just to line the pockets of some rich asshole, but it really just feels like it's not worth it anymore.

Thing is, I have no clue how to pitch myself for a real white-collar job. Every job I've ever had since I graduated from college has been nonprofit marketing and outreach in some way, other than the freelance photography and video that I do. I (think I) have a very strong portfolio with some very impressive material, and I'd love to pursue a creative career, but especially in my current area the market is so incredibly saturated that I have no idea where to even look for such a job and even then I'd be 1 applicant out of 500 or whatever.

I also have no idea what jobs I'd even be able to argue that my experience qualifies me for. Obviously there's marketing, but what else? I studied journalism so my degree isn't versatile or flashy or lucrative like an engineering degree or something like that.

 What should I even be doing now? I want to GTFO so badly but I'm just so lost."

They have a decent hourly wage of 17 an hour and great benefits. It’s a nice place to work and everyone is kind. But I can’t help but think I could’ve been working here without a 4 year degree. That I’m surrounded by people who didn’t go to college and it’s a bit of a waste.

My parents and therapists says the same thing. Especially since I could use the extra money to move out and get my own place. The problem is I don’t know where to start. It’s been 2 years post graduation and I haven’t done squat regarding my resume. 

The last couple months I had some help with my resume so it looks better. But I’m lacking in the experience department. Only did one minor internship and that was like 3 years ago now. I should’ve started right after college and not waited.

Life keeps passing me by but I lack the motivation to find a better job. I fear that I’ll accept this life of mediocrity. Recently I tried to mess with Indeed but I’m not sure what to do. I just keep applying to communication type positions via online. I haven’t gotten any interviews or anything back yet. 

I guess I’ll keep trying here. Any other suggestions? I’ve heard job fairs are helpful but I haven’t been to one since college. I just have no idea where to start and I want to do it already."

the title pretty much gives it away. I've been struggling for the past months with finding the dream job for me. After I finished school, most of my classmates knew immediately what to do, yet I was unsure. 
I knew that somewhen in my career I wanted to become a lawyer, but that shouldn't be the first thing I study. I wanted to get some practical experience first in another job and through mere fortune I was introduced to my local police. I was almost sold instantly and combining it with the career I strive for afterwards, the puzzle pieces just fit together too well.
Now, as I started collecting the information I needed to apply for the job, I realized that you need pretty good eyesight for it. I thought contact lenses would be fine, but they aren't.
The only options I currently have are to either get eye surgery or apply for another job. The issue here is that I am too young to get eye surgery just yet, as my eyesight might decrease even more. 

I feel absolutely broken right now, I wanted to be the opposite to the corrupt police that is so widely known by people. I wanted to be a good person and actually help those around me, but that doesn't seem possible right now.

I don't want to become a lawyer just yet, and I am out of options. This is the only job that spoke to me in months and now I am at square one again.

 Does anyone have a similar storie to share? Or any advice to give what they would do in this situation? I just really don't know what to do. 
I'm looking forward to hear from you guys"

Outsourcing,u/Severe-Challenge695,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zx989h/recruitment_vs_outsourcing/,jobs,"What are the differences and similarities between [\#recruitment](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=recruitment&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7013850509795028992) and [\#outsourcing](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=outsourcing&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7013850509795028992)? In this post we will discuss the pros and cons of each, and the factors that companies should consider when deciding which approach is best suited for them.  


Recruitment and outsourcing can be useful tools for organizations to identify and acquire the necessary talents and resources they need to achieve their business goals / needs. However, they differ in terms of the scope and nature of the work being performed, as well as the level of control and oversight that the organization has over the individuals or companies providing the services.  


Both internal and external [\#hiring](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=hiring&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7013850509795028992) involve some level of evaluation and selection of candidates or service providers. In the case of internal (recruitment), this involves evaluating and selecting the best candidate for a job opening. With external (outsourcing), it may involve evaluating the capabilities and track record of potential service providers and selecting the one that is the best fit for the organization's needs.  


Additionally, both recruitment and outsourcing can improve efficiency and reduce costs. Recruitment can help organizations find the most qualified and capable candidates to fill job openings, potentially increasing productivity and reducing the need for retraining or other resources. Outsourcing can allow organizations to access specialized expertise or resources at a lower cost than if they were to hire and train employees in-house.

I love the job; I love the people, for the most part; however, I work with one person who does nothing and gets paid for it. Typically, unless it affects my job, I don't care. It's a manager's job to deal with that. But now, another coworker is leaving, and I have been told my workload will go up because my manager does not trust the slacker to do much of anything. 

I flagged the slacker to my boss because we were working on various projects together, and the slacker contributed nothing. I was so resentful that I told my boss that I could no longer work with him on joint projects. My boss looped him out. Now he has even fewer projects to work on.

So my other coworker is like me, in the same boat, getting more work while the slacker gets less to nothing to do. My boss does nothing about the situation but realizes it's a problem. This is creating a toxic work environment. I concluded that the boss is afraid to do anything because the slacker has mentioned a ""toxic"" work environment to him (my coworker is so beyond frustrated that she has lashed out a few times at the slacker and was told that she was a bully) and therefore has protected himself from being fired (my guess is he has done this at other jobs because it works so well). 

My question is, since the boss is doing nothing and I have to figure out a workaround to working with this idiot, what suggestions to you have for not becoming resentful? I thought about looking for another job, but besides this guy, the job is good."

I completed a Bachelor of Biomedical Science this past year. I’ve been offered two Masters degrees beginning in March 2023 that I’m interested in:

- Master of Public Health (2yrs)
- Master of Genome Analytics (1.5yrs)

Equally happy to do both of these, though I know I can score much more highly in the Master of Public Health. What I’m more concerned about though is which one would lead to more lucrative jobs.

Any advice would be helpful and appreciated. Thank you!

Hi. Ok so I got rejected again and this rejection was even more frustrating. This job only hires students that go to my college with my major.

I am fully available for their work hours. I have a 3.95 GPA which the hiring managers praised during the interview. I do not need any visa sponsorship. I have the technical skills they require. I have prior internship experience.

I think my interview answers are great. I always include examples in my answers. When I practice interviews, I am told those answers are great. I also ask good questions for the hiring managers. I do not know what I am doing wrong.

I think there are dozens of students like me. Maybe they care only hire 1. I wish they could hire all of us.Sheesh."

I have something else lined up which pays better, but my manager wants to meet with me later today to try to counter the offer anyway because they're desperate to keep people.

A big part of what soured me on the job was the very limited onboarding process. Once I got into my team, a lot of the training was institutional knowledge I had to get from one senior team member in particular, and she was spectacularly unhelpful, saying stuff like ""figure it out"" rather than answer a simple question. She's been doing the same thing to other new employees and it creates an issue where no one wants to ask for help since they won't get any, and then people make mistakes they wouldn't have if they'd just been able to ask a question.

I spoke to my manager about this person before and he responded by making it so that I, personally, don't have to deal with her much anymore, but other colleagues still do and have been complaining to me about how unhelpful she is. Right after I started here, someone else also left the team after 4 months in part because it was so hard to get up to speed with no one willing to help.

I hate to throw anyone under the bus, but on the other hand, I feel like if they want to retain employees something needs to be done about this person's ""training"" method."

I had to take an assessment prior to an  interview last week which was 100 questions that had  personality/behavior questions. It had two answers on each side of a  slider and you had the options of slightly agree or agree on both sides,  you could not put the slider in the middle you just had to select one  or the other. Now these would be easy for me if the questions were like  ""I don't like to work in groups"" vs ""I love a challenge"". Easy i would  go strongly agree ""I love a challenge"". Bruh, These questions were  crazy. To paraphrase one question was like ""I don't feel bad about  people who don't have much in life"" vs ""It is not wise to try to do a  task you already made a mistake in"". How in the world do I answer that?  Why do i have to do this? lmao. I went with the not feeling bad option  but I mean of course I think both things are awful. Any feedback? I  ended up failing the assessment and now can't interview for this  position so I really need to get good at this.

TLDR:  How to answer personality/behavior assessments when the questions have  options to choose from that are both horrible. e.g.  ""I don't feel bad  about people who don't have much in life"" vs ""It is not wise to try to  do a task you already made a mistake in""."

My daughter offered her condolences, etc and then the client said the thing is she (the deceased mom) was still there because the coroner/funeral home hadn't come yet because of the holiday. 

Then the lady says I'd still like you to clean in there and my daughter says she's going to ask her boss. Calls her boss and she says ""Well since you're already there go ahead and do it"".

I went right into grad school studies because there were barely any jobs available due to the pandemic. 

While I was getting my MS I did a Marketing Operations Internship for a startup but unfortunately they did not extend a job offer to me after the internship. 

Overall I have a huge lack of professional experience because for 6 years I was in school nonstop and did not get a job during that time because the work load was very heavy. Unfortunately now this lack of professional experience is becoming a huge determining factor in me not getting hired by employers. 

When asked about it in interviews I am honest and say that I did not work because I was in school full time, but this seems to make employers not interested in me. 

Am I doing the wrong thing by being honest?"

Then add a 6 month application-interview window. So I’m supposed to just wait 6 months to not hear anything as a rejection instead of some hiring professional spending 30 seconds to send an automated rejection email?

I put it in but hadn’t heard anything. Today someone else on my team Dave sent a team email saying he has those dates off and he’ll try to keep his desk clean. We already have 2 people off. So it’s not possible for us both to have it off as we have to cover everyone’s desks. If we’re both off that leaves 1 person covering 4 desks which is nearly impossible. I haven’t responded to Dave. 

I was going to email my boss and verify I was still good for those dates as Dave also said he had it off when I went to go check my time off and realized it didn’t take. I remember putting it in. Since I took it off Friday and we had a half day and Monday off I honestly didn’t think to check yesterday if it took. 

I emailed my boss to let him know that it didn’t take and I can’t put it in because it’s already a pay period but I haven’t heard. What do I do?

If Dave took it off this week he had to email my boss to have him manually add it as you can’t put vacation in yourself for the same pay period."

Grateful to have this position considering I have no degree and it gave me an opportunity to earn and hold securities licenses.... yet I hate it.

Hey Reddit. I'm in a little pickle regarding my career and life choices and I'm not too sure what to do. I'd like to get some advice or perspective from others here. During my teenage years I worked fast-food/retail, with a bit of odd manual labor mixed in here and there. Then I joined the military and worked a physically demanding job while active duty. I did that for 4 years, all the while teaching myself to code with the primary motivation of being able to attain a lucrative job and build a respectable career for myself down the road. Upon separating from the military, I attained said job.
At first, I was thrilled. I do enjoy coding to an extent, and thought that this was my ""big break"". But after doing it for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, I've come to realize that I don't enjoy it all that much after all. It was an escape after a hard days work. It was a way for me to relax. But sitting down, alone, in front of a computer screen all day every day is slowly driving me mad. My mental health is slowly getting worse and I've come to realize that I need some amount of human interaction and, more importantly, some amount of movement and physical activity. I don't believe it's my company, coworkers, or manager that makes me dislike my work. The problems I solve are interesting, my manager is truly incredible, and my coworker are all kind, encouraging, and helpful. It's simply the nature of the job, I'm certain I'd feel similar with almost any desk job where I toil in front of a screen day in and day out. I just didn't realize it as I'd never really had a truly white collar job prior. I also should note that I don't try to derive meaning or fulfillment solely from my employment. I go to the gym, I train MMA, I even dabble in stand-up comedy (though public speaking certainly is not my forte). All that to say, I don't expect to be 100% fulfilled from any job, but I just can't handle the 40+ hours a week of complete inactivity and nearly complete isolation.

I have the GI Bill, which grants me 4 free years of tuition at any public university in the country. I'm strongly considering quitting and using it. The only thing holding me back is that I have no idea whatsoever what I could do that I actually would enjoy and would meet my physical and social needs without overloading them. Too much socialization or physical activity for me is almost as bad as none whatsoever. I've come to terms with the fact that I'll almost certainly have to take a pay cut, and that's okay. I'm willing to earn less in exchange for my mental health, but only to a point. The ratio of income lost to happiness gained should be at least roughly equal.

I'm blessed to have the opportunity, time, and means to drastically alter my career path in my early-mid 20's but at the same time I'm overwhelmed with options. And I fear choosing the wrong one as I don't want to be in this same position 4 years from now.

I've tried introspecting and narrowing down my options based on my interests, but I can't think of a single career I'd like to actually make out of my interests. Working out and MMA isn't something I would want to make a career out of as it's just a way to blow off steam, and I don't have the desire to do stand-up comedy professionally. The only other interest I've had over the past ~5 years has been programming. Which I do enjoy, just not enough. Aptitude isn't a concern. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I'm certain that I could perform well doing whatever I decide, so long as the interest is there. I'm hoping that just maybe there's some perfect career path out there that I just haven't heard of or thought about yet.

After that novella, I open the floor to you. What are some good options for me to consider? What would you do if you were in my situation? Is there anything else I haven't thought of?

Thanks if you've taken the time to read this, doubly so if you then take the time to write a response. I look forward to hearing from all of you."

I was told by a family member that owns the company that I would eventually take over their business. This person told everyone from family, colleagues and to clients. 

I was the VP of sales and operations. They have everyone working there as contractors but act as though they are employees. I have in writing that I am the VP of the company. I spent my years working my ass off for the company, starting off at minimum wage to almost 200k.  Building a list of clients.

The owner never reinvested into the company. Put all his money into rental properties. When the pandemic hit, because of the type of industry, we started losing a lot of clients / money. When this started, the owner (being insecure and narcissistic), and his partner (relationship, and a psychopath), started getting really angry, passive aggressive, micromanaging, bullying, etc. to the point where 2 sales people walked out. The environment got so bad that I ended up resigning because there was no support, it was toxic, owner was acting in a way that was damaging. Even at the height of all this, he was non-stop harassing people with the vaccines and sending them articles. Telling them if they don’t get vaccinated that they shouldn’t work there. . I’ve recorded every conversation that was considered crossing the line.

I had a new born baby, took 4’weeks off and they  threatened my job because of taking time off. The list goes on forever. From gaslighting,lovebombing, to micromanaging.

Because I left on my terms, can I get any sort of payout / severance from them? Or am I shit out of luck? 

I don’t know my rights, and was wondering if someone can point me in the right direction. I feel like I have been taken advantage of and abused over the years.

I got a job offer in Canada, only experience I have is my 4 month internship in China.

Due to China have different title name with Canada I direct translation title on cv which doesn’t contain word “intern”, and marked it as intern on LinkedIn ( which I include link on my cv). 

With my experience in China I do have the opportunity to go full time but due to I’m coming back to Canada, I didn’t take it. But I did function as a full time stuff during the intern. And I do believe hiring manager saw that because we went quite deep into my job responsibilities 

But, I never get the chance to tell hiring manager it’s an intern because I wasn’t asked to introduce myself, we went straight into my job responsibilities.

With Sterling they request referee check and employment verification. My referees (manager and senior) agree the title on my CV is appropriate and respond as soon as they got screening check. Company HR called next day after referee check told me my background check cleared and send me official offer, along with a lot of documents(non disclosure, tech equipment, etc…) for me to sign, and a starting date(after holiday) Hiring managers also send me welcome email.

After couple days Sterling request more info from me and told me my employment verification is still in process. 

Right now I’m a bit stressed because I have no idea what my title is in my old company system as it’s pretty random with title in China office. But I’m pretty sure it won’t match

Do you guys think this will a problem?

Company recruiter did contact me through LinkedIn directly, so I assumed he know. But now I’m worried what if he didn’t look at my LinkedIn profile."

However, this is not the role I am most interested in and I only accepted it so I could start working post-college. I have continued to work hard though, and am not letting my performance slip just b/c I don’t foresee working this role for very long. Yet, I have recently realized how toxic it has become working with my manager (lack of listening, creating unnecessary issues due to not fully listening, favoritism, micromanaging, incorrectly speaking for others, making disrespectful statements, etc.). I continue to try and work with them and not let my own ideals/beliefs get in the way of what they want me to do/say, but it has still not lead to a positive work environment, and I am starting to realize the stress/anxiety that my job is creating.

I love my team and everyone I work with besides my manager, and I believe that the company has been an excellent place to work for. I don’t want to create problems or come after anyone, but it has placed me in a Catch-22 situation where if I speak up it will create a negative event, but if I don’t then nothing will be changed. I am at the point where I would certainly leave for a new job, however, I am locked into the role for another 8 months due to accepting relocation assistance ($5k to be repayed if I leave early). 

What actions should I take? Do I just accept having to pay back relocation and get out of the toxic environment for the betterment of my mental health &amp; career? Do I continue to just “suck it up” and work there at the expense of my well being? Should I speak with my manager/HR about the issues? Do I request to be able to switch to a new role with a different dept more suited to my desired career? Would it hurt my chances of landing a new job if I quit this early? Is it ok interview for new jobs while I continue to work?

I don’t want to leave my job and the people I work with, but it is becoming too much of a struggle to enjoy coming to work everyday 

tldr: I am struggling to figure out next steps for handling a toxic work environment, but cannot leave without a penalty of $5k due to accepting relocation assistance."

Was wondering if anybody has experience with any of their certificates and if they would recommend doing them or could share their experience. Thanks!

They also offer certificates in digital marketing, data analytics, and IT, etc., all of which I am interested in as well, but will start with the PM one since my background is in PM.

Background: Have a Bachelor’s degree and other certificates and credentials from schools. No student loan debt. Have years of work experience and diverse transferable skills.

1,2022-12-28,I really want this job. I don't think I came across the best in the second interview. How can I salvage this?,u/TheKingGoliath,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zxnnnc/i_really_want_this_job_i_dont_think_i_came_across/,jobs,"I interviewed for a position that is essentially my dream position. For most people, it's just a position to use as a stepping stone but for me it allows me to relocate, allows me to progress a step higher in my career field and offers $6 more an hour/$12,000 a year. It also puts me back in the career field I have the most comfortability in and most confidence in. I also have experience working with the overhead parent company. Problem is, interviews suck. 

The first interview went well enough. Both were via Teams. I gave the guy my experience, asked questions, etc. I thought I didn't do well enough to make myself stand out but obviously I was wrong because 4 or 5 hours later, he had left a voicemail attempting to schedule a second interview. We set this up. I had it today. 

The interview started meh. My camera was at an awkward angle I couldn't fix but whatever. The interview was with the first guy I interviewed with and another manager. I came across as awkward and unsure of myself and I know this for sure. I said, ""umm..."" a lot. Although, I tried to answer questions, it feels like I danced around some of them and didn't give the actual answer. I definitely didn't display the level of confidence I should have. 

At one point, I got asked, ""Why should we hire you over another candidate?"" This stumped me. My response should have been, ""I plan on being with my next organization as long as possible and see growth potential within your franchise."" Instead, I stumbled through some words and ended with ""I couldn't tell you, I'm sorry. I want to work for the company, I'm driven and good at my job."" Which visibly didn't make a positive impact. I don't think either of them had a response for that.

Then about 2/3 of the way through the interview, my dog decided it was a good idea to start barking. He was in his cage outside of my room and I had the door closed but I could still hear it and assume they could too. I decided not to address this, in the hopes that my dog would stop eventually. And just continued the interview despite my dog being a cunt. For the record, he did eventually stop. They finished their questions, I asked some follow ups to display interest. They responded and we ended the interview. They said if they want to schedule the 3rd interview, they will reach back out in a few days with the goal of having the position start at the end of January.

I feel like it went terribly. I'm in my own head a lot and could be overthinking but I ***WANT*** this job. I need to be able to relocate (gtfo of my current city) and also to elevate in my career field. I also fully want to quit my current job as I hate the company I work for and this is the best way to do that. I don't know what to do.

The ""me"" in me wants to send an email to the guy reaffirming my interest in the position as well as further clarifying and articulating my experience and skills. Stating how much I want the position, that although I came across as awkward or timid in the interview I'm competent and intelligent, etc. That I'm the best fit for the organization and culture, and a bunch of other crap. Essentially selling myself to them. I can write this and make it look professional. Essentially a more personalized, position specific cover letter type of deal. But I don't know if it's a good idea. Do I just let what happens, happen or do should I take action? I know the guy did in fact like my resume and experience, so I hope that helps but I truly feel like I didn't sell myself enough on the second interview.

It’s in the roughest part of the city I live in so I have to deal with a lot of crap (literally) and with this Winter being pretty brutal thus far, I’ve already had an unhoused person pass away right outside our property. I really thought I wanted a chill office job with a lot of down time but I feel like it’s hurting my mental health with all the down time and the 9-6 hours. 

My boss has gone on record saying he wants me to eventually be the district manager, which I know for a fact I don’t want to do. I’m only 23 and I have a lot of reservations about committing to a career with lots of responsibilities in a field I don’t even care about. My boss is a good guy, but he lives in another state and also he’s given me weird vibes. He likes to be extremely personable with his employees and take them all out for dinners and to bars when he’s in town and once he asked if he could feel my back when I was brand new and met them all at a bar within my first week, so there’s that as well.

1. I was told that I could work remotely as a consultant. When I brought up a 100% remote role, the interviewer didn't seem to know what I was talking about. Also, should I forward the email conversations to the person I interviewed with to let them know what was discussed
2. I made it VERY clear to the people who set it up that I was in school and would need certain days off. The interviewer knew nothing about that either. 
3. Furthermore, I'm really not looking to move presently, as doing so would make it a LOT harder to get my studies done.  

Also, on another note, despite not having sporadic ""per diem"" hours for my job, they were overly concerned about how many hours I was doing ""self-guided"" courses. Why should they care? They're videos. I wouldn't be watching them @ work. This is to help me be a more qualified employee.

I’ve had a few interviews in my previous industry and accepted an offer making a decent living, but would require about 295 days of travel a year (3 weeks out of state, 5 days home). At the time I received this offer, I was not in a position to decline an offer so I accepted it. Two weeks later I received a much more modest offer for a 100% work from home position which requires no travel. I have 2 young kids, so traveling 300 days a year is the last thing I want to do. Is there any way to tell the first company I am rescinding my acceptance without getting blacklisted from future opportunities? Is there a blacklist that actually exists within companies?

My biggest fear is that I decline the first offer after they’ve already done the background check and have the other company reach out a week before my start date and tell me that they’ve gone another direction. The start date for company 2 is 2 weeks before company 1. I just don’t want to unnecessarily strong company #1 along.

BUT I’m unhappy with the construction lifestyle. I work in terrible work conditions, it can be really hot or really cold. I work long 12 hour shifts, I often get called in on my days off, this year alone I’ve worked 500 hours of overtime. I work most weekends, holidays, birthdays etc. 

I’m kind of just over it. So anyways I’m about 6 months to a year away from finishing my bachelors in business administration. I’m hoping to find a job working from home making something remotely close to what I make now but I don’t have high hopes. I’ve arranged my bills to where I can afford to take a pay cut I’m just unsure how I’ll respond to such a drastic pay cut. I guess what I’m asking for those who’ve been in similar situations did you regret it, was it worth it, would you do it again?"

I decided I was going to quit and find a new job. I called my boss and said I was quitting, then she said I had to give a two weeks notice because that was what was agreed on during the interview. I was like okay that’s fine whatever because I could use that time to find another part time job.

She then started to guilt trip me by saying that if I quit then the time training me would be wasted and how she has kids in college that she needs to provide for. In all honesty, in my head I didn’t really care about any of that because I have to put my needs over hers. It’s not personal but I follow where the money is. 

She asked what would it take to make me stay since more people have been quitting and I said I needed to get paid more because I’ve been looking at other jobs and asking how much majority of my coworkers have been getting paid. She raised my $12/hour to $14/hour and said I should not talk about my pay anymore with my coworkers and to only speak to her about it. My boss probably dislikes me to some degree. I feel kind of guilty by the way I got that pay raise. But at the same time I’m looking after myself. Is it normal to feel guilty and should I even feel bad in the first place?"

I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), a tier 1 institution in India and I have been actively seeking employment opportunities in [UI/UX,FrontEnd/FinTech/StockMarket/Programming/Product Development].

Despite my efforts, I have been unable to find a job that matches my skills and experience.I am working on two projects (hopefully they will become successful and can be a startup soon) 
One in StockMarket and One in HealthTech. 

I did not sit for campus placements because I thought these products would launch by the end of this year..but unfortunately as you all know, startup funding has dried up and investors are expecting to have a product in pilot stage and only then will consider the pitch

Now shipping those products will take atleast 6months..

Hence I am looking for a job also due to my family situation.


I am extremely motivated and eager to start my career, and I believe that I have a lot to offer as a recent graduate with strong technical skills, including proficiency in Python, Java, C and C++, and SQL, as well as experience in data science, UI/UX design, and web development. In addition, I have developed strong financial skills, including the ability to conduct market research and analyze financial data.

I am reaching out to this group because I know that you guys have a lot of connections and experience in this field.

Any assistance/guidance/advice you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

My LinkedIn profile if anyone wants to hire me : http://linkedin.com/in/shreyasjsfintech 

ANY HELP would be GREATLY APPRECIATED and revered with DEEP GRATITUDE.

Thank youu."

I have been here for a year at this company but I need to find something else. A few weeks ago, my boss revealed to me that they are cutting my hours starting this spring (from 40 to 25) because they simply don’t have enough marketing work for me to do. I work in writing and communications for a small (and very toxic) marketing firm. It took me 108 applications to land this job and I realize they probably hired me so fast because they literally cannot keep anyone around for more than a few months…and I was the person they could find who was desperate enough to come into the office 5 days a week. 

I have been looking for a new job for a couple months and response rates are even worse than when I started applying after college. I have 2 years of experience in my field and I’m just not getting any callbacks. I applied to 32 jobs so far and had 1 phone screen interview, for which I didn’t get selected. It feel like I’m shooting blanks every time I send in an application, even when I match every requirement that they are looking for. I am assuming response rates are going to be slow in the holiday season but I don’t know what to do. I have debated trying to get on Upwork to makeup the extra hours but I’d rather have a full time job with normal hours because I’d be starting from scratch, and the pay for beginner freelancers is barely worth it. I was underpaid to start with in my current role and I’d like to make at least what I do now but realistically, a 15% increase would be nice. Is anyone else feeling this?"

1,2022-12-29,Got fired in a really horrible way,u/Cute_Meringue1331,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zxxyuj/got_fired_in_a_really_horrible_way/,jobs,"Context: I have 5 years of working experience. My ex-colleague poach me to work under her. I had 2 other job offers but I rejected them for her bc she lied that the job will be about data analytics and financial risk management. The probation is 6 months. I've been working for 5.5 months.

What happened: Yesterday my boss suddenly ask me to go to the meeting room and told me that I have to either resign or she will terminate me anyway. So I resigned. She also force me to leave immediately, and make me use my leave days to offset the notice period. Then she told me that we can still meet for tea and reach out to her for help finding a new job.

The experience over the 5.5 months: Even though my boss and her boss both come from the same company as me, for some reason they really hate me. 2 months in, my boss started distancing herself from me. She didnt want anyone to know that I was from the same company as her, she doesn't want any association with me. Next, she didn't give me any important work or projects, but the most manual job, which is reviewing call logs. Then, she / and other different team leads tell her boss bad stuff about me like how either I am not sociable, or I talk about non-work stuff, or I laugh loudly. They told other colleagues not to talk to me because they have a bad impression of me. They then told me that they have received feedback from ""the team"" that I'm not a good fit. My boss will purposely ignore my emails about work. I wanted to try my best so I worked really hard, now obviously I also know they hate me so I also tried looking but was only able to apply to 70 jobs before I got fired, bc I didn't have enough time.

The culture: The place is really strict and quiet. My boss's boss will tell her subordinates to talk to their subordinates if their skirt is too short, or if they bring other colleagues to our pantry. During christmas lunch, my boss talked to everyone about their personal life like hobbies or kids, but just ignore me. My boss is a workaholic, she gives a lot of work, tight deadlines, and expect everyone to work on weekends, holidays, and until 4am, and over lunch. I'm not allowed to go buy coffee during working hours without permission. I'm not allowed to work from home bc ""what if there's an emergency and they need to know where i am"".

The root cause: My boss's boss complained that I have no risk acumen and cannot articulate myself well. My boss also noted down some mistakes I made (like 1 month later), and not immediately, bc she doesn't want me to improve but rather just need evidence to prove I'm bad. My boss say that she expect more from me than my peers bc I have a master's degree, but honestly, anyone can do the job of reviewing call logs. So my boss began secretly interviewing people and yesterday someone signed the contract so she asked me to leave.

My takeaway: I will not ever work in such a company again. It's really big like 6000 employees, there are a lot of acronyms, systems, and processes, but nobody teach me and they expect me to figure everything out myself, bc they say if they could do it themselves then why can't I. They want someone who will be very aggressive and start giving opinions on day 1, but I'm a more ""laid-back"" person bc I am new and I want to make sure I know more first before suggesting anything. I feel like killing myself bc I don't know if any proper job will hire me now, bc I am not a people manager despite being old (29), and even if I accept a paycut, companies will not trust that I will stay for long."
4,2022-12-29,"Why won't I even get interviews when applying? Resume, country and more details inside.",u/RealColdasice,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zxy3r5/why_wont_i_even_get_interviews_when_applying/,jobs,"Hi, I have been applying for jobs since 2018, most of them aimed towards my field of expertise and even some completely unrelated ones, but rarely do I even get interviews with the companies. This is getting more and more frustrating and I can't identify what could be disqualifying me. I would like opinions and suggestions (even other areas to specialize in).

&amp;#x200B;

I have a degree in Design (both graphics and industrial) with specialization in Marketing, image and video manipulation and editing. I also have diplomas from famous courses in my country in Adobe and Autodesk packages.

In addition to that:

* I have proficient English.
* Studied 3 and 1/2 years of architecture (I think even without finishing it, it adds to my repertoire, right?).
* Have professional training in photography
* Master all the tools a designer needs, from the complete Adobe package, Blender, to more specific things, like e-commerce platforms, email automation, leadings, SEO, Google, social media, etc.
* And even have knowledge that is more specific, but that I believe adds, like handling 3D printers, OpenAI knowledge and programming.

&amp;#x200B;

In my portfolio there are works for more than 10 companies, big and small, from my internship to my freelancing.

&amp;#x200B;

I always ask for salaries at or below the state average.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the country is important when analyzing the chances to get into a company. I live in Brazil (rip) and in a country town, but I have means to start working in São Paulo (biggest Brazilian metropole) and Curitiba (a very big city) the day after I am hired, I can also go to these cities for interviews without any problem (I always make this explicit in my resumes).

&amp;#x200B;

Something that I think might be affecting me:

* Me living in the countryside. (even though I can go to the focus cities without a problem, I think this might be affecting and I don't know how to get around it).
* The lack of formal jobs on my resume (basically everything I did after graduating was freelance).
* The design market may be extremely saturated (especially with the informal market in this area).

&amp;#x200B;

When I do get interviews I always research the company, their goals and ideals, and I try to fit in as best as possible without being forced. If it's a small marketing agency I try to show that I can easily work in a team (I actually can lol).

&amp;#x200B;

I have also sent resumes to companies in Canada, Australia, and Singapore. Without success (I think the ""Brazilian"" factor hinders a lot at these times).

&amp;#x200B;

These are the details that I can think of now, as comments asking for more details are appearing, I will update the post.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much for your help. It is extremely frustrating to have graduated and specialized myself so much and still be without a job."

Long story short, before the pandemic I had outdoor and very active jobs. I used to work in hotels as a housekeeping supervisor. I also worked at the reception and in verious fields.

It could be very stressful but overall I never struggled with depression while having that active life. I loved checking rooms and would make about 25.000 steps daily. I was in great shape and had an active social life.

I also have OCD so checking rooms was absolutely something that I liked. 

However, just before the pandemic came I got a desk job in a high building office and I hated my life. I felt so trapped inside of that office. I got extremely anxious and when the pandemic came, we moved home.

Anyway, I no longer work at that job because they fired us all but as I want able to find another due to the pandemic, I had to come back to my country ( I was living abroad ).

Here, I got another desk job in the IT field and the company is great. Lots of benefits, good management, good pay. However, I got depressed, out of shape and feeling miserable for being inside my house most of the time.

Now, this jobs pays enough but unfortunately I'm unhappy with this indoor lifestyle. The problem is, I can't find a job that pays well outdoors. For example, supermarkets, hotels etc. The pay is so so shit.

I'm thinking to open my own cleaning company or to get a part time cleaning job meanwhile just to get used to the active life again.

Do you guys have any advice? Anyone else feeling like this with desk jobs? I was a very outgoing person and I became isolated and developed a lot of unhealthy habits.

I just don't know where to start.."

We have a number of charge hours we have to meet. I have been spoken to by the head manager about how I need to increase my charge hours and meet my month quota. Since it’s the holiday season a lot of people have taken time off. Originally I wasn’t going to but since so many people toook off and the work flow was slow I decided I might as well take off. The problem is , I have not reached my charge hour goal. If I take time off that means I won’t be able to increase my charge hours since I won’t be working . My charge goal is 142 and I’m currently at like 79. I probably won’t be able to meet my target goal unless I put in a ridiculous amount of overtime. Plus there’s probably not enough work to increase my charge hours anyways. The manager approved my leave but I feel guilty and worried about what the head manager may think about me taking two days off instead of trying to meet the quota . Should I not take off? Should the head manager has been gone for two weeks themselves for the holiday. I’m not sure if anyone will reach their charge hour goal."

1,2022-12-29,Need advice on getting paid only half my pay each week instead of bi-weekly,u/morbidgames,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zy7w6a/need_advice_on_getting_paid_only_half_my_pay_each/,jobs,"I work as a W2 Contractor in CA. We are supposed to be paid bi-weekly, every other Friday. I started with this job in October and things had been fine. However as of the pay periods beginning in December things have gone...weird.

My direct deposit on Dec 16 was only for half my pay (think 40 hours instead of 80). I reached out to HR who said it may have been due to my timesheet being submitted late. Timesheets are due 10am on Mondays for the previous week's hours, however I always submit mine on Fridays at EOD before I head out, my manager usually immediately approves them since we have a good relationship.

 I confirmed in our &lt;timesheet portal&gt; that my timesheets were submitted and approved on the previous Fridays so early for what was needed. I asked the agency if there was any other issue that may have happened, but they never responded, simply stated a day later that they'd issue a manual check via mail. However, this was direct deposited Dec 20. 

Today I check our ADP system and see that yet again tomorrow Dec 30 I am only going to be paid half yet again. I have emailed HR and my recruiter and included them with the timesheet confirmations. The last time things worked out ok, but this time I need to cancel a lot of my autopay schedules that I had setup for the end of the year and it's really a big inconvenience. It's also going to limit me on some of the things I wanted to do during this holiday shutdown as I will not have the funds available that would have covered the rest of my unpaid break through Jan 3 (tech contractor, they shutdown Dec 24-Jan3 and we're not paid during this time).

What options do I have, besides looking for a new contract in the new year? Shame cause I do like the job and it seems to have a chance of converting to FT in July, but these pay issues are really going to mess me up."

I called the background checking company, sterling, and they said it takes 3-5 days to get results, then about the same time frame for them to contact my doctor / pharmacist which will cause a few more delays and my start date is January 16. 

Should I take one of those drinks that masks everything? I’ve taken them before for previous tests and I’ve passed them without a problem. Or, should I just go ahead and take the test and wait for the delay for them to fact check everything?

EDIT again: I’m just going to not take the adderall for 3 days and have it clear out of my system just to be on the safe side

EDIT 2: I called sterling and spoke to a representative, they just said to bring the medications, it’ll take 48 to 72 hours to process the drug test, at the same time they verify the medications concurrently and then send it off to my job. That way it doesn’t really delay the whole thing unless there’s some discrepancies or issues in the drug test or background check. Thanks for all the advice everyone! Y’all were all right for the most part. I will not stop taking my medicine now that I have direct confirmation."

&amp;#x200B;

I have a job, and Ive been there for 4 years.

It pays well, but its just been too slow for is since covid, we are a construction company with GOVERNMENT contracts until 2038, and funded already, we have about 150 people including field personell, so the company is strong. Our future contracts while, still in place, dont start until mid 2023/2024.

So I start poking around with other jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

Interview 1: goes well

Interview 2: extremely well

Interview 3: They have told me, they will move forward with me, but they will need time with paperwork and offer letter.

Lets say this was on day 6.

Day 7, I get sick, like sick - tremendously bad. Covid. 

From day 7 to day 9, I was so bed ridden, that day 10, I had to go to the ER. (not sure if any of you guys actually WENT to a doctor/hospital for COVID or if you guys just stayed home, but I went to a hospital, and when you tell them you have covid, they almost reject you, unless you have a specific issue. I had to tell them I couldnt breathe, and having respiratory issues. After 6 hours at Kaiser ER, I was admitted, and saw a doctor. Doctor administers another covid test, and yes I am positive, as I thought.)

Again this is day 10, and the Employer has sent me an offer letter and prequthorization on day 9, and I actually responded back on day 11 as zombied out, and I told the Hiring manager, I was sick, and will get back to him when I recover.

Day 11  - Day 14, I needed to go back to the hospital,  covid, just had a toll on me and mind you im younger. Day 14, Kaiser, still does not want to give me the emergency pill as they say, I have to be dying for them to give that out. Kaiser, tells me to stay the night. 

I stay at kaiser from day 14 eve to day 15 end of day. I could not attend to any of my phone calls emails, and what not.

Day 16/17 I fell a bit better, but still testing positive, and I look at my phone and I see:

Tons of Missed Calls and EMAILS from the company that offered me a position, ALL harrasing - level of communication.

They believe that I have completely ghosted them.

Day 17 I was trying to get back to work and attending to my affairs, and I start getting dizzy, I actually pass out. My Fiance, was alarmed, sat me up, she panicked, took the phone out my hand and tried to wake me back. I did after a couple of minutes, and she says I looked pale.

She took my phone and said you need to get back to the ER and rest! 

Day 17, at night, went back to Kaiser, and man, am I effed up, IVs and some other fluids given to me.

Day 18, mid day, I take my phone back and my laptop, MORE emails and CALLS

and now I get called a COWARD in the email and other names because I simply wouldnt get back to them.

&amp;#x200B;

\-1 My health comes first, and i told this to the hiring manager that I am sick and need to attend to myself

\-2 they are harrasing me with emails and calls (yesterday morning, got 2 more calls from them)

\-3 Now that Im feeling recovered, I dont even want to explain myselft to them after recieving those types of communication from them

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think I should reach out and explain even though I dont want the job just to save face?

I’ve had 15 or so jobs over the past 10 years - some lasting years, some lasting weeks.

When I write my resume, it’s heavily edited. I cut it down to 4 jobs, and I say I’ve worked at each one for years, so there’s no gaps in my resume.

I’m realizing this was a horrible idea, as potential employers can easily verify my job history and see that I’m a dirty liar.

I’ve landed a position but they’re going to background check me and I know they will see my real work history and I’m afraid they will take away their offer. This is fine, I already pretty much saw it coming.

My question is:
Going forward, how can I make a more honest resume? I’ve been unemployed for 6 months. The last job I was at, I was let go after 3 weeks. I can’t exactly put that on my resume.

I’m tired of lying and presenting a false version of myself, and furthermore; I’m really tired of the horrible paranoia of knowing I will be background checked, and caught in a lie.

Idk if anyone has been here before or has any advice - but I’m kind of freaking out, and I could use some help.

TLDR: I lie on my resume because my work history is atrocious and when jobs background check me they will see my true work history so how do I make a more honest resume but not look like a horrible piece of shit employee?

Thank you."

I am a Senior Network Engineer at a medium to large-sized international company with over 8k employees, 30+ remote offices, and 4 Datacenters scattered all over the globe. There are currently only two Network Engineers on payroll (including myself) to support this entire network infrastructure (yes, I know we are stretched thin....). As of result, I stay extremely busy with ongoing change requests, projects, migrations, etc. Both my coworker and I started early this year (2022); however, he started a few weeks before me. However, I noticed that everyone resorts to me for Network support because I have a much better understanding of how everything is configured and set up in our environment. In Addition, I also pick up the most ongoing and critical projects because I am seen as very dependable and timely in seeing my assigned projects to completion.  Well, I have been on PTO this entire week due to the holidays; however, ongoing projects for other teams (App, Server, Security, Desktop Team) are still going on this week. Well, these other teams that have their ongoing projects still need network support to move their internal projects forward. However, the other teams report to my boss and management that they do not receive as much support from my coworker as they do from working with me. So as of result, I have been getting pings and calls left and right from management and my boss, even while on PTO, asking if I can assist them with their ongoing projects. Working even while on PTO was nowhere written on my Job Application when I accepted the job. What do you think I should do? Should I get compensated for this loss in PTO? Could this be leveraged when it is time to request for a decent raise in my upcoming performance review? Thanks again."

The offer letter said they cover 80% of you and your families monthly premiums towards insurance, standard 401K matches 6% and they even are giving me a 5k sign-on bonus to pay back the one I have to pay back for my current job. The salary they offered is 125k. They got plenty for room for growth. They even got a 20% performance bonus.

My wife is on disability and suffers a lot of pain so a lot of the house hold chores fall on me.  One child still in the home but will be out of high school in two years.  I am in my early fifties.

I have been working diligently to pay bills off. Other than monthly bills like utilities, insurance, and streaming services I owe for one vehicle and our home.  I expect the vehicle to be paid off in less than six months.

I have a pension, 401K, and a Roth IRA.  We do have some money put back but not a lot since we have been working to pay bills off - less than twenty thousand.  

My desire is to retire early, use my pension to make up for a cut in salary and get a job with better hours, less stress, holidays off, and provides insurance.

Need advice:  other than paying bills off, what else unforeseen thing I might need to prepare for should I do?  I’m looking at making the change in two years.  Should I refinance the house for a lower monthly payment?  I have no job planned yet so don’t know what kind of pay cut I will have to take as this is still a couple of years away.  I will be in my mid fifties then and don’t know how marketable I will be.  I figure anything in the twenty to thirty an hour range would suffice.  Any advice for preparing would be appreciated."

I received a CJO from a 3 letter agency, and the next steps include a polygraph assessment and psych eval. I am incredibly nervous for the polygraph test. I've never- had? used? taken part of?-  one before and the feeling of a being under a microscope makes me uneasy.   
Its also causing me a bit of stress because polygraphs are not totally accurate. Of course my fears being they will say I'm lying when I'm not, or ask me questions I'm not totally comfortable answering.  
I'm still going through the whole process because the job is amazing, and I believe working there would be fulfilling and would give me a sense of purpose. I would also be directly helping people with the work I do, which is very important to me. This is a huge milestone in my life, and if I get the job, it would be the first I've ever had with room for growth where I could picture myself staying at long term. Which also adds to my stress/anxiety about the process.  
I was hoping someone here might have experience with this kind of thing, and can provide some info that might put my mind at ease, or at the very least let me know what I will be walking in to. For example, did it feel like you were being interrogated, or was it more easy going. Any experience at all you've had, good or bad, I would love to hear it.  
Thanks!"

2. pouring my drink before wiping my steam wand 

3. chiming in on his conversation with a customer when he couldn’t answer a question about cross contamination and allergies

the conversation we had regarding these mistakes(?) was super aggressive. when i told him i needed time to adjust to changes,he told me that “we don’t have time” and “i’m the only one at my job who isn’t getting it”.

i feel like he’s handling this situation really poorly. i get paid minimum wage plus solid tips, and i do my best to put in a good effort when it comes to my job. i’ve explained before that i’m willing to learn, i just move via muscle memory and it’s tricky to break habits that have been built up over time. he’s been working with me for aprox 2 weeks, in which we’ve worked together 4 times.

I am new in the group. Few months ago I joined one company in a management group. I have a team of 10 people to lead and even though I think that I am doing fine, recently I catch myself feeling way too unsure about my performance. 

Little bit of context: changed the industry, I am in my early 20s, got the position for which people get promoted to within the company and rarely get hired externally.

Recently I have the feeling that people who are on the same position as I am don’t really like me, and it gets in my way of feeling confident. I did get basic training after joining the company, however there are way too many small details, processes which I am still not familiar with simply because they are “learn as you go”. Seems like lot of people I have to work with on daily basis don’t really seem to get that and even though in the beginning I was asking questions to make sure I had similar understanding of things as they did, I stopped asking questions because answers confused me even more. My supervisor gives me the positive feedback, nothing grand nor majorly negative - however, working with my peers makes me feel like I should be doing much more. I have this feeling that my opinions are “wrong” and there is this weird tension when we are in meetings (I work in Dutch company and everyone but me speaks Dutch as it’s not required to perform the daily tasks as we provide services in English and everyone has to speak English for this random British guy that joined from somewhere else). I went out for coffee and drinks with my peers few times to melt the ice and it sort of worked outside but as soon as we got back to the office, this distant, weirdly judgemental vibes came back so I stopped initiating being friendly. I noticed that people gossiped a lot, it was almost like I wasn’t talking to an individual, rather than the whole group. 

Another thing is that, I had to backup few of my peers and handle their teams and I learned that their teams liked me better (They were quite vocal about it). I learned that lot of people my peers are leading often feel unsupported, left alone, never listened to, nor respected which is opposite of my team. I always try to be very empathetic and even though I don’t have the good technical knowledge of this industry yet, I always get the answers provided to my team or my peers’ teams when I back them up. I don’t want to assume that my peers know this and it’s a jealousy thing, but sometimes I do feel like it is.

Also, most people working on this position are older than I am. 10-15 years older which might be playing it’s part, but I try to be mature, respect everyone and whenever I disagree with something, I try to be constructive. 

My main concern is that I won’t get contract extended because of this hostile environment will affect my performance at some point and I don’t want to lose the job as I like the salary and benefits. Also, it’s hard to get such a job in the area I am and some of the visa related paperwork is heavily dependent on it. 

What would you advise I should be doing? Have you had similar situation? Is it just me being anxious? 

Thank you!"
1,2022-12-29,I am being offered two jobs and I don't know which one to choose,u/Garloo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zyl7yy/i_am_being_offered_two_jobs_and_i_dont_know_which/,jobs,"Hello everyone, as the title says I am being offered two full time jobs and I do not know which to choose. 

The first is a Front Desk position at a 4-Star Hotel and the Other is a Bank Teller for a local Bank Chain.   
   


The hotel is a Renaissance hotel under the Marriott Brand. It is offering 17 an hour. Commute is about 25-30 minutes. Also the scheduling will be not always the same, so sometimes I work mornings, and sometimes I work evenings, and my days off will be different at times. I think I heard someone from HR say they are union? But I am not sure if they are.

The Bank is offering 15 an hour. The Commute is about 8 minutes, and I can even walk there if I want. Generally will be the normal 9-5 type job with the same two days off always. During the interview they placed empathize on monthly requirements on closing so many accounts, no idea if that is common.

No matter which one I choose it is only a stepping stone to a better job, which I am kind of interested in three fields, Museums, Libraries, or a job that allows me to travel overseas. I also only have a Associates Degree in Liberal Arts, in case that changes anything.

&amp;#x200B;

But if anyone is willing to give me their input, I would much appreciate it."

If I take time to focus on how to improve on a meta level (e.g. taking time to reflect, building better organization systems and routines, reading about soft skills that would help) on the clock, I feel like I'd be neglecting the clients and the work. But I feel like if I don't take the time to look at ways to improve, I'm always going to be treading water.

I do not blame her one bit, even though she was vital to our department she was honestly probably spread thin between two different roles.  I was informed that the department will not be hiring anyone else and instead I will be absorbing the roles she’s leaving, as well as working on my current tasks.  Basically I was told I need to pick up the extra slack.  Is it wrong to ask for a raise to compensate for the extra workload I will be expected to complete?  I do not have any downtime in my day currently, and I will have to try to figure out how to fit these extra responsibilities into my current schedule.  Is asking for a raise even the right move?  I don’t really think that asking for more money will grant me the ability to complete everything in a timely manner, but it is the only way I can think to justify the extra work and expectations.  

For clarity I am working in purchasing and she was a hybrid of planning/scheduling, and some purchasing.  She is moving to focus on planning and scheduling, and I am absorbing the remainder of her purchasing responsibilities.  I have only been working here since October and I currently make $25 an hour.

Payroll says they need to be submitted by midnight tonight in order to process it before the holiday. Thanks.” 

He replied: “ Yeah, I’m busy. I’ll get to it.” But then she said he approved it right then. She said she thought his response was a little odd because they usually have cordial interactions via Teams. 

Was her message rude or unprofessional? I feel like if you don’t use emojis and exclamation marks, every message can be seen as rude…

For clarification, 

1) it was 8pm on Friday before a holiday. Our boss usually approves timesheets as soon as they’re submitted, no later than 5pm; 

2) my coworker has to submit two timesheets, one recording project hours worked (which is what she was asking our boss to approve) and another which records her time in/time out hours. The first timesheet has to be approved by our boss and then it gets attached to the second timesheet before it’s submitted to payroll. 

3) My coworker is introverted but she also doesn’t really care for our boss because he hasn't stood up for her in the past and doesn’t advocate for her to get a full time position even though she’s been working for him for 6 years. I don’t think she has made that evident to him, though."

I have no interest whatsoever. I like games, comics, anime, you get the gist. I’ve asked for more WFH but it just gets met with false promises and dismissive answers.

I don’t really understand how offices work, even after having been there over a year, I guess. I just assumed it was kind of like school mostly, you just get paid for your assignments. I don’t really have much interest in making friends there either. I’ve often squared off with my boss because of this issue as well. 

I also don’t need anyone else to perform the job. Like, I don’t feel the need to really talk to anyone anyway? I’m not even sure why other people do it.

Some advice for those still looking, theres the cliche 'just keep pushing champ', which I hate that that is all that some can say, but truly do try to stay motivated. For me, what really helped was that I managed to make a connection with my interviewer, who will be my supervisor (which makes me think it wasn't just in my head), during the initial half hour. It was really tiny, he read my resume, saw I had studied math, his eyes lit up and there was a brief moment of 'this guy knows whats up'. It was notable enough that I actually journaled about it that evening, so I like to think it helped. Your interviewers are human (some just as flawed as you, which you'll notice as you do more and more), so making a connection will help them remember you, and increase your chances of a call back."

I manage the customer service for a small business in mental health advocacy. The director has had difficulty finding people who are okay with working inconsistent hours while we build our client base, so has had to compromise on hiring contractors with not much experience.

One such contractor has been great, she's very friendly and talkative and forges rapports easily with clients, but has a bit of a... ""rebellious"" streak? 

By ""rebellious"", what I mean is that it seems she assumes most agreements in the contract are subjective or not there for good reason. Even though it is stated that we do not drive clients home (this is due to insurance), she offered to drive a client home and when we informed her it was against our conduct, she argued with this point and stated it seemed unnecessary. She also sometimes has given clients advice on their diagnoses (suggesting they are fake), even though we are explicitly not supposed to offer medical or psychiatric advice.

The worst instance I can think of is when she informed me, gladly (appeared to not even question whether this was a bad idea), that she had offered a client her *prescription CBD oil* because the client had a headache. We were gobsmacked that she would recklessly offer prescription medication like that, seeing as it's off limits to even offer clients a paracetamol. She then stated that she is enthusiastic about recommending clients get a referral for medical marijuana. We could not believe that she didn't understand the significance of offering medical advice or medication to vulnerable people, let alone medical marijuana, and the hot water it could get us into. I'm just thankful for the company that as she's a contractor, it's her that would be sued and not us if something went wrong.

It did not appear to completely stick when I tried to explain the risks involved in this to her. The owner of the company is also a passive person and does not like letting people go, and in addition they know each other in their personal life, so I'm not sure if they would rather keep the contractor onboard because of this - if they did, I'm not sure if warnings to the contractor would fall to deaf ears. We knew that this contractor was a critic of traditional systems, but didn't expect her to not understand the need for *rules or structure in general*.

What should we do? The director agrees with me that this is unacceptable, but says she doesn't have the resources or time to find another contractor at the moment, that she still has projects that are underway, and that it would be too awkward to terminate the contract considering they're acquaintances. We're not sure how to explain the significance of following the agreements in the contract more clearly to the contractor. She has been great apart from these issues.

How do you explain to a reckless contractor that you must follow all relevant laws and agreements outlined in our contract?

Thank you."

I started a new part time job this week and worked 3 hours, I get paid hourly but I did not work for an entire week (started thursday). I am planning to do another 3 on Saturday. My employer said I will be paid on weekends. The shop is not running in business so no profit earned.
Other employees seem have worked longer hours than me.
Should I just go up to employer and ask Do I get paid today after finish working or is there other polite way to ask so?
Is it appropriate for me to ask?"

I completed the third round interview last week on Thursday for a very good sales job. After the interview both managers said they would hire me, we also agreed on all the details such as salary, job description (career journey at the company) and starting date. I was told the recruiter will call me after Christmas, however today (it is almost 1 PM Friday at my place) is the last working day of the week. I understand there was Christmas, we did no work on Monday in my country etc. But I am starting to get a bit worried. 

The thing is I somehow applied for a more like senior job, but it seemed they were happy with the way the interviews said and we agreed upon my career journey at the company. The job would be changed more to a junior type, but I will be provided enough training a experience to move towards senior. It is a corporate so I am quite worried that maybe someone in higher management declined this move. I was hoping to get a call even if this does not work out, just to know, the situation considering the fact they told me I ll get accepted. 

Also I came 20 minutes late for the interview, as I was away from the city for a 2 week Christmas vacation and travel conditions fucked me over :/.

Should I follow-up with the recruiter today or on Monday? Do you think it is legit its taking so long, considering Christmas etc.? 

Thank you."

I don’t have the means or time to take a lot of risk or go get another degree, but I am willing to get re-trained and I actually do really enjoy learning totally new things. I have a Data Camp subscription and am learning Python in between scrubbing toilets, but it doesn’t feel like it connects to real-world jobs because I don’t have professional experience or a background.

I’ve been doing both customer service and admin + floristry anyway…

Just before Christmas the full time florist position ad was changed to a full time customer service and admin job (my job) as my boss felt we would get more people applying this way… I saw the ad and it is 4K more than what I am getting paid and what I was offered when I got the job… and is also more than what I was told I would get after my six month probation period. 

We’re currently on our Christmas and new year break and when I go back I want to talk to my boss about it. I’ve only worked there three months but I know I deserve a pay rise for what I do especially if the job being advertised is more than I’m currently getting paid.

Dear (hiring manager),

When I moved into Orchard Knob almost nine years ago, nearly every home adjacent to us was vacant, there were multiple people shot at all times of the day within feet of our home, and I was worried I’d made a big mistake moving my wife into such a dangerous neighborhood.

That was until I met Ms. Pat, an elderly woman who was born in the very house whose porch we would spend hours talking and becoming best friends.    Sadly, Ms. Pat died in that same house in 2018 at the age of 76.  

While we kept vigil as a community on her porch in her last hours, I met the most amazing people in my neighborhood.  It was at this moment I decided I would be fully committed to my community and the people that make it so incredible.

This is why I became secretary of the Orchard Knob Neighborhood Watch Association, and it’s why I want to advocate for my community now regarding the TVA funds that will directly impact my neighbors’ well being.  There are many of my neighbors that need upgrades to their homes to improve their health, comfort, and quality of life; homes that many have lived in, like Ms. Pat, for more than 50 years."

My employer did call and text me when I didn’t show for my first shift but I didn’t reply to any of her attempts. 

Só a few days ago I was on a local job group and I seen her on there trying to have people apply, I’m assuming she’s short staffed now. At first she had a full house and “nowhere to put me” and yet here she is hiring again so I’m sure some people didn’t work out.

Fast forward to today I wake up to a long message from her that basically says “you didn’t show up to work for 2 weeks without a call or anything. Is it because of the job or the hours? Had you reached out you would’ve known that I had a full time position available for you. I need to know what you are going to do ASAP.” 

Personally I’m over the job and feel it’s a setup. I feel like if I were to go back she’d just run over me again and only keep me full time until she finds other people. I feel like she’d mess over me for sure as payback for not working. Any thoughts or suggestions ?

EDIT: OG post is still up, feel free to read it before calling me names, thanks.

LAST EDIT (hopefully): Some of you agree with my actions and some of you don’t. I understand both sides. Yes, I could’ve called and notified that I would not be working the shifts but they could’ve also notified me of all the changes. I was blindsided and so were they. Some of you deem my actions as “unprofessional” and say I’ve burnt that bridge however, the bridge was burnt before I even made my decision. Once untrustworthy, always untrustworthy. I was left without a job and they were left severely understaffed. Id rather not work for someone who doesn’t keep their word. I will continue to hold out for an employer who treats me properly. :)

This week especially, she treated me very poorly. I had to remind her that I was being professional and that she needs to be professional as well instead of threatening me. That also triggered her and she went off about some other company and how she gets paid however much.

I have talked to my supervisor and he knows exactly what I have been going through since he has seen her do the same thing to the scientists. He ended up talking to her and she walked up to my desk and told me that if I ever have a problem i should go to her and not hide behind my supervisor. I literally told her from the first week that he will get updates so he is in the loop. She ended the conversation that he is below her anyways and cannot do a single thing. She also called my team sensitive because no one talks to her and does things in a more humane way. We work with mice and our “sensitive” methods prolongs their life and the study.

I don’t know what to do. My supervisor talked to HR and they emailed him that they can’t do anything since she is VP. As a matter of fact, my friend was harassed by another coworker and they didn’t do anything either. HR is just useless. My coworker told me to go to the president, but I feel like that is only going to backfire. The VP and president are very close. She would know exactly who reported her and she has only gotten worse when I told my supervisor about the situation.

The project is estimated to last for another two months unless it doesn’t go well then the client might extend it. It has already been extended, initially it was supposed to be less than a month.

I already told her that I will drop the entire study and just not help her and she told me that she would find a way to fire me. I can’t lose this job at the moment since it pays well compared to other jobs in the market. My supervisor told me that he won’t let her fire me since he needs me on the team, but I don’t know if he would really stick his neck out for me if she is that stuck up. 

I have no clue what to do and am starting to get depressed because of this study."

I apply mostly on linkedin and company websites. I tried to go around and reach for recruiters, they always say go through the stupid online applications system, where I usually get rejected in a very short time.

The very few I got responds:

* Applied for high position: ""Well, we asked for 20 items, you only fit 19, sorry""
* Applied for a lower position: ""Are you trying to replace me (hiring manager)?"" They get scared I will substitute them.

It feels like I am doomed, I can't go too high because I lack ""experience"" on something. I can't go low, because the hiring manager is worried.

I say all of that but I still feel bad at my job because lately my schedule has been very open when my coworkers have been a lot busier than me. We are commission based so the paycheck reduction is really hurting right now. I’m feeling lost and not sure what to do as this has been for the past few months. Any clients I work with normally give me amazing reviews and compliments and I haven’t had a complaint in months or even years from anyone. 


I want to switch jobs but no idea what to. I would love a more 9-5 Monday-Friday job but no idea what to switch to I can’t afford to go back to school even though I have an interest in IT work maybe even coding. 


Anyone have any ideas or recourses to look into would be amazing. I don’t really care what I transition to as long as it is steady hours and would be possible to have a more comfortable life financially since my current line of work largely doesn’t offer pto or many other benefits. Work from home would be amazing but not mandatory for me.

I am not sure what to do and I'll need to make a decision very soon. I'm partially terrified of handing in my notice because I'll feel so bad and I reckon there would be some kickback but also terrified of starting something new. It's a risk, i have only been here for one year. Any advice?"

I sent an open application letter to company A, I've been to two interviews and one testing. I have last interview on January 11th, with the director. Fellow psychologist from HR can't guarantee I'll get the job, and for the beginning it will be temporary, but there's a chance to stay in HR because there's a lot of work to do and there is a need for another employee.

For company B I applied via job listing and have also been to two interviews and testing. They specifically look for an employee indefinitely. Still need to hear from them because they need to choose between few candidates.

The problem is, if I can, I would rather get the job at company A. But what if they call me from company B before 11th of January and they told me I got the job? What can I say, I want to wait until company A gives me the answer? I think that would be pretty rude. What if I then loose a chance at company B, and still don't get the job and company A on 11th of January? Help."

1,2022-12-30,How to request pay increase when absorbing a Sr.'s role who made similar to your current pay?,u/devindyan,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zzan3j/how_to_request_pay_increase_when_absorbing_a_srs/,jobs,"16 months ago I took an entry-level admin position with a roofing construction company after over a decade in F&amp;B Management. I stepped up to help with so many tasks in other departments I trained to take on the tasks of a Junior Production Manager who switched to our AR department last spring. I have been working ""under"" the Sr. Production Manager who turns out is terrible at his job and I started absorbing some of his tasks and was also tasked with auditing his work to ensure jobs were moving forward appropriately. 

During this time I inquired about pay increases but since many tasks were ""temporary"" and I wasn't given any official new titles I was turned down. I have since been job hunting for a new role. 

Yesterday I was informed my Sr. was getting let go and I will be absorbing half of his workload with our operations manager with the plan I stay responsible for that work and another person will be hired to backfill the other half. No word of title change or additional compensation has been brought up. 

Despite being on the job hunt I would like to gain an official promotion/title and receive compensation to go along with that title in the meantime. My original thought was to request I be bumped to the former Sr.'s pay level but a little bird informed me our pay rates were less than $5K apart. (HOW?) So I guess I'm wondering how to phrase my pay increase request to be tailored to my expertise and value rather than referencing the pay of my predecessor.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I've worked my way up in a construction company over the last 16 months with more and higher-rated responsibilities. Absorbing role of Sr. Production Manager who turns out made similar $$ to me. How do I request a significant pay increase for myself?"

I was notified by the recruiter an hour prior to the interview as well as the day before that I would be meeting with the hiring manager for the onsite interview. I showed up on time but after 10 minutes past the scheduled interview time I was met with the supervisor to my surprise as opposed to the hiring manager. The interview went pretty well and was told by the supervisor that he would discuss my resume and background with the hiring manager and the  hiring manager would come to a decision by today or latest Monday. He said the hiring manager couldn't interview because of end-of-the year employee reviews which makes sense giving the timing but still. The interview felt professional and I wasn't asked much of behavioral or technical questions but was shown around the company and was given a detailed overview of everything. Overall I thought I did pretty well. What do you all make of this?

Edit: Yeah they have pretty bad reviews consistently from current and former employees. They have around 200 personal per shift and 90 percent are Hispanic workers that I assume may be illegal immigrants. I came into the place and there was like 100 of them lined up for food break. Also evidently it's hard to leave the place for lunch due to a security check and former cases of employee impersonation..there was also a security guard and cop in tnere when I came in.."

I had my first annual evaluation which has raises tied to performance (allegedly). I am told that the company standard for raises is 3% yearly.

My director and I have a decent relationship (from her side, not mine) and we come from similar backgrounds so we connect in that way. Due to this, we have a certain rapport. One of my fellow managers is very lazy, unhygienic (doesn't wash his hands), and has been written up multiple times for sexual harassment, one of which I observed. My boss has asked me for advice about this coworker many times. She even once told me she was getting ready to fire him (this was several months ago). She said she does not know what to do with him because if she writes him up again he will get fired and she doesn't think he is a bad guy. Last year, he complained to me that he did not receive a raise.

He informed me that he received a 3% raise this year, the same as myself. My boss told me when she was doing my evaluation that she hoped to write ""above average"" for me next year and ""possibly"" change my job title to a pay grade higher. She gives me more responsibility than the other managers on the team and expects me to coach them in areas that they are weak in (writing evals for their staff especially pertaining to goals, IT-related things, etc).

Ever since I found out about his raise, I have been incredibly depressed at work. I feel very unvalued to have gotten the same raise as someone my boss said she was going to fire, who sexually harasses people and doesn't even wash his hands when we work in a hospital.

Do I bring this up? I did look for jobs in the area but there are none in my field. This raise does not even cover my increase in rent which I did tell her when she told me what I was getting. I would love to have a stay interview with her (which I did with my staff today) but she does not do this kind of thing. I would not overly mind the raise but the fact we got the same raise is what is affecting my morale. Why should I continue to go above and beyond and assist everyone else when I am being rewarded the same way as someone who does the bare minimum and negatively affects others and patient safety?"
300,2022-12-30,Mandated return to office in the New Year; do I move or quit?,u/LudicrousNerd,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zzdy8d/mandated_return_to_office_in_the_new_year_do_i/,jobs,"To give a brief rundown of the situation: I landed this position just before finishing my bachelors degree and I've been here going on 6 months now. I have a great team, manager, good pay and I'm 99% of the time working from home (still living with parents for the time being). I'm very grateful for the position as a whole, and it feels good to be able to start saving up for the future, along with building my career. Virtually no real negatives as things go.

This is the one and only problem I've really had to struggle with, hence posting on here for advice! Just before Christmas break everyone received a newsletter stating that we would be expected to return to the office for 3 days a week, starting in January. There's been very little (if any) runup to this, and no one in my small team is happy about it due to their commuting times, including me. We've yet to have a roundtable discussion about the change with our manager, but thought I should begin preparing/getting advice for different outcomes regardless.

This change would mean an extra 6 (bare min.) to 12 (max) hours a week commuting, preparing etc. which is just unsustainable for me now with the work/life balance I've had and gotten used to for the past half a year. This brings me to the fork in the road - if there's no leeway my realistic options are to move out from living with the parents and make the commute time minimal, or quit/move job. I'm hesitant to go whole hog and quit as the company is a good name to have on my CV/resume and I really enjoy my position. Not to mention a short employment period would probably bring up questions when having to find a new job. However, moving out would also mean cutting my saving power each month by over half with having to pay more when it comes to rent, food, taxes etc. I'd also have to make changes when it comes to personal, outside of work arrangements (i.e gym, clubs, family etc.).

Anyone have any advice for a newbie who's just started my career? Really not sure what to think, say or do in this situation. Any thoughts would be much appreciated, completely fine if you think I'm just being a whiney millennial too.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the advice thus far! To clarify, when interviewing and first joining, I was told I would have a week in-person for the induction and my arrangements would change based on my team's preferences, which has been fully work from home thus far unless an in-person meeting is necessary. I've gone in probably once a month or two so far.

EDIT 2: Wow! I did not expect to wake up to so many comments. I'll do my best to get back to you all, but for my sanity I'll probably have to skip over replying to quite a few of you - please know that I'm reading every comment though!

I've been countlessly applying, and last week, a company reached out to me two hours (!!) after I sent them my resume saying that they were interested in having me come in for an interview.

They scheduled it for this Tuesday, that interview seemed like it went well, and then they told me to come in again Wednesday morning to chat with the rest of the team/office to get a feel of everyone, as well as ""talk about comp and all that"".

I was pretty surprised at how quickly they were willing to extend an offer (they sent me the official offer end of day yesterday, Thursday), but the base salary is almost insultingly low. Doesn't quite align with how they seem to have presented, along with how happy everyone seemed to be to be part of the company, and it's super weird as well because their glassdoor site (albeit very very bare) has one of the pros listed as salary. One of the guys I even talked to said that the offer should be pretty good.

I know a lot of people say to always reflect the salary range question back to the employer, but I've personally always preferred to give my range straight up instead of play some weird back and forth game. I gave them the $65-80k range, their glassdoor for one of the engineers stated $76k, and the average on the market seems to average around the $73k mark. Not sure if this is just base pay or includes all benefits.

I was expecting something around the $72k mark just based on my experience and what I'd be comfortable being paid (being paid too much gives me performance anxiety), and so when they came back with $64k, that just seemed absolutely ridiculous. I'm not sure if they did that because they expected me to counter, or if because I had happened to tell them about the urgency of needing to move out due to my lease ending soon, or trying to make it seem like I was willing to take a lower salary to increase my chances of getting an offer by talking about my low living costs because I kinda did really need a job.

Now, I don't *technically* mind taking the $64k base, it's pretty much almost the same as what I used to make, except that all their other benefits seem a bit lower. One less PTO day per year, fixed 401k contribution (no vesting though!), medical/dental isn't fully covered, and there is no sign on bonus. The work environment sounds absolutely worlds and worlds better than my old job though, and the 3 main people I'd work with all happened to have actually worked at my old workplace in the past too (what a coincidence). They're also super flexible with scheduling, I had asked if it was ok to start for a week, then take a week off to move, before starting again, and they were totally cool with that. They also mentioned that you pretty much can make your own schedule (within reasonable bounds), and they actually have the bandwidth to train me, and despite one person having worked there for almost 2 years, have never once worked overtime. I also asked if they would cover paying for study materials for the certification exam, or the exam itself, and they said it would be fine. They're also fine with looking into future green card/H1-B sponsorship.

So, looking at the whole package in general, it's not too bad. It's just that base pay that just feels way too low. Any tips on how to go about negotiating for higher pay? Do I send them screenshots of market research stating the average pay around the area? Do I ask for a sign on bonus? Would it seem like pushing too hard because if you do add everything up, it does, just barely, end up at 70k. It's still less than what I used to make though. Considering I have +1 year experience, seems a little odd.

They repeatedly emphasized how they care a lot less about what someone can bring to the table than the kind of personality/intangibles that a person brings, and how well they can get along with the team. So general salary negotiation advice about saying what you can bring to the table doesn't seem like it's something they'd necessarily find all that relevant. They're also not in a panic to hire, so it's not like I can use that as leverage, as they say they're always hiring, because you never know. Everyone I talked to in the office has jokingly said that ""I better take the offer!! We need your help! I better see you in a couple weeks!"", so likability wise, I think I've got that down. But I'm still not sure how to navigate the negotiation, I've never negotiated in my life.

Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: Alright alright guys sorry if I sound like an entitled ass in this post, I'm not pissed or annoyed at the company or offer, it's just that I've never gotten an offer under my range before, which I've intentionally expanded to hit the lower part of the bell curve, so an offer under that range falls in the sub 30-40% of the going market rate, which while fine, is not ideal. All I'm asking is if it's possible to move that offer into my range."
1,2022-12-30,Should I give a short resignation notice to my current company via an email or in person?,u/Shyfilipino,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zzeeht/should_i_give_a_short_resignation_notice_to_my/,jobs,"I just accepted a new job. I'm going to a previous employer that I left 3yrs ago. I'm mainly leaving my current company because cost of living will be better (moving from SF area to Nevada), better lifestyle for myself, and I'm getting a promotion where I'll go back to being a manager ( I took a step down 3yrs ago to go to my current startup company).

When the negotiations started about 3 weeks ago, they initially wanted me to start on Jan. 2nd, but I initially negotiated it to Jan 9th instead due to me moving, and I knew negotiations would take at least a week to finalize.. that was the first negotiation. But after a few other negotiations (salary and sign on bonus), I finally signed the offer this morning.

Now, this leaves me in a situation where I can now only give a short notice to my current company that I will be leaving. I did try to negotiate at the end to push for a 2-week notice since the other negotiations took a lot of time to handle, but that didn't go anywhere. I feel bad for giving short notice. I don't want to leave on bad terms, but I also don't want to start on bad terms.

 I am wondering if I should give a short notice EMAIL to my current manager/company so it gives them a few extra days (it's a company holiday today for New Year's)? Or should I wait until Monday to give it in person? I was going to do it in person but I still feel a bit unease about it."

Many people I talked to said it was hard getting a job in medical coding without experience. I guess if I got a HIM degree an internship would help with experience for  that.

But I digress. I applied for an editor position in another country (of which I have past work experience in) on a website that has job ads specifically for said country. I have a strong background in writing, have published my own articles, etc... thought heck, why not give it a try? I didn't expect to get it anyways.

Well, some days go by at which point I just figured they moved past my application. But then I get a direct email from their HR saying that after consideration of my application they wouldn't hire me.

That's fine. What surprised me was that their HR went out of their way to email me directly... they didn't just message me the rejection via the site's messaging system which most companies do.

So I thought why not? This time I'll actually reply to a rejection saying 'thank you for your time and have a nice day.' I figure people complain all the time about not getting notified of application status I'd send a response back for once.

So I did. But then immediately after I'm like wait, was that not a good thing to do? Does it come off as being passive-aggressive? I don't know.

I took this role because it was a step up career wise, has a pension, and 13 pto days. However, I have to stay 10 years to be vested and the rents in the area are at 1450.

I'm debating If I should stay at this job or apply for a remote role and move back in with family? I thought I would meet a lot of people moving to a college town and develop myself more moving away from family, but it hasn't been as easy meeting peope as I thought it would be.

When I was studying for certs my manager said that they were theoretical because unless you use that software in your day to day work environment then it's theoretical. And that hes been in the same role for 20 years and doesnt have any certs. I'm the only person there that has worked in the private sector or has any certs. And it seems like I have no chance at getting a promotion because the management is filled with these clickish boomers that have been there 15 to 25 years.

My dad keeps saying to stay at the uni job for the pension which contributes 20%, the days off, and he says the private sector may not even offer better pay. The pension is also guaranteed whereas the 401k depends how the stock market does. For instance, if I have to move for a role that pays 70k in a big city like Chicago, is that really a pay raise when I would have to pay more for the increased cost of living?

Some people were also saying that remote jobs might go away or turn into hybrid jobs, do you think this is true? Do you think I should stay or look for remote jobs though?

Would I miss out on personal growth by moving in with family?

Or would it be a better idea to move back in and give up the benefits to save more money?"

5,2022-12-30,Should I tell the Hiring Manager I received another offer?,u/hankprairie,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zzl7l6/should_i_tell_the_hiring_manager_i_received/,jobs,"I'm nearing the final stages of interviewing with Company A (my preferred company). So far I've completed:

* Phone screen with internal recruiter
* Video interview with Hiring Manager (Sr Manager)
* Video Interview with Hiring Manager's Supervisor (Director)

During my interview with the Hiring Manager, they mentioned the process would entail speaking with themselves, the director, and a c-level. They didn't have an exact date they planned to hire by, but were looking towards the end of January.

When I met with the director they mentioned that the Hiring Manager had asked them to speak to me, almost as if I was prioritized. The meeting went great and seemed much more like a meet and greet, with few questions about my actual technical ability. At the end, just to keep an idea on the timeline, I asked about next steps of possibly speaking with the c-level and if she had an idea on when they were looking to hire. I had also sprinkled in little hints that I've been interviewing with other companies.

They mentioned that since it was around the holidays, the recruiter had the next week off, but to watch for an email to set up next steps. I was surprised to see an email directly from the director 2 hours later with time slots for the c-level meeting which will take place Tuesday. This is the last phase of the hiring process.

To me it seems like they like me for the position. I think the c-level interview is mostly just a further culture fit, but either way I feel pretty confident about my chances. Much more than I usually do.

I've had a few interviews with other companies and just so happened to receive a verbal offer from Company B, likely to receive the written offer Monday.

In my mind, it seems Company A is already seemingly moving at a faster pace to get my interviews in quickly. That makes me feel they're interested. 

If I do receive a written offer from Company B on Monday (very likely), should I let the recruiter/hiring manager know before my next interview on Tuesday? I don't want it to seem like I'm rushing them or being pushy, but if it could help speed the process and/or help with negotiations, I feel like it could be a good move.

They hired new supervisor because the last one retired. 


During the time, I worked nightshift to clean up city camp programs (during spring/summer/winter breaks, the city has a permit to use the school as a camp program for kids). Deep cleaning are only for day shift. When the program was finished, I wanted to cash in my vacation time. 

I informed the the custodial manager that I wanted to take vacation. New supervisor denied it because there was work that needed to be done and the crew was behind. 

Was tasked to deep clean a library. 

Okay.

 I only finished around 1/5 of it. Told the new supervisor that I was going to take the next day off for personal reasons and that I was going to finish the library by the end of the week. 

Dude had me on speaker. 

""No, no, no! That's too long!"" someone said in the background. New supervisor said he'd call me back after he check my work. 

Calls me back and told me he expected me to be finished within 8 hrs. I told him it was literally impossible to deep clean the entire library's carpet in 8 hrs. ""I worked with a team pre pandemic and we definitely didn't knock it out in 8 hrs. You're expecting me to do it solo in 8 hrs?""

""I checked your work and, heh, you hardly did anything. What did you do in 8 hrs?"" he said.

Told him I had to go on a scavenger hunt for all the necessary tools because they're scattered across the campus. Then I had to move all of the furniture (15 tables, 90 chairs, a TV, book stands, etc) to one side of the library. 

""That took you 8 hrs to do? I'm very disappointed in you."" 

Reason I told him I'd be done by the end of the week because I was expecting that all that needed to be done. 

Eventually got the job done and I was right. There was no reason to rush the job. For whatever reason, he just wanted the job to be done in 8 hrs."

From what I heard being in delivery is the same as being a sandwich maker but you also have to deliver.

I would assume this job isn't too physically demanding but the reason I ask is because I've been dealing with really bad anxiety for a while to the point where im starting to get physical symptoms. My most concerning one is when my chest tightens up and I get short of breath really easy.

I went to the drs and got checked and its all fine, it really just seems to be like stress caused muscle tension.

But if I have to constantly be fighting shortness of breath while like physically straining myself im just gonna panic constantly.

Should I be fine? Or is this job too fast and stressful?

Would pizza hut be any different? I was going between pizza hut and jimmy johns and I'm leaning more towards JJ."

My first full time bartending job, the GM seemed super excited to bring me on. 3 weeks later he calls me in early and fired me. He just said there were too many complaints about me, he then said I was “a liar, a con-artist, and you have no business being behind a bar” That destroyed my confidence

For about a month after I began vigorously looking for a new job while driving Uber full time to stay afloat financially. I land another job but it’s graveyard shift. I found myself driving a total of 66 miles each day to often make $0 and not having a single guest the entire shift, while paying close to $6 a gallon for gas. Uber still kept me afloat. 

I land a job at a local restaurant. Management and my coworkers were awesome. Problem was I was only getting scheduled 2 days a week and often made $60-$75 a shift. Uber saved me again. And my event bartending gig had a lot going on also

2 months ago, I get a job as a bartender downtown, on call. Well right when I started, the full time bartender who’s in the service well takes an FMLA leave. I’m now in the service well 5 days a week and averaging $100 a shift. Better than my last two jobs but still not quite what I’m looking for. And while I still have my event bartending job, I’ve had to give up a lot of shifts because I can’t say no to the casino or they’ll fire me. 

I want to try to look again for a more stable, consistent, decent tipped bartending job but I’m tired of job hopping, burnt out on filling out app after app and getting turned away. Since I was fired from that one job this past summer, I now have a paranoid fear every day going to work I’m going to get fired even when logically speaking I have no reason to. I don’t come in late, I don’t call out, I do what I’m supposed to do

I just don’t know what to do anymore. Maybe this industry just isn’t for me"

The only problem was I couldn’t get hired till this week due to the process. Every month I’d reach out for a update and was usually told I’d be in the running for it. Turns out that the employers never gave me a opportunity to change any information I had. I was applied for the position by them and they had my information from my current employer because our companies were owned by the same company. I was never able to update my number so instead of getting a call from them I never did. I lost the opportunity and didn’t find out till asking someone involved with the process when I’d be contacted. Is there anything I can do in this situation?
5,2022-12-31,Accepting a job you have 0 interest in?,u/thotherside_10,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zzoelx/accepting_a_job_you_have_0_interest_in/,jobs,"After working as a contractor at company for 6 years and being approached by management twice  in a 5 months period, I made the idiotic decision to take a permanent job that I: 1)have zero interest in 2) do not do well. 

The thing is, I’ve been COASTING by in the shadows as much as possible for these past 6 years and when I have to perform, I muster up every ounce of energy and brain power I can and perform. It exhausts me and leaves me burnt out each time. Management seems to think I am excelling, but I’m not and I haven’t told them otherwise. 

I had an update meeting with management (my boss and the department director) asking how things were going and encouraging me to apply for the job. I gave the same excuse I had given before when I was asked to apply. But this time it felt different because instead of my boss asking me, it was the department director.  Two weeks later, I applied for the job on a whim. 

I interviewed and 2 months later, I got an offer which I hesitated SO MUCH to accept. The offer was great, I just didn’t want the job because of the workload, new boss, coming into the office 3x a week, basically having to constantly “perform” and do all the things I do poorly. 

Well I accepted at the eleventh hour and here I am. I have fallen into an even deeper depression because the fact that I made this terrible decision has sunken in. Now that I’m a permanent employee, my performance will actually be evaluated by my peers and boss (this wasn’t required as a contractor) and the truth that I’m sub-par at my job will be revealed to management.  

Like I said, I was coasting by all these years, so I don’t have the knowledge and skills to be marketable to other companies. 

I’m 30. Diagnosed Clinical depression at 26, severe brain fog, introversion, poor intrapersonal skills, lack of energy and motivation cause me to perform poorly about 95% of the time. I take much longer than my coworkers to understand, execute and resolve tasks. Overall, below-average performer.  

I’m a private person, but I really regret not telling  management the reason I was reluctant to apply is because of poor mental health. I’ve already made the choice to accept the job and fear I will look bad and make them look bad either way - by asking for my old contractor job back or by staying in my new role and performing poorly. Should I tell management that I’m having mental health issues anyway?

Where do I even go from here? Like I said, I’m 30, living with my mom, about $13k in savings, $2k in retirement, $2,500 in CC debt. My new salary is six figures. Moving out on my own and helping my unemployed, 62yo mom financially was a big reason I accepted the job, especially with all the layoffs in the US, as well as inflation and recession. But now I’m realizing I probably could have managed on $43/hr and poor benefits like I have been doing, for the sake of my mental health. Maybe even gotten a part time WFH job with better health insurance and PTO."

So, 20 minutes roll by and I decide to call the store. A worker, possibly the manager, asked me what time the interview was supposed to be... Like, aren't *you* supposed to know? Anyways, I let him know, and he goes, ""Oh, we might have to have you come in... give me one moment."" 

I was put on hold for 35 minutes. I was honestly willing to wait another 30 minutes, but I immediately got an email for another job offer at a different company. I hung up the phone. 

I just think that was super unprofessional of them. Do you think I dodged a bullet? Because if that's how they treat potential employees... Man. I never experienced that before."

Need help deciding by tomorrow!",u/Throwmeawaythanks99,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zzp7nr/partner_thinks_im_too_good_for_the_entry_level/,jobs,"I've only had one minimum seasonal job working at a bakery. I graduated this year with a useless degree in interdisciplinary humanities/fine arts, albeit from a top school. I'm decent at traditional art, and I've spent the last few months trying to transition to digital design but I'm still not great in that area (the skills surprisingly do not overlap). Inaccessibility to mental health resources since graduating has also taken a huge toll.

I recently applied to a minimum wage internship teaching art. I need help deciding by tomorrow if my doubts for turning down this opportunity are valid.

Pros:

* It has 6 months paid training, they teach you how to teach art and this is a marketable skill
* Very part time (3.5 hours around 4 times a week), which will allow me to flesh out other skills and do other internships on the side
* I am passionate about fine arts and kids are fun to work with
* I have no skills or useful work experience and this is one of the few jobs that doesn't have any hard skill or prior experience requirements
* Sounds fun
* Involves fine art

Cons:

* I am very introverted and not great with public speaking to adults, but I'm unsure if this is a matter of ""do a customer service job to get rid of your social anxiety"" sort of thing or if I will come off as unapproachable and cold and be miserable at the job. I think I'm friendly but suuuper chill; I don't exactly have that giggly disneyland enthusiasm that gets kids excited. I know a lot of teachers put on a ""work persona"" though
* Since my classes were during covid, I've never worked with kids in person and don't know what that is like.
* They require you to stay with them for a year, and I'm not sure if being part time and in person will effect me getting a full time position elsewhere + I won't be able to visit my long distance partner as opposed to the remote internships I'm looking at
* Minimum wage (expected)
* My partner is a software engineer and thinks something in tech/design would be good for me. He says that I could ""do better"" and that this job is for high schoolers. But I feel like I'm starting from scratch careerwise and the alternative is to get a unpaid internship or volunteer position (I'm planning on doing at least two internships).

TL;DR: Am an introvert unsure if I can do an extrovert job, partner thinks I shouldn't ""give up"" by taking a min wage part time job I'm a bad personality fit for. Are these valid doubts to turn down the opportunity? The woman who runs the place wants us to be all in"

A few months have past now and we are doing well on saving for her first year but recently she has been feeling conflicted because she also has a passion for history (namely British history) and has also been thinking about becoming a curator. I want her to be happy and I know she can do either but I don't want her to have any regrets. I was wondering if anyone knows of any jobs that combine the two? And if there are sertain degrees/deplomas for it? Since she will be starting to look for courses soon I thought it would better to find an end goal first.

Sometimes the role includes a link to the hiring manager, and I find I’m much more likely to have a preliminary interview if I ping this person directly to highlight my application. In fact, I often find these people to sometimes be unaware of any application and thankful to have been contacted! (There is a dearth of qualified talent in my field.)

I’m just wondering if there are any tricks to identify the hiring manager for the LinkedIn recruitment posts that do not list a contact person? I found a few perfect roles and I’ve tried calling the company but understandably the receptionist on the phone is pretty quick to refer me back to the online application portal, and they definitely don’t want to share anyone’s email, including HR’s.

If anyone has a trick for getting around application portals and making that first point of contact, I’d really appreciate hearing it!"

I was always living in the moment and school was mostly a place to fuck around for me. School was like a place to go and meet friends and mess about. The same goes for university. 

I know what I did, and I am fully to blame for it, so please don't come at me for messing up like this. I know i fucked up. 

Anyways, I'm from the UK and I did my A-levels, got decent grades actually and went off to university without knowing what I want to do and without caring. 

I graduated this year with a 2:1 in politics, and after summer when September came, it finally hit me. I fucked up. I never got any work experience except a few customer service and delivery jobs during summer, and that's it. I realised that my degree is useless. It hasn't given me any specific skills or vocational skills, and I haven't gone out my way to get internships. 

I dont know what career i want, at all. I dont know what job I want. I don't know what the next step is. All jobs require experience and for you to be job ready. I'm honestly kinda scared now. Currently, I'm living with my parents, not know what the hell to do. Everyone else got their lives figured out. 

If i could go back in time, I would learn a specific skill that's in demand, and do an apprenticheship where im actually getting trained for a job. I feel like doing a broad degree like this has left me more confused than ever. I'm not just blaming the degree itself. I agree, a degree is what you make out of it, but I made this huge mistake of just not caring and doing whatever is next expected, without a plan for the future whatsoever. 

The only skill I'd say i have is i am pretty advanced in excel. I can do VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, IF formulas, pivot tables, power pivot, Macros, conditional formatting etc. I learnt these a while back when i took a course on excel training. But i've never actually used these for a job, i just know how to do them. so i dont even have evidence i can do these. 

i dont know how fucked i am but im not feeling confident. So in summary, i have a 2.1 in a useless degree, no internships or professional work experience except a couple customer service/delivery jobs i did during the summer for some quick cash, no extra curricular or volunteering, no specific skillset except Excel, i never networked or even went to a single careers fair. 

again, please dont come at me. I take full blame for what i did. I just dont know what to do next. I need a job now and need to start earning. But i dont know how to build a career. Do i just get a basic office assistant job or something? but then what? i wish i had a skill i specialised in that i could do forever. 

im kinda scared. because of the uncertainty, because of the lack of skillset. i dont know what i have to offer to employers.

any advice is appreciated. thank you."

I have started working there since August and during the time I had a few call outs. First, my grandpa passed away. Second, I tested positive for Covid, third was the only time I called out out of not wanting to work and fourth was after I requested a day off after my cousin had been murdered so not technically a call out. I’m afraid if I call out again I’d be fired or suspended even thought I had legitimate proof with evidence for all my call outs outside of that one, I’m still nervous to call out. I go in, in a few hours and I work from 2pm to 2am but since it’s NYE my shift won’t end until 4-5am on average and then my next shift is tomorrow at 12pm to 12am these hours are killing men and not being able to enjoy the holiday is sort of sickening for me. I’m tired of being overworked. I work as a dishwasher and I barley get any breaks and my co-workers take there time to help so it’s like I’m working alone. I really need the job so that’s why I don’t want to call out but I really don’t want to kill myself by overworking myself. Had I worked a more important job like at a hospital I’d understand the sacrifice but I shouldn’t be hurting my back and weakening myself just to wash some dishes for over 14 hours on a holiday with only a 30 minute break if I’m lucky. It’s unfair. Another employee already called out as well so the reason I’m working these hours is to fill in for his time which is unfair to me to double my hours."

ETA: Thanks for the ideas. To clarify I have not set up direct deposit yet so they do not have my details. The HR person sent me the form to fill out to set it up and that’s where I saw everyone’s details. I have voided checks from everyone. I emailed her back to let her know I saw these details I didn’t feel comfortable setting up DD if the info would be shared in that way.

If I don’t set up direct deposit I think they’re going to withhold my last check as they’re switching to DD and need 100% compliance. 🤦‍♀️💁‍♀️ I really don’t need to sue them. I’ve got plenty of legal issues and a divorce. Their HR person is actually a lawyer too. Life is so funny sometimes. 😅🫠

ETA 2: I emailed her that she’d sent me everyone’s account and routing numbers and she didn’t believe me. I told her again what she’d sent and she said to just delete the email and attached the correct blank form for setting up DD. 🙃

he comes in late every single day already punched in (having already punched in from his phone, we all used to be allowed to do this until he started complaining to the owner, now only he is allowed to do this) and sits in the office and plays pokemon go. he is supposed to help everyone pack up and get out the door quicker, which he never does, any will only begin to start helping when pretty much everyone is already done besides the last person.

he also steals time wantonly. as i was just saying, he punches in before he gets there, he also punches out after he leaves. i saw him punch out the other day at work and he had 100 hours on his time clock, which is actually literally impossible because everyone has observed what little work he does, and hes usually gone by the time i get back from my route, which usually takes around 6 hours.

now this guy has the gall to complain about me to the owner. what exactly he says i dont know, but for seemingly no reason the owner seems to despise me, and i know it comes from my manager, because the other assistant and I are friends.

yesterday, i told the other assistant that i wouldnt be coming in to work because there was this big family reunion my parents really wanted me to go to, and he offered to cover my route. it shoudlve been settled there, but the manager tells the owner and now the owner wants to have a meeting with me for ""not communicating"".

i hate speaking with the manager because he thinks everyone likes him and meanwhile everyone hates him. every time hes late to work, everyone is always talking to me and the other assistant about how nice it is to not have him there and how much better it is to be working with us as the managers, because we actually help people and arent total jerks.

what do i do? i have a meeting with the owner on monday, when i shouldnt

TL;DR, very bad manager talks badly to owner about me (an assistant manager) for no reason, when he is the one doing everything badly."

Just wondering if anyone experienced this and if I'm in the wrong

I started a new job about 3/4 months ago and on Saturday I'm expected to work 8-5 and sundays 10-4. I'm the opening and closing cashier for these days and therefore the only one that can cash people out and I'm supposed to unlock the doors in the morning to let customers in.

Now the problem comes when the store opens at 8, the same time I'm scheduled to start. Now to open the tills and do a quick facing of the store, turn on the lights and open the door (as instructed by the boss) it takes at least 15 min. This same process happens again in reverse at the end of the day, again taking 15min making me have an extra 30 min of work a day.

Recently the boss got mad and yelled at me when I was clocking in at 7:55 for not clocking in early enough to complete the opening tasks he was saying that I need to clock in at 7:45 so I have enough time and that I'm 3 months in and should know better 

I was never explicitly told I need to clock in at that time and as per scheduling I don't start till 8 


This same this happens on Sundays when I'm supposed to work 10-4, making a 6 hour shift into a 6.5 hour shift 


I know it's not much of a difference but in my mind if they want me to come in at a certain time they need to schedule me for that time. 

So tell me am I in the wrong here for clocking in at 8?"
1,2022-12-31,Job interviewer didn’t ask many questions,u/Nearby-Vermicelli907,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1003p12/job_interviewer_didnt_ask_many_questions/,jobs,"I applied for a water resources engineering position in Europe (I’m from the U.S.) with my company (so I’m an internal candidate). To my surprise, they quickly scheduled a short call with  an HR manager, who briefed me on the salary standards, visa process and next steps. 

He said he needed to confirm the visa requirements. Then there would be 2 interviews, an HR screening interview and if that went well, a second interview with the engineering manager. He also added that the engineering manager reviewed my resume and liked my experience. After this short call, HR confirmed I met the visa requirements, and I attended the first and second interviews last week. The first interview was standard for a HR screening.

However, the second interview with the engineering manager was not what I expected. He didn’t ask me many questions, which would normally be a red flag, but he started with, “I‘ve seen your resume. I understand your experience so I’m not going to ask you anything about that. I think you are a great fit for the team.” Then he described the team and the role. He pitched the position as a “mid-to senior-level” engineering design role. From the job listing, I perceived the position to be more of an entry- to mid-level engineering design role.

I have 6 years of engineering experience in risk assessment, which is similar to engineering design in many ways. They’re both water resources engineering, but it’s not exactly apples to apples. With my experience, I feel overqualified for “graduate” or “entry level” design jobs and under-qualified for “mid” or “senior” level design jobs.

The engineering manager appeared confident I was a good fit for the job just from my resume alone, but because he did not ask me much about my experience, I didn’t have many chances to expand on my skillset. During the second interview, I affirmed that I liked the role responsibilities and though my experience was not in design (though it is similar), that I wanted design work, and that I was committed to growing my experience / learning. 

After I said this, he reiterated I had the basic skills suitable for the position, and that they are looking for a design focused role, not a risk assessment role, which I agreed was consistent with my objective and the reason I applied. But then he asked me if my last job was the same as the design position I applied for, to which I said it was not a design role but I had similar responsibilities and skills to a design role. He seemed satisfied with this and appeared confident I was great for the role.

He said next steps would for him to speak with his boss and then talk with the team leader who is in charge of the small team I would be working with. The team leader has risk assessment and design experience, and he’ll instantly know from my resume that my experience isn’t an exact match to design experience.

Even when I was 2 years out of school, I had trouble pursuing water resources engineering design work opportunities at my first job, because I didn’t have design experience (so they assigned new engineers with 0 experience to those projects instead). I’m concerned the team leader may have this same point of view. I’m not looking to dramatically shift my career, but some organizations can be rigid at offering new opportunities.

And I’m worried the engineering manager left the interview with the same assumptions about my experience that he walked in with. My resume was consistent with my experience. My objective statement said I do risk assessment modeling and am looking to transition to a design role.

There are cultural and language differences with international recruiting, and misunderstandings are bound to happen. I think the engineering manager was not discounting what I said. He listened. I think he was so convinced I was a good fit for the role that it didn’t matter what I said.

The other thing that perplexed me is that the role and small team is not even established. The engineering manager is coordinating with the team leader on building the small team. He mentioned the company is pushing them to hire more people, because they are anticipating more work. When I asked if the outcome of my application was contingent on successful completion of this small team, the engineering manager said there was other work, but he didn’t offer more information. He was convinced I fit the needs of the forming role he already described and really hopes he can add me to the team.

The question that REALLY threw me was, “Would you like to work on your current (U.S. office projects) from Europe?” I’m interviewing looking to transition away from my current work to design work so it felt like a strange thing to ask. Plus, why would they consider going through the visa process just for me to do my current job from their office?

It’s been 1 week since the second interview, and I have not heard anything yet. It’s the holidays, and people are out. The HR manager said “early January” but the engineering manager said it may be “mid-January” before I receive an update. It seems that the engineering manager is an important decision maker but not the sole decision maker. I know I’m overthinking the interview, but I could not get a read. With the question about working from Europe for my U.S. office combined with not having positions / work finalized and ready to go, do they have enough to keep my busy. At times, I felt he wanted to build this role around me, and at other points, I felt like he was hoping to add standby to the team in anticipation of new work. He talked a lot more than I did, mainly because he was explaining the role, team, his experience, etc.

Overall, I enjoyed the conversation. My experience with everyone I’ve interacted with has been warm and positive. I know I can do the job, and I hope they give me a chance.

Has anyone ever had an interview like this - where you aren’t asked many questions because the interviewer seems to have their mind made up already?"
1,2022-12-31,What should I do and what are my options? (27M),u/Remarkable-Swan-4522,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1003ppe/what_should_i_do_and_what_are_my_options_27m/,jobs," Hello, this is the first time I am going to actively seek guidance on what to do because I am very lost. I live in the state of Hawaii to give some background.

**My work experience includes:**

Retail Sales: 2 years

Wireless Sales (Sprint/AT&amp;T/etc): 1.5 years

Resort &amp; Hotels:

Room Attendant/Housekeeping: 2-3 years

Frontdesk/Bell attendant: 1-2 years

Private Security Company:

Security Guard: 2-3 years.

Landscaping: 7 months

On my resume, I have about 10 jobs listed where I work on average a little less than 1 year. Some jobs like my retail/sales, the first jobs I've ever worked, were around 2 years. I've worked in all types of resorts and hotels from small to luxury. I've done some other miscellaneous jobs such as basic accounting, front desk management at a small hotel, and some other jobs that I didn't mention, nor did I bother to put on my resume. The reason is that I feel like it would just fill up my already filled-up job history in the past 8-9 years. In more recent years I've started to work in security. This is because when I was very ambitious in the hospitality industry, I was always barred from management positions or higher due to lacking a college degree. So while I work as a security guard and landscaper now, I am a full-time student. I just got my Associate's in Arts degree. I also switched jobs because none of these jobs were things I felt were utilizing my full potential, nor did they reward my work because of lack of mobility due to my lack of college education at that time.

**Some other things to mention:**

Associates in Arts (Fall 2022)

Eagle Scout 2013

AT&amp;T top sales 2014

90 WPM

Basic understanding of computer/network troubleshooting and computer building.

I don't really know who would want me. I'm turning 28 in 3 months and I'm tired of working entry-level jobs that aren't really helping me grow. I felt more ambitious and ready years 4 years ago before I was told that a college education would be necessary to move up. But now that I have 3 semesters left of college before I receive my bachelors in Economics, I really want to get an idea of what's available for me. I admit that my self-esteem despite my great work ethic is terrible due to previous rejections when I was ambitious and denied previously. I feel like no one really wants me for a leadership role even if that's what I had wanted when I worked in the hospitality industry and performed very well.

Does anyone have some advice on who I should talk to or where I could get help on what to do? I have a good work ethic, I just need guidance on how to take it to the next level. I've considered other industries such as manual labor and IT, but I already have experience in these industries that I've listed. So before I consider starting all over after finally receiving my associate's, I would like to know if I'm looking at things the wrong way, and that maybe employers do see the potential to build me into leadership roles.

**Other things I do on the side include:**

Toastmasters (leadership/communication/presentation/ skill development)

Working towards my bachelor's in Economics

Building Computers

Stock portfolio management (friends/family)

**Things I'm willing to do:**

Take classes, courses, certifications, etc.

I took (1) a year off to care for my father who was struggling with drug abuse and my mother who was also struggling in 2021 but started working in May 2022. I work full-time as a security guard,  16 weeks as a landscaper, and am a full-time student at college. But this isn't ideal or sustainable. I would rather work on my career while taking 1-3 classes per semester because I need the money more than finishing this degree, especially if I can build a career without it or put less priority on it. I also don’t mind not making the entire use of my time in college and would be perfectly fine with a bachelor's in economics tomorrow. This is because I do study economics on the side very actively, but I don't want to become an economist as I feel like this knowledge could be useful in other jobs as well. I also felt more inclined to get a college degree for my employers in order to move up into management, rather than using college as a medium to study. 

Any advice is welcomed and I don't know what to do. I want find a job that pays higher, has good upward mobility, and helps me develop useful skills. I don't mind learning a new skill, but I want to know if what I currently have is worth anything to the job market. Thank you very much."

So the past year, I've been working two jobs, I have one job in the warehouse (pays $13.25/hr) and I have another job as an on-campus tutor (pays $13.50/hr). I want to leave the warehouse job because it's not easy to work there as it's very labor intensive and I prefer tutoring more (despite I can only work there at 19.5 hours max). 

Also before my old boss got fired, he told me there's a possibility of everyone in the warehouse getting a raise this December and now with the new boss in place I don't see a raise happening. 

The problem is I don't know how I can leave the warehouse job without sounding like a jerk. How should I email my boss without sounding like an arrogant jerk. I doubt he knows I worked a second job and I want to leave on good terms in case I need to re-apply in the summer for the warehouse job again. I feel like since my old boss got fired the warehouse (which is a non-profit donation center) is on a sinking ship because we're now more short-staffed than ever before and my new boss was talking about donor fatigue or something like that. 

Not sure if this helps for context: I am a college senior and who wants to go to grad school soon (either in law school or a master's)."

Is this an interview or a pyramid scheme presentation?

Both email were for similar roles as a remote booking agent

Edit: they called it an informational meeting"

2,2022-12-31,"The job description says I'm qualified, but HR says I'm not",u/thejensenfeel,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1005g9y/the_job_description_says_im_qualified_but_hr_says/,jobs,"I applied for a job at the IRS (""Revenue Officer"", to be specific). The job announcement said to be eligible I needed 3 years of experience in the field **OR** a bachelor's degree in **any** field. I don't have the experience, but I do have a bachelor's, so I applied, and they said I wasn't qualified. I told them that's not what their announcement said, and they emailed me back and said I ""lacked the required specialized experience and, therefore, [was] not eligible for the position and would not be referred."" Am I reading something wrong, or is their HR department just being obtuse?

Here's the exact text from the announcement:

&gt;SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE: GS-05 LEVEL:

&gt;You must have three (3) years of general experience, one (1) year of which was at a level of difficulty and responsibility equivalent to the GS-04 grade level in the Federal service. General experience for this position includes having a general knowledge and understanding of business and financial practices, and that demonstrated the ability to deal effectively with others. Examples of this experience may have been gained in work such as financial, accounting, purchasing, merchandising, investigative, civil or criminal law enforcement, data processing, or similar activities in commercial or government enterprises. It also may have been gained in work that provided knowledge of credit operations and practices related to the collection of delinquent accounts;

&gt;OR

&gt; Four (4) year course of study leading to a Bachelor's or higher degree in any field of study from an accredited college or university;

&gt;OR

&gt;Certificate as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) obtained through written examination or membership in the bar in State, territory or the District of Columbia;

&gt;OR

&gt;You may qualify by a combination of experience and education.

I'm pretty sure working as a cashier/assistant manager at a gas station for four years doesn't count as the kind of specialized experience that they're looking for, but I have a bachelor's degree in linguistics (which is definitely *a* field, the last time I checked), and I'm quite certain the University of Texas at Austin is accredited. So, any idea what the problem is?"

Right now if anyone has any advice or ideas on where I can start looking?
I’ve been looking and so far it’s kinda empty or a potential scam.
I just want to find a way to work at home.
As I have a lot going on at once and it just be better for me to do so.
It’s discouraging that everywhere I look around me either there’s no positions, not available for me, or they simply stop hiring?
I’m not letting it put me down, and I won’t give up tell I find something. Near me if I can or online at home. Thank you for your time and reading!"

So it's been 6 month in the job and I believe that my salary is not commensurate with my skillset. It assumes that I have similar skill set as anyone else within the salary band range in the company which is not true. There are certain specialized skills such as advanced excel formulas, powerquery, VBA that I use for financial modelling. Also my job requires a lot of lateral thinking. My role is a new position which did not exist in the company six month ago. So it seems that HR might have underestimated the skills it would take to do my job correctly.

Do you have any experience with requesting HR to reevaluate your salary and were they amenable? If you have any advice, please let me know."
